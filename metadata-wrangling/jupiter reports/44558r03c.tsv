How can knowledge-intensive sectors develop in ways which account for local contexts and local needs? How can benefits and prosperity be made to stick to the communities in which new technologies are innovated? We are developing a partnership to explore these questions and to foster networks which integrate scientific innovation, community development, and urban planning in the development of localinnovation clusters. Using the local case of nanotechnology in Edmonton, the University of Albertas City-Region Studies Centre is developing partnerships with the National Institute of Nanotechnology (NINT), the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT), NanoAlberta - Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (AITF), TEC Edmonton, the municipalities making up the Alberta Capital Region and an emerging nanotechnology business sector. Our aim in developing this partnership is to inform and research innovation networks which recognize and engage people and place as key constituents of successful science policy and development strategies.	2016-11-23T17:10:56.774Z	Nanotechnology and the Alberta capital region: A case study of integrating communities, innovation and development	N/A	Shields, Rob	N/A	N/A	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2011/11/29	2013-08-14T08:02:42Z	2013-08-14T08:02:42Z	N/A	English	2012 | Urban | SSHRC Grant | Political Science | Geography | Cities | Innovation | Nanotechnology | networks | new technologies | Partnership Development Grant | PDG | Policy Studies | Science governance | Technological development | Urban planning	2011	2011	6395w824r	6395w824r	2015-10-10T08:50:13.823Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/05/74/1s/76/05741s76w/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-11-14T22:34:15.963Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. Rob Shields PDG.pdf	2013-08-14T14:02:43.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/vt/15/0k/44/vt150k44w	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Early L2 child speakers appear to produce more varied types of phonological errors compared with monolingual children, some but not all of which are predictable from their own mother tongues. The project will collect longitudinal data over an eighteen month period, from immigrant children aged four to seven and their parents, living in Edmonton and Vancouver. The ultimate result will be the first robust data set of ESL child phonology in Canada, accessible to researchers in academic, educational and clinical capacities. Understanding the roles of mother tongues and perceptual plasticity in young childrens second language acquisition is crucial to childrens development and well-being in an increasingly multi-cultural and multi-lingual Canada. By providing linguistically-informed measures of how first language phonology affects young immigrants spoken English, these results will provide data to inform pedagogical norms in early education, as well as ultimately identifying clinical markers for diagnosing speech delays and disorders among young L2 speakers.	2017-10-02T14:18:39.992Z	English Spoken by Immigrant Children: Learning a Second Language Phonology in Early Childhood	N/A	Tessier, Anne-Michelle	N/A	GAPSSHRC | Coetzee, Andries | Farris-Trimble, Ashley | Zuraw, Kie	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2014/10/15	2015-06-16T11:03:00Z	2015-06-16T11:03:00Z	N/A	English	2015 | Children | Linguistics | Successful SSHRC | Education | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | Grant application | Immigrants | IG | ESL | Computational Modeling | Language Acquisition	2014	2014	1g05fc783	1g05fc783	2015-10-09T22:52:59.959Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/cc/08/hg/61/cc08hg61f/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-11-14T22:34:15.963Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Tessier_SSHRCInsight_Oct22014.pdf	2015-06-16T17:03:00.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/st/74/cr/46/st74cr46s	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Building on this tradition, the 2014 Institute will, for the first time in ICS history, focus its innovative research capacities on a central theme: \Energy, Environment, Culture.\ The conference addresses two priority areas identified by SSHRC: Canadian Environmental Issues and Innovation, and Leadership and Prosperity. While promoting an understanding of energy in Canada and the United States, ICS 2014 will increase knowledge of environmental and sustainability issues with specific importance to Canada, from Northern sovereignty to energy security. To build networks between emerging scholars and experts in a number of fields, ICS will divide its focus into 3 streams: (1) Energy and Globalization; (2) Energy and Ecology; and (3) Energy and Community Practices. Each research stream will contribute to knowledge about the social, cultural, and environmental relations of energy systems in Canada and abroad.	2016-11-23T15:15:59.705Z	Energy, Environment, Culture - Institute on Culture and Society (June 13-17,  2014)	N/A	Szeman, Imre	N/A	Best, Beverley | Cetinic, Maria | Nilgis, Mathias	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2013/12/13	2014-04-16T11:27:08Z	2014-04-16T11:27:08Z	N/A	English	Ecology | CG | Connection Grant | Literature | Energy | SSHRC | Environmental Studies | Globalization | Culture | Art | Anthropology | Natural Resources | Conference Grant | Society | Community Practices	2013	2013	sq87bv61n	sq87bv61n	2015-10-07T08:01:40.521Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/nc/58/0n/73/nc580n73g/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-11-14T22:34:15.963Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	SzemanICSconference2014SSHRCconnection(Dec2013).pdf	2014-04-15T16:43:48.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/8g/84/mn/34/8g84mn34g	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

This research project will test two central hypotheses about verb learning in children: First, in experimental situations, children benefit from co-speech gesture as shown by enhanced verb learning. Second, in everyday interaction, children use the co-speech gesture they observe to discern the meaning of verbs. Evaluation of these claims will enable us to identify the effectiveness of co-speech gesture as a support for a particularly challenging area of language acquisition.We have designed both experimental and observational studies to address our central questions: First, can children use gestures to support verb learning? Second, do children use gestures to support verb learning? We anticipate that the results of these studies will reveal that co-speech gesture can be used experimentally to enhance verb learning, and further that children whose parents use co-speech gesture have a linguistic advantage.	2016-11-23T16:08:43.615Z	Gestures as a potential cue to childrens verb learning	N/A	Elena Nicoladis	N/A	Marentette, Paula	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2011/10/13	2013-07-25T12:43:00Z	2013-07-25T12:43:00Z	N/A	English	2012 | Linguistics | Insight Grant | Communications | Psychology | Gesture | IG | Learning | Successful SSHRC Grant | Language acquisition | Adolescent | Verbs | SSHRC Grants | Child	2011	2011	gh93h0569	gh93h0569	2015-10-10T00:14:04.740Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/r4/94/vm/20/r494vm201/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-11-14T22:34:15.963Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. Elena Nicoladis IG.pdf	2013-07-25T18:43:00.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/t1/48/fj/52/t148fj52q	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

The conference will address theoretical issues concerning what linguistic and contextual factors affect the manner in which discourse expectations arise, how they can be quantified, and how they can be modeled. Understanding how such discourse expectations arise and vary in different languages helps us better understand human cognition, intercultural communication (and how it may break down), and improve artificial intelligence through computational modeling. Conference findings will also improve research methods by exploring the benefits of combining experimental and traditional fieldwork methodologies. Furthermore, the outcomes of the conference will generate information on the discourse properties of indigenous languages, which will contribute to the documentation and preservation of endangered languages.	2016-11-23T15:16:17.419Z	Discourse Expectations: theoretical, experimental, and computational perspectives	N/A	Daskalaki, Evangelia	N/A	Jarvikivi, Juhani | Koch, Karsten | Puderbaugh, Rebekka | Ruiting, Jia	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2015/01/30	N/A	2016-03-15T16:27:42.729Z	N/A	English	2015 | CG | Computational Linguistics | Computers and Language | Conference grant | Connection Grant | Discourse | Discourse Analysis | Discourse Processing | Grant Application | Indigenous Languages | Linguistic Theory | Linguistics | Pragmatics | Psycholinguistics | Successful SSHRC	2015	2015	N/A	N/A	2016-03-15T16:27:44.743Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/44/55/8h/14/44558h14f/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-24T08:51:58.631Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Daskalaki-CG-2015.pdf	N/A	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/cc/08/hj/22/cc08hj225	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

We know surprisingly little about how a child gradually develops into a fluent reader and whether the process of becoming fluent is similar across languages with different orthographic characteristics. This work will contribute to the development of a more comprehensive model of reading fluency, documenting how different component skills (e.g., rapid naming, letter-sound fluency, orthographic knowledge) uniquely and jointly contribute to it. By testing our hypotheses across languages varying in orthographic consistency (English, Dutch, and Greek), we also address a major limitation of existing theories of reading development, namely that they possibly apply only to English.	2016-11-25T22:03:15.629Z	Reading fluency: How does it develop and how can it be fostered?

A group of Deline Elders wish to publish an academic book that describes their philosophy of Dene governance and have asked me to work with them to achieve this goal. An orienting oral tradition of Deline Gotine (the people of the place where the waters flow) is the Waterheart story, or Tudzi. It describes the journey of a man to the heart of Great Bear Lake. The journey centres around the teachings of the lakes heart, teachings recognized by the people the people as foundational laws of governance. Over several years, the Elders worked with various government departments to apply this philosophy of governance to the Great Bear Lake Watershed Management Plan (GBLWMP), part of the land management approach undertaken in the context of the Sahtu Comprehensive Land Claim. However, owing to its comprehensiveness, the GBLWMP has not been implemented by the legal authorities charged with its care, primarily due to the complexity of managing from an ecological approach rather than one predicated on narrowly defined areas of legal and regulatoryresponsibility.	2016-08-23T18:04:02.872Z	Towards social and economic prosperity: Political legitimacy in Northern Indigenous governance	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2012/02/01	2013-09-03T14:09:01Z	2013-09-03T14:09:01Z	N/A	English	Sustainability | Aboriginal | IDG | Insight Development Grant | Grant application | Community Development | Government | Indigenous peoples | Successful SSHRC Grant | North | Aboriginal policy | Aboriginal Research | Dene language | Indigenous governance | Northern development | Oral tradition | Public  Administration | Self  governance | Self government | Slavey language | Social Anthropology	2012	2012	0r9675090	0r9675090	2015-10-10T14:28:55.002Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/z3/16/q3/03/z316q3035/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-24T14:32:30.321Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. Stephanie Irlbacher-Fox IDG.pdf	2013-09-03T20:09:01.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/sj/13/93/38/sj139338h	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Analysis will be based on case studies from three biological domains: (1) In the context of systems biology, which mathematically models the operation of molecular and cellular systems, I will investigate how different models are used in a coordinated fashion. (2) In the case of the evolution of complexity, I will investigate some scientific disagreements about explanatory frameworks and standards. Models of the evolution of multicellular animals as well as multispecies microbial communities attempt to capture this complexity while still making various idealizations, and I will analyse the representational aims used to justify such simplifications. (3)  While philosophers have argued that social and environmental values matter in science, I will articulate a stronger role for social values, exploring the implications for scientific objectivity, particularly with respect to feminist values, and the domains of human evolution and the social behaviour of non-human primates.	2016-11-23T17:52:52.413Z	Standards, Aims and Values: Biological Explanation and Beyond	N/A	Ingo Brigandt	N/A	Carla Fehr | Christophe Malaterre | Heather Douglas | Marc Ereshefsky | Maureen OMalley	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2015/10/14	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	Grant Application | Successful SSHRC | 2016 | Gender | IG | Insight Grant | Post-Secondary Education | Biology education | Epistemic values | Feminist Philosophy | Human evolution | Metaphilosophy | Philosophy of Science | Philosophy of Technology | Science Education | Scientific epistemology | Scientific practice | Systems biology	N/A	2015	N/A	N/A	2016-07-07T22:44:20.687Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/3f/46/28/39/3f462839f/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-24T08:42:46.459Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	BrigandtIngo-IDG-2016.pdf	2016-07-07T22:44:19.284Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/9k/41/zh/21/9k41zh21q	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Park interpretation is a communication process that reveals meanings and relationships of cultural and natural heritage to the public.  While interpretation aims to encourage park-friendly behaviour, increase knowledge, and generate positive attitudes, interpretation efforts in Canada face a key challenge:  inconsistent approaches and outcomes. Additionally, as provinces implement results-based planning models, little is known about the long-term outcomes for participants in interpretive programs. Alberta is a representative case study since Alberta Parks faces many of the same management and planning issues for interpretive programs as other park systems across Canada.	2017-05-17T19:10:57.844Z	Matching goals and outcomes of park interpretation using the Theory of Planned Behaviour: A case study of Albertas Provincial Parks	N/A	Hvenegaard, Glen	N/A	GAPSSHRC	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2016/10/15	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	Insight Grant | Recreation | SSHRC | Leisure | Evaluation | IG | Environment | Successful Grant | Education, environmental | Parks, interpretation | Parks, policy | Parks, provincial | Tourism, sustainable	N/A	2016	N/A	N/A	2017-04-12T19:00:55.964Z	bypassAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bq/j7/2p/73/bqj72p733b/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-05-18T01:11:12.378Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Hvenegaard&Halpenny-IG-2016-17.pdf	2017-04-12T19:00:54.340Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/mg/74/qp/82/mg74qp823	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Rhetorical history is the term that describes the process of organizations discursively re-interpreting past organizational events. Through this lens, the past is viewed as a tool that shapes the way stakeholders understand and interpret organizational actions. Thus, when the past is rhetorically constructed in the present it becomes a valuable catalyst for organizational activities and practices, including organizational change and strategic renewal. To study why and how organizations draw upon their past to build rhetorical histories we propose to analyze the activities of corporate archivists/historians. Our cross-industry, cross-country investigation is designed to examine how senior, corporate managers and archivist/historians use rhetorical history.  In all, this body of research has the potential to present different communities (business, academic, public) with a different conception of how organizations use history as a strategic, persuasive tool.	2016-11-23T15:12:00.630Z	Defining rhetorical history: Exploring the world of corporate archivists/historians	N/A	William Foster	N/A	Suddaby, Roy | Voronov, Maxim | Wiebe, Elden	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2012/10/09	2013-07-25T15:41:54Z	2013-07-25T15:41:54Z	N/A	English	2013 | Insight Grant | IG | Successful SSHRC Grant | SSHRC Grants | Archivists | Corporate history | Corporations | Historians | Rhetorical history	2012	2012	9306t027w	9306t027w	2015-10-06T01:27:46.042Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/xk/81/jm/21/xk81jm219/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-20T17:31:09.352Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. William Foster IG.pdf	2013-07-25T21:41:54.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/gb/19/f6/65/gb19f665t	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

We do so in a case study of German popfeminist protest and performance art culture. The objective is to interrogate how the Do it Yourself (DIY) political body standard to German feminist art activism is transformed through digital technologies.  The results will impact the academy, community practice, and student training. It is the first academic study to clearly define twenty-first-century feminism beyond the waves by challenging writings on post-feminism that draw bleak conclusions about the viability of feminist politics. It reaches into digital activist communities that are transnational in nature through open access forms of knowledge dissemination. Finally, it will impact student training; a new generation of feminist humanities scholarswill emerge versed in theoretical vocabulary and the complexities of political practice today in and for a digital world.	2016-11-23T18:04:44.034Z	Technologies of popfeminist activisim	N/A	Carrie Smith-Prei	N/A	N/A	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2012/10/11	2013-07-30T07:23:26Z	2013-07-30T07:23:26Z	N/A	English	2013 | Gender | Feminist | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | Feminism | Activism | Successful SSHRC Grant | Protest | Body | Performance | Digital technologies | Digital | Chicks on Speed | DIY | FEMEN | Lay Bitch Ray | Mädchenmannschaft | Popfeminism | Pussy Riot | Slutwalk	2012	2012	m326m263n	m326m263n	2015-10-06T05:40:03.352Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/ft/84/8r/49/ft848r49v/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-20T18:14:57.848Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. Carrie Smith-Prei IG.pdf	2013-07-30T13:23:26.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/9z/90/30/74/9z903074g	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

It communicates to diverse audiences that sleep is not a mysterious non-experience (essential but a wasteful interruption of life) but rather a central part of existence that tells us a lot about how we imagine time, bodies and human action, especially in the contexts of gender and sexuality.Sleep is the new sex. By this I mean two things: first, recent research suggests that more people (especially more women) crave sleep than sex, and sleep has taken over from sex in the popular imagination as a topic for cultural anxiety and thwarted need. In an era of sexual saturation but widespread exhaustion, sleep is a prime target of desire. My interdisciplinary research aims to theorize sleep in contexts where the lived experience of sleeping and waking comes together with the historical and social constitution of sleep; that is, it conjoins phenomenological and genealogical analysis. My primary expected outcome is to produce a series of academic essays on sleep. These essays will be organized around the phenomenological motifs of time, embodiment, and activity. They will address contemporary representations of women and men sleeping; sleep disordered patients and sleep medicine; and advice to parents on childrens sleep.  My work will also include one primary research component to fill a gap in existing empirical literature: drawing on my experience working with interviews as co-investigator on a CIHR grant on queer womens encounters with primary health care providers, I will interview childrens sleep coaches in western Canada and their clients.	2017-05-17T18:03:06.560Z	Sleep is the new sex	N/A	Heyes, Cressida	N/A	GAPSSHRC	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2017/04/11	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	2017 | Gender | Parenting | Ethics | Medicine | Insight Grant | Health | SSHRC | Leisure | Philosophy | IG | Feminism | Phenomenology | Successful Grant | Sexuality | Womens Studies | Family | Genealogy | Sleep | Time | Embodiment | Childrens Sleep | Liminal States | Philosophy, Feminist | Philosophy, Political | Queer Womens Health | Sleep Coaches | Sleep Disorders | Unconsciousness	N/A	2017	N/A	N/A	2017-04-11T22:23:10.822Z	bypassAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/qr/46/r3/80/qr46r380t/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-05-18T00:03:06.814Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Heyes-IG-2016-17.pdf	2017-04-11T22:23:09.654Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/st/74/ct/03/st74ct03d	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Canada continues to bear the legacy of a past in which racism held sway. The importance of race in shaping the very spaces we inhabit is epitomized by the events of World War II,when longstanding antipathy toward Asian immigration interwove with the pressures of war to enable the uprooting and dispossession of Japanese Canadians. The liquidation of Japanese Canadian real estate left a particularly lasting scar on the city of Vancouver, which was home, until 1942, to the oldest and largest Japanese Canadian neighbourhood in the country. But the liquidation reshaped localities throughout British Columbia. Displaced Japanese Canadians dispersed throughout the country. The liquidation built racism into the map of Canada.	2016-09-07T15:40:56.647Z	Landscapes of Injustice [PG stage II]	N/A	Adams, Eric	N/A	Adams, Eric | Blomley, Nicholas | Freund, Alexander | Harris, Douglas | Kobayashi, Audrey | Lutz, John | Masuda, Jeffrey | Reilly, Nolan | Rose-Redwood, Reuben | Sager, Eric	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2013/10/29	2014-09-29T16:35:11Z	2014-09-29T16:35:11Z	N/A	English	2014 | Successful SSHRC | Immigration | Racism | History | SSHRC Grant | Sociology | Grant application | Partnership grant (stage 2) | PG | WWII | Partnership Grant | Land | War | Asian | Injustice | Japanese-Canadians | Law | Mapping Injustice | Museum | Vancouver	2013	2013	x920fz57x	x920fz57x	2015-10-10T17:20:33.462Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/xd/07/gv/39/xd07gv39h/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-22T11:25:20.658Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Stanger-Ross,Adams&al(Co-App)-PG 2014.pdf	2014-09-29T22:35:12.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b8/51/5p/74/b8515p74b	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

La fin de vie est aujourdhui monopolisée par la pratique médicale et le milieu hospitalier, mais ceux-ci sont-il les plus hospitaliers pour accueillir lexpérience radicalement singulière de mourir? Comment faire de celle-ci le vrai dernier chapitre de la vie, chargé de valeur et de signification, et non livré à la contingence de laccident ou de léchec médical? Comment rendre à celui qui la vit cette expérience ultime, au lieu quelle sanéantisse dans loubli des drogues ou lanonymat de la table dopération, qui le dérobent à lui-même et à ses proches? Malgré lallongement de lespérance de vie, les progrès considérables de la médecine, les ressources psychologiques disponibles, lindividu occidental demeure entièrement désarmé face à lannonce du diagnostic fatal ou la disparition du proche (parent, enfant, compagne ou compagnon dune vie). Limpact émotionnel de la fin de vie sur ceux qui vont mourir comme sur leur entourage semble réservé au seing privé des cabinets des psychologues ou aux services des travailleurs sociaux. Quel discours public fait défaut qui permettrait de regarder la mort en face et de sy préparer? La recherche propose doffrir et de partager avec les publics les plus immédiatement concernés la première étude systématique de ce corpus de récits littéraires de la fin de vie, qui na jamais été abordé pour lui-même ni pour sa riche comparaison interculturelle. Elle sappuie sur le postulat que par les formes de savoir émotionnel et empathique quelle met en oeuvre, la littérature offre une intelligibilité spécifique de la vie humaine, produite par la rencontre entre lexpertise langagière des écrivains et leur expérience vécue, quil est temps de mettre au service de tous.	2016-11-23T14:21:41.272Z	Apprendre à mourir au 21e siècle : la contribution littéraire	N/A	Maïté Snauwaert	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2015/10/15	N/A	N/A	N/A	French	Successful SSHRC | 2016 | Literature | Death | Insight Grant | Grant application | éthique | IG | SSHRC grant | autobiographie | Beaux-arts et culture | contemporain | deuil | Développement social et bien-être | dying | écrits intimes | écrivain | fin | Histoire culturelle | journaux | Littératures et langues modernes | Mémoires | mort | mortalité | Personnes âgées | roman personnel | sociétés occidentales | soin | vie | vieillissement | vita nova	N/A	2015	N/A	N/A	2016-09-03T03:30:28.561Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/c8/21/gn/51/c821gn513/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-24T08:51:21.193Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Snauwaert-IG-2015.pdf	2016-09-03T03:30:27.108Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b9/g5/4x/h7/b9g54xh745	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

In 19th century Hawaii, missionaries leisure-discourses were intimately connected with colonial structures and judgments about Kanaka Maolis fitness to self-govern. Having adopted writing early in the missionary experience, Kanaka Maoli used self-produced, Hawaiian language, newspapers to create an intellectual tradition and commons from 1838 to 1948. These newspapers are a valuable source for understanding what Kanaka Maoli of the time thought about the discourses that categorized their cultural/spiritual practices as marketable leisure activities. The project will include developing a leisure-search strategy for the yet-untranslated Hawaiian language newspapers, and analysis of two Kanaka Maoli practices labeled as leisure by missionaries. The intellectual outcomes will include: Demonstrate the role of leisure discourses in colonial misrepresentations of Indigenous practices and Kanaka Maoli use of cultural practices to maintain well-being and resist colonialization. Materially contribute to the Hawaiian-language intellectual commons through search strategies and translation; Historical analysis has implications for current tourism/leisure practices and self-determination actions relevant for other Indigenous communities.	2016-11-23T17:11:35.239Z	Native Hawaiian Responses to 18th and 19th Century Leisure Discourses and their Haunting Consequences	N/A	Karen Fox	N/A	McDermott | Puakea Nogelmeier	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2014	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	2014 | Grant Application | Successful SSHRC | cultural studies | IDG | Insight Development Grant |  gender studies | Americanization | Colonization | communication studies | decolonization | demography | Hawaii | Hawaiian language | Hawaiian newspapers | Indigenous epistemologies | journalism | Kanaka Maoli | Kawaihuelani Center | Leisure Studies | library and information science | media studies | Missionization | Moolelo | Polynesia | Recreation | Sociology	N/A	2014	N/A	N/A	2016-07-14T17:23:31.466Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b8/p5/8p/d1/b8p58pd12z/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-24T08:41:49.658Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	FoxKaren-IDG-2014.pdf	2016-07-14T17:23:29.784Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/br/86/b6/52/br86b6527	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

This study examines the effects of the French Revolution on European and American style. It asks how 1790s fashion drastically changed to affect and reflect the social order. During this revolutionary decade, clothing was implicated in the changing political, artistic and ideological landscapes of Europe. As people searched for new systems of government, the meaning of dress in France took on additional importance. The research will thus begin in France and expand to places traditionally affected by French style: the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States and Canada. Finding, accessing and analyzing surviving clothing and depictions of dress such as portraits and fashion plates from the 1790s will allow us to understand the journey towards more democratic and body-conscious styles.	2017-05-17T18:05:55.018Z	A Revolutionary Decade: Fasion & Material Culture in the 1790s	N/A	Bissonette, Anne	N/A	GAPSSHRC	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2017/04/11	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	2017 | Material Culture | Representation | Insight Grant | SSHRC | IG | Successful Grant | Human Ecology | Artefact | 1790 | Dress, Historical | Fashion Studies | Fashion, French | Fashion, Neoclassical | Fashion, Street | Federalist Era | French Revolution | Textile History	N/A	2017	N/A	N/A	2017-04-11T22:23:11.659Z	bypassAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bj/w8/27/b8/bjw827b856/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-05-18T00:05:55.256Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Bissonette-IG-2016-17.pdf	2017-04-11T22:23:10.236Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/st/74/ct/03/st74ct03d	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

These concepts play distinct roles in diverse branches of philosophy, but they intersect naturally in several places, and examined together, they may help explain puzzles in early modern views of perceptual intentionality and action, particularly about what fuels various mental acts, about the nature of mental content and about motivation to deeds. The results of this work will include a monograph on the genealogy of early modern passions, an article on Hobbes connecting social power, representation and the passion of glory, another article on the (dys)functionality of the passions in Malebranche, an edited anthology on the history of the concept of power, and yet another edited volume on the concept of conatus. Although it is directed at retrieving and explaining early modern conceptual history, this research is informed by contemporary interests in representation and the emotions, particularly (though not exclusively) in the philosophy of mind, as well as by current political theory and (to a lesser degree) philosophy of science. As such, it should have a broadly interdisciplinary appeal, illuminating theorigins of many current concepts. Let me emphasize, however, that I do not think that there is any single, overarching account about the relations among passions, power and representation in early modern philosophy: Showing the diversity of alternative conceptions should add a fruitful complexity to our grasp on our own concepts.	2016-11-23T17:28:59.056Z	Passions, Power and Representations in Early Modern Philosophy	N/A	Amy Schmitter	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2015/10/14	N/A	2016-05-19T20:31:07.909Z	N/A	English	Successful SSHRC | 2016 | France | Germany | Insight Grant | Grant application | Philosophy | Spinoza | IG | Netherlands | Hobbes | emotion | England | Scotland | Leibniz | Astell | conatus | Descartes | History of Philosophy | History of Psychology | Hume | Hutcheson | Intellectual History | Malebranche | passion | Poullain de la Barre | sentiment | Shaftesbury | Smith	N/A	2015	N/A	N/A	2016-05-19T20:31:08.559Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/qz/20/sw/23/qz20sw23h/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-22T02:27:51.979Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	SchmitterAmy-IG-2015.pdf	N/A	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/4q/77/fv/08/4q77fv08w	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Parents investsubstantial amounts of time and money to support their childrens sport participation. They payregistration fees, take time off work to transport children to practices and games and, in many cases,coach, manage, or referee [2]. Hence, youth sport plays a significant role in the social fabric of Canadiansociety. Parents also help children understand and interpret their sport experiences, acting as role modelsof (positive and negative) behaviours, attitudes, and beliefs [3, 4]. However, parenting in youth sport canbe a stressful and challenging endeavour and the demands facing parents and children in sport changewith development [5]. The proposed study of parenting in youth sport will create better understandingsof how different parenting approaches influence parent-child relationships over time and knowledge thatcan be used to improve childrens and parents experiences [6].OBJECTIVE AND RESEARCH QUESTIONSThe objective of this research is to produce knowledge that can be used to improve parent-childrelationships in the context of sport. The following research questions will be addressed by obtaining theperceptions of parents and their children: (a) How do parenting styles and practices change during theearly adolescent period (aged approximately 12-15 years)? (b) What are the consequences of differentparenting styles and practices for parents and their children (e.g., stressors, enjoyment, dropout)? (c)How do parenting styles and practices vary among the parents of male and female youth sportparticipants and among parents/children of different ethnicities?METHODSA three-year ethnographic study will be conducted. Participant observers will be embedded with twocompetitive youth soccer teams (one male, on female) from the U12 age group. These teams will befollowed for three entire seasons. Observations and end-of-season interviews will be conducted.ORIGINALITY, SIGNIFICANCE, AND EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION TO KNOWLEDGEThe original and significant elements of the proposed research are the use of an ethnographic approachto longitudinally study parenting styles and practices. This has not been done before in youth sport ordevelopmental psychology research. The proposed analysis of issues relating to gender and ethnicityfurther add to the novelty of the research. This research will produce information about dimensions ofthe qualities of parent-child relationships and how they may change over time, which can be usedbeyond the academic realm to inform parent education seminars (mandatory in many sports).Accordingly, we have planned a knowledge mobilization workshop in Year 4 to reach key stakeholdersin youth sport organizations (see Knowledge Mobilization Plan module for further details).	2016-06-07T10:16:03.920Z	Parenting Styles and Practices in Sport	N/A	Holt, Nick	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2014/10/09	N/A	2016-03-15T18:41:03.207Z	N/A	English	2014 | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | Recreation | Leisure | Children (sport) | Parenting (sport) | Physical Education | Sport Participation Research Initiative | Sports Psychology	2014	2014	N/A	N/A	2016-03-15T18:41:03.919Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bf/f3/65/53/bff3655331/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-24T03:28:22.129Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	HoltNick-IG-2014-SPRI(Redacted).pdf	N/A	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b3/f4/62/54/b3f462548p	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Powersharing experts argue ethnopolitical groups are the most important actors in contemporary conflicts like Afghanistan and Syria, often to the exclusion of all other social identities and locations, while women, peace and security scholars and other critics of powersharing theory argue powersharing is inherently exclusionary. Our research question is: can powersharing theory, which focuses exclusively on ethnopolitical groups, be revised to accommodate the women, peace, and security agenda? Drawing on the lessons of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995 and the Belfast Peace Agreement in Northern Ireland in 1998, we assert that the exclusion of women is not a result of powersharing per se, but rather stems from a failure to integrate a gender perspective into powersharing theory and practice. Our projects central purpose is to provide a theory of gender-inclusive powersharing and to demonstrate how it can inform conflict resolution processes in two contemporary cases of conflict: Afghanistan and Syria. This requires significant theoretical revision to the power-sharing model and necessitates building opportunities for scholars from both streams to share knowledge. Our four-year research plan is centered on two objectives: developing opportunities for practitioner-academic engagements to advance scholarship and creating a gendered theory of power-sharing. We will employ a qualitative multi-methods approach, including in-depth semi-structured interviews with politicians, advocacy groups, and UN staff; gender analysis of comprehensive peace accords, UN Security Council Resolutions, and other key peace documents, and; comparative case studies (Syria, Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Northern Ireland). This research will benefit not only scholars and practitioners but also the women, men, and children who live in conflict and post-conflict zones.	2016-11-23T15:59:39.817Z	Gender, peace and powersharing practices in political transitions	N/A	Siobhan Byrne	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2013/10/10	N/A	2016-03-15T18:29:42.046Z	N/A	English	2014 | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | Political Science | IG | Interdisciplinary Studies | Theory | United Nations | Peace | Negotiation | conflict resolution | ethnonational conflict | Gender | International relations | peace-building | Peacebuilding | postconflict | Powersharing | Resolution 1325 | Security Council | Women and Peace	2013	2013	N/A	N/A	2016-03-15T18:29:42.947Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bh/12/8n/d7/bh128nd744/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-20T17:32:29.255Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	ByrneSiobhan-IG-2013.pdf	N/A	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b6/q1/82/k2/b6q182k20h	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

The study of tea culture as a form of material identity offers a lens on change in contemporary China, including the upsurge of regional identities, the impact of foreign investment and tourism on local communities, and the importance of not only of government programs but also commerce as a force in materializing regional and national cultural identities. The research will focus on three major themes:1. The resurgence of interest in Chinese specialty teas and tea arts in Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces, and public and private support for this resurgence in formal programs of education;2. The role of historical legends, rituals, and the performing arts in promoting regional forms of tea culture in Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces, including modern interpretations of Chan (Zen) Buddhist tea culture;3.

However,  audio and music in games is still primarily constrained to sound effects, dialog and emotive accompaniment, thereby lagging behind advances in full-sphere 3D audio and procedurally generated sound. This research aims to answer several questions in relation to the potential of audio as a major video game mechanic: What if sound were the primary form of interaction?  What kinds of musical and sonic experiences can be created in that environment?  How might 3D audio enhance that experience?  What about field recording and soundscape composition?  How could games enhance our understanding of our changing soundscape?	2017-07-24T21:49:11.508Z	The Lost Garden: Exploring Audio in Interactive Spaces	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2017/01/25	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	Grant Application | Successful SSHRC | 2017 | IDG | Composition | Music | Soundscape | Video Games | Fine Arts | Interactivity | Ambisonics | Audio Games | Binaural audio | Electroacoustic music | Sound art | Sound design | Soundscape composition	N/A	2017	N/A	N/A	2017-07-24T21:49:12.207Z	bypassAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bz/w1/2z/54/bzw12z547q/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-07-24T22:13:10.264Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	SmallwoodSCott-IDG-2017.pdf	2017-07-24T21:49:11.508Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/70/79/5b/72/70795b72c	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

This project plans to examine this episode and to attempt to answer some key questions: What was the scale of the destruction of these mills, weirs, etc. (sporadic or comprehensive)? How was this program of destruction implemented and who specifically carried it out? Who were the specific winners and losers (e.g., were certain people targeted to the benefit of a select few)? Did it effect a permanent change on riverine systems, or were the impacts reversible as landowners were allowed to rebuild mills and weirs? Does the examination of the Statute and its impact help our understanding of the Henrician reforms as a whole?The methodology involves examining an array of government and manorial documents available in print and manuscript. Surveying the documents in print will provide excellent training for graduate students, while paleographic training in reading early sixteenth-century documents will also be provided. A great deal of the relevant manuscript material is not available in printed or digital form and will have to be examined (and, where allowed, photographed) at archives in the United Kingdom. Based upon thepast research experience and output of the applicant, this project should have a high probability in providing important and broad-ranging results that will inform academics and interested people generally not only about this particular incident but about early sixteenth-century English society, economy and politics as a whole.	2016-11-23T14:11:37.255Z	A war over water: The 1531 English Statue of Sewers and its impact upon local politics, economies and environments	N/A	Langdon, John	N/A	N/A	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2012/10/09	2013-07-31T14:37:00Z	2013-07-31T14:37:00Z	N/A	English	2013 | Book | History | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | Environmental Studies | Politics | Rivers | IG | England | Successful SSHRC Grant | Economy | Trade | Fishing | Navigation | Weirs	2012	2012	s1784m89h	s1784m89h	2015-10-07T09:37:02.946Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/ww/72/bc/52/ww72bc52f/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-20T17:30:02.323Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. John Langdon IG.pdf	2013-07-31T20:37:00.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/nc/58/0n/75/nc580n751	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Inclusive movement programs have been internationally championed as a basic right of people with disabilities, and a vehicle for their broader social inclusion (United Nations, 2008). The Canadian Government (2013) celebrates the existing inclusivity of its movement programs, in particular, disability sport. These claims, however, contradict Statistics Canada’s (2013) report that only 3% of people with disabilities have regular access to organized sport. This research will create the first national database of inclusive movement programs in Canada, and the first study of inclusive movement communities in Canada, helping to identify trends and implications in relation to the production of disability, inclusion, and exclusion at a national level.	2017-05-17T19:25:00.589Z	Moving Towards Disability Inclusion?

The book that will emerge from this research will probe the narratives and discourses surrounding oil at three distinct sites: (1) in recent visual art, documentary cinema and contemporary fiction; (2) as they emergein public debates in relation to three major oil events: the running aground of the Exxon Valdez, the recent BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the emergence of the oil sands as an environmentalproblem on an international level; and (3) in philosophical discussions about ecological limits, sustainability, and the capacity of contemporary society to undergo intensive and extensive social andpolitical change. By investigating each of these sites, what I wish to capture is the full range of the contemporary discourses that have emerged in relation to this puzzling substance, whose impact onhuman life has been deeper than we have previously believed, and whose eventual decline and disappearance will pose substantial cultural, political and philosophical challenges.	2016-11-23T17:22:34.454Z	On empty: The cultural politics of oil	http://www.crcculturalstudies.ca/research/petrocultures	Imre Szeman	N/A	N/A	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2012/10/10	2013-07-29T10:11:37Z	2013-07-29T10:11:37Z	N/A	English	2013 | Sustainability | Discourse | gender | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | Oil | Film | Oil sands | IG | Art | Energy transition | Successful SSHRC Grant | Pipelines | Cinema | Cultural Imaginaries | Documentaries | Exxon Valdez | Fiction | Oil spills | Petroculture | Tar sands	2012	2012	zg64tn49m	zg64tn49m	2015-10-10T23:55:25.745Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/41/68/7k/04/41687k04r/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-20T17:59:49.514Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. Imre Szeman IG.pdf	2013-07-29T16:11:37.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/v1/18/rg/16/v118rg16q	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Multi-generational subsistence fisheries (including Indigenous communities) have well developed systems of local and traditional knowledge (LTK) that can contribute to the sustainable governance of these complex and dynamic social-ecological systems. Through community-based research at fish camps in each of the eight sub-basins of the Mackenze, the Tapajos (Lower Amazon, and tributaries of the Lower Mekong, the project will enable researchers and communities to collaboratively document oral histories, observations and experiences of social-ecological change. The aim is to understand what indicators and what methods are being used by communities to track change in the subsistence fishery and how those changes matter to the livelihood and well-being of communities. Such tracking of social-ecological change is a recognized function of watershed governance that is increasingly important in the Mackenzie, Mekong and Amazon. There are concerns that the pressures of resource development and climate change are fundamentally changing fisheries/fishing livelihoods. Determining fit between the scale of observation, experience and meaning of such changes on the one hand, and the scale of watershed decision-making on the other, may help address discontinuities in perspectives and emerging social and environmental conflicts.	2016-09-07T15:40:41.073Z	Tracking Change - The Role of Local and Traditional Knowledge in Watershed Governance [PG stage II]	N/A	Parlee, Brenda	N/A	Parkins, John | Berkes, Fikret | Baker, Shannon | Hallstrom, Lars | Jobin Bandervelde, Shalene | Lantz, Trevor | Marschke, Melissa | Napoleon, Val | Natcher, David | Nuttall, Mark | Robertson, Sean | Swallow, Brent	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2014/10/21	N/A	2016-03-09T22:47:45.137Z	N/A	English	Sustainability | SSHRC Grant | Grant application | Partnership grant (stage 2) | PG | Aboriginal research | Anthropology | Environment | Environmental governance | Environmental monitoring | Geography | Indigenous Knowledge | Local knowledge | Natural Resources | Partnership Grant | Traditional Knowledge | Watersheds	2014	2014	N/A	N/A	2016-03-09T22:47:46.518Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b9/01/9s/24/b9019s248g/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-24T14:37:15.043Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Parlee_SSHRC PG [DRAFT-Copy].pdf	N/A	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/1j/92/gb/15/1j92gb15f	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

The Birgittines played a decisive role in popular resistance to Lutheran texts in the decade preceding Henry VIII’s break from the Roman Catholic Church in 1535. Research results will be a less well-known story of the English Reformation, one of the complexity of lay piety in the Middle Ages, the role of women in the English Reformation, Syon Abbeys reimagining of the relationships and differences between religious and lay person, and popular resistance as guided by a series of texts originating from the nation’s then most important monastic establishment.  The research will form the preliminary stage in a larger book-length project that will provide the first sustained textual analysis of work by the Syon brothers from the early sixteenth century.	2017-05-17T19:19:38.934Z	Good cownsell for an erroneous conscyence: William Bonde, Lutheran Polemic, and Orthodox Reform in the Late Middle Ages	N/A	Alakas, Brandon	N/A	GAPSSHRC	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2016/02/01	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	Grant Application | Religious Studies | Christianity | IDG | Insight Development Grant | Medieval | Book research | Brigittine spirituality | Classics | English Reformation | History | Lectio divina | Literature, devotional | Literature, medieval | Martin Luther | Medieval Studies | Melancholy, religious | Piety, Medieval | St. Bridget of Sweden | Successful SSHRC | Syon Abbey	N/A	2016	N/A	N/A	2016-07-15T19:13:39.725Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/28/01/pk/23/2801pk231/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-05-18T01:19:39.162Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	AlakasBrandon-IDG-2016.pdf	2016-07-15T19:14:16.541Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b5/d8/6p/02/b5d86p029j	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

We suggest that, compared to narrowcasting (sharing with few others), broadcasting (sharing with many others) changes the perspective, or the lens, through which consumers view their sharing, from an actor (internal) perspective to an observer (external) perspective. Prior research suggests that these changes in perspective may have implications for the strength of consumers brand-related emotions. Specifically, taking an observer perspective by sharing with broader audiences may weaken emotions. Thus, a consumer who shares the sentiment I love Starbucks! with 340 Facebook friends may love Starbucks less than if she shares it with a single Facebook friend. Through a series of lab experiments, the current proposal aims to test this prediction and to provide novel insights into several aspects of emotional sharing via social media. This research will provide theoretical and methodological contributions to marketing and psychology, and will help organizations use social media to maximize the positive outcomes of sharing and minimize the negative outcomes. Further, this research will improve digital literacy for the general public; consumers will benefit from learning how broadcasting emotions influences them, enabling them to use social media to their benefit. The present research thus aims to provide important insights to the scholarly community, to industry, and to society.	2016-08-26T16:01:39.651Z	The Public Heart: The Impact of Sharing Emotions on Social Media	N/A	Sarah Moore	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2014/10/06	N/A	2016-03-15T18:04:28.586Z	N/A	English	2015 | Successful SSHRC | consumer behaviour | Information Technologies | Insight Grant | social media | SSHRC Grant | Communications | psychology | Media Studies | IG | brand attachment | emotional intensity | social sharing of emotion	2014	2014	N/A	N/A	2016-03-15T18:04:29.743Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b9/z9/02/z9/b9z902z940/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-19T01:14:21.792Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Moore&Argo-IG-2014.pdf	N/A	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/hq/37/vr/25/hq37vr25z	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

We expect to learn more about the appropriateness of interpreting interference within the positive framework of learning, and to learn more about the relationship between interference, learning, and cognitive control. We will examine interference in picture-naming and memory activities. We will examine whether children demonstrate an accumulation of interference among related words, even when their responses are separated by intervening, unrelated words – a critical pattern in support of the learning view. We will also compare patterns of interference when the goal is communication rather than remembering items. Finally, we will examine the contributions of vocabulary ability and other cognitive skills to interference outcomes.	2016-11-23T15:04:25.316Z	Cumulative Semantic Interference and Lexical Learning in Children	N/A	Monique Charest	N/A	Sandra Wiebe	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2016/02/01	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	Children | Grant Application | Psycholinguistics | Successful SSHRC | 2016 | Memory | IDG | Insight Development Grant | Learning | Executive function | Interference phenomenon | Language processing | Llexicon | Vocabulary learning	N/A	2016	N/A	N/A	2016-07-07T22:44:21.434Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/08/61/2r/09/08612r09p/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-20T17:31:29.014Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	CharestMonique-IDG-2016.pdf	2016-07-07T22:44:20.679Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/9k/41/zh/21/9k41zh21q	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

The primary texts it will discuss are dictionaries and wordlists produced or circulated in England, both printed and manuscript. These texts were at the heart of sixteenth-century English literate culture. Many of them were bilingual, guiding English-speakers in their encounters with other languages. Latin-English and English-Latin dictionaries form the largest group (every educated person used these, so that they are for instance theone kind of dictionary which Shakespeare is absolutely certain to have studied), but there were also dictionaries of English with Welsh, Spanish, Italian, French, Old English, Russian, and other languages, and wordlists of English with languages of Africa, the Ottoman Empire, and the Arctic. Monolingual English dictionaries and glossaries introduced their readers to the fields of specialized literate knowledge most highly valued in sixteenth-century insular culture, giving access to the languages of the law, medicine, and other arts and sciences; the first free-standing non-specialized English dictionary appearedjust after the period under discussion, in 1604.  My first monograph has, as far as I know, mostly been read by members of the academic community (including undergraduate students) and professional lexicographers, and I would expect much the same to be true of the study which I now propose to write. I would also expect the proposed study to have a similar interdisciplinary impact, and a similar indirect impact beyond the academy, to that of my first book, which has recently been cited by historians of lexicography and the language sciences, but also in works on language for a wide readership by authors such as Jack Lynch, Henry Hitchings, and Alastair Fowler, and in studies of the histories of Orientalism, religion, Anglo-Saxon studies, Byzantine literature, literary translation, the English language, and méditations cosmographiques.	2016-11-23T15:28:59.627Z	English dictionaries in the sixteenth century	N/A	John Considine	N/A	N/A	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2012/10/12	2013-07-29T10:48:39Z	2013-07-29T10:48:39Z	N/A	English	2012 | Literature | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | IG | Successful SSHRC Grant | Dictionaries | glossaries | History of learned texts | History of the book | lexicography | Modern languages | Wordlists	2012	2012	7s75dd46d	7s75dd46d	2015-10-06T16:15:24.635Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/h1/28/nf/83/h128nf83m/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-20T17:30:49.522Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. John Considine IG.pdf	2013-07-29T16:48:39.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/44/55/8f/28/44558f28c	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Our objectives include: -To investigate the factors that shape the transition of TFWs to permanent residents, international students, and undocumented migrants in Canada;-To examine how TFWs, who transition to undocumented migrants and students in Canada, contend with and navigate their lives in Canada;-To examine opportunities that exist to engage TFWs to challenge systemic processes that contribute to becoming undocumented in Canada.	2017-04-12T14:52:44.265Z	Migration and Precarity: From the Temporary Foreign Worker Program to Permanent Resident, Student and Undocumented Migrant Status	N/A	Bukola Salami	N/A	GAPSSHRC	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2017/04/11	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	2017 | Immigration | Insight Grant | SSHRC | Nursing | IG | Successful Grant | Multiculturalism | Temporary Foreign Workers | Migrant Rights | Migrant Workers | Migration Policy | PAR | Participatory Action Research | Precarious Work | Transnational Theory | Transnationalism	N/A	2017	N/A	N/A	2017-04-11T22:23:11.241Z	bypassAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bv/m4/0x/r7/bvm40xr75v/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-04-12T20:52:58.521Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Salami-IG-2016-17.pdf	2017-04-11T22:23:09.955Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/st/74/ct/03/st74ct03d	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

The education of Aboriginal students has become a national priority and consequently an increasing demand for teachers who understand the pedagogical implications of working with Aboriginal students. The objectives of our study are to 1) establish sustainable collaborations between three diverse Aboriginal community schools and organizations that support those schools; 2) undertake research development of co-created curriculum models, through arts, digital technology and youth exchange, for nurturing the educational success of Aboriginal learners; 3) build capacity within the communities to utilize and further develop the emergent curricular models; 4) disseminate learning from the study to schools, school authorities, and teacher preparation programs locally, nationally and internationally; 5) developother partnerships for research into the education of Aboriginal learners. Partnership: Our collaboration involves University of Alberta researchers including a leading Indigenous scholar; three diverse First Nations schools including a community school in the Northwest Territories; a school on a Southern Alberta reserve, with the Principal as research collaborator; an urban Aboriginal school in Edmonton, Alberta; two school boards; a community council; a Northern community college; and a government department. Relationship building activities and consultation processes undertaken with the communities including a meeting of representatives from all three communities have indicated that education is a priority for all partners; they have identified the partnership development as aligning with their established goals. Partners will provide leadership for the research; analyze and evaluate the processes and products of the curriculum exploration, attuned to the specific cultural contexts of their communities and the educational goals of their regions.	2016-08-23T19:30:52.497Z	Partnership Development for Researching the Education of Aboriginal Students: A Youth Exchange through Arts & Technology - Stories of Culture, Identity, Community and Place	N/A	Diane Conrad	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2014/11/24	N/A	2016-03-15T22:48:15.182Z	N/A	English	2015 | SSHRC Grant | First Nations | Curriculum | Secondary Education | Partnership Development Grant | PDG | Indigenous peoples | Aboriginal education | participatory action research | Indigenous research | wisdom traditions | Aboriginal youth identity | arts and technology | Arts Education | decolonizing education | knowledge co-creation | Teacher education	2014	2014	N/A	N/A	2016-03-15T22:48:18.208Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bs/j1/39/20/bsj139203h/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-24T14:32:33.724Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Conrad&Donald-PDG-2014[Redacted].pdf	N/A	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bf/x7/19/m4/bfx719m47n	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

It employs the primary data gathered during my tour of duty, and pilot project data from my upcoming art installation and interdisciplinary forum at the Liu Institute for Global Issues, University of British Columbia. Photography in a State of Exception advances my interrogation of contemporary warfare through the application of a new methodological approach: immersive digital photography. This innovative application of commercial digital print media utilizes large-scale, interactive installations to situate the audience within the geographically and socially remote spaces of Canadians at war. This immersive approach represents and challenges the phenomenological experience of war on numerous levels. Specifically, what is the relationship between the concept of spectacle---in respect to war---and everyday life? How does the spectacle of the suffering of others affect us? Moreover, how an artist can represent their experience of modern war?

Both research and anecdotal evidence tell us “no”.  In contrast to language differences, differences in speaking styles are far more difficult to detect.  Although knowledge of different language systems such as English and Chinese is extensive, there is little systematic knowledge of how people—particularly those who speak Chinese—engage in everyday conversation. One unique, though poorly documented, norm in the Chinese speaking style is to leave things unsaid or unfinished. In this research, I will examine how and why Mandarin Chinese speakers use unfinished utterances in everyday conversation.	2017-10-02T20:43:12.267Z	Unfinished Utterances in Mandarin Conversation	N/A	Xiaoting Li	N/A	GAPSSHRC	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2017/02/01	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	Linguistics | Successful SSHRC | 2017 | IDG | Chinese | Conversation | East Asia | Communications studies | Media studies | Non-verbal behaviour | Speaking style | Verbal behaviour	N/A	2017	N/A	N/A	2017-10-02T20:43:12.751Z	bypassAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bm/61/3m/x7/bm613mx71b/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-10-02T20:54:26.162Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	LiXiaoting-IDG-2017.pdf	2017-10-02T20:43:12.267Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bs/46/55/g6/bs4655g69w	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Renewed archaeological thinking about migration pays attention to social science research into migration, and specific processes like kin structuring of founding populations. The current proposal develops predictions about what to expect during Apachean migration and uses the extraordinary fidelity of Promontory material culture and the growing inventory of AMS dates reflecting temporal trends to frame precise questions. These include insights into the population structure of the Promontory Cave inhabitants (derived from moccasin sizes and their precise relationship to stature and age), assessing the potential for apex founding populations (based on refinement of moccasin sewing techniques) and similar problems.	2016-11-23T14:18:50.920Z	Apachean origins: New explorations of the Canadian heritage of A.D. 13th century Dene at Promontory Point, Utah	N/A	John Ives	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2011/10/07	2013-07-29T10:21:53Z	2013-07-29T10:21:53Z	N/A	English	2012 | Aboriginal | Dene | Archaeology | Insight Grant | SSHRC | successful SSHRC Grant | First Nations | IG | Handicraft | Apache | Artefact | Prehistory | Radiocarbon	2011	2011	f1881m31b	f1881m31b	2015-10-04T08:27:49.274Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/pc/28/9j/64/pc289j645/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-22T02:12:30.624Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. John Ives IG.pdf	2013-07-29T16:21:54.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/vh/53/ww/13/vh53ww13r	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Prior research has indicated that cognitive lock-in plays a critical role in this process. Put simply, once people have learned to use an emerging technology, they are more efficient with thattechnology and are reluctant to switch to competing products that require new skills or allow for only limited transfer of current skills. As a result, consumers become less likely to search for alternative products or services, they are more likely to repeat past behaviours, making it difficult for new firms, products or services to successfully enter the market. The proposed work will examine three theoretically important, yet previously unexplored, linkages between experience with an emerging technology and lock-in to that technology. I am especially interested in better understanding the impact of cognitive lock-in on Canadian consumers. Given the growing power and dominance of platforms ranging from Facebook to Twitter and from Google to Apple, this research has important applied implications for Canadian business competitiveness, government regulation and consumer choice in the ever-evolving digital economy.	2016-11-23T14:34:00.910Z	Cognitive lock-in to emerging technologies: efficiency, efficacy and emotion	N/A	Kyle Murray	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2014/10/07	N/A	2016-03-15T22:06:33.956Z	N/A	English	2015 | Information Technologies | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | Psychology | IG | Affective states | Business | Cognitive lock-in | Consumer-choice | Consumer-Learning | Emerging technology | Management	2014	2014	N/A	N/A	2016-03-15T22:06:34.668Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/1c/18/dj/30/1c18dj303/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-22T01:53:23.729Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	MurrayKyle-IG-2014.pdf	N/A	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b5/d8/6p/02/b5d86p0259	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

In France, wartime shortages and state controls accentuated stresses that reveal critical state-market and market-consumer relations. My primary objective is to research and write a history of the proliferation of black market activity in France in the 1940s in the context of shortages and state controls during the Occupation and the postwar years. I will examine state policy, business efforts to deal with shortages and state controls, and civilians efforts to obtain the food, shelter and clothing they needed to survive. My study will include close attention to food supply and food security, including the regional variations and the urban/rural divide in access to food. Detailed study of the economic problems in France will allow a comparative analysis of the use of controls and black markets in Occupied Europe and in Allied countries (particularly Britain and the United States). The state and market responses to the economic challenges of the wartime shortages and the relationship between state controls and black markets involve much starker choices than in peacetime, but as such they allow a clearer view of the issues of government control and market behaviour that are relevant to current debates about the role for economic regulation and the functioning of free markets. France provides an excellent case study to distinguish what factors encourage compliance or defiance of state controls, and the role for regulations to limit excess and abuse in free markets. State controls in wartime France diverted consumer demand, production and the creative powers of markets to illegal activities -- the black heart of Frances economy. Significance: Marché noir: Capitalisms Black Heart in France 1939-1950 has significance for our understanding of the French economy: the efficacy of economic controls, the prevalence of black market activity in wartime, and the severity of food shortages in France and Occupied Europe. It will provide a new analysis of black market activity and food security, adding to our understanding of black markets, economic controls, market behaviours, market rhetoric, and histories of consumption and of economic policy in times of crisis. It will interest historians of Modern France, World War II, policy history, consumption history, and of how events are conceived in history and in memory. Beyond historians, it will interest economists specializing in economic history, economic policy, and transitions from wartime control regimes to peacetime, as well as political scientists engaged in debates on regulation and markets. Markets do not exist without rules. Contemporary debates on the need for regulation or deregulation are part of my interest in earlier experience. The role of the state in the economy and the basis for moral behaviour in economic life are central concerns in my study. These issues should have a broader audience in a general public interested in the role of the state and regulation in economic stability and the market dynamics essential to economic growth. Methodology: This project is based on intensive archival research, principally in France, in the archives of the major ministries involved in economic activity and the design and enforcement of controls. It draws on economic theory and cultural theory to analyse government policy, its enforcement, its effectiveness, and the agency of firms and consumers in adapting to and contravening controls. It will look as well at the representations of controls and black markets by the state, the press, entrepreneurs, consumers, and in postwar fiction and film.	2016-05-31T14:48:34.666Z	Marche noir: Capitalisms black heart in France, 1939-1950	N/A	Moure, Kenneth	N/A	N/A	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2012/10/15	2013-08-09T13:53:39Z	2013-08-09T13:53:39Z	N/A	English	2013 | Economics | History | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | black market | Economic Policy | governmentality | Law and Justice | price controls | rationing | Vichy regime | Wartime Occupation | World War II	2012	2012	cz30pt02k	cz30pt02k	2015-10-03T20:56:45.294Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/6q/18/2k/48/6q182k48w/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-20T22:52:36.312Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. Kenneth Moure IG.pdf	2013-08-09T19:53:39.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/w0/89/2b/18/w0892b18t	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

One problem is that we currently lack the requisite knowledge to make good on our commitment under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to eliminate discrimination against... and render appropriate assistance to... parents with intellectual impairment in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities (Article 23). The second problem is that there is no provincial or national strategy at present to translate extant knowledge about parents and parenting with intellectual impairment into the planning and delivery of more effective parenting and family supports. As a result of these two problems, children of parents with intellectual impairment are at increased risk of developmental delay, accidents and injuries, and behaviour problems; and, they are ten to fifteen times more likely than their peers to be apprehended by child and youth protection authorities and permanently placed out-of-home.	2016-11-23T17:56:54.046Z	Support needs and service pathways of parents with intellectual impairment	N/A	David McConnell	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2015-12-01	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	Successful SSHRC | 2016 | Parenting | child development | child welfare | SSHRC Application | family | Partnership Development Grant | PDG | child safety | Intellectual disability | mixed methods research | service pathways	N/A	2015	N/A	N/A	2016-08-26T18:30:29.278Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/3r/07/4x/81/3r074x812/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-24T08:42:51.561Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	McConnellDavid-PDG-2016.pdf	2016-08-26T18:30:27.327Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/k3/56/97/06/k3569706s	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Heresies was a quasi-biannual magazine edited and produced by a collective that included artists, art historians, activists, and critics. Heresies branded itself as a place where many womens voices would be heard. The central claim of this research project is that the periodicals commitment to representing opposing points of view makes it a particularly valuable document for understanding feminist thinking about art and politics from 1977 to 1993. Heresies stands as a gauge for what its participants -- many of whom would continue to play a central role in feminist art practice, criticism and history well after the periodical folded -- understood to be the key issues of the time. I argue that Heresies is additionally a valuable gauge for understanding the contours of the debates that animated feminist discourses and feminist art thinking during the 1980s -- a period that has been largely overlooked by feminist art historians and critics.	2016-08-26T15:58:46.391Z	Art, Politics, and Feminist Periodicals: The Case of Heresies (1977-1993)	N/A	Meagher, Michelle	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2013/10/07	N/A	2016-03-15T18:20:38.133Z	N/A	English	Women | Successful SSHRC | cultural studies | Insight Grant | Grant application | Media Studies | Arts and culture | book culture | feminist activism | feminist art history | feminist cultural production | Fine Arts | heresies | IG | Interdisciplinary Studies | periodical studies | women-in-print movement	2013	2013	N/A	N/A	2016-03-15T18:20:39.122Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/3f/46/28/35/3f462835b/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-22T11:21:42.969Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	MeagherMichelle-IG-2013.pdf	N/A	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/tb/09/j8/36/tb09j836j	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

In the United States, uncovered medical expenses wreak havoc on the finances of the ill and injured, whereas in Canada, the income lost while convalescing leaves many individuals struggling to make ends meet. Public programs, such as the federal employment insurance sickness benefit and provincial workers compensation programs, are intended to insulate ill and injured Canadians from financial distress by providing them with replacement income. The frequency with which medical events trigger bankruptcy suggests that these programs are not fulfilling this goal; this project seeks to understand why.	2017-10-05T20:44:52.314Z	Providing Income Support to the Ill and Injured	N/A	Anna Lund	N/A	GAPSSHRC	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2017/02/01	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	Successful SSHRC | 2017 | IDG | Law | Bankruptcy | Employment insurance | Financial distress | Medical poverty | Sickness benefit | Workers compensation	N/A	2017	N/A	N/A	2017-10-05T20:44:53.057Z	bypassAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bm/p4/8s/c9/bmp48sc923/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-10-05T21:29:36.424Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	LundAnna-IDG-2017.pdf	2017-10-05T20:44:52.314Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bp/26/76/v6/bp2676v672	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

The relative sobriety and calculations required by health regimens, by the physical and mental declines of old age, by the accidents that radically alter ones identity, or by the unequal rhythms and lifespan of organs along with the possibility of their transplant, quickly prove to be incompatible with the subjective flourishing of the ideal of the good life that dominates our images of citizenship.	2017-05-17T18:34:09.098Z	The Biomedical Body and Everyday Life in Quebec	N/A	Laforest, Daniel	N/A	GAPSSHRC	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2017/04/11	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	2017 | Literature | Insight Grant | Cultural Studies | Modern Languages | SSHRC | Storytelling | IG | Successful Grant |  Québécoise | Biomedical | French Canadian | Health Humanities | Health Narratives | Medical Experiences | Narration | Narrative	N/A	2017	N/A	N/A	2017-04-11T22:23:11.900Z	bypassAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/cc/08/hj/30/cc08hj30v/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-05-18T00:34:09.286Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	LaForest-IG-2016-17.pdf	2017-04-11T22:23:10.651Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/st/74/ct/03/st74ct03d	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Our approach is innovative, comparative, interdisciplinary, and organized around three broad objectives, to: (1) use elicitation and visualization techniques to understand how individually held landscape values influence citizen responses to energy development; (2) use Q methodology and survey research to understand cultural values and gauge technical literacy related to energy development in Canada; and, (3) draw on insights from objectives 1 and 2 (and use deliberative democratic techniques) to facilitate citizen deliberations and learning to identify acceptable energy alternatives. These objectives are intended to elucidate a cultural imaginary of energy development and to help find ways to re-imagine it for the future. Adaptation to and mitigation of climate change will involve widespread transitions to technologies such as renewable energy and carbon capture and storage that will affect our landscapes and our cultural imaginaries, but these transitions can only take place where civil society has shifted their understanding of what is needed, what is desirable, and what is possible. Gaining deeper insight into public understandings of energy development alternatives will be an essential component to making the transition successfully and democratically. Working with civil society organizations and regional institutions within our study locations, this project has strong potential to contribute to public understanding of alternative energy development, encourage an appropriate mix of energy supply and conservation measures, improve energy development protocols and contribute to the adaptation and mitigation of climate change.	2016-11-23T15:39:22.098Z	Exploring and transforming a cultural imaginary of energy development in Canada	N/A	John Parkins	N/A	Beckley, Thomas//UNB | Sherren, Kate//Dalhousie University	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2011/10/12	2013-07-29T08:23:45Z	2013-07-29T08:23:45Z	N/A	English	2012 | Energy | Insight Grant | Policy | IG | Environment | Energy transition |  Civic deliberation | Alternative energy development | Cultural imaginary | Energy Policy | Environmental issues | Grant Proposal | Multidisciplinary research | Successful SSHRC Grant	2011	2011	4j03d057v	4j03d057v	2015-10-06T04:15:37.539Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/66/82/x4/94/6682x494g/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-20T17:31:47.003Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. John Parkins IG.pdf	2013-07-29T14:23:45.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/5d/86/p1/31/5d86p1319	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Energy transition demands social transformation. This research is driven by two ideas: 1) the future will be shaped by those who are able to imagine it. 2) feminist and inclusive thinkers interested in equity, under whatever name they go by, should be shaping that future. Feminists of all genders, and stories and cultural production of all forms, are critically important to imagining less carbon intensive and socially just futures, as we power-down.   Using feminist intersectional theories and qualitative methods, the project will record and create an archive of energy transition texts (stories, video, art, textiles, artefacts), analyze how feminists outputs and marginalized womens social reproduction may be mobilized to shift public perceptions toward more equitable imaginaries of our collective energy future.	2017-10-02T19:32:49.244Z	Feminist Energy Futures: Power Shift and Environmental Social Justice	N/A	Sheena Wilson	N/A	GAPSSHRC | Dorow, Sara | Beer, Ruth | Ikeda, Satoshi | Loveless, Natalie | Mookerjea, Sourayan | Moore, Lisa	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2016/10/17	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	Women | Alberta | 2017 | Gender | Climate change | Feminist | IG | Feminism | Activism | Anti-oil | Carbon footprint | Communication studies | Cultural studies | Energy humanities | Energy transition | Environmentalism | Feminist counter-narratives | Feminist knowledge | Future imagining | Intermedia communication | Northern Gateway Pipeline | Participatory action research | Petrocultures | Political engagement | Research-Creation	N/A	2016	N/A	N/A	2017-10-02T19:32:50.257Z	bypassAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b5/99/9n/35/b5999n351r/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-10-02T20:02:21.598Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Wilson-IG-2016-17.pdf	2017-10-02T19:32:49.244Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/bn/v9/35/29/bnv9352975	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Like many minority languagesof the world, UNT is in danger of extinction and its disappearance would be a major loss for speakersand scientists alike. A language contains within it an irreplaceable record of a people’s knowledge oftheir natural environment and their cultural, social, and political history, making the loss of a language aloss of identity. For the scientist, languages encode the unique way in which their speakers organize andunderstand the world and provide invaluable insights into the cognitive processes of the human mind.The death of a language represents an impoverishment of human linguistic diversity and, as languagessuch as UNT disappear, linguists of all specializations lose the typological data we need to develop, test,and validate claims about the universal features of human language and its acquisition. In the case ofUNT, all but the eldest speakers of the language are bilingual in Spanish, and the language of childrearingin most households has been shifted to Spanish by parents who see proficiency in the language ofthe larger society as an advantage for their children.Building on materials collected in previous SSHRC funded projects, our research team will collectlexical, textual, and grammatical data that will deepen our understanding of UNT and will carry outlinguistic surveys of 3–5 additional Northern Totonacan communities to facilitate comparison andinternal reconstruction of the Totonacan family. The project will also collect comparative sociolinguisticdata on language attitudes, language use, and language vitality in Northern Totonacan communities,revealing the current state of the languages, which are undergoing differing degrees of language shift,and the factors underlying language loss in indigenous communities in Mexico and around the world.During the course of this project, the research team will spend five summers in the field, recording andtranscribing texts and survey material, and will work with native speaker consultants on site at theUniversity of Alberta, transcribing and analyzing this material. The emphasis will be on working withtexts from fluent older speakers, whose knowledge of vanishing oral traditions is more profound, makingthem an important link to the community’s past. The involvement of graduate students in this project isessential, one of our goals being the training of the next generation of North American field linguists.At its most effective, this work will provide motivation and resources for those members of thecommunity who value their language and wish to revitalize and preserve it. Documentation of oraltraditions will be especially valuable in this respect, both as archival material and as the basis forpedagogical and popular language publications; the reconstruction of the linguistic history of Totonacan,with its potential to identify links between the Totonacan people and important archeological sites suchas Teotihuacán, will help to connect speakers with their cultural heritage. For the local community, thisproject will create a record of the languages as they are used by the fluent speakers, and of the vanishingtraditions of those who speak it. For policy-makers, an understanding of the factors underlying languageshiftwill help develop strategies for language maintenance and revitalization in minority languagecommunities. For the academic world, it will mean a record of a hitherto undescribed language withmany significant and unique linguistic properties.	2016-03-15T13:27:09.349Z	Upper Necaxa Totonac in Context: Exploring the Past, Present, and Future of Northern Totonac	N/A	Beck, David	N/A	Grzegorz Kondrak | Johanne Paradis | Yvonne Lam	Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives 3.0 Unported	Research Material	2011/01/28	2013-08-08T12:11:23Z	2013-08-08T12:11:23Z	N/A	English	2012 | Linguistics | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | Mexico | computational linguistics | Language acquisition | language attitudes | bilingual | endangered languages | grammatical studies | Indigenous languages | linguistic survey | Spanich | Totonacan language | Upper Necaxa Totonac	2011	2011	c534fq294	c534fq294	2015-10-10T16:39:37.949Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/9g/54/xk/21/9g54xk218/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2016-12-24T02:45:14.057Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Dr. David Beck IG.pdf	2013-08-08T18:11:23.000Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/nc/58/0p/20/nc580p20n	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

Many parents are now struggling to meet the demands of a workplace that can reach out to them 24/7, care for children and ageing parents, and maintain satisfying social relationships. Consequently, chronic loneliness is widespread. The implications of chronic loneliness for parents and children, including parents of children with disabilities who are particularly vulnerable to loneliness,may be far-reaching. This study will investigate the intriguing possibility that a rise in the prevalence of loneliness among parents of children with and without disabilities may have contributed to the decline of free and risky (i.e., physically & socially challenging) outdoor play, and portend a rise in the prevalence of social-emotional problems among children and youth.	2016-11-23T16:15:57.117Z	The loneliness crisis and the decline of free play: Pathways and effects	N/A	David McConnell	N/A	Christina Rinaldi | Rhonda Breitkreuz | Shannon Phelan | Suzanne Anselmo	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2015-10-16	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	Mental health | Grant Application | Successful SSHRC | 2016 | Parenting | Disability | Insight Grant | IG | mixed methods | free play | Family | Adolescent psychology | Child psycology | Isolation | Loneliness | social-emotional development	N/A	2015	N/A	N/A	2016-08-26T21:27:15.732Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/jq/08/5n/98/jq085n988/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-20T17:32:36.543Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	McConnellDavid-IG-2015-16.pdf	2016-08-26T21:27:14.158Z	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/b3/j3/33/23/b3j3332377	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource

How do they understand the influence on their literacy achievements of their early local sense of the world and of text, developed in their first places? This project will study how the abstract achievement of literary understanding is pursued and enacted in a specific place and time. METHOD: Using a custom designed app to explore tacit factors that often evade scrutiny but are crucial to literate development, I will investigate how readers perceive their formative literacy experiences in a particular space.	2016-11-23T17:46:11.151Z	Situated Readers in Digital Times: Understanding the Role of Place in the Development of Contemporary Literate Awareness	N/A	Mackey, Margaret	N/A	N/A	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Research Material	2014/10/13	N/A	2016-03-15T17:38:34.897Z	N/A	English	2015 | Insight Grant | SSHRC Grant | media studies | Literacy | IG | embodied comprehension | geography and literacy | landscape and literacy | Landscape App | literary understanding | reception theory | Virtual worlds	2015	2014	N/A	N/A	2016-03-15T17:38:35.683Z	fedoraAdmin	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/ws/85/9j/43/ws859j43n/fcr:export?format=jcr/xml	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod	2017-01-20T18:05:13.794Z	bypassAdmin	fedora:Container | fedora:Resource	nt:folder	true	Mackey-IG-2015.pdf	N/A	available	http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/st/74/cs/96/st74cs966	http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Container | http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#Resource | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0created | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0lastModified | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/mix/1.0referenceable | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0base | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0folder | http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0hierarchyNode | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container | http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource
