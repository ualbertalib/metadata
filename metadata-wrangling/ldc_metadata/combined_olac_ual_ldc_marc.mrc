It reflects many ways that people use language in their lives: conversation, gossip, arguments, on-the-job talk, card games, city council meetings, sales pitches, classroom lectures, political speeches, bedtime stories, sermons, weddings, and more. *Data* Part I contains 14 speech files of between 15-30 minutes each, from the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English. Collected by: University of California, Santa Barbara Center for the Study of Discourse, Director John W. Du Bois (UCSB), Associate Editors: Wallace L. Chafe (UCSB), Charlese Meyer (UMass, Boston), and Sandra A. Thompson (UCSB). The Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English is part of the International Corpus of English (Charles W. Meyer, Director), representing the American Component. Each speech file is accompanied by a transcript in which phrases are time stamped with respect to the audio recording. Personal names, place names, phone numbers, etc., in the transcripts have been altered to preserve the anonymity of the speakers and their acquaintances and the audio files have been filtered to make these portions of the recordings unrecognizable.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aDu Bois, John W.10aChafe, Wallace L.10aMeyer, Charles10aThompson, Sandra A.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2000S8501790nmm a22002893i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245006200141264007300203336003800276336003300314337002600347338003200373500001500405500004500420506005100465520066600516546004201182655002801224700003101252856014901283856006801432m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2000    pau        u        eng d  a15856317288 aLDC2000S868 aISLRN: 786-335-176-662-7  adc00a1998 HUB4 Broadcast News Evaluation English Test Material  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2000]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2000S86  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2000S861 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis publication contains the evaluation test material used in the 1998 DARPA/NIST Continuous Speech Recognition Broadcast News HUB4 English Benchmark Test administered by the NIST Spoken Natural Language Processing Group and produced by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), catalog number LDC2000S86, ISBN 1-58563-172-8. *Data* The test material is contained in two SPHERE-formatted waveform files.

The 62 data files presented in this corpus represent the audio of the daily broadcasts of 30-minute news programs. Due to technical limitations in the hardware at LDC that was used to receive the VOA broadcasts via a satellite downlink, a number of files contain brief portions where the audio signal was interrupted. These interruptions typically yielded regions of complete silence that lasted less than two seconds and were scattered sparsely throughout an affected audio file. Additional markup was provided in the transcription texts to isolate the regions where these interruptions occurred. The 62 audio files in this corpus are single-channel, 16 KHz, 16-bit linear SPHERE files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Czech.

The 2000 Speech in Noisy Environments Evaluation (SPINE1) is a first attempt to assess the state of the art and practice in speech recognition technology in noisy military environments and to exchange information on innovative speech recognition technology in the context of fully implemented systems that perform realistic tasks. It is intended to be of interest to all university, industrial and commercial speech system developers working on the problem of robust speech recognition. The evaluation gives participants the opportunity to participate in a flexible evaluation, suited to development needs and abilities. The SPINE1 evaluation focuses on the task of transcribing speech produced in noisy environments with emphasis on noisy military environments. The evaluation is designed to promote research progress in this area, to provide the opportunity for participants to try out new ideas for developing robust speech recognition systems that are of both scientific and practical interest, and to measure the performance of this technology. More information on this evaluation is available at SPINE1. This work was sponsored in part by National Science Foundation Grant No. IIS-9982201. *Data* The evaluation task is to transcribe speech produced in noisy environments. The training and test speech data to be used for this evaluation were generated by ARCON Corp. for the DoD Digital Voice Processing Consortium (DDVPC) under controlled conditions. The speech data consists of conversations between two communicators working on a collaborative, Battleship-like task in which they seek and shoot at targets (ARCON Communicability Exercise, ACE). Participants may talk freely, but the total vocabulary used is fairly limited.

Incoming data from the modem was spooled directly to a "raw collection" file on a daily basis and the raw files were then processed to produce the format for release by the LDC. There are approximately 143,137 articles this corpus. It is probable that there are duplicate articles in this corpus. We have taken steps to remove articles that were corrupted by failures or noise in modem transmission. The kinds of corruption that we were able to eliminate include truncated articles (a valid end-of-article sequence is not observed before a valid start-of-article) and invalid character codes within the text segment of articles. Some corruption may have occurred that did not produce these symptoms (e.g. service interruptions that might cause partial loss of data within or across articles or corruptions that garble the content but happen not to produce any invalid character codes). At present we have no means for detecting these more subtle problems in the data, but we expect that they are relatively infrequent. The format chosen for release consists of SGML tagging (since this gives a fairly simple and self-explanatory presentation of the data) and the KSC-5601 Korean character encoding.  aContent in Korean.

Each parallel file pair is named hklaws.nn.[ec] where: * nn = sequence number and * the file extensions, c = Cantonese and e = English Each files holds up to 2,000 sequentially numbered sentences tagged with a sentence index and sequence number as described below for a total of 37,807 sentence indices across all 19 file pairs. The sentence numbering spans the file pairs such that the initial sentence index (in files hklaws.01.e and hklaws.01.c) is 1, and the last sentence index (in files hklaws.19.e and hklaws.19.c) is 37807. The sentence numbering establishes the sentence parallelism two sentences having the same index and sequence number are purported to be parallel in content. Each sentence index may contain one or more sequentially numbered sentences, with corresponding files in English and Chinese containing the corresponding sets of sentences. The initial sequence number of each sentence is 1. The sentence sequence number plus the sentence index number is sufficient to uniquely identify parallel sentences. There are 313,659 sentences in the corpora. Each sentence is of the form:...... ...... where # represents a one to five digit sentence index or sequence number.

A companion corpus, Speech in Noisy Environments (SPINE) Training Audio, was also produced by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2000S87, ISBN 1-58563-173-6. These corpora support the 2000 Speech in Noisy Environments evaluation. For an example transcript, please click here. The 2000 Speech in Noisy Environments Evaluation (SPINE1) is a first attempt to assess the state of the art and practice in speech recognition technology in noisy military environments and to exchange information on innovative speech recognition technology in the context of fully implemented systems that perform realistic tasks. It is intended to be of interest to all university, industrial and commercial speech system developers working on the problem of robust speech recognition. The evaluation gives participants the opportunity to participate in a flexible evaluation, suited to development needs and abilities. The SPINE1 evaluation focuses on the task of transcribing speech produced in noisy environments with the emphasis on speech produced in noisy military environments. The evaluation is designed to promote research progress in this area, to provide the opportunity for participants to try out new ideas for developing robust speech recognition systems that are of both scientific and practical interest, and to measure the performance of this technology. More information on this evaluation is available at SPINE1. This work was sponsored in part by National Science Foundation Grant No. IIS-9982201. Corresponding Audio is available as Speech in Noisy Environments (SPINE) Training Audio (LDC2000S87) *Data* The evaluation task is to transcribe speech produced in noisy environments. The training and test speech data to be used for this evaluation were generated by ARCON Corp. for the DoD Digital Voice Processing Consortium (DDVPC) under controlled conditions. The speech data consists of conversations between two communicators working on a collaborative, Battleship-like task in which they seek and shoot at targets (ARCON Communicability Exercise, ACE). Participants may talk freely, but the total vocabulary used is fairly limited. Each person is seated in a sound chamber in which a previously recorded military background noise environment is accurately reproduced. The participants use handsets and transmission channels that are resident to the particular environment. The training data includes 10 of 20 available talker pairs with 14 five-minute conversations per talker pair (about 720 minutes total) available, which include four noise scenarios.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aSchmidt-Nielsen, Astrid, 1941-10aMarsh, Elaine10aCieri, Christopher10aStrassel, Stephanie10aRennert, Kara403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2000T4903128nmm a22003133i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041002800152042000700180245003700187264007300224336003800297336002600335337002600361338003200387500001500419500004500434506005100479520197000530546006202500655002002562700001502582856014902597856006802746m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2000    pau        u        eng d  a15856317528 aLDC2000T508 aISLRN: 272-276-125-586-50 aengachibeng07aengazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aHong Kong Hansards Parallel Text  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2000]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2000T50  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2000T501 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aHong Kong Hansards Parallel Text was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and contains excerpts from the Official Record of Proceedings of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) from October 1995 to April 2000. LDC thanks the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China for granting permission to distribute this data to the research community. The Legislative Council normally meets every Wednesday afternoon in the Chamber of the Legislative Council Building. Business includes: discussion of subsidiary legislation, papers, reports, addresses, statements, questions, the three readings of bills, motions and debates. From time to time, the Chief Executive attends a special Council meeting to brief Members on policy issues and to answer questions from Members. All Council meetings are open to the public. The proceedings of the meetings are recorded verbatim in the Official Record of Proceedings of the Legislative Council (Hansard). The record of proceedings is in the original language delivered by the speakers (Floor Version). They are then translated into English and Chinese versions separately. *Data* This corpus contains excerpts from the official record of meetings from October 1995 to April 2000. There are 11.9 million English words and 18.15 million Chinese characters in this release. Chinese text is presented in the traditional script and encoded as BIG5. There are 388 files in the data/ subdirectory of this corpus, half (194 files) in English in the data/english/ subdirectory and half (194 files) in Chinese in the data/chinese/ subdirectory.

The transcripts in this release correspond to Voice of America (VOA) Czech Broadcast News Audio (LDC2000S89). Support for this work was provided by the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic (Grant No. VS97159); by the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic (Project ME293); and by the NSF Language Engineering Workshop at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD USA (NSF Grant No. IIS-9820687). *Data* Between February 9 and May 28, 1999, the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) collected approximately 30 hours of Czech broadcast audio from the Voice of America news service. The 62 data files presented in this corpus represent the transcripts of the daily broadcasts of 30-minute news programs. The transcriptions were created by native Czech speakers, Pavel Ircing, Jindrich Matousek, Ludek Muller, and Vlasta Radova, working at the Department of Cybernetics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen under the direction of Josef Psutka. They used transcription software provided by LDC (the "Transcriber" package), developed by Eduoard Geoffrois and Claude Barras at DGA, France, with assistance from Zhibiao Wu at LDC. The version of Transcriber used for this project produced a text file format which is no longer supported by the software; also, the format does not resemble any previous transcription format published by LDC. Therefore, the files in this release have been converted into an SGML format that has been used for other broadcast news transcription corpora, specifcally, the the "Universal Transcription Format" (UTF -- not to be confused with the "Unicode Transformation Formats") defined by the speech group at NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). A description of that format is provided in the "utf.ps" (Postscript) and "utf.pdf" (Adobe Acrobat) files, and the formal SGML definition is provided in "utf.dtd," all in the release "doc" directory. The transcription text is rendered using the ISO 8859-2 character set. Information relating this character set to the Unicode standard is available at this site and from the Unicode Consortium. Due to technical limitations in the hardware at LDC that was used to receive the VOA broadcasts via a satellite downlink, a number of files contain brief portions where the audio signal was interrupted. These interruptions typically yielded regions of complete silence that lasted less than two seconds and were scattered sparsely throughout an affected audio file. Additional markup was provided in the transcription texts to isolate the regions where these interruptions occurred.

The 2000 Speech in Noisy Environments Evaluation (SPINE1) is a first attempt to assess the state of the art and practice in speech recognition technology in noisy military environments and to exchange information on innovative speech recognition technology in the context of fully implemented systems that perform realistic tasks. It is intended to be of interest to all university, industrial and commercial speech system developers working on the problem of robust speech recognition. The evaluation gives participants the opportunity to participate in a flexible evaluation, suited to development needs and abilities. This work was sponsored in part by National Science Foundation Grant No. IIS-9982201. *Data* The SPINE1 evaluation focuses on the task of transcribing speech produced in noisy environments with the emphasis on speech produced in noisy military environments. The evaluation is designed to promote research progress in this area, to provide the opportunity for participants to try out new ideas for developing robust speech recognition systems that are of both scientific and practical interest, and to measure the performance of this technology. More information on this evaluation is available at SPINE1. The evaluation task is to transcribe speech produced in noisy environments. The training and test speech data to be used for this evaluation were generated by ARCON Corp. for the DoD Digital Voice Processing Consortium (DDVPC) under controlled conditions. The speech data consists of conversations between two communicators working on a collaborative, Battleship-like task in which they seek and shoot at targets (ARCON Communicability Exercise, ACE). Participants may talk freely, but the total vocabulary used is fairly limited. Each person is seated in a sound chamber in which a previously recorded military background noise environment is accurately reproduced. The participants use handsets and transmission channels that are resident to the particular environment. The evaluation data includes 20 talker-pairs, with six five-minutes conversations per talker-pair (about 600 minutes total), from a set of four scenarios  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aSchmidt-Nielsen, Astrid, 1941-10aMarsh, Elaine10aCieri, Christopher10aStrassel, Stephanie10aRennert, Kara403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2000T5403602nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245005500141264007300196336003800269336003300307337002600340338003200366500001500398500004500413506005100458520215900509546004202668655002802710700003502738700001802773700001902791700001902810700002302829700002002852700002302872700002402895700001902919700001702938700002002955856014902975856006803124m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2001    pau        u        eng d  a15856320668 aLDC2001S048 aISLRN: 275-012-111-000-7  adc00aSpeech in Noisy Environments (SPINE2) Part 1 Audio  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2001]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2001S04  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2001S041 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis corpus was used as part of the training set for the Second Speech in Noisy Environments Evaluation (SPINE2).

The Switchboard cellular collection focused primarily on GSM cellular phone technology. The project's goal was to target 190 subjects balanced by gender and under varied environmental conditions to participate in (10+) five to six minute conversations on GSM cellular phones. The speech data was collected for research, development, and evaluation of automatic systems for speech-to-text conversion, talker identification, language identification and speech signal detection purposes. During the study period, LDC collected a total of 1,309 calls, or 2,618 sides (1,957 GSM), from 254 participants (129 male speakers, 125 female speakers) under varied environmental conditions. *Data* This release contains speech data files with documentation describing speaker information (sex, age, education, city and state where raised), call information (date, time, call duration, Personal Identification Numbers, topic) and audit information (channel quality, background noise). The data files are not compressed. The documentation also contains reports on clipped files. Each speech file consists of a 1,024-byte ASCII-formatted Sphere header, followed by two-channel interleaved mu-law sample data. The mu-law samples represent the actual digital data transmission from the telephone service provider (MCI), as captured separately for each side of the telephone conversation by LDC's telephone collection platform. The header also indicates the caller_pin, callee_pin, topic_id, cellular service/handset information and speaker demographic information.

FORM is a gesture annotation scheme designed to capture the kinematic information in gesture from videos of speakers. This publication is a detailed database of gesture-annotated videos stored in the Anvil and FORM file formats. FORM encodes the "phonetics" of gesture by giving geometric descriptions of location and movement of the right and left arms. Other kinematic information such as effort and shape are also recorded. FORM gesture data has applications in statistical natural language processsing, gesture recognition and generation, information extraction from video, and human-computer interaction. Please go to the FORM website for more information. The FORM2 publication was released in 2003 by the LDC and encoded much of the same data provided here using a more recent tag set. *Data* This publication contains gesture annotations created using the FORM 1.0 tag set. The Anvil annotation files used in their creation are also included, as are 29.5 minutes of the original audio and video recordings excerpted from a lecture given by Brian MacWhinney on January 24, 2000 at Carnegie Mellon University. A second data set, with 5.5 minutes of Paul Howard telling a story in conversation while being motion captured, is also supplied. These video recordings were chosen because they are part of the NSF-funded TalkBank project. There are a total of 69 data files: 21 movie (.mov) files, 24 Anvil (.anvil) files, and 24 FORM (.form1) files. The movie files are in Quicktime format with the following specs: Size 360 x 240 pixels Compression H.261 Video rate 29.97 fps Audio rate 48 kHz Audio format 8-bit/16-bit stereo Anvil files can be opened using the Anvil video annotation tool, which is freely available from Michael Kipp. The .form file format is an intermediate data format that contains only the FORM2 values from each .anvil in a comma-delimited, frame-by-frame listing of the following form: frame,upper_arm_lift,forearm_orientation,handshape,wrist_up_down,wrist_side_side,effort,tension *Sponsorship* This research was conducted using funding from the following grant sources: ISLE - 9910603 NSF: TalkBank (via subcontract from Carnegie Mellon University) - BCS-998009 and BCS-9978056 NSF: Discourse and Gesture w/ Joshi, Liberman, and Martell - EIA98-09209  aContent and documentation in English.7 aVideo recordings2lcgft10aMartell, Craig10aOsborn, Chris10aBritt, Lisa10aMyers, Kari403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004V0104302nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245006100177264007300238336003800311336002600349337002600375338003200401500001500433500004500448506005100493520284600544520005103390546005403441650006403495650002903559650003203588650003403620655002003654700003703674856014903711856006803860m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2006    pau        u        ara d  a15856340188 aLDC2006T158 aISLRN: 647-896-139-023-90 aarabeng07aafbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aGulf Arabic Conversational Telephone Speech, Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2006]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2006T15  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T151 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGulf Arabic Conversational Telephone Speech, Transcripts is a database containing transcripts of 975 Gulf Arabic speakers taking part in spontaneous telephone conversations in Colloquial Gulf Arabic. A total of 976 conversation sides are provided (one speaker appears on two distinct calls). The average duration per side is about 5.7 minutes. The data was collected and transcribed in 2004 by Appen Pty Ltd., Sydney, Australia. Each transcript file is a tab-delimited flat table, where each line contains information and text for a single contiguous utterance, presented via the following fields: * beginning time stamp in seconds, in square brackets ("[5.7189]") * ending time stampe in seconds, in square brackets * channel/speaker-ID ("A:" or "B:") * "consonant skeleton" orthography for the utterance, in UTF-8 * "diacritized" orthography for the utterance, in ASCII The ASCII field is the Buckwalter transliteration of the fully "vowelized" (pronunciation) form of the utterance. Within fields 4 and 5, word boundaries are marked by space characters in the normal way, following common practices of Arabic orthographic convention (e.g. all definite articles and many conjunctions and prepositions are attached as prefixes to the following word). Transcript tokens enclosed in single parentheses -- e.g. "(DHk)" -- represent annotation marks for non-speech events or conditions, such as laughter, noise, etc. Multi-token strings within single parentheses involve words in some other language (typically English) or some other Arabic dialect. Double parentheses, either with or without tokens enclosed within them -- e.g. "(())", "((word))" or "((word1 word2))" -- represent regions where the transcriber was unable to tell for sure what was said. The "consonant skeleton" orthography is intended to reflect common orthographic practice in written Arabic (i.e. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)), but without being bound strictly by the specific spellings of MSA words. That is, there may be novel (dialect-specific) words and changes of consonant quality (hence altered spelling) in words that are cognate between MSA and Gulf Arabic. The "vowelized" orthography is restricted to a character set that allows words to be rendered coherently in Arabic script (with all diacritics present as needed to represent short vowels, etc), but is intended to reflect the perceived pronunciation of each token. As a result, a given word (type), having a multiple occurrences in the text with identical "skeletal" spellings, may have multiple distinct "vowelized" spellings. In some cases, these different spellings simply reflect pronunciation variants, while in other cases, they represent distinct morphological forms (with distinct contextual meanings) where the semantic differences are conveyed solely by the the short vowels (i.e. the diacritics).  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Gulf Arabic.

The TDT3 corpus was created to support three TDT3 tasks: find topically homogeneous sections (segmentation), detect the occurrence of new events (detection), and track the reoccurrence of old or new events (tracking). The goal of Topic Detection and Tracking - Phase 3 (TDT3) is to create core technology to monitor multiple streams of news in multiple languages and media (newswire, radio, television, web sites or some future combination or innovation), segmenting the streams into individual stories, detecting new topics and tracking all stories discussing them. In additional to the TDT2 tasks of segmentation, detection and tracking, TDT3 adds the tasks of first story detection and story-link detection. The goal of the latter is to detect links between stories that discuss the same topic even though the topic has not been defined in advance. *Data* The TDT3 English Audio Corpus contains the audio (in compressed sphere format) of news broadcasts collected daily from six news sources in American English, over a three-month collection period (October - December 1998). The sources and amounts are as follows: Sources Hours CDs ------------------------------------------------------------------ CNN_HDL Cable News Network, "Headline News" 174.6 19 ABC_WNT American Broadcasting Co., "World News Tonight" 38.6 5 NBC_NNW National Broadcasting Co., "NBC Nightly News" 44.6 6 MNB_NBW MS-NBC, "News with Brian Williams" 51.8 6 PRI_TWD Public Radio International, "The World" 63.9 7 VOA_ENG Voice of America, English news programs 102.2 12 Total 475.7 55 The files in this publication are complete single-channel recordings of the (30 or 60-minute) broadcasts listed above. Each one has been digitized at a sample rate of 16 KHz using 16-bit samples, and compressed using the "shorten" algorithm. (The audio CD-ROMs are grouped into subsets by broadcast source and the LDC will support the option of purchasing one or more subsets, e.g. just the ABC data. We regret that we cannot provide "customized" subsets.)

In the 1990s, the MUC evaluations funded the development of metrics and statistical algorithms to support government evaluations of emerging information extraction technologies. Additional information from NIST can be found here. *Data* The following list shows the correspondence between versions of the IE task definition and stages of the MUC-7 evaluation. Version #Stage 4.1 training and dryrun 4.2 formalrun 5.1 final The dryrun and formalrun have different domains; the dryrun (and training) consists of aircrashes scenarios and the formalrun consists of missile launches scenarios. The final version updates especially the Template Relations portion of the guidelines. Normally, for each scenario, two datasets are provided: training and test. When the evaluation cycle begins, the label for the scenario dataset is training. Then the corresponding test dataset for that same scenario is used for the dryrun testing. For the formal run, a formal training set is given out four weeks before the test answers are due. The formal test is given out one week before the test answers are due. After the entire evaluation and meeting have been held, final edits are made if necessary.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aChinchor, Nancy403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2001T0203558nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245006100141264007300202336003800275336002600313337002600339338003200365500001500397500004500412506005100457520212400508546004202632655002002674700001902694700002302713700002002736700003502756700001802791700001902809700002302828700002402851700001902875700001702894700002002911856014902931856006803080m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2001    pau        u        eng d  a15856320748 aLDC2001T058 aISLRN: 525-834-904-967-7  adc00aSpeech in Noisy Environments (SPINE2) Part 1 Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2001]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2001T05  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2001T051 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis corpus was used as part of the training set for the Second Speech in Noisy Environments Evaluation (SPINE2).

Hajicova. Dependency-Based Underlying-Structure Tagging of a Very Large Czech Corpus) Since a group of Czech linguists (Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Institute of Theoretical and Computational Linguistcs) from Charles University in Prague and Masaryk University in Brno first formulated the Czech National Corpus, it has been quite clear to all of us that for the outcome of our project to have broader relevance and multifaceted usage, we cannot confine ourselves to a mere compilation of a very large corpus of Czech texts. We have been aware that in order to make the corpus really useful for future users -- be they linguists or developers of natural language processing systems of any kind -- we have to design annotation schemes and develop tools that will allow us to add as much linguistic information as possible. Having the advantage of a long and fruitful tradition of theoretical and computational linguistics and inspired by the research resulting in the Penn Treebank, the project group decided to build the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT). *Data* The following three points are characteristic for the theory underlying the PDT, fully visible at the highest, tectogrammatical level: (i) Its theoretical background is a dependency-based syntax (handling the sentence structure as concentrated around the verb and its valency, but containing a further dimension, namely coordination). Among the reasons for the choice of a dependency-based syntax, we primarily stress its relative economy and perspicuous, immediate correspondence to the empirical data. (ii) The nodes of the dependency tree (more precisely, of a multidimensional network) are labeled by complex symbols consisting of lexical, morphological and syntactic parts. Thus, the label of every node contains symbols expressing all of the information contained in the grammatical position of this word and is relevant for a semantic (semantico-pragmatic) interpretation. This makes the output representations, or the trees of our treebank, not only useful for practical applications such as parsing, but also for its inclusion into an integrated theoretical description encompassing all layers from the outer (phonetic or graphemic) shape of the sentence to its semantico-pragmatic representation, be it in the form of truth-conditionally based intensional semantics or in that of a framework paying more attention to the embedding of the sentence in context. (iii) The dependency tree is understood as projective. Its relationships to the morphemic representation of the sentence (a string of symbols, the order of which corresponds to the surface word order) are handled by means of specific rules. Prague Dependency Treebank as a project The Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) is a long-term project with two major phases. In the first phase (1996-2000), the morphological and syntactic analytic layers of annotation have been completed and made together with the preview of tectogrammatical layer annotation available as PDT 1.0. During the second phase (2000 - 2004, Center for Computational Linguistics), the tectogrammatical layer of annotation will proceed and the PDT 2.0 will be available upon completion. The structure of the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) corresponds to a three-layer structure annotated corpus of Czech as a representative of inflectionally rich, free word-order languages: * Morphological layer (lowest) - Full morphological annotation * Analytic layer (middle) - Superficial (surface) syntactic annotation using dependency treebank with a level conceptually close to the syntactic annotation used in the Penn Treebank * Tectogrammatical layer (highest) - Level of linguistic meaning Text Sources The electronic text sources have been provided by the Institute of the Czech National Corpus.The text material contains samples from the following sources: * Lidové Noviny (daily newspapers), 1991, 1994, 1995 * Mladá fronta Dnes (daily newspapers), 1992 * Ceskomoravský Profit (business weekly), 1994 * Vesmír (scientific magazine), Academia Publishers, 1992, 1993 There is also a parallel Czech English corpus. Drawn from Readers Digest 1993-1996, it consists of 450 articles, 53,117 parallel sentences, 1,010,346 English tokens and 877,658 Czech tokens Inner format of PDT There are two internal formats employed in PDT: FS and CSTS. The former is an older format, still heavily used by some treebank tools. The latter, more general SGML-based encoding, is meant as the main PDT format (in the future, it will be followed by an XML version, probably already for PDT 2.0). See the description of the FS file format and documentation of the CSTS document type definition (csts.dtd). Prague Dependency Treebank Version 1.0 PDT 0.5 (half through) was released in 1998 and contains 456,705 tokens (words and punctuation) in 26,610 sentences. PDT 1.0 contains about three times more tokens and sentences than PDT 0.5. It is completely manually-annotated on the morphological and analytical levels and includes a preview of tectogrammatically annotated data as well. Future The Prague Dependency Treebank Version 2.0 will add the tectogrammatical layer of annotation to PDT 1.0. It will be available with a reduced amount of data as preliminary Version 1.5 during 2002. The final data volume will be reached at the end of 2004.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Parallel aligned treebanks are treebanks annotated with morphological and syntactic structures aligned at the sentence level and the sub-sentence level. Such data sets are useful for natural language processing and related fields, including automatic word alignment system training and evaluation, transfer-rule extraction, word sense disambiguation, translation lexicon extraction and cultural heritage and cross-linguistic studies. With respect to machine translation system development, parallel aligned treebanks may improve system performance with enhanced syntactic parsers, better rules and knowledge about language pairs and reduced word error rate. In this release, the source Arabic data was translated into English. Arabic and English treebank annotations were performed independently. The parallel texts were then word aligned. The material in this corpus corresponds to a portion of the Arabic treebanked data in Arabic Treebank - Broadcast News v1.0 (LDC2012T07). *Data* The source data consists of Arabic broadcast news programming collected by LDC in 2005 and 2006 from Alhurra, Aljazeera and Dubai TV. All data is encoded as UTF-8. A count of files, words, tokens and segments is below. Language Files Words Tokens Segments Arabic 28 89,213 115,826 4,824 Note: Word count is based on the untokenized Arabic source. Token count is based on the ATB-tokenized Arabic source. The purpose of the GALE word alignment task was to find correspondences between words, phrases or groups of words in a set of parallel texts. Arabic-English word alignment annotation consisted of the following tasks: * Identifying different types of links: translated (correct or incorrect) and not translated (correct or incorrect) * Identifying sentence segments not suitable for annotation, e.g., blank segments, incorrectly-segmented segments, segments with foreign languages * Tagging unmatched words attached to other words or phrases This release contains four types of files - raw, tokenized, treebank, and wa. The raw format contains the original Arabic and English sentences without any annotation. The tokenized format is the treebank tokenized version of the raw data which may contain Empty Category tokens (treebank leaves that have the POS label -NONE-). The treebank and wa files are treebank and word alignment annotations on the tokenized files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Standard Arabic, and Arabic.

The Chinese Penn Treebank Project started in Summer 1998. The goal is the creation of a 100,000 word corpus of Chinese with syntactic bracketing. More information is available at The Chinese Treebank Project. Chinese Treebank 2.0 supersedes and replaces the Chinese Penn Treebank Final Release (LDC2000T48 ISBN 1-58563-187-6). *Data* Size: About 100K words, 325 data files Source: 325 articles from Xinhua newswire between 1994 and 1998 Coding: GB code Format: Same as the UPenn English Treebank except that we keep some original file information was retained such as "SRCID" and "DATE" in the data file. Annotation: All the files are annotated at least twice, the first-pass is done by one annotator, and the resulting files are checked by the second annotator (second-pass). SGML: All data files validate against chtb.dtd using nsmls. The files are located in the data subdirectory and are sequentially named as follows: chtb_nnn.fid where nnn is the sequential file number. There is a cross reference in file.tbl which provides some annotator and historical information.

The data used in this study came from three other LDC corpora, the CALLHOME Spanish Speech corpus, the CALLHOME Spanish Transcripts, and the CALLHOME Spanish Lexicon. It is a well-known fact that syllable-final /s/ is subject to lenition in many Latin American Spanish dialects. Lenition of -/s/ is a variable phonological process in which an -/s /may be aspirated (pronounced [h]) or deleted altogether. Lenition of -/s/ has been widely studied by sociolinguists, who have identified various linguistic and extralinguistic factors that favor the process. Since syllable-final /s /is frequent in Spanish, lenition has a great effect on overall pronunciation. *Data* Please see file.tbl for the directory structure of this publication, as well as a complete list of files. The primary data file consists of data stored in the following fields: * Token id * Code * Confidence level * Speaker id * Header of the line in the transcript * Words from the transcript * Location of word in the speakers turn * Location of /s/ in the word * Preceding segment * Following segment * Word stress pattern * Following word stress pattern * Word start time * Word end time * Length of pause following word * Coder * Speakers dialect * Speakers sex * Speakers age * Corrected following word * Comment * Morphological information There are on the order of 3,000 - 4,000 missing occurences of syllable-final /s/ encodings. These omissions occur for two main reasons: changes in the transcriptions after the list of all of the syllable-final /s/ were generated, and the failure of some transcript lines to be automatically aligned. For a more detailed description of this publication see the researchers description in HTML or Microsoft Word format.  aContent in Spanish.

The goal of CLARITY was to glean discourse information from unrestricted conversational speech using shallow, corpus-based analysis. The annotation was carried out at Interactive Systems Labs at Carnegie Mellon University. *Data* This publication used a three-level coding scheme to manually tag the LDC CALLHOME Spanish Transcripts. The three levels of the coding scheme are: * a dialogue act level consisting of a tag set extended from DAMSL and Switchboard; * a dialogue game level featuring short sequences of dialogue acts * a genre level similiar to topical segments. All available (120) dialogues have been annotated. Dialogue games are short sequences of dialogue acts such as question/answer pairs. Genres can be storytelling, discussion, planning, etc. Segmentation takes topics into account as well. Genres, games, and dialogue acts are annotated by type. Genres are additionally annotated for activities and topics (on a 0-5 scale), for the central object or person being discussed (who or what category), and contain a short synopsis of the segment. All available 120 CALLHOME Spanish dialogues have been annotated. The dialogue act annotation scheme is a further development of the SwitchBoard DAMSL tagset. Dialogue games are short sequences of dialogue acts such as question/answer pairs. Genres can be storytelling, discussion, planning etc. and the segmentation takes topic into account as well. Genres, games and dialogue acts are annotated for their type. Genres are additionally annotated for activities and topics (on a 0-5 scale), for the central object or person being discussed (who or what category) and contain a short gist of the segment. An example of the tagging from one conversation is presented below. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?> Sm, eso es para eso, de seguro. No importa. No importa.

CETEMPublico Version 1.7 contains 1,504,258 extracts (CETEMPublico Version 1.0 had 1,567,625). Version 1.7 was created in Oslo on August 6, 2001 and uses SGML tagging. The corpus is in 196 compressed text files, with names in the form cetemXXX.gz, from cetem001.gz to cetem196.gz. This corpus was designed to assist researchers who develop computer programs processing the Portuguese language and who would need raw material for their work. In addition, the authors wished for the corpus to be useful to everyone who studies the Portuguese language and wishes to verify their hypotheses in previously organized text material. The online and the CQP versions are meant for such users, who are, in any case, also welcome to get it on CD in order to process the corpus locally, possibly by means of the corpus processing system of their choice.

In 1999, responding to urgent demand for a Chinese-English bilingual wordlist to support various projects, LDC quickly solicited entries from both in-house and Internet resources and compiled two versions of Chinese-English wordlists, "ldc_ce_dict.1.0.gb" (henceforth Version 1) and "ldc_ce_dict.2.0.txt" (henceforth Version 2). Version 1, with 24,298 entries, was relatively small and its coverage was unbalanced. Version 2, created as an experiment, is impractical for translingual information processing. Many of its entries were created by reversing source and target language fields in various English-to-Chinese wordlists; as a result many entries are not really words. The increasing demand for richer lexical resources led to the present release, "ldc_cedict.gb.Version 3" (henceforth Version 3). *Data* What's New in Version 3 The total number of Chinese headwords in this release is 54,170. In terms of coverage, Version 3 is a superset of Version 1 and the LDC's Mandarin pronunciation lexicon (Version 3/Version 4). The pronunciation lexicon has a total of 44,404 entries, or 43,968 unique Chinese character strings (i.e. with pronunciation removed). There are still 553 entries from the pronunciation lexicon not found in Version 3. We were unable to provide accurate translations for these head words for various reasons: they may be very technical; they don't make sense unless their source is re-examined; they may have segmentation errors; or they may be rare words for which appropriate translations could not be found due to limited time and resources. Version 3 also left out less than 40 entries from Version 1. Most of these are rare single-character words whose translations cannot be verified for accuracy. *Format* There is one data file, the lexicon itself. Within the lexicon, each entry is in this format: head_word_in_Chinese_characters /gloss 1/gloss 2/.../gloss n/ For example: ººÓï /Chinese language/Chinese/ Ó¢ÎÄ /English language/English/ (A Chinese-capable browser is needed to see this properly.

West Point Arabic Speech contains speech data that was collected and processed by members of the Department of Foreign languages at the United States Military Academy at West Point and the Center For Technology Enhanced Language Learning (CTELL) as part of an effort called "Project Santiago." The original purpose of this corpus was to train acoustic models for automatic speech recognition that could be used as an aid in teaching Arabic to West Point cadets. *Data* The corpus consists of 8,516 speech files, totaling 1.7 gigabytes or 11.42 hours of speech data. Each speech file represents one person reciting one prompt from one of four prompt scripts. The utterances were recorded using a Shure SM10A microphone and a RANE Model MS1 pre-amplifier. The files were recorded as 16-bit PCM low-byte-first ("little-endian") raw audio files, with a sampling rate of 22.05 KHz. They were then converted to NIST sphere format. Approximately 7,200 of the recordings are from native informants and 1200 files are from non-native informants. The following tables show the breakdown of corpus content in terms of male, female, native and non-native speakers. number of speakers male female total native: 41 34 75 non-native: 25 10 35 totals: 66 44 110 hours of data male female total native: 6.0 4.4 10.4 non-native: 0.74 0.28 1.02 totals: 6.74 4.68 11.42 megabytes of data male female total native: 918 667 1585 non-native: 111.9 42.8 154.7 totals: 1029.9 709.8 1739.7 number of speech files male female total native: 4107 3163 7270 non-native: 883 363 1246 totals: 4990 3526 8516 Some of the recording sessions include a handful of utterances that were cut short due to pronunciation mistakes or unexpected interruptions (e.g. phones ringing, doors slamming, etc). These partial utterances have been retained in the waveform directories and are distinguished from the full-sentence recordings by having a trailing "-u" in the filename, before the extension (e.g. "s1_080-u.sph" instead of "s1_080.sph"). The above tables describe all data; both the complete and partial utterances are accounted for. 168 of the 8,516 speech files are partial utterances, and the remaining 8,348 are complete.  aContent in Arabic.

This release contains speech data files ONLY, along with documentation describing speaker information (sex, age, education, city and state where raised), call information (date, time, call duration, Personal Identification Numbers, topic), and audit information (channel quality, background noise). The data files are not compressed. The Switchboard-2 Phase III collection was focused primarily in the American South. The collection commenced on October 21, 1997 and was completed on January 1, 1998. The project's goal was to target native speakers of English in the American South, balanced by gender, to participate in (10+) five to six minute conversations on a variety of telephone (land line) handsets. *Data* The speech data was collected for research, development, and evaluation of automatic systems for speech-to-text conversion, talker identification, language identification and speech signal detection purposes. During the collection period, the LDC collected a total of 2,728 calls, or 5,456 sides, from 640 participants (292 Male, 348 Female), under varied environmental conditions. Each speech file consists of a 1,024-byte ASCII-formatted Sphere header, followed by two-channel interleaved mu-law sample data. The mu-law samples represent the actual digital data transmission from the telephone service provider (MCI), as captured separately for each side of the telephone conversation by the LDC's telephone collection platform. The header also indicates the caller_pin, callee_pin, topic_id. The speech files are named according to the following pattern: sw_NNNNN.sph where the five-digit string "NNNNN" represents the conversation-id; this string is used to identify all speech files and to identify the calls in the associated data base tables that provide information about the calls and participants (i.e. callstat.tbl, master.tbl). Other documentation files available on the publication are: 0readme.1st Field information for all database tables swb_callaudit.tbl Audit results for each channel swb_callaudit.txt Document describing audit table swb_callstats.tbl Information about recorded calls swb_callstats.txt Document describing callstats table swb_callsubjects.tbl Demographic information swb_callsubjects.txt Document describing callsubjects table topics.txt List of proposed call topics There are a total of 2,657 data files (=~ 222 hours of audio)  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGraff, David10aMiller, Dave, 1960-10aWalker, Kevin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S0602703nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245004000141264007300181336003800254336003300292337002600325338003200351500001500383500004500398506005100443520153800494520005102032546004202083655002802125700003102153856014902184856006802333m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2002    pau        u        eng d  a15856322528 aLDC2002S098 aISLRN: 650-378-591-541-7  adc00a2000 HUB5 English Evaluation Speech  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2002]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2002S09  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S091 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  a2000 HUB5 English Evaluation was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and consists of English conversational telephone speech used in the 2000 HUB5 evaluation sponsored by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).

The 1997 HUB5 Non-English evaluation is part of an ongoing series of periodic evaluations conducted by NIST. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities. They are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of conversational speech recognition. To this end the evaluation was designed to be simple, to focus on core speech technology issues, to be fully supported, and to be accessible. The HUB5 Non-English evaluation, conducted in the fall of 1997, complemented another related evaluation which was conducted in the spring. The spring evaluation focuses on the recognition of conversational speech in English. This evaluation is dedicated to the advancement of speech recognition technology for languages other than English; specifically for Arabic, German, Mandarin, and Spanish. It focuses also on issues related to porting recognition technology to new languages, to system generality, and to language commonalties and universals. The HUB5 Non-English evaluation focuses on the task of transcribing conversational speech into text. This task is posed in the context of conversational telephone speech in Arabic, German, Mandarin, and Spanish. The evaluation is designed to foster research progress, with the goals of: * exploring promising new ideas in the recognition of conversational speech * developing advanced technology incorporating these ideas, and * measuring the performance of this technology The task is to transcribe conversational speech. The speech to be transcribed is presented as a set of conversations collected over the telephone. Each conversation is represented as a "4-wire" recording, that is with two distinct sides, one from each end of the telephone circuit. Each side is recorded and stored as a standard telephone codec signal (8 kHz sampling, 8-bit mu-law encoding). Each conversation is represented as a sequence of "turns," where each turn is the period of time when one speaker is speaking. Each successive turn results from a reversal of speaking and listening roles for the conversation participants. The transcription task is to produce the correct transcription for each of the specified turns. The beginning and ending times of each of these turns will be supplied as side information to the system under test. This turn information will be supplied in NDX format, with one NDX file for all conversations to be transcribed. (Note that the turns are not necessarily a simple sequence of non-overlapping time intervals. They may be overlapping or non-alternating from time to time, because there is no sequencing constraint on conversational interaction.) Additional documentation is available at the 1997 NIST Evaluation Plan for Recognition of Conversational Speech Over the Telephone website. *Data* This publication contains 20 sphere files encoded in two channel interleaved mulaw with a sampling rate of 8 KHz, for a total of 424,160,000 bytes (405 Mbytes) of sphere data.

The recordings consist of professional actors reading a series of semantically neutral utterances (dates and numbers) spanning fourteen distinct emotional categories, selected after Banse & Scherers study of vocal emotional expression in German. (Banse, R. & Scherer, K. R. 1996. Acoustic profiles in vocal emotion expression. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70, 614-636.) Actor participants were provided with descriptions of each emotional context, including situational examples adapted from those used in the original German study. Flashcards were used to display series of four-syllable dates and numbers to be uttered in the approriate emotional category. The Prosody Recordings Project was interested in capturing the aspects of speech (emotion, intonation) that are left out of the written form of a message. In these experiments, simple phrases are expressed in ways that reflect varied contexts. The same phrase might be used to answer different questions, address listeners at different distances from the speaker, or express different emotional states. Actors were used because they are experts at producing this kind of contextual variation in a natural and convincing way. *Data* There are 30 data files: 15 recordings in sphere format and their transcripts. The sphere files are encoded in two-channel interleaved 16-bit PCM, high-byte-first (big-endian) format, for a total of 2,912,067,980 bytes (2777 Mbytes) or nine hours of sphere data. The utterences were recorded directly into WAVES+ datafiles, on two channels with a sampling rate of 22.05K. The two microphones used were a stand-mounted boom Shure SN94 and a headset Seinnheiser HMD 410. The original session recordings are provided in their entirety, including informal chit-chat and discussion between each emotion category elicitation task. Time alignment is limited to utterances within the formal elicitation tasks and miscellanous regions have been marked as such.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aLiberman, Mark10aDavis, Kelly10aGrossman, Murray10aMartey, Nii O.10aBell, John403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S2802954nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245005200141264007300193336003800266336003300304337002600337338003200363500001500395500004500410506005100455520182100506546004202327655002802369700002002397700001802417856014902435856006802584m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2002    pau        u        eng d  a15856324148 aLDC2002S348 aISLRN: 176-469-534-264-7  adc00a2001 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2002]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2002S34  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S341 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe 2001 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Corpus was produced by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2002S34 and ISBN 1-58563-241-4. The 2001 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation is part of an ongoing series of yearly evaluations conducted by NIST. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities. They are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluation was designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported, and to be accessible. The corpus is based entirely on conversational cellular telephone speech collected by the LDC. Supporting documentation for this evaluation may be found on the 2001 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation website. Consult the NIST evaluation plan for detailed instructions on using this evaluation material. *Data* The files are divided into evaluation and development data. There are a total of 2,350 compressed speech files, all of which are in sphere format. The sphere files are compressed and encoded in one channel 8-bit mulaw, for a total of 575,337,198 bytes (548.7 Mbytes), or 26 hours of sphere data. The evaluation data is divided into evaluation training data and evaluation test data. The training data consists of 174 speech files that are two minutes long. The test data comprises 2,038 speech files of varying lengths not exceeding sixty seconds. The development data is similarly divided into development training data and development test data. The training data comprises 60 speech files with durations of two minutes per target speaker. The 78 development test data files contain segments of varying length not exceeding 60 seconds.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aPrzybocki, Mark10aMartin, Alvin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S3402497nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245002900141264007300170336003800243336003300281337002600314338003200340500001500372500004500387506005100432520122000483546004201703655002801745700003101773700002101804700002501825700001601850700001801866700001701884700001701901856014901918856006802067m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2002    pau        u        eng d  a15856324228 aLDC2002S358 aISLRN: 550-933-474-715-5  adc00aVoicemail Corpus Part II  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2002]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2002S35  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S351 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aVoicemail Corpus Part II was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2002S35 and ISBN 1-58563-242-2. Voicemail Corpus Part II is a continuation of Voicemail Corpus Part I, LDC98S77. *Data* This publication is comprised of speech and script files, and is structured in training and evaluation data. The training data consists of 2,048 voicemail messages and the corresponding script files. The speech and script files are organized in 41 directories, each of which contains up to 50 messages. The evaluation data consists of 50 voicemail messages and 50 scripts. The speech data is provided in sphere format it is sampled at 8 KHz, and recorded in 8-bit ulaw, totalling approximately 14 hours (406 MB) for training and 23 minutes (11 MB) for evaluation. In addition to the individual script files, there are three files which represent a concatenation of the individual scripts: train_scripts.all and eval_scripts .all represent a concatenation of the training and evaluation script files, one file per line, each line beginning with the fileID. eval_scripts_filtered.all is a filtered version of the file eval_scripts.all, after eliminating the tagged elements () and the proper nouns marker.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aPadmanabhan, Mukund, 1965-10aKingsbury, Brian10aRamabhadran, Bhuvana10aHuang, Jing10aChen, Stanley10aSaon, George10aMangu, Lidia403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S3502104nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245004700177264007300224336003800297336003300335337002600368338003200394500001500426500004500441506005100486520096200537546005801499655002801557856014901585856006801734m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2002    pau        u        ara d  a15856324308 aLDC2002S378 aISLRN: 710-821-044-437-40 aarabeng07aarzbeng2iso639-3  adc00aCALLHOME Egyptian Arabic Speech Supplement  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2002]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2002S37  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S371 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe CALLHOME Egyptian Arabic Speech Supplement was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), catalog number LDC2002S37 and ISBN 1-58563-243-0.

The original goals of the Communicator program were to support the creation of speech-enabled interfaces that scale gracefully across modalities, from speech-only to interfaces that include graphics, maps, pointing and gesture. The original vision of the Communicator systems included the ability of a user, during one 10-minute session, to plan a three-leg trip, with the three flights/legs on three different days, with rental car and hotel in each of the two "away" cities, plus dictating/sending a voice-mail message. The actual research that led to the data collections in 2000 and 2001 explored ways to construct better spoken-dialogue sys tems, with which users interact via speech-alone to perform relatively complex tasks such as travel planning. During 2000 and 2001 two large data sets were collected, in which users used the Communicator systems built by the research groups to do travel planning. The researchers improved their systems intensively during the ten months between the two data collections. This distribution consists of all the data from the 2000 collection. All the Communicator implementations used a common software architecture, called Galaxy-II, which was designed by a research team at MIT and adapted for Communicator in collaboration with a team at MITRE. The architecture supported detailed logging of the interaction between users a nd the systems. *Data* Nine sites participated in this project: ATT, BBN, Carnegie Mellon University, IBM, MIT, MITRE, NIST, SRI and University of Colorado at Boulder. In 2000, each user called the nine different automated travel-planning systems to make simulated flight reservations. The order in which the users encountered the systems was counterbalanced, for statistical analysis purposes. All aspects of the reservations were simulated in 2000. Each user was to make nine calls. The first seven calls had an assigned hypothetical travel task, which the user got via th e web. The last two calls asked the user to make simulated travel reservations for a trip that they might wish to take: they were asked to make travel plans for a vacation or pleasure trip on the eighth call and a business trip paid for by an employer on the ninth call. All audio files are in SPHERE format, recorded in 8-bit u-law and pcm, at 8 KHZ. The files consist of the sites' recordings and the NIST recordings. The sites' recordings are utterance level (one channel) while the NIST recordings are a continuous recording of the whole call (both channels: user and system). The two-channel sphere files total ~62 hours of audio (3415 MB), representing ~317K words in transcription. The caller side of the calls have had sample_checksums added to the files headers submitted by the sites.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aWalker, Marilyn10aAberdeen, John10aSanders, Greg403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S5603299nmm a22003373i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041002800152042000700180245004000187264007300227336003800300336002600338337002600364338003200390500001500422500004500437506005100482520205800533546007102591655002002662700001902682700001702701700002602718856014902744856006802893m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2002    pau        u        eng d  a15856321718 aLDC2002T018 aISLRN: 642-346-533-147-20 aengachibeng07aengacmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aMultiple-Translation Chinese Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2002]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2002T01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002T011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aMultiple-Translation Chinese Corpus was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and contains 17 human and machine tranlsations of Chinese newswire and broeadcast data. To support the development of automatic means for evaluating translation quality, LDC was sponsored to solicit 11 sets of human translations for a single set of Mandarin Chinese source materials. LDC was also asked to produce translations from various commercial machine translation (MT) systems as well as from MT systems available on the Internet. * Data* Three sources of journalistic Mandarin Chinese text were selected from existing LDC corpora: * Xinhua News Service: 52 news stories * Zaobao News Service: 27 news stories * Voice of America Mandarin broadcast transcripts: 26 news stories for a total of 105 stories. For an example of Mandarin Chinese Text please click on this example. For an example of English translation please click on this example. The Xinhua data were drawn from Chinese Treebank 2.0 (LDC2001T11); the file names and "doc_id" attributes assigned to these stories match the file names used in the Chinese Treebank release. The Zaobao and VOA data were both drawn from TDT3 Multilanguage Text Version 2.0 (LDC2001T58); their file names and "doc_id" attributes match the "DOCNO" tags assigned to these stories in the TDT3 release. Selection of stories from the two newswire collections was controlled by story length: all selected stories contain between about 340 and 400 Chinese characters. The selection from VOA broadcasts varied more widely, between 100 and 1,000 characters per story. The VOA Mandarin transcripts in TDT3 were created manually by a professional transcription service, but with limited editorial quality control -- while generally quite complete, these transcripts were not expected to exceed the quality or accuracy of closed-caption text in television broadcasts. Zaobao is a news portal from Singapore and many of its news stories are translations from other news agencies' releases. There are a total of 1,890 data files.  aContent in English and Mandarin Chinese.

It consists of 385 Wall Street Journal articles from the Penn Treebank annotated with discourse structure in the RST framework along with human-generated extracts and abstracts associated with the source documents. In the RST framework (Mann and Thompson, 1988), a text's discourse structure can be represented as a tree in four aspects: (1) the leaves correspond to text fragments called elementary discourse units (the mininal discourse units); (2) the internal nodes of the tree correspond to contiguous text spans; (3) each node is characterized by its nuclearity, or essential unit of information; and (4) each node is also characterized by a rhetorical relation between two or more non-overlapping, adjacent text spans. *Data* The data in this release is divided into a training set (347 documents) and a test set (38 documents). All annotations were produced using a discourse annotation tool that can be downloaded from http://www.isi.edu/~marcu/discourse. Human-generated material in the corpus includes (1) long and short abstracts for 30 documents that were intended to convey the essential information and the main topic of the article, respectively; and (2) long, short and informative extracts for 180 documents, some of which were created from scratch and some of which were derived from the humanly-producted abstracts indicated above.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aCarlson, Lynn10aMarcu, Daniel10aOkurowski, Mary Ellen403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002T0702968nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041002800152042000700180245004000187264007300227336003800300336002600338337002600364338003200390500001500422500004500437506005100482520157000533546006102103655002002164700001902184700001902203700001602222700001602238700001702254700001402271700002402285700001502309700001702324856014902341856006802490m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2002    pau        u        kor d  a15856323688 aLDC2002T268 aISLRN: 977-393-913-599-20 akoraengbeng07akoraengbeng2iso639-3  adc00aKorean English Treebank Annotations  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2002]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2002T26  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002T261 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis file contains documentation on the Korean English Treebank Annotations, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2002T26 and ISBN 1-58563-236-8. This corpus consists of 33 texts originally written in Korean and translated into English for the purpose of language training in a military setting. The conversations are not authentic dialogues but were constructed for pedagogical purposes. The texts were made available for linguistic research by the Defense Language Institute (DLI). They were delivered on paper to the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science (IRCS) at the University of Pennsylvania, where they were converted to digital form using the KSC 5601 character set encoding (also known as KS X 1001 Wansung). Both the Korean and English texts are presented with complete Treebank annotation which was done manually at IRCS, including syntactic constituent bracketing and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Further documentation about the parsing and POS specifications used in these annotations can be found on the Korean NLP web site. *Data* There are 66 data files: 33 for Korean and 33 for English. The text files mostly contain sets of question and answer sentences. A full, unannotated sentence is presented first, on a single line with an initial semi-colon character ";" -- the first token on such lines (the string preceding the first space character on the line) is a sentence-identifier tag that matches the English and Korean versions of the sentence. The parsed/POS-tagged annotation of the sentence follows on subsequent lines.  aContent in Korean and English.

It was prepared by the LDC for the AQUAINT Project, and will be used in official benchmark evaluations conducted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). *Data* The data files contain roughly 375 million words correlating to about 3GB of data. The text data are separated into directories by source (apw, nyt, xie); within each source, data files are subdivided by year, and within each year, there is one file per date of collection. Each file is named to reflect the source and date, and contains a stream of SGML-tagged text data presenting the series of news stories reported on the given date as a concatenation of DOC elements (i.e. blocks of text bounded by and tags). All data files are published in compressed form, using the GNU "gzip" utility; as such, all files have a ".gz" extension, and will have null file name extension when uncompressed in the usual way (i.e. just the base file name, consisting of "YYYYMMDD_SRC"). While all the data files are covered by a single DTD, it is not the case that they all have a single pattern of markup. Rather, all files share a core markup structure, with minor variations in the peripheral regions of each DOC element, and the DTD has been written to accommodate the variations.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aGraff, David403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002T3102559nmm a22003133i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245005200177264007300229336003800302336002600340337002600366338003200392500001500424500004500439506005100484520138400535546005801919655002001977700003101997856014902028856006802177m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2002    pau        u        ara d  a15856324498 aLDC2002T388 aISLRN: 244-440-307-221-80 aarabeng07aarzbeng2iso639-3  adc00aCALLHOME Egyptian Arabic Transcripts Supplement  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2002]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2002T38  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002T381 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe CALLHOME Egyptian Arabic Transcripts Supplement corpus was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), catalog number LDC2002T38 and ISBN 1-58563-244-9.

In the first set, one page lists every word in the lexicon that begins with a given letter (or letter combination). In the second set, one page lists approximately 25 entries, unless there are fewer than 25 entries beginning with a given letter. The second set is more convenient for use on slower machines. Each entry under a headword has links to two or more sound files. Two speakers were recorded; a given entry generally contains links to utterances of the headword by both speakers, as well as a laryngograph recording of the headword by the second speaker. Nouns may also have links to pronunciations of the plurals, and verbs may have links to pronunciations of the imperative and infinitive forms. These ancillary forms will in general also have laryngograph recordings.

The original goals of the Communicator program were to support the creation of speech-enabled interfaces that scale gracefully across modalities, from speech-only to interfaces that include graphics, maps, pointing and gesture. The original vision of the Communicator systems included the ability of a user, during one 10-minute session, to plan a three-leg trip, with the three flights/legs on three different days, with rental car and hotel in each of the two "away" cities, plus dictating/sending a voice-mail message. The actual research that led to the data collections in 2000 and 2001 explored ways to construct better spoken-dialogue systems, with which users interact via speech-alone to perform relatively complex tasks such as travel planning. During 2000 and 2001 two large data sets were collected, in which users used the Communicator systems built by the research groups to do travel planning. The researchers improved their systems intensively during the ten months between the two data collections. This distribution consists of all the data from the 2001 collection. All the Communicator implementations used a common software architecture, called Galaxy-II, which was designed by a research team at MIT and adapted for Communicator in collaboration with a team at MITRE. The architecture supported detailed logging of the interaction between users and the systems. For possible updated information about the Communicator project and the data distributions, please visit the NIST website. *Data* The following sites participated in this project: ATT, BBN, Carnegie Mellon University, IBM, Lucent Bell Labs, MIT, SRI and University of Colorado at Boulder. All audio files have been converted into SPHERE format; there are 53394 sphere files, totalling approximately 102 hours of audio. All sphere files are one-channel, 8KHz, but the sample coding and format, while consistent for all files belonging to one site, is not consistent across sites (for example, some sites provided pcm, while others provided u-law data). The documentation included in this distribution is replicated exactly as received from NIST and from the participating sites.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aSpeech processing systemsvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aWalker, Marilyn10aAberdeen, John10aSanders, Greg403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003S0102399nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245005600177264007300233336003800306336003300344337002600377338003200403500001500435500004500450506005100495520119100546546004801737650002601785655002801811700001701839856014901856856006802005m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2003    pau        u        bai d  a15856325468 aLDC2003S028 aISLRN: 973-117-906-652-90 abaibeng07aybbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aGrassfields Bantu Fieldwork: Dschang Tone Paradigms  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2003]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2003S02  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003S021 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGrassfields Bantu Fieldwork: Dschang Tone Paradigms was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2003S02 and ISBN 1-58563-254-6.

The telephone conversations in this corpus were originally recorded as part of the CALLFRIEND project. The CALLFRIEND Korean telephone speech was collected by Linguistic Data Consortium primarily in support of the Language Identification (LID) project, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. The calls were later transcribed for use in other projects. This publication consists of 100 telephone conversations, 49 of which were published in 1996 as CALLFRIEND Korean, while the rest of 51 are previously unexposed calls. All 100 conversations have been transcribed and are published as Korean Telephone Conversations Transcripts. The recorded conversations are between native speakers of Korean and last up to 30 minutes, of which the transcribed speech covers between 15 to 18 minutes. All speakers were aware that they were being recorded. They were given no guidelines concerning what they should talk about. Once a caller was recruited to participate, he/she was given a free choice of whom to call. Most participants called family members or close friends. All calls originated in either the United States or Canada. *Data* There are 100 speech files, totalling approximately 44 hours of audio. All speech files are in sphere format (shorten-compressed), recorded in two-channel ulaw with a sampling rate of 8 KHz.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Korean.

The West Point Russian Speech corpus was developed at the Department of Foreign Languages (DFL) and the Center for Technology Enhanced Language Learning (CTELL) at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The purpose of the corpus is to provide a set of recordings for the training and development of speaker-independent speech recognition systems for use by West Point cadets enrolled in the Russian language program. *Data* The corpus consists of 4,181 speech files in SPHERE format, totalling approximately four hours of speech. Approximately 2,290 files are from native informants and 1,891 are from non-native informants. The following tables show the breakdown of corpus content in terms of male, female, native and non-native speakers. Number of speakers: male female total native 13 16 29 non-native 16 10 26 totals 29 26 55 Number of speech files: male female total native 1027 1263 2290 non-native 1103 788 1891 totals 2130 2050 4181 The speech data was collected using laptop computers running Windows NT. Recordings were captured at a sampling rate of 16-bit at 22,050 Hz pcm using a Shure SM10A microphone and a RANE Model MS1 pre-amplifier. A visual display of the sentence, along with a digital recording of the sentence as read by a native speaker, was presented. The informant pressed the Enter key to record the utterance. The informant's recording was played back for review and the utterance was re-recorded if necessary. The collection script consists of 96 sentences with a total of 528 tokens and 351 types. Each waveform file has a monophone and word level master label file transcription in HTK-format. A concatenated version of the master label files at both the word level and the phone level is provided. The lexicon contains 690 distinct orthographic word forms, including all words found in the collection script.  aContent in Russian.

Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English Part II is based on hundreds of recordings of natural speech from all over the United States, representing a wide variety of people of different regional origins, ages, occupations, and ethnic and social backgrounds. It reflects many ways that people use language in their lives: conversation, gossip, arguments, on-the-job talk, card games, city council meetings, sales pitches, classroom lectures, political speeches, bedtime stories, sermons, weddings, and more. The corpus was collected by: University of California, Santa Barbara Center for the Study of Discourse (Director: John W. Du Bois (UCSB), Associate Editors: Wallace L. Chafe (UCSB), Charles Meyer (UMass, Boston), and Sandra A. Thompson (UCSB)). Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English Part II is also part of the International Corpus of English (ICE) (Charles W. Meyer, Director), representing the American Component. For software and additional data resources, please refer to the following sites: TalkBank, International Corpus of English. Part I of the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English is also available as LDC2000S85. *Data* The audio data consists of 16 wave format speech files, recorded in two-channel pcm, at 22,050Hz. The speech files total ~six hours of audio (1.8GB), representing over 47K-words and over 5K unique words in transcription. Each speech file is accompanied by two transcripts in which intonation units are time stamped with respect to the audio recording. The two types of transcripts are defined by the file extension: .trn and .ca. The text and coding content of specific transcripts are identical. However, the transcripts with the ".ca" extension are transcripts in the CHAT format for conversational analysis, formatted for use with the CLAN software, available from TalkBank. The transcripts with ".trn" extension are structured according to the LDC Callhome format, for use with a variety of annotation tools. (Please also note that transcript coding is not presented as in the ICE standard). Personal names, place names, phone numbers, etc., in the transcripts have been altered to preserve the anonymity of the speakers and their acquaintances and the audio files have been filtered to make these portions of the recordings unrecognizable. Pitch information is still recoverable from these filtered portions of the recordings, but the amplitude levels in these regions have been reduced relative to the original signal. A separate filter list file (*.flt) associated with each transcript/waveform file pair is provided to list the beginning and ending times of the filtered regions. There are 4 .flt files which are empty because there was no information that needed to be filtered out from the audio files. The filtering was done using a digital FIR low-pass filter, with the cut-off frequency set at 400 Hz. The effect of the filter was gradually faded in and out at the beginning and end of the regions over a 1,000 sample region, roughly 45 milliseconds, to avoid abrupt transitions in the resulting waveform. *Acknowledgements* The completion and release of this corpus was facilitated by funding extended by the TalkBank project. TalkBank is an interdisciplinary research project funded by a five-year grant (BCS-998009, KDI, SBE) from the National Science Foundation to Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pennsylvania.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzUnited StatesvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aDu Bois, John W.10aChafe, Wallace L.10aMeyer, Charles10aThompson, Sandra A.10aMartey, Nii O.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003S0601989nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090041001300119041002300132042000700155245003500162264007300197336003800270336002600308337002600334338003200360500001500392500004500407506005100452520071800503546005901221650005001280650005101330650004501381655002001426856014901446856006801595m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2002    pau        u        chi d8 aLDC2003T018 aISLRN: 799-085-183-531-80 achibeng07acmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00a2001 HUB5 Mandarin Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2002]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2003T01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003T011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  a2001 HUB5 Mandarin Transcripts was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).

This is a comprehensive archive of newswire text data in English that has been acquired over several years by the LDC. Four distinct international sources of English newswire are represented here: Agence France Press English Service (afe) Associated Press Worldstream English Service (apw) The New York Times Newswire Service (nyt) The Xinhua News Agency English Service (xie) *Data* Much of the content in this collection has been published previously by the LDC in a variety of other, older corpora, particularly the North American News text corpora (LDC95T21, LDC98T30), the various TDT corpora and the AQUAINT text corpus (LDC2002T31). But there is a significant amount of material that is being released here for the first time: all of the Agence France Presse content, the 1995 and 2001 Xinhua content, and the portions of NYT and APW dating from February 2001 forward. Each data file name consists of the three-letter prefix, followed by a six-digit date (representing the year and month during which the file contents were delivered by the respective news source), followed by a ".gz" file extension, indicating that the file contents have been compressed using the GNU "gzip" compression utility (RFC 1952). So, each file contains all the usable data received by LDC for the given month from the given news source. All text data are presented in SGML form, using a very simple, minimal markup structure; all text consists of printable ASCII and whitespace. The corpus has been fully validated by a standard SGML parser utility (nsgmls), using a DTD file which is provided as part of this publication. Please follow this link for a sample file. The markup structure, common to all data files, can be summarized as follows: The Headline Element is Optional -- not all DOCs have one The Dateline Element is Optional -- not all DOCs have one Paragraph tags are only used if the "type" attribute of the DOC happens to be "story" Note that all data files use the UNIX-standard " " form of line termination, and text lines are generally wrapped to a width of 80 characters or less For this release, all sources have received a uniform treatment in terms of quality control and we have applied a rudimentary (and _approximate_) categorization of DOC units into four distinct "types." The classification is indicated by the "type="string" " attribute that is included in each opening DOC tag. The four types are: story, multi, advis and other. Statistics regarding the quantities of data for each source are summarized below. Note that the "Totl-MB" numbers show the amount of data you get when the files are not compressed (i.e. nearly 12 gigabytes, total); the "Gzip-MB" column shows totals for compressed file sizes as stored on the DVD-ROM; the "K-wrds" numbers are simply the number of whitespace-separated tokens (of all types) after all SGML tags are eliminated.

This publication is part one of a a corpus of one million words of Arabic Treebank, designed to support language research and development of language technology for Modern Standard Arabic. *Data* The Penn Arabic Treebank, which is part of the DARPA TIDES project, started in the Fall of 2001 with the objective of performing human and computer annotations of a large Arabic machine-readable text corpus (for project background please see POStest.html). As in previous Penn Treebanks, two different kinds of information need to be produced by two different (human and computer) processes. The Arabic Treebank project consists therefore of two distinct phases: * Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging - divides the text into lexical tokens, and gives relevant information about each token such as lexical category, inflectional features, and a gloss * Arabic Treebanking (ArabicTB) - characterizes the constituent structures of word sequences, provides categories for each non-terminal node, and identifies null elements, co-reference, traces, etc. Both tasks started in November 2001 with an initial pilot consisting of 734 files representing roughly 166K words of written Modern Standard Arabic newswire from the Agence France Presse corpus. The target of this publication is to provide a description of a written Modern Standard Arabic text corpus. The source data consists of Agence France Presse (AFP) newswire, spanning from July through November of 2000. This publication includes 734 stories representing 140,265 words (168,123 tokens after clitic segmentation in the Treebank).  aContent in Standard Arabic.

The purpose of this corpus of 10K Arabic words translated into English is to support the development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing, machine translation, human language technologies, cross-lingual information retrieval, and other forms of linguistic research on Modern Standard Arabic in general. *Data* The project targets the translation of a written Modern Standard Arabic corpus from the Agence France Presse (AFP) newswire archives for July 2000 (the files are dated 20000715*). The corpus consists of 49 source stories, which is a subset of the 734 stories published in Arabic Treebank: Part 1 v 2.0. These 49 source files consist of 418 paragraphs and 9,981 words. The source data and the translations are stored in SGML format. The files have been validated using the DTD provided in the corpus. Please follow these links for an example of an Arabic source file and the English translation. The stories have been translated at paragraph level and verified/corrected by different annotators. In general, the translation between Arabic and English has been aligned at sentence-to-sentence level. However, we noticed that an Arabic sentence can be translated into multiple English sentences (16 occurrences), and two Arabic sentences can be translated into a single English sentence (two occurrences). For 18 paragraphs out of the total of 418 in the corpus, only paragraph-to-paragraph alignment is provided.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

The telephone conversations on which these transcripts are based were originally recorded as part of the CALLFRIEND project. The CALLFRIEND Korean telephone speech was collected by Linguistic Data Consortium primarily in support of the Language Identification (LID) project, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. The calls were later transcribed for use in other projects. This publication consists of 100 transcribed telephone conversations in Korean. The corresponding speech is published as Korean Telephone Conversations Speech. The Korean orthographic forms from the 100 trascription files serve as the head-words in the associated Korean Telephone Conversations Lexicon. The recorded conversations are between native speakers of Korean and last up to 30 minutes, of which the transcribed speech covers between 15 to 18 minutes. All speakers were aware that they were being recorded. They were given no guidelines concerning what they should talk about. Once a caller was recruited to participate, he/she was given a free choice of whom to call. Most participants called family members or close friends. All calls originated in either the United States or Canada. *Data* There are 100 time aligned text files, totalling approximately 190K words and 25K unique words. All files are in Korean orthography: orthographic Korean characters are in Hangul, encoded in KSC5601 (Wansung) system, also known as EUC-KR or ISO-2022-KR.

This is a comprehensive archive of newswire text data that has been acquired from Chinese news sources by the LDC over several years. Two distinct international sources of Chinese newswire are represented here: Central News Agency of Taiwan (cna) Xinhua News Agency of Beijing (xin) Some of the Xinhua content in this collection has been published previously by the LDC in other, older corpora, particularly Mandarin Chinese News Text (LDC95T13), TREC Mandarin (LDC2000T52), and the various TDT Multilanguage Text corpora. But all of the CNA data and a significant amount of Xinhua material is being released here for the first time. *Data* There are 286 files, totalling approximately 1.5GB in compressed form. The table below presents the following categories of information: source of the data, number of files per source, Gzip-MB shows totals for compressed file sizes, Totl-MB shows totals for uncompressed file sizes (nearly four gigabytes, total), K-wrds are actually the number of Chinese characters (there is no notion of "space-separated word tokens" in Chinese), and number of documents. Source #Files Gzip-MB Totl-MB K-wrds #DOCs CNA 144 1018 2606 735499 1649492 XIE 142 548 1331 382881 817348 TOTAL 286 1566 3937 1118380 2466840 The original data archives received by the LDC from Xinhua were encoded in GB-2312, whereas those from CNA were encoded in Big-5. To avoid the problems and confusion that could result from differences in character-set specifications, all text files in this corpus have been converted to UTF-8 character encoding. With some exceptions described in the 0readme.txt file, all characters in the text are either single-byte ASCII or multi-byte Chinese. Each data file name consists of a three-letter prefix, followed by a six-digit date (representing the year and month during which the file contents were generated by the respective news source), followed by a ".gz" file extension, indicating that the file contents have been compressed using the GNU "gzip" compression utility (RFC 1952). So, each file contains all the usable data received by LDC for the given month from the given news source. All text data are presented in SGML form, using a very simple, minimal markup structure. The corpus has been fully validated by a standard SGML parser utility (nsgmls), using a DTD file provided in the corpus. Unlike older corpora, the present corpus uses only the information structure that is common to all sources and serves a clear function: headline, dateline, and core news content (usually containing paragraphs). All sources have received a uniform treatment in terms of quality control and have been categorized into four distinct "types": story this type of DOC represents a coherent report on a particular topic or event, consisting of paragraphs and full sentences multi this type of DOC contains a series of unrelated "blurbs," each of which briefly describes a particular topic or event: "summaries of today's news," "news briefs in ..." (some general area like finance or sports), and so on advis these are DOCs which the news service addresses to news editors, they are not intended for publication to the "end users" other these DOCs clearly do not fall into any of the above types; these are things like lists of sports scores, stock prices, temperatures around the world, and so on The general strategy for categorizing DOCs into these four classes was, for each source, to discover the most common and frequent clues in the text stream that correlated with the three "non-story" types. When none of the known clues was in evidence, the DOC was classified as a "story."  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

The purpose if this corpus is to provide data for investigating the structural configurations in which English idioms are typically found. The assumption was that, since idioms are phrasal lexical items (PLIs), they would therefore have structural properties which are idiosyncratic. In order to study the structural properties of phrasal lexical items, the data is more useful if it is syntactically annotated. *Data* The data was originally drawn from four dictionaries of English idioms. Only citation forms, suitably adapted for this purpose, were used. The citation files were amalgamated. The rationale for the selection was that these are among the biggest and most comprehensive lists of English idioms. There are 13,467 phrasal lexical items in this corpus. The analysis of the phrasal lexical items was manual, while the bracketting symmetry was checked computationally. In order to facilitate machine manipulation of the annotated data, the manual analysis was converted to PROLOG format. This involved expansions of those PLIs which had optional constituents so that both the case with and the case without the options were made available. The files are provided in text format, which each record separated by a carriage return. *Sponsorship* The New Zealand Vice Chancellors' Committee The University of Canterbury  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexIdioms. 0aEnglish languagexIdiomsvDictionaries.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aKuiper, Koenraad10aMcCann, Heather10aQuinn, Heidi10aAitchison, Therese10aVeer, Kees van der403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003T1005035nmm a22004213i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245002200141264007300163336003800236336002600274337002600300338003200326500001500358500004500373506005100418520359900469546004204068650003704110650003104147655002004178700002104198700002404219700002004243700001604263700002604279700002004305700001704325700001904342700001604361700001904377856014904396856006804545m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2003    pau        u        eng d  a15856327088 aLDC2003T118 aISLRN: 498-363-793-174-9  adc00aACE-2 Version 1.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2003]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2003T11  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003T111 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aACE-2 Version 1.0 was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2003T11 and ISBN 1-58563-270-8. This release contains Version 1.0 of the ACE-2 corpus, created and distributed by the LDC to support the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program. The objective of the ACE program is to develop extraction technology to support automatic processing of source language data (in the form of natural text, and as text derived from ASR and OCR). This includes classification, filtering, and selection based on the language content of the source data, i.e., based on the meaning conveyed by the data. Thus the ACE program requires the development of technologies that automatically detect and characterize this meaning. The ACE research objectives are viewed as the detection and characterization of Entities, Relations, and Events. There are three main ACE tasks: Entity Detection and Tracking, Relation Detection and Characterization, and Event Detection and Characterization. Annotations for the ACE-2 corpus were produced by Linguistic Data Consortium to support the following two research tasks: Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT) and Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC). For information regarding the ACE program and ACE technology evaluations administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), please visit the NIST website. For information about ACE annotation and ongoing ACE corpus development, including annotation guidelines, task definitions, annotation tools and other project documentation, please visit the ACE Project page at the LDC. *Data* This publication contains two sets of data: training and devtest. Each of these sets is further divided by source: broadcast news, newspaper, and newswire. The training contains data originally developed as training material for the February 2002 evaluation and again for the September 2002 evaluation. The devtest contains data originally developed as test data for the February 2002 evaluation and later used as devtest data for the September 2002 evaluation. The broadcast and newswire source data is drawn from a subset of the TDT2 Multilanguage Text Version 4.0 (LDC2001T57); this has been supplemented with additional newspaper data from the Washington Post. A portion of the training broadcast data was drawn from the 1997 English Broadcast News Transcripts (HUB4) corpus (LDC98T28). All material comes from the first half of 1998. The sources for the broadcast, newswire, and newspaper data are listed below.

This is a comprehensive archive of newswire text data that has been acquired from Arabic news sources by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) at the University of Pennsylvania. Four distinct sources of Arabic newswire are represented here: Agence France Presse (afa) Al Hayat News Agency (alh) Al Nahar News Agency (ann) Xinhua News Agency (xin) Much of the AFP content in this collection has been published previously by the LDC in Arabic Newswire Part 1 (LDC2001T55) and some of this content has also been included in an Arabic supplement to TDT3 and as the Arabic component of TDT4. TDT4 also included a four month sample from Al Hayat and An Nahar (October 2000 - January 2001). Apart from that, all of the Al Hayat, An Nahar and Xinhua Arabic content, as well as AFP content for 2001-2002, is being released here for the first time. *Data* There are 319 files, totalling approximately 1.1GB in compressed form (4348 MB uncompressed, and 391619 Kwords). The table below presents the following categories of information: source of the data, number of files per source, Gzip-MB shows totals for compressed file sizes, Totl-MB shows totals for uncompressed file sizes (i.e. approximately 4.3 gigabytes, total), K-wrds are the number of space-separated tokens in the text, excluding SGML tags. Source #Files Gzip-MB Totl-MB K-wrds #DOCs AFA 104 274 1091 94484 516855 ALH 95 431 1535 139501 305250 ANN 96 415 1530 140247 327768 XIA 24 47 192 17387 106846 TOTAL 319 1167 4348 391619 1256719 All text files in this corpus have been converted to UTF-8 character encoding. Owing to the use of UTF-8, the SGML tagging within each file shows up as lines of single-byte-per-character (ASCII) text, whereas lines of actual text data, including article headlines and datelines, contain a mixture of single-byte and multi-byte characters. In general, single-byte characters in the text data will consist of digits and punctuation marks (where the original source relied on ASCII punctuation codes, rather than Arabic-specific punctuation), whereas multi-byte characters consist of Arabic letters and a small number of special punctuation or other symbols. This variable-width character encoding is intrinsic to UTF-8, and all UTF-8 capable processes will handle the data appropriately. Each data file name consists of the three-letter prefix, followed by a six-digit date (representing the year and month during which the file contents were generated by the respective news source), followed by a ".gz" file extension, indicating that the file contents have been compressed using the GNU "gzip" compression utility (RFC 1952). So, each file contains all the usable data received by LDC for the given month from the given news source. All text data are presented in SGML form, using a very simple, minimal markup structure. The corpus has been fully validated by a standard SGML parser utility (nsgmls), using the DTD file provided in the publication. Unlike older corpora, the present corpus uses only the information structure that is common to all sources and serves a clear function: headline, dateline, and core news content (usually containing paragraphs). All sources have received a uniform treatment in terms of quality control, and have been categorized into three distinct "types": story this type of DOC represents a coherent report on a particular topic or event, consisting of paragraphs and full sentences multi this type of DOC contains a series of unrelated "blurbs," each of which briefly describes a particular topic or event: "summaries of today's news," "news briefs in ... (some general area like finance or sports)," and so on other these DOCs clearly do not fall into any of the above types; these are things like lists of sports scores, stock prices, temperatures around the world, and so on The general strategy for categorizing DOCs into these three classes was, for each source, to discover the most common and frequent clues in the text stream that correlated with the "non-story" types. When none of the known clues was in evidence, the DOC was classified as a "story." Previous "Gigaword" corpora (in English and Chinese) had a fourth category, "advis" (for "advisory"), which applied to DOCs that contain text intended solely for news service editors, not the news-reading public. In preparing the Arabic data, the task of determining patterns for assigning "non-story" type labels was carried out by a native speaker of Arabic. For whatever reason, this person did not find the "advis" category to be applicable to any of the data.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

All of the interviews are conducted by William Labov or by one of his students. Labov notes that these interviews are not classic in the sense that they form part of a systematic sociolinguistic study of the speech community. What makes these interviews classic is that they represent classic solutions to the problems of achieving cross-cultural contact, reducing the effect of the Observers Paradox and approximating the vernacular of everyday life. Most importantly, they are interviews with extraordinarily gifted, memorable and fluent speakers. These particular interviews have also been targeted for inclusion in this corpus because of their sound quality and because publication of the audio data and corresponding transcripts and annotations does not violate any agreement the interviewer made with the speakers regarding data distribution. The corpus includes the complete interview recordings plus time-aligned verbatim transcripts for each speaker. Also included in the publication is a sociolinguistic variable survey that represents an overview of the intra- and inter-speaker variation attested in the corpus, highlighting a broad range of phonological, phonetic, grammatical, lexical and stylistic variables. Finally, the publication includes a number of annotation tools that allow users to listen to each interview while browsing the corresponding transcripts, and to display and hear each token identified in the variable survey. These tools can be extended to create new time-aligned transcripts or tag additional variables within the existing corpus. The SLX Corpus was developed as part of the Data and Annotations for Sociolinguistics (DASL) Project, an investigation of best practices in the use of digital speech corpora for the study of language variation. Containing classic interview material in the Labovian tradition, it is a valuable teaching tool for linguists. The recordings demonstrate successful interviewing techniques, the sound quality is high, and the digitization, segmentation and transcription of the data represent best practice in these areas. The variable survey highlights over 150 sociolinguistic variables attested in the corpus and suggests avenues for further research. Most importantly, the SLX Corpus provides both an example of a digital speech corpus developed specifically to support sociolinguistic research, and a stable benchmark for training in sociolinguistic data collection, digitization, segmentation, transcription, analysis and publication. *Data* The 17 speech files are 22050Hz, 16-bit, single-channel in the MS WAV (RIFF) format, for a total of 575 minutes (~ 1.5GB). The audio data reflects a broad spectrum of speaking styles, including spontaneous speech, narratives, responses and formal linguistic tasks. The interviews touch on a multitude of topics, and corpus users should note that the language of the interviews represents the uncensored opinions of the speakers, reflecting their daily concerns and personal histories. Taken as a whole, the speakers exemplify a wide variety of regional and social dialects. Demographic information for each main speaker in the corpus is displayed in the table below.

SummBank 1.0 contains the data created for the Summer 2001 Johns Hopkins Workshop which focused on text summarization in a cross-lingual information retrieval framework. For more information about the Johns Hopkins summer workshop on Text Summarization please visit its website. The goal of the corpus is to gather together a corpus of original documents and summaries which can be used as gold standards by the documents summarization community. The source of the data consists of 18,147 aligned bilingual (Cantonese and English) article pairs from the Information Services Department of the Hong-Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, which were published by the LDC in 2000 as Hong Kong News Parallel Text. *Data* This corpus contains 40 news clusters in English and Chinese, 360 multi-document, human-written non-extractive summaries, and nearly two million single document and multi-document extracts created by automatic and manual methods. The summarizer that was reimplemented and upgraded during the workshop is called MEAD; updated versions of the software are available from the MEAD website. This distribution includes roughly two million text files, totalling approximately 13GB uncompressed. The text files are encoded either as utf-8 for English or GB or Big-5 for Chinese.  aContent in Yue Chinese and English.

To support the development of automatic means for evaluating translation quality, the LDC was sponsored to solicit four sets of human translations for a single set of Mandarin Chinese source materials. The LDC was also asked to produce translations from various commercial-off-the-shelf-systems (COTS, including commercial Machine Translation (MT) systems as well as MT systems available on the Internet). There are a total of six sets of COTS outputs, and one set of outputs from a TIDES MT Evaluation participant, which is representative for the state-of-the-art research systems. To see if automatic evaluation systems, such as BLEU, track human assessment, the LDC has also performed human assessment on two of the six COTS outputs and the TIDES research system. The corpus includes the assessment results for these two COTS systems, the assessment result for the TIDES research system, and the specifications used for conducting the assessments. A similar corpus, Multiple-Translation Chinese Corpus, was published in 2002. Both the 2002 and the present corpus used Chinese news articles from the Xinhua and Zaobao News Service, and provide human and COTS translations. However, Part 2 also offers translations from a TIDES research system, and provides human assessment of some of the automatic translations. *Data* Source Data Selection Two sources of journalistic Mandarin Chinese text were selected to provide the Chinese material: - Xinhua News Service: 70 news stories - Zaobao News Service: 30 news stories (total: 100 stories) The Xinhua data were drawn from March and April 2002 collection of Xinhua news. The Zaobao data were drawn from March 2002 collection of Zaobao's online news service. The story selection from the two newswire collections was controlled by story length: all selected stories contain between about 212 and 707 Chinese characters. The overall count of Chinese characters by source is shown in the following table: Xinhua 25247 Zaobao 14009 -------------- total 39256 Zaobao is a news portal from Singapore and many of its news stories are translations from other news agencies' releases. For the Chinese data, there are approximately 20K-words, while for the English translation, there are approximately 258K-words in total, and 13K unique words. Source Data Preparation for Human Translation The original source files used GB-2312 encoding for the Chinese characters, and SGML tags for marking sentence and paragraph boundaries and other information about each story. The character encoding has been left unaltered. To make things easier for translators, nearly all sgml tags were removed, or replaced by "plain text" markers. Human Translation Procedure and Quality Assessment Four best translation teams were chosen from the 11 teams which had participated in the translation of Multiple Translation Chinese Corpus Part 1 (LDC2002T01) to take part in the project. In accordance with the guidelines, each translation team was asked to return the first 10 Xinhua stories for quality checking. This was to ensure that the translation team had indeed understood and was following the guidelines and the translation quality was acceptable. The LDC sent the translations back to the translation team for any deviations from the guidelines or quality issues detected. Subsequent translation submissions were continuously monitored for conformance and quality. Once the full set of translations was complete, a final pass of reformatting and validation was carried out, to assure alignability of segments, and to convert the translated texts into SGML format. Each translation team was also asked to fill out and return a questionnaire to describe their procedures and professional background. Machine Translation Procedure Complete sets of automatic MT translations were also produced by submitting the 100 stories to each of six publicly-available MT systems. Four of these were commercial MT software packages (off-the-shelf products), and two were free web-based services. Starting from the original SGML text format, special alterations were made to the files on an as-needed basis, so that they would be accepted and handled correctly by the various systems; also, the systems differed in terms of the input and retrieval methods required to submit the source data for translation and to save the translated text in alignable form. Human Assessment Procedure The goal of this effort is to evaluate the quality of TIDES research, human translation teams and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems. Translations are evaluated on the basis of adequacy and fluency. Adequacy refers to the degree to which the translation communicates information present in the original source language text. Fluency refers to the degree to which the translation is well-formed according to the grammar of the target language.  aContent in English and Mandarin Chinese.

To support the development of automatic means for evaluating translation quality, the LDC was sponsored to solicit ten sets of human translations for a single set of Arabic source materials. The LDC was also asked to produce translations from various commercial-off-the-shelf-systems (COTS, including commercial Machine Translation (MT) systems as well as MT systems available on the Internet). There are a total of two sets of COTS outputs and one output set from a TIDES 2002 MT Evaluation participant, which is representative for the state-of-the-art research systems.

The Xinhua data was drawn from the Xinhua News Agency's Arabic newswire feed in October 2001. The AFP Data was drawn from the LDC's Arabic Newswire Part 1). The story selection from the two newswire collections was controlled by story length: all selected stories contain between 700 and 1,500 Arabic characters. The overall count of Arabic words (excluding markup) is shown in the following table by source: AFP 12,674 Xinhua 11,155 ------------- 23,829 For the Arabic data, there are approximately 23K-words, while for the English translations, there are 366K-words in total and 163K unique words. Source Data Preparation for Human Translation The original source files used CP-1256 encoding for the Arabic characters, and SGML tags for marking sentence and paragraph boundaries and other information about each story. The source files were later converted to UTF8 encoding. To make things easier for the translators, nearly all sgml tags were removed or replaced by "plain text" markers. Human Translation Procedure and Quality Assessment Each initially selected translation team received the translation guidelines and a sample pair of source and translation (excluded from the final release) for review. After the team said that they understood the task requirements and would be willing to participate in the project, 75 AFP news stories were sent to them as a first installment of data. In accordance with the guidelines, each translation team was asked to return the first six AFP stories for quality checking. This was to ensure that the translation team had indeed understood and was following the guidelines and the translation quality was acceptable. The LDC sent the translations back to the translation team for any deviations from the guidelines or quality issues detected.

FORM is a gesture annotation scheme designed to capture the kinematic information in gesture from videos of speakers. This publication is a detailed database of gesture-annotated videos stored in the Anvil and FORM file formats. FORM encodes the "phonetics" of gesture by giving geometric descriptions of location and movement of the right and left arms. Other kinematic information such as effort and shape are also recorded. *Data* There are a total of 24 data files: eight movie files, eight Anvil files, and eight Form files. The movie files represent 12 minutes of audio and video recordings excerpted from a lecture given by Brian MacWhinney on January 24, 2000 at Carnegie Mellon University. These video recordings were chosen because they are part of the NSF-funded Talkbank project. The video format is as follows: Size 360 x 240 pixels Compression H.261 Data rate 696 K/sec Video rate 29.82 fps Audio rate 48.000 kHz Audio format 8-bit stereo The gesture annotations were created using the FORM 2.0 tag set. The Anvil annotation files used in their creation, augmented with FORM 1.0 data, are also included. (FORM1 data will be the subject of a separate publication to be released in the near future). FORM1 values that are not included in the FORM2 spec are not included in the publication. A full description of the FORM tag set with explanations of each value can be found in the documentation. *Sponsorship* This research was conducted using funding from the following grant sources: ISLE - 9910603 NSF: TalkBank (via subcontract from Carnegie Mellon University) - BCS-998009 and BCS-9978056 NSF: Discourse and Gesture - EIA98-09209  aContent and documentation in English. 0aGesturevDatabases.7 aVideo recordings2lcgft10aMartell, Craig10aHoward, Paul10aOsborn, Chris10aBritt, Lisa10aMyers, Kari403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003V0103341nmm a22003133i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090041001300119041002300132042000700155245005300162264007300215336003800288336002600326337002600352338003200378500001500410500004500425506005100470520215300521520005102674546004902725655002002774700001602794856014902810856006802959m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        kor d8 aLDC2004L018 aISLRN: 031-806-130-080-10 akorbeng07akorbeng2iso639-3  adc00aKlex: Finite-State Lexical Transducer for Korean  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004L01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004L011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aKlex: Finite-State Lexical Transducer for Korean was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004L01 and ISBN 1-58563-283-x. Klex is a finite-state lexical transducer for the Korean language, with the lexical string on the upper side and the inflected surface string on the lower side. Klex was developed on the XFST (Xerox Finite State Tool) software platform, developed and distributed by the Xerox Corporation. The most common application for such lexical transducers is morphological analysis and generation. *Data* The distribution consists of ~7,8MB. Characters in Hangul (Korean alphabet) can be displayed by selecting Korean encoding in your brower. A lexicon in the form of a transducer has the following basic structure: fly/VV+s/ECS 돕/VV+었/EPF+다/EFN | | flies 도왔다 A sequence of morphemes along with the respective part-of-speech constitutes the upper string; a fully lexicalized form constitutes the lower string. A transducer network as a whole consists of all such possible morpheme sequence / word pairs in the language. Given the lower lexicalized form, the transducer can produce the analyzed morpheme sequence (the process of "looking-up"); conversely, the transducer can be used in producing the fully inflected surface form of grammatical sequence of morphemes (opposite of "looking-up," hence Xerox's terminology of "looking-down"). These two operations are the most typical applications of such lexical transducers, namely morphological analysis and generation. Output of Klex when used as a morphological analyzer is compatible with the Morphologically Annotated Korean Text corpus. It also conforms to the Korean Treebank POS annotation standards, with slight variation. The Korean morphological grammar employed by Klex was constructed by Na-Rae Han, under the guidance of Ken Beesley, Lauri Karttunen and Martha Palmer. The lexicon was fine-tuned by testing against various corpora, by fixing undesirable outputs and adding missing lexical entries. Klex was partially supported by the Korean Treebank Project, whose result was published in 2002 as the Korean English Treebank Annotations.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Korean.

Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English Part IV is based on hundreds of recordings of natural speech from all over the United States, representing a wide variety of people of different regional origins, ages, occupations, and ethnic and social backgrounds. It reflects many ways that people use language in their lives: conversation, gossip, arguments, on-the-job talk, card games, city council meetings, sales pitches, classroom lectures, political speeches, bedtime stories, sermons, weddings, and more. The corpus was collected by: University of California, Santa Barbara Center for the Study of Discourse (Director: John W. Du Bois (UCSB), Authors: John W. Du Bois and Robert Englebretson. Associate Editors: Wallace L. Chafe (UCSB), Charles Meyer (UMass, Boston), and Sandra A. Thompson (UCSB)). For software and additional data resources, please refer to the following sites: TalkBank, International Corpus of English. Part I of the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English is available as LDC2000S85. Part II of the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English is available as LDC2003S06. Part III of the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English is available as LDC2003S10. *Data* The audio data consists of 14 wave format speech files, recorded in two-channel pcm, at 22050Hz. The speech files total 5.75 hours of audio (1.5 GB), representing over 58,000 words and over 6,000 unique words in the transcribed text.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzUnited StatesvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aDu Bois, John W.10aEnglebretson, Robert403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005S2505111nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041002800152042000700180245006200187264007300249336003800322336002600360337002600386338003200412500001500444500004500459506005100504520369000555520005104245546007004296650002904366650004704395655002004442700001504462700001904477700002404496856014904520856006804669m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2007    pau        u        eng d  a15856344418 aLDC2007T248 aISLRN: 123-270-985-345-40 aengaarabeng07aengaarbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 1  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2007]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2007T24  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007T241 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis release is Part 1 of the three-part GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text, which, along with other corpora, was used as training data in year 1 (Phase 1) of the DARPA-funded GALE program. This corpus contains transcripts and English translations of 17 hours of Arabic broadcast news programming selected from a variety of sources. This corpus does not contain the audio files from which the transcripts and translations were generated. The audio files will be released by the LDC at a future date. LDC has released the following GALE Phase 1 & 2 Arabic Parallel Text data sets: * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 1 (LDC2007T24) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 2 (LDC2008T09) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Blog Parallel Text (LDC2008T02) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 1 (LDC2009T03) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 2 (LDC2009T09) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 1 (LDC2012T06) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 2 (LDC2012T14) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Newswire Parallel Text (LDC2012T17) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text (LDC2012T18) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Web Parallel Text (LDC2013T01) *Source Data* A total of 17 hours of Arabic broadcast news recordings was selected from six sources and seven different programs. A manual selection procedure was used to choose data appropriate for the GALE program, namely, news and conversation programs focusing on current events. Stories on topics such as sports, entertainment news, and stock market reports were excluded from the data set. The following table is a summary of the files included in this release. Source Program Epoch (YYYY.MM) #hours #words Al Hurra News 10 2005.11 0.2 959 News 13 2005.04 - 2005.11 3.9 24,430 Dubai TV Dubai News 2005.01 - 2005.02 1.9 10,842 Lebanese Broadcast Naharkum Saiid 2005.01 - 2005.02 2.0 13,979 Nile TV News 2000.10 0.6 3,671 Voice of America News 2000.06 - 2000.11 5.7 36,925 *Transcription* The selected audio snippets were then carefully transcribed by LDC annotators and professional transcription agencies following LDC's Quick Rich Transcription. Manual sentence units/segments (SU) annotation was also performed as part of the transcription task. Three types of end of sentence SU are identified: - statement SU - question SU - incomplete SU *Translation* After transcription and SU annotation, the files were reformatted into a human-readable translation format and were then assigned to professional translators for careful translation. Translators followed LDC's GALE translation guidelines, which describe the makeup of the translation team, the source data format, the translation data format, best practices for translating certain linguistic features (such as names and speech disfluencies), and quality control procedures applied to completed translations. TDF Format All final data are in Tab Delimited Format (TDF). TDF is compatible with other transcription formats, such as the Transcriber format and AG format, and it is easy to process. Each line of a TDF file corresponds to a speech segment and contains 13 tab delimited fields (the 13th field "suType" might be empty): field data_type ----- --------- 1 file unicode 2 channel int 3 start float 4 end float 5 speaker unicode 6 speakerType unicode 7 speakerDialect unicode 8 transcript unicode 9 section int 10 turn int 11 segment int 12 sectionType unicode 13 suType unicode A source TDF file and its translation are the same except that the transcript in the source TDF is replaced by its English translation. Encoding All data are encoded in UTF8.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English and Standard Arabic.

The audio was recorded between February 1 and April 22, 2000, at the Department of Cybernetics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen. The corpus was created to support the development of large vocabulary speaker independent speech recognition systems for Czech. *Data* There are 286 audio files, totaling approximately 50 hours of broadcast news. The news does not contain weather forecasts, sports news, or traffic announcements. The audio files are single-channel, 22.05 kHz, 16 bit linear wav files. The stations, channels, number of files and number of hours are listed below: Radio Source Files Hours CRo1 138 30.8 CRo2 90 7.8 CRo3 14 2 TV Source Files Hours CTV 22 5.1 Prima 22 4.2 The corresponding transcripts are available as Czech Broadcast News Transcripts. The transcripts were created by native Czech speakers working at the Department of Cybernetics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, under the direction of Vlasta Radova. The transcription was done using software provided by the LDC (Transcriber 1.4.1). Those parts of the audio recordings that do not contain speech or where the signal was disrupted were not transcribed. As a consequence, the corpus contains about 23 hours of transcribed speech. The transcriptions are provided in both the ISO-8859-2 and Windows-1250 character set.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Czech.

The ICSI Meeting corpus is a collection of 75 meetings collected at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley during the years 2000-2002. The meetings included are "natural" meetings in the sense that they would have occurred anyway: they are generally regular weekly meetings of various ICSI working teams, including the team working on the ICSI Meeting Project. In recording meetings of this type, we hoped to capture meeting dynamics and speaking styles that are as natural as possible given that speakers are wearing close-talking microphones and are fully cognizant of the recording process. The speech files range in length from 17 to 103 minutes, but generally run just under an hour each. Word-level orthographic transcriptions are available as ICSI Meeting Transcripts. *Data* The collection includes 922 speech files, for a total of approximately 72 hours of Meeting Room speech. The speech is structured as one subdirectory per meeting, containing wavefiles for each channel (and possible .blp file, specifying any censored intervals). The audio was collected at a 48 kHZ sample-rate, downsampled on the fly to 16 kHz. Audio files for each meeting are provided as separate time-synchronous recordings for each channel, encoded as 16-bit linear (big-endian) wavefiles, shorten-compressed in NIST SPHERE format. The meetings were simultaneously recorded using close-talking microphones for each speaker (generally head-mounted, but early meetings contain some lapel microphones), as well as six table-top microphones: four high-quality omnidirectional PZM microphones arrayed down the center of the conference table, and two inexpensive microphone elements mounted on a mock PDA. All meetings were recorded in the same instrumented meeting room. In addition to recording the meetings themselves, the participants were also asked to read digit strings, similar to those found in TIDIGITS, at the start or end of the meeting. This small-vocabulary read-speech component of the recordings -- using the same meeting room, speakers, and microphones -- provides a valuable supplement to the natural conversational data, allowing a factorization of the speech challenges offered by the corpus. For all but a dozen of the meetings included in the corpus, at least some of the participants read digit strings; for the great majority of meetings, all participants did. The digit readings are included as part of the wavefiles for the meeting as a whole and are fully transcribed as part of the associated transcripts. There are a total of 53 unique speakers in the corpus. Meetings involved anywhere from three to 10 participants, averaging six. The corpus contains a significant proportion of non-native English speakers, varying in fluency from nearly-native to challenging-to-transcribe. *Sponsorship* The collection and preparation of this corpus was made possible in large part through funding from DARPA, both through the Communicator project and through a ROAR "seedling," the Swiss IM2 project (National Centre of Competence in Research, sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation), and a supplementary award from IBM.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aComputer science. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases. 0aSpeech processing systemsvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aJanin, Adam10aEdwards, Jane10aEllis, Dan10aGelbart, David10aMorgan, Nelson10aPeskin, Barbara10aPfau, Thilo10aShriberg, Elizabeth10aStolcke, Andreas10aWooters, Chuck403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S0202853nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245004500141264007300186336003800259336003300297337002600330338003200356500001500388500004500403506005100448520150900499546004202008650002902050650003202079650006402111650004502175655002802220700001802248700002002266856014902286856006802435m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        eng d  a15856329378 aLDC2004S048 aISLRN: 575-386-034-582-7  adc00a2002 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004S04  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S041 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe 2002 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation corpus was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004S04 and ISBN 1-58563-293-7. The 2002 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation is part of an ongoing series of yearly evaluations conducted by NIST. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities. They are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluation was designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported, and to be accessible. The 2002 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation main data was extracted from the Switchboard Cellular Part 2. The extended data task used two phases of Switchboard II, Phases 2 and 3. This evaluation also included the first multi-modal task, using data from the FBI voice database. Supporting documentation for this evaluation may be found on the 2002 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation website. Please consult the NIST evaluation plan for detailed instructions on using this evaluation material. *Data* There are a total of 9,153 speech files (6,098 at 8 KHz and 3,055 at 16KHz), all of which are in sphere format, for a total of ~156 hours. The data was initially distributed by NIST on 13 CD-ROMs (r81_1_1 through r81_13_1). This corpus consists of training and test data and replicates exactly the content and structure of the 13 CD-ROMs.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aConversationvDatabases. 0aTelephone callsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzUnited StatesvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aMartin, Alvin10aPrzybocki, Mark403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S0403444nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245003000141264007300171336003800244336003300282337002600315338003200341500001500373500004500388506005100433520204100484546004202525650008102567650003302648650004502681650005102726655002802777700002002805700002302825700001702848856014902865856006803014m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        eng d  a15856329458 aLDC2004S058 aISLRN: 459-840-211-562-6  adc00aISL Meeting Speech Part 1  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004S05  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S051 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aISL Meeting Speech Part 1 was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004S05 and ISBN 1-58563-294-5. The ISL Meeting Speech Part 1 is a first subset of the ISL Meeting Corpus (112 meetings). It contains 18 meetings collected at the Interactive Systems Laboratories at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA during the years 2000-2001. The recorded meetings were either natural meetings where participants needed to meet in the real world, or artificial meetings, which were designed explicitly for the purposes of data collection but still had real topics and tasks. The duration of the meetings in this corpus ranges from eight to 64 minutes and averages at 34 minutes. Word-level orthographic transcriptions are available as ISL Meeting Transcripts Part 1. The transcriptions are available as ISL Meeting Transcripts Part 1. *Data* The collection includes 105 speech files, for a total of approximately 10 hours of meeting speech. The speech for each meeting consists of wave files for each channel and a wave file containing a mix of all channels. The audio was collected at a 16 kHz sample-rate. Audio files for each meeting are provided as separate time-synchronous recordings for each channel, encoded as 16-bit (little-endian) wave files. During meeting recordings, each speaker wore an individual lapel microphone and was recorded via an Alesis 8-channel mix board and an ECHO Layla 8-channel sound card. This setup was designed to obtain a consumer- or application-style sound quality. All meetings were recorded in the same instrumented meeting area. For an example transcript, please click here. There are a total of 31 unique speakers in the corpus. Meetings involved anywhere from three to nine participants, averaging at five. The corpus contains a significant proportion of non-native English speakers, varying in fluency. *Sponsorship* The collection and preparation of this corpus was made possible in large part through funding from DARPA, both through the GENOA project and through ROAR.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzUnited StatesxData processingvDatabases. 0aSpeech synthesisvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases. 0aNatural language processing (Computer science)7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aBurger, Susanne10aMacLaren, Victoria10aWaibel, Alex403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S0503094nmm a22003133i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090042000700119245003800126264007300164336003800237336003300275337002600308338003200334500001500366500004500381506005100426520190600477520005102383546004202434655002802476700001702504700001802521700002402539856014902563856006802712m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        eng d8 aLDC2004S078 aISLRN: 047-363-770-147-0  adc00aSwitchboard Cellular Part 2 Audio  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004S07  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S071 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aSwitchboard Cellular Part 2 Audio was devloped by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and consists of approximately 200 hours of English telephone conversations collected by LDC in 2000. The Switchboard cellular collection focused primarily on cellular phone technology of all service types. The goal was to target 200 subjects balanced by gender to participate in (10+) five-six minute conversations on cellular phones. The speech data was collected for research, development, and evaluation of automatic systems for speech-to-text conversion, talker identification, language identification and speech signal detection purposes. During the study period, LDC collected a total of 2,020 calls, or 4,040 sides (2,950 cellular) from 419 participants (2,405 female speakers, 1,635 male speakers) under varied environmental conditions. *Data* This release contains speech data files with documentation describing speaker information (sex, age, education, city and state where raised), call information (date, time, call duration, Personal Identification Numbers, topic), and audit information (channel quality, background noise). The documentation also contains reports on clipped files. Each speech file consists of a 1,024-byte ASCII-formatted Sphere header, followed by two-channel interleaved mu-law sample data. The mu-law samples represent the actual digital data transmission from the telephone service provider (MCI), as captured separately for each side of the telephone conversation by LDC's telephone collection platform. The header also indicates the caller_pin, callee_pin, topic_id, cellular service/handset information and speaker demographic information. The data files are not compressed.

This data was originally created to support the DARPA EARS (Efficient, Affordable, Reusable Speech-to-Text) Program in Metadata Extraction (MDE). The goal of EARS MDE is to enable technology that can take raw Speech-to-Text output and refine it into forms that are of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. The data in this release consists of English Conversational Telephone Speech (CTS) and Broadcast News (BN) audio data. The corresponding transcripts and annotations are available as MDE RT-03 Training Data Text and Annotations. *Data* There are 633 files, totalling approximately 5.39 GB (uncompressed) representing over 60 hours of recorded speech. There are approximately 20 hours of Broadcast News and over 40 hours of Conversational Telephone Speech contained in the corpus. The annotated data was originally developed to support the DARPA EARS Metadata Extraction (MDE) Program, and was distributed as training data for the RT-03F evaluation cycle. The CTS data was drawn from the Switchboard-1 Release 2 corpus. The BN speech data was drawn from the 1997 English Broadcast News Speech (HUB4) corpus, from four distinct sources: American Broadcasting Company (ABC) (1998, 2001) National Broadcasting Company (NBC) (1998, 2001) Public Radio International (PRI) (1998) Cable News Network (CNN) (2001) *Data Format* The audio data in this corpus conforms to the following technical specifications. Type Format Encoding Channels Sample Rate CTS WAVE u-Law 2 8000/sec BN WAVE 16-bit PCM 1 16000/sec Note that the data is in wave format. This is the audio file format that our annotation tool (MDE Tool) supports. Since the annotation data is best explored with this open-source annotation tool, the WAVE format is our choice of data format. *Annotations* The transcripts corresponding to this speech have been annotated for various kinds of metadata. The goal of MDE is to enable technology that can take raw Speech-To-Text output and refine it into forms that are of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. In simple terms, this means the creation of automatic transcripts that are maximally readable. To this end, LDC has defined a SimpleMDE annotation task. Under SimpleMDE, annotators identify four types of fillers: filled pauses like "uh" and "um," discourse markers like "you know," asides and parentheticals, and editing terms like "sorry" and "I mean." Edit disfluencies are also identified; the full extent of the disfluency (or string of adjacent disfluencies) and interruption points are tagged. Annotators further identify SUs (alternately semantic units, sense units, syntactic units, slash units or sentence units); that is, units within the discourse that function to express a complete thought or idea on the part of a speaker. As with disfluency annotation, the goal of SU labeling is to improve transcript readability, here by creating a transcript in which information is presented in small, structured, coherent chunks rather than long turns or stories. There are four types of sentence-level SUs: statements, questions, backchannels and incomplete SUs. To enhance inter-annotator consistency, the annotation task also identifies a number of sub-sentence SU boundaries (coordination and clausal SUs). General information about the EARS MDE Annotation effort, including free annotation tools, annotation guidelines and additional information can be found at LDC's main EARS MDE Project Page.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aStrassel, Stephanie10aWalker, Christopher10aLee, Haejoong403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S0802669nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090042000700119245003700126264007300163336003800236336003300274337002600307338003200333500001500365500004500380506005100425520137200476546004201848655002801890700002201918700002001940700002501960700001901985700002402004700002602028700001902054700001702073856014902090856006802239m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        eng d8 aLDC2004S098 aISLRN: 706-538-229-826-0  adc00aNIST Meeting Pilot Corpus Speech  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004S09  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S091 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aNIST Meeting Pilot Corpus Speech consists of approximately 15 hours of English meeting speech and was collected in the NIST Meeting Data Collection Laboratory for the NIST Automatic Meeting Recognition Project.

For more information regarding the data collection conditions, meeting scenarios, transcripts, speaker information, recording logs, errata, and other ancillary data for the corpus, please consult the NIST project website for this corpus. *Data* The data in this corpus consists of 369 SPHERE audio files generated from 19 meetings (comprising about 15 hours of meeting room data and amounting to about 32 GB) recorded between November 2001 and December 2003. Each meeting was recorded using two wireless "personal" mics attached to each meeting participant: a close-talking noise-cancelling boom mic and an omni-directional lapel mic. Each meeting was also recorded using three omni-directional table mics and a four-channel directional table mic covering 365 degrees (each channel is recorded in a separate file). Each individual channel was converted from its 48Khz, 24-bits, linear PCM source format to 16 Khz, 16-bits, linear PCM-sampled audio SPHERE-formatted files.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGarofolo, John S.10aMichel, Martial10aStanford, Vincent M.10aTabassi, Elham10aFiscus, Jonathan G.10aLaprun, Christophe D.10aPratz, Nicolas10aLard, Jerome403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S0905003nmm a22003133i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245006100141264007300202336003800275336003300313337002600346338003200372500001500404500004500419506005100464520377700515546004204292650006404334655002804398700002104426700002504447856014904472856006804621m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        eng d  a15856330898 aLDC2004S108 aISLRN: 801-946-303-326-6  adc00aSanta Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English Part III  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004S10  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S101 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aSanta Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English Part III was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004S10 and ISBN 1-58563-308-9. Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English Part III is based on hundreds of recordings of natural speech from all over the United States, representing a wide variety of people of different regional origins, ages, occupations, and ethnic and social backgrounds. It reflects many ways that people use language in their lives: conversation, gossip, arguments, on-the-job talk, card games, city council meetings, sales pitches, classroom lectures, political speeches, bedtime stories, sermons, weddings, and more. The corpus was collected by: University of California, Santa Barbara Center for the Study of Discourse (Director: John W. Du Bois (UCSB), Authors: John W. Du Bois and Robert Englebretson. Associate Editors: Wallace L. Chafe (UCSB), Charles Meyer (UMass, Boston), and Sandra A. Thompson (UCSB)). Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English Part III is also part of the International Corpus of English (ICE) (Charles W. Meyer, Director), representing the American Component. For software and additional data resources, please refer to the following sites: Talkbank, International Corpus of English. Part I of the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English is available as LDC2000S85. Part II of the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English is available as LDC2003S06. *Data* The audio data consists of 16 wave format speech files, recorded in two-channel pcm, at 22050Hz. The speech files total ~6 hours of audio (1.8GB), representing over 116K-words and over 9K unique words in transcription. segment.txt explanation of the information in segment.tbl segment.tbl collection information about the recordings segment_summaries.txt brief summaries of audio scenarios speaker.txt explanation of the information in speaker.tbl speaker.tbl speaker ethnographic, demographic information table.txt description of file names and informal titles annotations.txt list of conventions and prosodic annotations The the transcripts are in the following format: .trn format structure 2.660 2.805 JOANNE: But, 2.805 4.685 so these slides be real interesting. 6.140 6.325 KEN: ... Yeah. 6.325 7.710 I think it'll be real interesting A sample transcript file may be found here. Personal names, place names, phone numbers, etc., in the transcripts have been altered to preserve the anonymity of the speakers and their acquaintances and the audio files have been filtered to make these portions of the recordings unrecognizable. Pitch information is still recoverable from these filtered portions of the recordings, but the amplitude levels in these regions have been reduced relative to the original signal. A separate filter list file (*.flt) associated with each transcript/waveform file pair is provided to list the beginning and ending times of the filtered regions. The file sbc040.flt is empty indicating there was no personal information to filter out. The filtering was done using a digital FIR low-pass filter, with the cut-off frequency set at 400 Hz. The effect of the filter was gradually faded in and out at the beginning and end of the regions over a 1,000 sample region, roughly 45 milliseconds, to avoid abrupt transitions in the resulting waveform. For a complete listing of the files, please see file.tbl in the docs directory. *Acknowledgements* The completion and release of this corpus was facilitated by funding extended by the Talkbank project.

This corpus contains the test material used in the 2002 Rich Transcription (RT-02) Evaluation of Broadcast News and Conversational Telephone Speech, administered by the NIST Speech Group in the Spring of 2002. The RT-02 Meeting Recognition Evaluation material is available in a separate distribution. For complete up-to-date information, see the RT-02 Evaluation Website. The RT-02 Evaluation supported two main evaluation tasks: * Speech-To-Text (STT) Tasks -- included three processing speeds (1x real time, 10x real time, and unlimited time) for both the Broadcast News (BN) and Conversational Telephone Speech (CTS) domains. * Metadata Extraction (MDE) Task -- consisted of a speaker diarization task for the BN and CTS domains. *Data* This distribution of the RT-02 Evaluation Data contains only Broadcast News and Conversational Telephone Speech data. Meeting data used in the RT-02 Evaluation is not included in this distribution and is packaged in a separate distribution. All recordings are in English. The BN data is composed of six approximately 10-minute excerpts from six different broadcasts. Each waveform is a SPHERE-headered, single-channel, 16-bit PCM file. The broadcasts were selected from programs from MNB, PRI, NBC, CNN, VOA and ABC, all collected in 1998. The evaluation excerpts were transcribed to the nearest story boundary. The CTS data is composed of 60 approximately five-minute excerpts from 60 different conversations: 20 from Switchboard-1 data, 20 from Switchboard-2 data, and 20 from Switchboard Cellular-2 data. Evaluation excerpts were transcribed to the nearest turn. Unlike the BN audio files where the full broadcasts were provided, the CTS audio files contain only the evaluation excerpts. Each audio excerpt is a SPHERE-headered, two channel interleaved 8-bit mulaw file. The reference transcripts are also provided in this corpus. The official format for STT reference data is STM (files with the extension 'stm'), while the official format for MDE reference data is RTTM (files with the extension 'rttm') . Files with the extensions 'txt' or 'utf' are the original reference transcripts before any format conversions, additions of annotations, etc., and are included for completeness.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGarofolo, John S.10aFiscus, Jonathan G.10aLe, Audrey403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S1103283nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245006800182264007300250336003800323336003300361337002600394338003200420500001500452500004500467506005100512520201400563546008802577655002802665700002402693700002302717856014902740856006802889m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        zxx d  a15856331278 aLDC2004S128 aISLRN: 722-712-209-012-60 azxxbeng07azxxazxxbeng2iso639-3  adc00aTalkBank Ethology Data: Field Recordings of Vervet Monkey Calls  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004S12  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S121 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aTalkBank Ethology Corpus: Field Recordings of Vervet Monkey Calls contains digitized audio files of field recordings of vervet monkeys (cercopithecus aethiops) collected by Robert M.

It contains 568 hours of conversational telephone and microphone speech in English, Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Farsi, Hindi, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Thai and Urdu and associated English transcripts used as test data in the NIST-sponsored 2006 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). The ongoing series of SRE yearly evaluations conducted by NIST are intended to be of interest to researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluations are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported and to be accessible to those wishing to participate. The task of the 2006 SRE evaluation was speaker detection, that is, to determine whether a specified speaker is speaking during a given segment of conversational telephone speech. The task was divided into 15 distinct and separate tests involving one of five training conditions and one of four test conditions. Further information about the test conditions and additional documentation is available at the NIST web site for the 2006 SRE and within the 2006 SRE Evaluation Plan. LDC previously published 2006 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Training Set and 2006 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Test Set Part 1. *Data* The speech data in this release was collected by LDC as part of the Mixer project, in particular Mixer Phases 1, 2 and 3. The Mixer project supports the development of robust speaker recognition technology by providing carefully collected and audited speech from a large pool of speakers recorded simultaneously across numerous microphones and in different communicative situations and/or in multiple languages. The data is mostly English speech, but includes some speech in Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Farsi, Hindi, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Thai and Urdu. The telephone speech segments are multi-channel data collected simultaneously from a number of auxiliary microphones. The files are organized into four types: two-channel excerpts of approximately 10 seconds, two-channel conversations of approximately 5 minutes, summed-channel conversations also of approximately 5 minutes and a two-channel conversation with the usual telephone speech replaced by auxiliary microphone data in the putative target speaker channel. The auxiliary microphone conversations are also of approximately five minutes in length. The speech files are stored as 8-bit u-law speech signals in separate SPHERE files. In addition to the standard header fields, the SPHERE header for each file contains some auxiliary information such as the language of the conversation. English language time-aligned transcripts in .ctm format were produced using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Yue Chinese, Urdu, Thai, Spanish, Russian, Korean, Hindi, Persian, English, Mandarin Chinese, Bengali, Standard Arabic, Dari, Iranian Persian, Chinese, and Arabic.

It contains 640 hours of multilingual telephone speech and English interview speech along with time-aligned transcripts and other materials used as training data in the 2008 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). SRE is part of an ongoing series of evaluations conducted by NIST. These evaluations are an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities. They are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluation is designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported, and to be accessible to those wishing to participate. The 2008 evaluation was distinguished from prior evaluations, in particular those in 2005 and 2006, by including not only conversational telephone speech data but also conversational speech data of comparable duration recorded over a microphone channel involving an interview scenario. *Data* The speech data in this release was collected in 2007 by LDC at its Human Subjects Data Collection Laboratories in Philadelphia and by the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at the University of California, Berkley. This collection was part of the Mixer 5 project, which was designed to support the development of robust speaker recognition technology by providing carefully collected and audited speech from a large pool of speakers recorded simultaneously across numerous microphones and in different communicative situations and/or in multiple languages. Mixer participants were native English and bilingual English speakers. The telephone speech in this corpus is predominately English, but also includes the languages identified above. All interview segments are in English. Telephone speech represents approximately 565 hours of the data, whereas microphone speech represents the other 75 hours. The telephone speech segments include excerpts in the range of 8-12 seconds and 5 minutes from longer original conversations. The interview material includes short conversation interview segments of approximately 3 minutes from a longer interview session. As in prior evaluations, intervals of silence were not removed. Also, two separate conversation channels are provided (to aid systems in echo cancellation, dialog analysis, etc.). There are approximately six files distributed as part of SRE08 where each file is a 1024 byte header with no audio.

It contains approximately 78 hours of English meeting speech, reference transcripts and other material used in the RT Spring 2005 evaluation. Rich Transcription (RT) is broadly defined as a fusion of speech-to-text (STT) technology and metadata extraction technologies providing the bases for the generation of more usable transcriptions of human-human speech in meetings. LDC has also released 2004 Spring NIST Rich Transcription (RT-04S) Development Data LDC2007S11 and 2004 Spring NIST Rich Transcription (RT-04S) Evaluation Data LDC2007S12. RT-05S included the following tasks in the meeting domain: * Speech-To-Text (STT) -convert spoken words into streams of text * Speaker Diarization (SPKR) -find the segments of time within a meeting in which each meeting participant is talking * Speech Activity Detection (SAD) - detect when someone in a meeting space is talking Further information about the evaluation is available on the RT-05Spring Evaluation Website. Please note the lecture meeting data is not included in this release. *Data Description* The data in this release consists of portions of meeting speech collected between 2001 and 2005 by the IDIAP Research Institutes Augmented Multi-Party Interaction project (AMI), Martigny, Switzerland International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at University of California, Berkeley Interactive Systems Laboratories (ISL) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, PA NIST and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT), Blacksburg, VA. Each meeting excerpt contains a head-mic recording for each subject and one or more distant microphone recordings. Reference transcripts for the evaluation excerpts were prepared by LDC according to its Meeting Recording Careful Transcription Guidelines. Those specifications are designed to provide an accurate, verbatim (word-for-word) transcription, time-aligned with the audio file and including the identification of additional audio and speech signals with special mark-up.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aSpeech processing systems. 0aDiscourse analysisxData processing. 0aEnglish languagexDiscourse analysisxData processing. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aNIST Multimodal Information Group403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011S0603860nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245004900141264007300190336003800263336003300301337002600334338003200360500001500392500004500407506005100452520256900503520005103072546004203123655002803165700002303193700001703216700001803233700002403251700001803275856014903293856006803442m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        eng d  a15856331358 aLDC2004S138 aISLRN: 259-501-047-379-0  adc00aFisher English Training Speech Part 1 Speech  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004S13  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S131 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aFisher English Training Speech Part 1 Speech represents the first half of a collection of conversational telephone speech (CTS) that was created at the LDC during 2003. It contains 5,850 audio files, each one containing a full conversation of up to 10 minutes. Additional information regarding the speakers involved and types of telephones used can be found in the companion text corpus of transcripts, Fisher English Training Speech Part 1, Transcripts (LDC2004T19). The Fisher telephone conversation collection protocol was created at LDC to address a critical need of developers trying to build robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Previous collection protocols, such as CALLFRIEND and Switchboard-II and the resulting corpora, have been adapted for ASR research but were in fact developed for language and speaker identification respectively. Although the CALLHOME protocol and corpora were developed to support ASR technology, they feature small numbers of speakers making telephone calls of relatively long duration with narrow vocabulary across the collection. CALLHOME conversations are challengingly natural and intimate. Under the Fisher protocol, a very large number of participants each make a few calls of short duration speaking to other participants, whom they typically do not know, about assigned topics. This maximizes inter-speaker variation and vocabulary breath while also increasing formality. Previous protocols such as CALLHOME, CALLFRIEND and Switchboard relied upon participant activity to drive the collection. Fisher is unique in being platform driven rather than participant driven. Participants who wish to initiate a call may do so; however the collection platform initiates the majority of calls. Participants need only answer their phones at the times they specified when registering for the study. To encourage a broad range of vocabulary, Fisher participants are asked to speak on an assigned topic which is selected at random from a list, which changes every 24 hours and which is assigned to all subjects paired on that day. Some topics are inherited or refined from previous Switchboard studies while others were developed specifically for the Fisher protocol. *Data* The individual audio files are presented in NIST SPHERE format, and contain two-channel mu-law sample data; "shorten" compression has been applied to all files. Data collection and transcription were sponsored by DARPA and the U.S. Department of Defense, as part of the EARS project for research and development in automatic speech recognition.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aCieri, Christopher10aGraff, David10aKimball, Owen10aMiller, Dave, 1960-10aWalker, Kevin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S1303541nmm a22003853i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245003700177264007300214336003800287336002600325337002600351338003200377500001500409500004500424506005100469520221000520546004802730655002002778700002002798700002102818700001802839700001902857700002102876700001802897700002302915856014902938856006803087m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        cze d  a15856328138 aLDC2004T018 aISLRN: 577-603-476-733-70 aczebeng07acesbeng2iso639-3  adc00aCzech Broadcast News Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004T01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aCzech Broadcast News Transcripts contains the transcripts corresponding to the Czech broadcast news audio published as Czech Broadcast News Speech. The audio recordings were collected from three Czech radio stations (Cesky rozhlas 1 Radiozurnal - CRo1, Cesky rozhlas 2 Praha - CRo2, Cesky rozhlas 3 Vltava - CRo3) and two TV channels (Ceska televize - CTV and Prima TV - Prima). The audio was recorded between February 1 and April 22, 2000, at the Department of Cybernetics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen. The corpus was created to support the development of large vocabulary speaker independent speech recognition systems for Czech. *Data* There are 286 transcripts, corresponding to the 286 audio files (approximately 50 hours of broadcast news). The transcripts contain approximatelly 196K words and 27K unique words. The news does not contain weather forecasts, sports news, or traffic announcements. The stations, channels, number of files and number of hours are listed below: Radio Source Files Hours CRo1 138 30.8 CRo2 90 7.8 CRo3 14 2 TV Source Files Hours CTV 22 5.1 Prima 22 4.2 The transcripts were created by native Czech speakers working at the Department of Cybernetics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, under the direction of Vlasta Radova. The transcription was done using software provided by the LDC (Transcriber 1.4.1). Those parts of the audio recordings that do not contain speech or where the signal was disrupted, were not transcribed. As a consequence, the corpus contains about 23 hours of transcribed speech. The transcriptions are provided both in the ISO-8859-2 and Windows-1250 character set.

This is a collection of Korean text with annotated morphological analysis and part-of-speech tags. The source text was extracted from the Korean Newswire corpus. The newswire corpus is a collection of Korean Press Agency news articles from June 2, 1994 to March 20, 2000. The portion included in this release consists of a small number of hand-picked articles. The corpus is part of the Korean Treebank Phase 2. Between 2001 and 2002, the project was conducted under subcontract from Cogentex Inc., sponsor number Cogentex 5-33436. The text was tokenized and then automatically analyzed using Klex. Since there can be multiple possible morphological analyses, the output was fed through a statistical ranking system in order to select the best possible analysis for the word in the text environment. The part-of-speech tagged result was then manually corrected by Seung-yun Yang and Na-Rae Han, graduate students in the University of Pennsylvania Linguistics Department. *Data* The data consists of one single file, totalling approximately 880KB in uncompressed form. The text contains 1,574 sentences with 41,024 words and 77,173 morphemes in total. The text file is in ksc-5601 encoding. Characters in Hangul (Korean alphabet) can be displayed with Korean X-terminals such as hanterm, or by selecting Korean encoding in common web browsers such as Netscape or Internet Explorer. The data is formatted as follows: one head word per line, the word and its morphologically analyzed output are separated by a tab. Each morpheme is followed by "/" and its part-of-speech; morphemes are separated by "+". ^EOS is a special symbol denoting the end of a sentence. Morphologically analyzed and part-of-speech tagged data can be useful in the following applications: training of statistical morphological analyzers and part-of-speech taggers, evaluation of pre-existing morphological analyzers and part-of-speech taggers. The morphologically tagged output is compatible with Klex: Finite-State Lexical Transducer for Korean. It also conforms to the Korean Treebank POS annotation standards.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Korean.

The Center for Spoken Language Understanding is attempting to address this problem with the Names Corpus. The Names Corpus is a collection of name utterances, both first and last names, from several thousand different speakers over the telephone. Name utterances are "spontaneous" in that the subject is not reading from a word list. Another area of active research is the development of name Recognition systems. The Names Corpus is a useful resource for addressing this problem. The utterances in this corpus were taken from many other telephone speech data collections that have been completed at the CSLU. In most data collections, the callers were asked to leave their name at some point. Also, the callers would occasionally leave their name in the midst of another utterance. The names in these situations were extracted out of the host utterance and added to the Names Corpus. Each file in the Names Corpus has an orthographic transcription following the CSLU Labeling Conventions. Also, to take advantage of the phonemic variability, many of the utterances have been phonetically transcribed. The selection of files to phonetically transcribe was constrained by a process that selected files that were suspected to contain phonetic contexts that had not yet been transcribed. Release 1.3 of this corpus contains 24,245 files. All of these have been phonetically labeled. Approximately 40% of the bigram phonemic contexts possible, without regard to language constraints, are represented.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aNames, PersonalxPronunciationvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aMuthusamy, Yeshwant Kumar, 1965-10aCole, Ronald Allan10aOshika, Beatrice403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006S3903743nmm a22004453i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245002900141264007300170336003800243336002600281337002600307338003200333500001500365500004500380506005100425520220400476546004202680650002202722650004202744650004502786650004202831655002002873700001602893700001802909700001502927700001902942700001902961700002002980700001603000700002403016700002103040700001903061856014903080856006803229m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        eng d  a15856328648 aLDC2004T048 aISLRN: 295-380-961-299-0  adc00aICSI Meeting Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004T04  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T041 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aICSI Meeting Transcripts was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004T04 and ISBN 1-58563-286-4. The ICSI Meeting corpus is a collection of 75 meetings collected at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley during the years 2000-2002. The meetings included are "natural" meetings in the sense that they would have occurred anyway: they are generally regular weekly meetings of various ICSI working teams, including the team working on the ICSI Meeting Project. In recording meetings of this type, we hoped to capture meeting dynamics and speaking styles that are as natural as possible given that speakers are wearing close-talking microphones and are fully cognizant of the recording process. The speech files range in length from 17 to 103 minutes, but generally run just under an hour each. The speech files are available as ICSI Meeting Speech. *Data* This corpus consists of 75 word-level transcripts (one transcript file per meeting), time-synchronized to digitized audio recordings. There are approximately 795 K-words and 13K unique words in the transcripts. The meetings were recorded with close-talking and far-field microphones. The transcripts were based mostly on the close-talking microphones, either separately or blended together in a so-called "mixed" channel. The focus of the transcripts was on capturing the flow of audible events, especially the words which were spoken, and who spoke them. Transcripts were prepared by means of the "Channeltrans" interface. Channeltrans is an extension of the "Transcriber" interface. There are a total of 53 unique speakers in the corpus. Meetings involved anywhere from three to 10 participants, averaging six. The corpus contains a significant proportion of non-native English speakers, varying in fluency from nearly-native to challenging-to-transcribe. *Sponsorship* The collection and preparation of this corpus was made possible in large part through funding from DARPA, both through the Communicator project and through a ROAR "seedling," the Swiss IM2 project (National Centre of Competence in Research, sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation), and a supplementary award from IBM.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aComputer science. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases. 0aSpeech processing systemsvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aJanin, Adam10aEdwards, Jane10aEllis, Dan10aGelbart, David10aMorgan, Nelson10aPeskin, Barbara10aPfau, Thilo10aShriberg, Elizabeth10aStolcke, Andreas10aWooters, Chuck403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T0402656nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245002500177264007300202336003800275336002600313337002600339338003200365500001500397500004500412506005100457520142700508546005901935655002001994700001902014700001902033700001702052700002002069856014902089856006802238m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        chi d  a15856328728 aLDC2004T058 aISLRN: 191-685-030-898-80 achibeng07acmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aChinese Treebank 4.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004T05  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T051 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aChinese Treebank 4.0 was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004T05 and ISBN 1-58563-287-2. The Penn Chinese Treebank is an ongoing project that started in the summer of 1998. The goal of the project is to create of a 500,000-word corpus of Chinese text with syntactic bracketing. Chinese Treebank 1.0 was first published in 2000. It was later corrected and released in 2001 as Chinese Treebank 2.0. More information about the project is available on the Penn Chinese Treebank website. The content used in this corpus comes from the following newswire sources: 698 articles Xinhua (1994-1998) 55 articles Information Services Department of HKSAR (1997) 80 articles Sinorama magazine, Taiwan (1996-1998 & 2000-2001) *Data* Chinese Treebank 4.0 contains 404,156 words, 664,633 Hanzi, 15,162 sentences, and 838 data files. All files are GB encoded. The format of Chinese Treebank 4.0 is the same as the Penn English Treebank. All files have been annotated at least twice. The first pass was done by one annotator, and the resulting files were checked by a second annotator (second pass). The corpus also provides seven files intended to serve as the gold standard annotation. The corpus provides four versions of files: bracketed, raw, segmented and postagged. The raw, segmented and postagged versions are generated from the bracketed version and so do not reflect the previous annotation stages.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

To support the development of automatic means for evaluating translation quality, the LDC was sponsored to solicit four sets of human translations for a single set of Mandarin Chinese source materials. Two similar corpora, Multiple-Translation Chinese Corpus, and Multiple-Translation Chinese Corpus Part 2 were published in 2002 and 2003. The 2002 corpus (Part 1), 2003 corpus (Part 2), and the present corpus used Chinese news articles from multiple sources and provide human translations for them. However, Part 1 also offers translations produced from various commercial-off-the-shelf-systems (COTS). In addition to human and COTS translations, Part 2 also offers translations from a TIDES research system, and provides human assessment for some of the automatic translations. *Data* Two sources of journalistic Mandarin Chinese text were selected to provide the Chinese material: - AFP News Service: 50 news stories - Xinhua News Service: 50 news stories (total: 100 stories) The data was drawn from the May and June 2002 collection of AFP and Xinhua news. The story selection from the two newswire collections was controlled by story length: all selected stories contain between about 230 and 564 Chinese characters. The overall count of Chinese characters by source is shown in the following table: AFP 22,135 Xinhua 20,321 --------------- total 42,456 For the Chinese data, there are approximately 21K-words, while for the English translation, there are approximately 100K-words in total, and 12K unique words. Four best translation teams were chosen from the 11 teams which had participated in the translation of Multiple Translation Chinese Corpus Part 1 (LDC2002T01) and Part 2 (LDC2003T17) to take part in the project. In accordance with the guidelines, each translation team was asked to return the first ten Xinhua stories for quality checking. This was to ensure that each translation team had indeed understood and was following the guidelines, and the translation quality was acceptable. The LDC sent the translations back to the translation team for any deviations from the guidelines or any quality issues detected. Subsequent translation submissions were continuously monitored for conformance and quality. Once the full set of translations was complete, a final pass of reformatting and validation was carried out, to assure alignability of segments, and to convert the translated texts into SGML format. Each translation team was also asked to fill out and return a questionnaire to describe their procedures and professional background. Please click here for a Chinese and an English example.

Hong Kong Hansards Parallel Text contains excerpts from the Official Record of Proceedings of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Hong Kong Laws Parallel Text contains law codes acquired from the Department of Justice of the HKSAR. Hong Kong News Parallel Text contains press releases from the Information Services Department of the HKSAR. Hong Kong Hansards Parallel Text, Hong Kong Laws Parallel Text and Hong Kong News Parallel Text were published in 2000. The 2000 versions of Hong Kong Hansards Parallel Text and Hong Kong News Parallel Text are aligned at the document level, while the 2004 versions are aligned at the sentence level. The 2000 and 2004 versions of Hong Kong News Parallel Text were aligned using different sentence alignment algorithms. As a result, the 2004 version has better sentence alignment and it also has slightly more data than the 2000 version. Chinese text is presented in the traditional script and encoded as BIG5. *Data* Hong Kong Hansards Hong Kong Hansards contains excerpts from the Official Record of Proceedings (hansards) of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR from October 1985 to April 2003. LDC downloaded the hansards, which were in pdf format, from the official website of HKSAR. A total of 1,428 files (714 in Chinese, 714 in English) were downloaded. One to one correspondence between the English hansards and the Chinese hansards is indicated by the file names. LDC converted the pdf files into plain text files using automatic conversion software and segmented the files at sentence boundaries. Efforts were made to remove tables from all files. Hong Kong Laws Hong Kong Laws contains statute laws of Hong Kong, downloaded from the Bilingual Laws Information System (BLIS, http://www.justice.gov.hk/), a searchable electronic database of the statute laws of Hong Kong, established and updated by the Department of Justice of the HKSAR, in 2000. The original BLIS database contains statute laws of Hong Kong in English and Chinese, constitutional instruments, national laws and other relevant instruments, collections of terms and expressions used in the laws of Hong Kong and subject indices of Ordinances. This corpus contains only statute laws of Hong Kong in English and Chinese, constitutional instruments, national laws and other relevant instruments published up to year 2000. The original files were in html format, and document level alignment was indicated by file names. LDC converted the html files into plain text files using automatic conversion software, and segmented the files at sentence boundaries. Efforts were made to remove tables from all files. Hong Kong News Hong Kong News contains press releases from July 1997 to October 2003 from the government of HKSAR. The HKSAR publishes press releases in both Chinese and English on a daily basis. Most press releases are available in both languages, some were translated from English to Chinese, some were translated from Chinese to English. The original files were in html format. LDC converted the html files into plain text files using automatic conversion software. Efforts were made to remove tables from all files. The original files do not indicate document level alignment in any way. The document level alignment was performed at LDC using an automatic document aligner. The document-aligned files were then segmented at sentence boundaries. Sentence alignment was performed on all data using Champollion, a parallel text sentence alignment tool developed at LDC. See http://champollion.sourceforge.net for more information about Champollion. Final Data Format and Validation For the Chinese data, there are approximately 49M-words, while for the English translation, there are approximately 59M-words in total, and 466K unique words.

The ISL Meeting Corpus Part 1 is a first subset of the ISL Meeting Corpus (112 meetings). It contains 18 meetings collected at the Interactive Systems Laboratories at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA during the years 2000-2001. The recorded meetings were either natural meetings where participants needed to meet in the real world, or artificial meetings, which were designed explicitly for the purposes of data collection but still had real topics and tasks. The duration of the meetings in this corpus ranges from eight to 64 minutes and averages at 34 minutes.The audio files are available as ISL Meeting Speech Part 1. *Data* This corpus consists of 19 word-level transcripts of 18 meetings (one transcription file per meeting, meeting m039 has two parts, m039a and m039b), time synchronized to digitized audio recordings. There are approximately 116,200 word tokens and 5,850 unique word types in the transcripts. The meetings were recorded with lapel microphones. The transcriptions were based on the lapel microphones recordings. The focus of the transcriptions was on capturing the flow of audible events, especially the words which were spoken, and who spoke them. The transcriptions contain additional annotations for spontaneous speech events and disfluencies. Transcriptions were prepared by means of the TransEdit transcription application. This application was developed for the transcription of multi-channel recordings and displays a synchronized multi-track view for all channels of a meeting with listening and segmentation function for each single channel separately. For an example transcript, please click here. There are a total of 31 unique speakers in the corpus. Meetings involved anywhere from three to nine participants, averaging at five. The corpus contains a significant proportion of non-native English speakers, varying in fluency. *Sponsorship* The collection and preparation of this corpus was made possible in large part through funding from DARPA, both through the GENOA project and through ROAR.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzUnited StatesxData processingvDatabases. 0aMeetingsxData processingvDatabases. 0aSpeech synthesisvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases. 0aNatural language processing (Computer science)7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aBurger, Susanne10aMacLaren, Victoria10aWaibel, Alex403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T1002633nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245003400177264007300211336003800284336002600322337002600348338003200374500001500406500004500421506005100466520133600517520005101853546005801904655002001962700002201982700001402004700002002018700001602038856014902054856006802203m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        ara d  a15856329888 aLDC2004T118 aISLRN: 026-183-445-670-40 aarabeng07aarbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aArabic Treebank: Part 3 v 1.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004T11  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T111 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aArabic Treebank: Part 3 v 1.0 was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004T11 and ISBN 1-58563-298-8. This publication is the third part of a corpus of 1,000,000 words of Arabic Treebank, designed to support language resear ch and development of language technology for Modern Standard Arabic. Part one was released in 2003 as Arabic Treebank: Part 1 v 2.0, having the source data extracted from Agence France Press stories. Part two was released in 2004 as Arabic Treebank: Part 2 v 2.0, having the source data extracted from Al-Hayat distributed by Ummah. The current Arabic Treebank: Part 3 v 1.0 corpus consists of stories from An Nahar News Agency. *Data* This corpus includes 600 stories from the An Nahar News Text. There are a total of 340,281 words (counting non-Arabic tokens such as numbers and punctuation) in the 600 files - one story per file. New features of annotation include complete vocalization (including case endings), lemma IDs, and more specific POS tags for verbs and particles. The corpus contains 293,035 Arabic-only word tokens (prior to the separation of clitics), of which 290,842 (99.25%) were provided with an acceptable morphological analysis and POS tag by the morphological parser, and 2,193 (0.75%) were items that the morphological parser failed to analyze correctly.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

This data was originally created to support the DARPA EARS (Efficient, Affordable, Reusable Speech-to-Text) Program in Metadata Extraction (MDE). The goal of EARS MDE is to enable technology that can take raw Speech-to-Text output and refine it into forms that are of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. The data in this release consists of English Conversational Telephone Speech (CTS) and Broadcast News (BN) transcripts and annotations. The corresponding speech data is available as MDE RT-03 Training Data Speech . *Data* There are 633 files, totalling approximately 747 MB with a total of 764,978 tokens. The transcripts and annotations cover approximately 20 hours of Broadcast News and over 40 hours of Conversational Telephone Speech data. The annotated data was originally developed to support the DARPA EARS Metadata Extraction (MDE) Program, and was distributed as training data for the RT-03F evaluation cycle. The CTS data was drawn from the Switchboard-1 Release 2 corpus. The BN speech data was drawn from the 1997 English Broadcast News Speech (HUB4) corpus, from four distinct sources: American Broadcasting Company (ABC) (1998, 2001) National Broadcasting Company (NBC) (1998, 2001) Public Radio International (PRI) (1998) Cable News Network (CNN) (2001) *Annotations* The transcripts within this corpus have been annotated for various kinds of metadata. The goal of MDE is to enable technology that can take raw Speech-To-Text output and refine it into forms that are of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. In simple terms, this means the creation of automatic transcripts that are maximally readable. To this end, LDC has defined a SimpleMDE annotation task. Under SimpleMDE, annotators identify four types of fillers: filled pauses like "uh" and "um," discourse markers like "you know," asides and parentheticals, and editing terms like "sorry" and "I mean." Edit disfluencies are also identified; the full extent of the disfluency (or string of adjacent disfluencies) and interruption points are tagged. Annotators further identify SUs (alternately semantic units, sense units, syntactic units, slash units or sentence units); that is, units within the discourse that function to express a complete thought or idea on the part of a speaker. As with disfluency annotation, the goal of SU labeling is to improve transcript readability, here by creating a transcript in which information is presented in small, structured, coherent chunks rather than long turns or stories. There are four types of sentence-level SUs: statements, questions, backchannels and incomplete SUs. To enhance inter-annotator consistency, the annotation task also identifies a number of sub-sentence SU boundaries (coordination and clausal SUs). The docs directory contains the complete set of SimpleMDE annotation guidelines used to create this data. *Data Format* The data appears in two formats. The AG Atlas (ag.xml) format represents the native annotation format, and utilizes the Annotation Graph Library. This data is best explored using the LDC MDE Toolkit, which is freely available at http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/MDE/Tools. The data is also provided in RTTM format developed by NIST to support the EARS Program. The RTTM format labels each token in the reference transcript according to the properties it displays: lexeme vs. non-lexeme; edit, filler, SU, etc. Please click here for a RTTM file example. General information about the EARS MDE Annotation effort, including free annotation tools, annotation guidelines and additional information can be found at LDC's EARS MDE Project Page.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aStrassel, Stephanie10aWalker, Christopher10aLee, Haejoong403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T1202789nmm a22003853i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245005500141264007300196336003800269336002600307337002600333338003200359500001500391500004500406506005100451520142600502546004201928655002001970700002201990700002002012700002502032700001902057700002402076700002602100700001902126700001702145700002402162856014902186856006802335m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        eng d  a15856330388 aLDC2004T138 aISLRN: 682-718-319-529-5  adc00aNIST Meeting Pilot Corpus Transcripts and Metadata  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004T13  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T131 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aNIST Meeting Pilot Corpus Transcripts and Metadata was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004T13 and ISBN 1-58563-303-8.

This is a semantic annotation of the Wall Street Journal section of Treebank-2. More specifically, each verb occurring in the Treebank has been treated as a semantic predicate and the surrounding text has been annotated for arguments and adjuncts of the predicate. The verbs have also been tagged with coarse grained senses and with inflectional information. This work was done in the Computer and Information Sciences Department at the University of Pennsylvania. All data is the result of double blind, adjudicated annotation. *Data* There are two basic components to Propbank: * The Verb Lexicon. A frames file, consisting of one or more frame sets, has been created for each verb occuring in the Treebank. These files serve as a reference for the annotators and for users of the data. 3,324 such files have been created, totalling about 5.5 MB of uncompressed data. * The Annotation. There are approximately 113,000 annotated verb tokens. These verb tokens include all those occurring in over one million words of the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank, excluding 'be' and auxiliary uses of 'do' and 'have.' There are annotations for over 3,200 unique verbs. These annotations are stored in a single file in standoff format, totalling ~9.6 MB of uncompressed data.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aPalmer, Martha10aKingsbury, Paul10aBabko-Malaya, Olga10aCotton, Scott10aSnyder, Benjamin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T1403295nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245004200141264007300183336003800256336002600294337002600320338003200346500001500378500004500393506005100438520194600489546004202435650008102477650004502558650001502603650005102618655002002669700001902689700002002708856014902728856006802877m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        eng d  a15856330548 aLDC2004T158 aISLRN: 451-626-470-363-6  adc00a2000 Communicator Dialogue Act Tagged  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004T15  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T151 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  a2000 Communicator Dialogue Act Tagged was produced by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004T15 and ISBN 1-58563-305-4. This corpus is an addendum to the 2000 Communicator Evaluation corpus produced by the LDC in 2002. This addendum contains annotations on the transcriptions of the system and user utterances as taken from the logfiles of the 2000 Communicator Evaluation corpus. Dialogue Act annotations are provided for system utterances in the dialogues. The dialogue act tags follow the DATE (Dialogue Act Tagging for Evaluation) scheme. In addition, both system and user utterances are tagged for named entities. For further description of the 2000 Communicator Evaluation corpus, please refer to the main publication from 2002 (LDC2002S56). *Data* The complete Dialogue Act annotated corpus is available as a single XML text file totalling approximately 16 MB. The total number of dialogues is 648. There are 314,223 words (tokens) and 1,403,985 unique words. Each dialogue is segmented into system and user turns. The total number of turns for the entire corpus is 24,728 (13,013 system turns and 11,715 user turns). Except for one system, no utterance segmentation was done within the turns in the logfiles. The number of utterances is therefore the same as the number of turns. Utterance segmentation is carried out and reflected as the dialogue act segmentation. The total number of tagged dialogue acts is 22,701 with 61 unique tags. There are a total of 275,938 words in the system utterances and a total of 38,285 words in the user utterances. Dialogue Act tagging was done automatically via pattern matching with human-labeled dialogue utterances used by the nine different participating Communicator Systems.

To support the development of automatic machine translation systems, the LDC was sponsored to solicit English translations for a single set of Arabic source materials. The source Arabic text was selected and translated in different LDC projects during the time period of November 2002 to February 2004. A total of about 441K Arabic words were selected from three sources, namely Xinhua, AFP, and An Nahar, and translation services were provided by eight translation agencies who translated each Arabic news story once. The Xinhua and An Nahar stories and their translations were created for TIDES Machine Translation, while the AFP stories and their English translations were created for TIDES TDT. The development of all these translations followed roughly the same guidelines and procedures. *Data* Three sources of journalistic Arabic text were selected to provide the Arabic material: - AFP News Service: 250 news stories, October 1998 - December 1998 - Xinhua News Service: 670 news stories, November 2001 - March 2002 - An Nahar: 606 news stories, October 2001 to December 2002 (total: 1,526 stories) The overall count of Arabic words by source is shown in the following table: AFP 44,193 Xinhua 99,514 An Nahar 297,533 ---------------- total 441,240 For the Arabic data, there are 441K-words, while for the English translation, there are approximately 581K-words in total, and 25K unique words. Each translation team was provided with translation guidelines. In accordance with the guidelines, each translation team was asked to return the first five stories for quality checking in each project. This was to ensure that each translation team had indeed understood and was following the guidelines, and the translation quality was acceptable. The LDC sent the translations back to the translation team for any deviations from the guidelines or any quality issues detected. Subsequent translation submissions were continuously monitored for conformance and quality. Once the full set of translations was complete, a final pass of reformatting and validation was carried out, to assure alignability of segments, and to convert the translated texts into SGML format. An Arabic-English bilingual LDC employee went through all the source data and English translations, and fixed any problems that had been found. For the present release, the corpus content is organized into source and translation directories, containing 1,526 files in source and 1,526 files in translation, one news story per file.  aContent in English and Standard Arabic.

It contains time-aligned transcript data for 5,850 complete conversations, each lasting up to 10 minutes. In addition to the transcriptions, which are found under the trans directory, there is a complete set of tables describing the speakers, the properties of the telephone calls, and the set of topics that were used to initiate the conversations. The corresponding speech files are contained in Fisher English Training Speech Part 1 Speech (LDC2004S13). The Fisher telephone conversation collection protocol was created at LDC to address a critical need of developers trying to build robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Previous collection protocols, such as CALLFRIEND and Switchboard-II and the resulting corpora, have been adapted for ASR research but were in fact developed for language and speaker identification respectively. Although the CALLHOME protocol and corpora were developed to support ASR technology, they feature small numbers of speakers making telephone calls of relatively long duration with narrow vocabulary across the collection. CALLHOME conversations are challengingly natural and intimate. Under the Fisher protocol, a large number of participants each calls an other participant, whom they typically do not know, for a short short period of time to discuss the assigned topics. This maximizes inter-speaker variation and vocabulary breath while also increasing formality. Previous protocols such as CALLHOME, CALLFRIEND and Switchboard relied upon participant activity to drive the collection. Fisher is unique in being platform driven rather than participant driven. Participants who wish to initiate a call may do so, however, the collection platform initiates the majority of calls. Participants need only answer their phones at the times they specified when registering for the study. To encourage a broad range of vocabulary, Fisher participants are asked to speak about an assigned topic chosen from a randomly generated list that changes every 24 hours. All participants that day will be assigned subjects from that list. Some topics are inherited or refined from previous Switchboard studies while others were developed specifically for the Fisher protocol. *Data* Overall, about 12% of the conversations were transcribed at LDC, and the rest were transcribed by BBN and WordWave using a significantly different approach to the task. A central goal in both sets was to maximize the speed and economy of the transcription process. This in turn involved certain aspects of mark-up detail and quality control that may have been common in previous, smaller corpora. The LDC transcripts were based on automatic segmentation of the audio data, to identify the utterance end-points on both channels of each conversation. Given these time stamps, manual transcription was simply a matter of typing in the words for each segment and doing a rudimentary spell-check. No attempt was made to modify the segmentation boundaries manually, or to locate utterances that the segmenter might have missed. Portions of speech where the transcriber could not be sure exactly what was said were marked with double parentheses -- (( ... )) -- and the transcriber could hazard a guess as to what was said, or leave the region between parentheses blank. The LDC transcription process yields one plain-text transcript file per conversation, in which the first two lines show the call-ID and the fact that the transcript was developed at LDC. The remainder of the file contains one utterance per line (with blank lines separating the utterances), with the start-time, end-time, speaker/channel-ID and utterance text. Data collection and transcription were sponsored by DARPA and the U.S. Department of Defense, as part of the EARS project for research and development in automatic speech recognition.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aCieri, Christopher10aGraff, David10aKimball, Owen10aMiller, Dave, 1960-10aWalker, Kevin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T1904156nmm a22004573i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245004200177264007300219336003800292336002600330337002600356338003200382500001500414500004500429506005100474520251300525520005103038546005803089650004903147650004203196650002703238650005103265655002003316700001603336700001703352700001803369700001603387700001803403700001903421700001903440700002203459856014903481856006803630m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2004    pau        u        ara d  a15856331948 aLDC2004T238 aISLRN: 034-001-778-929-80 aarabeng07aarbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aPrague Arabic Dependency Treebank 1.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2004]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2004T23  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T231 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aPrague Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) not only consists of multi-level linguistic annotations over the language of Modern Standard Arabic, but even provides a variety of unique software implementations designed for general use in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The PADT project might be summarized as an open-ended activity of the Center for Computational Linguistics, the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, and the Institute of Comparative Linguistics, Charles University in Prague, resting in multi-level annotation of Arabic language resources in the light of the theory of Functional Generative Description . The project is a younger sibling to Prague Dependency Treebank for Czech, and is maintained upon co-operation with the Linguistic Data Consortium, University of Pennsylvania, who release non-annotated corpora of Arabic newswire and develop an independent Penn Arabic Treebank. *Data * The corpus of PADT 1.0 consists of morphologically and analytically annotated newswire texts of Modern Standard Arabic, which originate from the Arabic Gigaword and the plain data of Penn Arabic Treebank, Part 1 and Penn Arabic Treebank, Part 2. The PADT 1.0 distribution comprises over 113,500 tokens of data annotated analytically and provided with the disambiguated morphological information. In addition, the release includes complete annotations of MorphoTrees resulting in more than 148,000 tokens, 49,000 of which have received the analytical processing.

Sentences of the Czech translation were automatically morphologically annotated and parsed into two levels (analytical and tectogrammatical) of dependency structures introduced in the theory of Functional Generative Description and closely related to the Prague Dependency Treebank project. The original English sentences were transformed from the Penn Treebank phrase-structure trees into dependency representations. A heldout (development and evaluation) set of 515 sentence pairs was selected and manually annotated on tectogrammatical level in both Czech and English; for the purposes of quantitative evaluation, this set has been retranslated from Czech into English by four different translation companies. PCEDT 1.0 also contains a parallel Czech-English corpus of plain text from Reader's Digest 1993-1996 consisting of 53,000 parallel sentences, and a large monolingual corpus of Czech (2.4 M sentences). The included Czech-English translation dictionary consists of 46,150 translation pairs in its lemmatized version and 496,673 pairs of word forms, where for each entry-translation pair all corresponding word form pairs have been generated. Also included is an English-Czech dictionary provided by Milan Svoboda under GNU/FDL license; this dictionary contains multi-word translations in 115,929 translation pairs. The next version of PCEDT intends to translate the whole Wall Street Journal part of the Penn Treebank, and to include reference retranslations for Czech. As the manual for tectogrammatical annotation of English gets created, the proportion of manually annotated data will increase. *Sponsorship* PCEDT 1.0 has been supported by the following grants and projects: * Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic project No. LN00A063 (Center for Computational Linguistics) * National Science Foundation grant No. IIS-0121285  aContent in Czech and English.

The other variants of Mandekan involved are the Bambara or Bamanankan [Mali] and the Maninka or Maninkakan [Guinea-Conakry]. The lack of written tradition makes such a dictionary project extremely important. Our expectation is that once this initial goal is reached, it will become easier to extend the dictionary to all the other varieties of Mandekan. LDC released a Maninkakan Lexicon (LDC2013L01) in 2013 and a Bamanankan Lexicon (LDC2016L01) in 2016. For the dictionary of a small language like Mawukakan (less than half of a million speakers) to be the most useful, it has to combine the linguistic component with a cultural component. The fact that the Mawukakan - English lexicon is coupled with a Mawukakan - French one makes this project a bit more important, given that Mawukakan speakers live mostly in the francophone area of West Africa. The project consists of the collection of the largest amount of data possible on the Mandekan and the Manding culture and making it available electronically for the research community. To pursue the objective defined above, the concept of dictionary-making adopted is the one being developed at the LDC. It is a very revolutionary approach to the lexicology of the languages which do not have a writing tradition. The originality of this project resides in the fact that it extends the scope of the lexical database behind that of a simple list of lexical entries. It suggests that the database includes, in addition to the lexicon itself, anything that can help to a better knowledge of the language and the culture of the Manding people. That means a collection of audio and video recordings, as well as all of the written materials available on the language and the culture. By adopting this concept, it becomes easy to preserve small languages like Mawukakan from a speedy death. In fact, apart from creating the best conditions for the popularization and standardization of the writing system of the concerned languages, the new approach to lexicology can contribute to minimizing significantly the cost of the research on those languages and cultures. Creating the largest electronic database possible on Mandekan and the Manding culture is more than suitable. The availability of such databases will contribute to an exposure of all of the aspects of that language and its culture. That can help popularize the writing system of the language and trigger more interest for its study. An access to such reference can only affect positively the research on the concerned language and culture. Because of its electronic nature, updating the database will be an easy and permanent exercise, dependent on the feedback received in reaction. That situation will also reduce to the strict minimum the number of fieldtrips the researchers interested in Mandekan need to take. Todays technological breakthroughs make such objectives not very difficult to reach. The powerful computers and modern dictionary-making tools available now have transformed lexicology into a more exciting enterprise than before. As for the Mawukakan lexicon we are making available here, anyone with a minimal training in linguistics should be capable of exploiting it. But for maximum and efficient exploitation of the global database which will result from this project, an initiation to the linguistic disciplines of Phonetics, Phonology and Syntax will be the most helpful. Our hope is that the final product be exploitable by linguists as well as all other researchers who are interested in the language and the culture of the Mandenkas. This explains, in part, our choice of the International Phonetic Alphabet [IPA] as the main transcription system of the Mawukakan. IPA is the least costly system for transcribing the African languages without a writing tradition, and for which an alphabet was defined only at the end of the 1950s, a period in which most of the colonies in West Africa became independent. *Data* Both the Toolbox and the XML versions of this dictionary use the Unicode (UTF-8) encoding. The Doulos SIL Unicode font works well, as do a number of other fonts displaying ASCII, Latin-1 (U+00A0 through U+00FF), Latin Extended-A (U+0100 through U+017F), Latin Extended B (U+0180 through U+024F), IPA extensions (U+0250 through U+02AF) and Combining Diacritic Marks (U+300 through U+36F). *Acknowledgement* Meghan Glenn served as an editor for the French and English parts of this Lexicon.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mahou, French, and English.

The corresponding human annotated transcripts are contained in Arabic CTS Levantine Fisher Training Data Set 3, Transcripts (LDC2005T03). The Fisher telephone conversation collection protocol was created at LDC to address a critical need of developers trying to build robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Previous collection protocols, such as CALLFRIEND and Switchboard-II and the resulting corpora, have been adapted for ASR research but were in fact developed for language and speaker identification respectively. Although the CALLHOME protocol and corpora were developed to support ASR technology, they feature small numbers of speakers making telephone calls of relatively long duration with narrow vocabulary across the collection. CALLHOME conversations were challengingly natural and intimate. Under the Fisher protocol, a very large number of participants each made a few calls of short duration speaking to other participants, whom they typically did not know, about assigned topics. This maximized inter-speaker variation and vocabulary breadth although it also increased formality. Previous protocols such as CALLHOME, CALLFRIEND and Switchboard relied upon participant activity to drive the collection. Fisher was unique in being platform driven rather than participant driven. Participants who wished to initiate a call did so; however, the collection platform initiated the majority of calls. Participants simply answered their phones at the times they specified when registering for the study. To encourage a broad range of vocabulary, Fisher participants were asked to speak about an assigned topic chosen from a randomly generated list that changed every 24 hours. All participants that day were assigned subjects from that list. Some topics were inherited or refined from previous Switchboard studies while others were developed specifically for the Fisher protocol.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in North Levantine Arabic and South Levantine Arabic.

Additional information regarding the speakers involved, and types of telephones used, can be found in the companion text corpus of transcripts, Fisher English Training Part 2, Transcripts (LDC2005T19).

Taken as a whole, the two parts comprise 11,699 recorded telephone conversations. The individual audio files are presented in NIST SPHERE format, and contain two-channel mu-law sample data; "shorten" compression has been applied to all files.

More information about the project is available on the Penn Chinese Treebank website. The content used in this corpus comes from the following newswire sources: 698 articles Xinhua (1994-1998) 55 articles Information Services Department of HKSAR (1997) 132 articles Sinorama magazine, Taiwan (1996-1998 & 2000-2001) *Data* Chinese Treebank 5.0 contains 507,222 words, 824,983 Hanzi, 18,782 sentences, and 890 data files. All files are GB encoded. The format of Chinese Treebank 5.0 is the same as the Penn English Treebank. All files have been annotated at least twice. The first pass was done by one annotator, and the resulting files were checked by a second annotator (second pass). Some files were also double-blind annotated and then adjudicated to create gold standard files. The corpus provides four versions of files: bracketed, raw, segmented and postagged. The raw, segmented and postagged versions are generated from the bracketed version and so do not reflect the previous annotation stages. The bracketed files are sequentially named as follows: chtb_nnnn.fid, where nnnn is a sequential file number.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

This corpus is a re-release of part one of that project, with the addition in Version 3.0 of improved morphological/part-of-speech annotation (including full vocalization and case endings). *Data* The project targets the description of a written Modern Standard Arabic corpus from the Agence France Presse (AFP) newswire archives for July-November 2000 (files dated 20000/7/15 to 2000/11/15). This corpus includes 734 stories representing 145,386 words (166,068 tokens after clitic segmentation in the Treebank; the number of Arabic tokens is 123,796). For this work, annotators must be native speakers of Arabic, and they must understand enough linguistics to check morphosyntactic analysis and build syntactic structures.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

This training speech release consists of 322 conversations, representing a total of approximately 50 hours of Levantine Arabic speech. The Fisher telephone conversation collection protocol was created at LDC to address a critical need of developers trying to build robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Previous collection protocols, such as CALLFRIEND and Switchboard-II and the resulting corpora, have been adapted for ASR research but were in fact developed for language and speaker identification respectively. Although the CALLHOME protocol and corpora were developed to support ASR technology, they feature small numbers of speakers making telephone calls of relatively long duration with narrow vocabulary across the collection. CALLHOME conversations are challengingly natural and intimate. Under the Fisher protocol, a very large number of participants each make a few calls of short duration speaking to other participants, whom they typically do not know, about assigned topics. This maximizes inter-speaker variation and vocabulary breadth although it also increases formality. Previous protocols such as CALLHOME, CALLFRIEND and Switchboard relied upon participant activity to drive the collection. Fisher is unique in being platform driven rather than participant driven. Participants who wish to initiate a call may do so; however the collection platform initiates the majority of calls. Participants need only answer their phones at the times they specified when registering for the study. To encourage a broad range of vocabulary, Fisher participants are asked to speak on an assigned topic which is selected at random from a list, which changes every 24 hours and which is assigned to all subjects paired on that day. Some topics are inherited or refined from previous Switchboard studies while others were developed specifically for the Fisher protocol.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in North Levantine Arabic and South Levantine Arabic.

To support the development of automatic means for evaluating translation quality, LDC was sponsored to solicit four sets of human translations for a single set of Arabic source materials. LDC was also asked to produce translations from various commercial-off-the-shelf-systems (COTS, including commercial Machine Translation (MT) systems as well as MT systems available on the Internet). This corpus contains two sets of COTS outputs and one output set from a TIDES 2003 MT Evaluation participant, which is representative for the state-of-the-art research systems. To determine if automatic evaluation systems such as BLEU track human assessment, LDC also performed human assessment on the two COTS outputs and the TIDES research system. The corpus includes the assessment results for one of the two COTS systems, the assessment result for the TIDES research system, and the specifications used for conducting the assessments. *Source Data Selection:* * Xinhua News Service (Xinhua): 50 news stories * Agence France Presse (AFP): 50 news stories (total: 100 stories) There are 100 source files and 700 translation files. All source data were drawn from January and February 2003 collection of Xinhua Arabic data and AFP Arabic data. The story selection from the two newswire collections was controlled by story length: all selected stories contain between 700 and 1,500 Arabic characters.

This release contains the English training data prepared for the 2004 Time Expression Recognition and Normalization (TERN) Evaluation, sponsored by the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program. The evaluation was held in August 2004 and a workshop in September 2004. Evaluation participants received this data for training purposes, and it is now being released for general use. The annotation specifications for this corpus were developed under DARPA's Translingual Information Detection Extraction and Summarization (TIDES) program, with continuing support from ACE. The purpose of this corpus and the TERN evaluation is to advance the state of the art in the automatic recognition and normalization of natural language temporal expressions. In most language contexts such expressions are indexical. For example, with "Monday," "last week," or "three months starting October 1," one must know the narrative reference time in order to pinpoint the time interval being conveyed by the expression. In addition, for data exchange purposes, it is essential that the identified interval be rendered according to an established standard, i.e., normalized. Accurate identification and normalization of temporal expressions is in turn essential for the temporal reasoning being demanded by advanced NLP applications such as question answering, information extraction, and summarization.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aFerro, Lisa10aGerber, Laurie10aHitzeman, Janet10aLima, Elizabeth10aSundheim, Beth403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T0702127nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245002400141264007300165336003800238336002600276337002600302338003200328500001500360500004500375506005100420520056800471520005101039546004201090650003901132650005301171650004201224650005801266650003901324650004301363655002001406700001801426700001901444700001601463700002101479856014901500856006801649m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2005    pau        u        eng d  a15856332088 aLDC2005T088 aISLRN: 983-656-398-539-6  adc00aDiscourse Graphbank  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2005]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2005T08  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T081 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aAs Florian Wolf's Ph.D thesis, the Discourse Treebank aimed to define a descriptively adequate data structure for representing discourse coherence structures.

This corpus was created with support from the DARPA TIDES Program and LDC. *Data* Three major annotation tasks are represented in this release: Topic Creation, Clarification Form Responses, and Relevance Assessment. Topics include a short title, query plus context, and a number of limiting parameters known as metadata which include targeted geographical region, target data domain or genre, and level of searcher expertise. Clarification Forms are brief HTML questionnaires system developers submitted to LDC searchers to glean additional information about information needs directly from the topic creators. Relevance assessment consisted of adjudication of pooled system responses, and included document-level judgments for all topics, and passage-level relevance judgments for a subset of topics. The release is divided into training and evaluation resources. The training set comprises twenty-one topics and 100 document-level relevance judgments per topic. The evaluation set contains fifty topics, clarification forms and responses, document-level relevance assessment for all topics and passage-level judgments for half of the topics. HARD participants received the reference data over the course of the evaluation cycle in stages: (0) training topics, (1) evaluation topic descriptions without metadata, (2) clarification form responses, (3) topic descriptions with metadata, and (4) relevance assessments.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aInformation retrievalvDatabases. 0aMetadatabases. 0aEnglish languagevDatabases. 0aBroadcast journalismvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.10aStrassel, Stephanie10aGlenn, Meghan403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T2903768nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245002500141264007300166336003800239336003300277337002600310338003200336500001500368500004500383506005100428520254400479520005103023546004203074655002803116700002403144700002203168700003503190856014903225856006803374m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2013    pau        u        eng d  a15856366068 aLDC2013S098 aISLRN: 030-491-638-667-9  adc00aCSC Deceptive Speech  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2013]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2013S09  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013S091 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aCSC Deceptive Speech was developed by Columbia University, SRI International and University of Colorado Boulder. It consists of 32 hours of audio interviews from 32 native speakers of Standard American English (16 male,16 female) recruited from the Columbia University student population and the community. The purpose of the study was to distinguish deceptive speech from non-deceptive speech using machine learning techniques on extracted features from the corpus. The participants were told that they were participating in a communication experiment which sought to identify people who fit the profile of the top entrepreneurs in America. To this end, the participants performed tasks and answered questions in six areas. They were later told that they had received low scores in some of those areas and did not fit the profile. The subjects then participated in an interview where they were told to convince the interviewer that they had actually achieved high scores in all areas and that they did indeed fit the profile. The task of the interviewer was to determine how he thought the subjects had actually performed, and he was allowed to ask them any questions other than those that were part of the performed tasks. For each question from the interviewer, subjects were asked to indicate whether the reply was true or contained any false information by pressing one of two pedals hidden from the interviewer under a table. *Data* Interviews were conducted in a double-walled sound booth and recorded to digital audio tape on two channels using Crown CM311A Differoid headworn close-talking microphones, then downsampled to 16kHz before processing. The interviews were orthographically transcribed by hand using the NIST EARS transcription guidelines. Labels for local lies were obtained automatically from the pedal-press data and hand-corrected for alignment, and labels for global lies were annotated during transcription based on the known scores of the subjects versus their reported scores. The orthographic transcription was force-aligned using the SRI telephone speech recognizer adapted for full-bandwidth recordings. There are several segmentations associated with the corpus: the implicit segmentation of the pedal presses, derived semi-automatically sentence-like units (EARS SLASH-UNITS or SUs) which were hand labeled, intonational phrase units and the units corresponding to each topic of the interview. Transcript files are in .trs format and audio files are .wav presented in flac-compressed form for this release.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aColumbia University10aSRI International10aUniversity of Colorado Boulder403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013S0903252nmm a22003973i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245002500182264007300207336003800280336002600318337002600344338003200370500001500402500004500417506005100462520186100513520005102374546007102425655002002496700001702516700001902533700001702552700001902569700001302588700001902601700001702620856014902637856006802786m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2013    pau        u        chi d  a15856366148 aLDC2013T218 aISLRN: 860-172-183-494-40 achibeng07acmnazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aChinese Treebank 8.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2013]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2013T21  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T211 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aChinese Treebank 8.0 consists of approximately 1.5 million words of annotated and parsed text from Chinese newswire, government documents, magazine articles, various broadcast news and broadcast conversation programs, web newsgroups and weblogs. The Chinese Treebank project began at the University of Pennsylvania in 1998, continued at the University of Colorado and then moved to Brandeis University. The project goal is to provide a large, part-of-speech tagged and fully bracketed Chinese language corpus. The first delivery, Chinese Treebank 1.0, contained 100,000 syntactically annotated words from Xinhua News Agency newswire. It was later corrected and released in 2001 as Chinese Treebank 2.0 (LDC2001T11) and consisted of approximately 100,000 words. LDC released Chinese Treebank 4.0 (LDC2004T05), an updated version containing roughly 400,000 words, in 2004. A year later, LDC published the 500,000 word Chinese Treebank 5.0 (LDC2005T01). Chinese Treebank 6.0 (LDC2007T36), released in 2007, consisted of 780,000 words. Chinese Treebank 7.0 (LDC2010T08), released in 2010, added new annotated newswire data, broadcast material and web text to the approximate total of one million words. Chinese Treebank 8.0 adds new annotated data from newswire, magazine articles and government documents. *Data* There are 3,007 text files in this release, containing 71,369 sentences, 1,620,561 words, 2,589,848 characters (hanzi or foreign). The data is provided in UTF-8 encoding, and the annotation has Penn Treebank-style labeled brackets. Details of the annotation standard can be found in the segmentation, POS-tagging and bracketing guidelines included in this release. The data is provided in four different formats: raw text, word segmented, POS-tagged and syntactically bracketed formats. All files were automatically verified and manually checked.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

This publication contains the complete set of English, Arabic and Chinese training data for the 2004 Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) technology evaluation. The corpus consists of data of various types annotated for entities and relations and was created by Linguistic Data Consortium with support from the ACE Program, with additional assistance from the DARPA TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization) Program. This data was previously distributed as an e-corpus (LDC2004E17) to participants in the 2004 ACE evaluation. The objective of the ACE program is to develop automatic content extraction technology to support automatic processing of human language in text form. In September 2004, sites were evaluated on system performance in six areas: Entity Detection and Recognition (EDR), Entity Mention Detection (EMD), EDR Co-reference, Relation Detection and Recognition (RDR), Relation Mention Detection (RMD), and RDR given reference entities. All tasks were evaluated in three languages: English, Chinese and Arabic. The current publication consists of the official training data for these evaluation tasks. A seventh evaluation area, Timex Detection and Recognition, is supported by the ACE Time Normalization (TERN) 2004 English Training Data Corpus (LDC2005T07). The TERN corpus source data largely overlaps with the English source data contained in the current release. A complete description of the ACE 2004 Evaluation can be found on the ACE Program website maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/ For more information about linguistic resources for the ACE program, including annotation guidelines, task definitions, free annotation tools and other documentation, please visit LDC's ACE website.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Standard Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese.

It contains annotations of multi-genre English texts for anaphoric relations with information about agreement and explicit representation of multiple antecedents for ambiguous anaphoric expressions and discourse antecedents for expressions which refer to abstract entities such as events, actions and plans. The source texts in this release include task-oriented dialogues from the TRAINS-91 and TRAINS-93 corpora (the latter released through LDC, TRAINS Spoken Dialog Corpus LDC95S25), narratives from the English Pear Stories (a collection of narratives by subjects who watched a film and then recounted its contents), articles from the Wall Street Journal portions of the Penn Treebank (Treebank-2 LDC95T7) and the RST Discourse Treebank LDC2002T07, and the Vieira/Poesio Corpus which consists of training and test files from Treebank-2 and RST Discourse Treebank. *Data* The texts were annotated using the ARRAU guidelines which treat all noun phrases (NPs) as markables. Different semantic roles are recognized by distinguishing between referring expressions (that update or refer to a discourse model), and non-referring ones (including expletives, predicative expressions, quantifiers, and coordination). A variety of linguistic features were also annotated, including morphosyntactic agreement, grammatical function, semantic type (person, animate, concrete, action, time, other abstract) and genericity. The annotation was carried out using the MMAX2 annotation tool which allows text units to be marked at different levels. The files in MMAX format have been organized so that they can be visualized using the MMAX2 tool or directly used as input/output for the BART toolkit which performs automatic coreference resolution including all necessary preprocessing steps.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aPoesio, Massimo10aArtstein, Ron10aUryupina, Olga10aRodriguez, Kepa10aDelogu, Francesca10aBristot, Antonella10aHitzeman, Janet403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T2201714nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245001200141264007300153336003800226336002600264337002600290338003200316500001500348500004500363506005100408520040000459520005100859546004200910650004200952650005300994650003801047655002001085700002301105700001901128856014901147856006801296m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2005    pau        u        eng d  a15856334028 aLDC2005T138 aISLRN: 181-921-208-336-7  adc00aCCGbank  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2005]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2005T13  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T131 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aCCGbank is a translation of the Penn Treebank into a corpus of Combinatory Categorial Grammar derivations.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation. Other releases available in this series are: * GALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging Training Part 1 -- Newswire and Web (LDC2012T16) * GALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging Training Part 2 -- Newswire (LDC2012T20) * GALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging Training Part 3 -- Web (LDC2012T24) * GALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging Training Part 4 -- Web (LDC2013T05) *Data* This release consists of Chinese source broadcast conversation (BC) and broadcast news (BN) programming collected by LDC in 2005 - 2007.

One token is equivalent to one character and one word is equivalent to 1.5 characters. The Chinese word alignment tasks consisted of the following components: * Identifying, aligning, and tagging 8 different types of links * Identifying, attaching, and tagging local-level unmatched words * Identifying and tagging sentence/discourse-level unmatched words * Identifying and tagging all instances of Chinese 的(DE) except when they were a part of a semantic link.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, and Chinese.

It consists of time-aligned transcripts for the speech contained in Fisher English Training Part 2, Speech (LDC2005S13). The Fisher telephone conversation collection protocol was created at the LDC to address a critical need of developers trying to build robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Previous collection protocols, such as CALLFRIEND and Switchboard-II and the resulting corpora, have been adapted for ASR research but were in fact developed for language and speaker identification respectively. Although the CALLHOME protocol and corpora were developed to support ASR technology, they feature small numbers of speakers making telephone calls of relatively long duration with narrow vocabulary across the collection. CALLHOME conversations are challengingly natural and intimate. Under the Fisher protocol, a large number of participants each calls an other participant, whom they typically do not know, for a short short period of time to discuss the assigned topics. This maximizes inter-speaker variation and vocabulary breath while also increasing formality. Previous protocols such as CALLHOME, CALLFRIEND and Switchboard relied upon participant activity to drive the collection. Fisher is unique in being platform driven rather than participant driven. Participants who wish to initiate a call may do so however the collection platform initiates the majority of calls. Participants need only answer their phones at the times they specified when registering for the study. To encourage a broad range of vocabulary, Fisher participants are asked to speak on an assigned topic which is selected at random from a list, which changes every 24 hours and which is assigned to all subjects paired on that day. Some topics are inherited or refined from previous Switchboard studies while others were developed specifically for the Fisher protocol. *Data* The first half of the collection (Fisher English Training Speech,Part 1) was released by the LDC in 2004 (LDC2004S13 for speech data,LDC2004T19 for transcripts). Taken as a whole, the two parts comprise11,699 recorded telephone conversations. The individual audio files are presented in NIST SPHERE format, and contain two-channel mu-law sample data shorten compression has been applied to all files. Data collection and transcription were sponsored by DARPA and the U.S. Department of Defense, as part of the EARS project for research and development in automatic speech recognition.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aCieri, Christopher10aGraff, David10aKimball, Owen10aMiller, Dave, 1960-10aWalker, Kevin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T1902371nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001200090024002900102042000700131245005300138264007300191336003800264336003300302337002600335338003200361500001200393500004200405506005100447520101500498520005101513546004201564655002801606700002201634700001901656700002301675700002401698700002201722700002301744700001601767856014901783856006501932m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1993    pau        u        eng d  a15856301958 aLDC93S18 aISLRN: 664-033-662-630-6  adc00aTIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1993]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC93S1  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S11 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe TIMIT corpus of read speech is designed to provide speech data for acoustic-phonetic studies and for the development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems.

The corpus actually consists of two sub-corpora: "Stonehenge" and "Waterloo." The Stonehenge corpus contains road rally planning conversations as well as some read speech collected using high quality microphones and a telephone-simulating filter. The Waterloo corpus contains read road rally planning domain speech which was collected using actual telephone lines.* Stonehenge The Stonehenge corpus was collected from subjects using telephone handsets which were modified to contain a high quality microphone. To gather conversational data, two talkers were located in separate rooms, given a road map and asked to participate in a road rally planning task. Their objective was to form a path between two locations on the map which would maximize their road rally point score. They were also given a time limit in which to complete the task to increase their responsiveness. Their speech was recorded on a stereo tape recorder with each subject's speech on a separate track. The tracks were digitized and the speech was edited to remove silences longer than a second or so. This resulted in approximately three minutes of continuous speech per subject. The speech was filtered using a 300Hz to 3300Hz PCM FIR bandpass filter to simulate telephone bandwidth quality. The Stonehenge corpus consists of 80 speakers; 28 females and 52 males.* Waterloo The Waterloo corpus was collected as an extension to Stonehenge to provide similar domain speech under different conditions. The corpus was collected from subjects using conventional telephones and dialed up telephone lines in the Massachussetts area. Unlike the Stonehenge speech, the Waterloo speech is naturally band-limited by the telephones/lines but for consistency, the speech was also filtered using the Stonehenge 300Hz to 3300Hz PCM FIR bandpass filter. The corpus consists of 56 speakers (28 males and 28 females) each reading aloud a paragraph of road rally domain speech.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1103777nmm a22002773i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245002500139264007300164336003800237336003300275337002600308338003200334500001300366500004300379506005100422520274100473546004203214655002803256856014903284856006603433m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1993    pau        u        eng d  a15856300988 aLDC93S128 aISLRN: 777-455-577-608-1  adc00aHCRC Map Task Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1993]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC93S12  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S121 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aOriginally published as set of eight CD-ROMS, the Map Task Corpus is now delivred as a web download. The contents of each disc reside in seprate directories with the same structure as the original set. The Map Task Corpus contains a total of about 18 hours of spontaneous speech that was recorded from 128 two-person conversations, involving 64 different speakers (32 female, 32 male, all adults, each taking part in four conversations). The 64 speakers were all students at the University of Glasgow, 61 of them being native Scots. The conversations were carried out in an experimental setting, in which each participant has a schematic map in front of them, not visible to the other. Each map is comprised of an outline and roughly a dozen labelled features (e.g. a white cottage, an oak forest, Green Bay, etc). Most features are common to the two maps, but not all. One map has a route drawn in, the other does not. The task is for the participant without the route to draw one on the basis of discussion with the participant with the route. In addition to the conversations, each speaker provides a wordlist reading, consisting of the major vocabulary items contained in the conversations. The experimental design allows a number of different phonemic, syntactico-semantic and pragmatic contrasts to be explored in a controlled way. In particular, maps and feature names were designed to allow for controlled exploration of phonological reductions of various kinds in a number of different referential contexts and to provide, via varying patterns of matches and mis-matches between the two maps, a range of different stimuli for referent negotiation. Also the conditions of the conversations were carefully balanced: In half of them the talkers were strangers, in half friends in half of them the talkers could see each others faces, in half they could not. The waveform data are provided in raw (headerless) files (16-bit samples, 20 kHz sample rate, two channels per conversation) and alternative header files are provided for use with software based on either the NIST SPHERE header structure or the European SAM header structure. Text transcriptions are provided for each conversation, along with PostScript files of the map images used in the experiments. Additional materials include full documentation of the experimental design and data collection protocol, resources for using SGML tools on the transcriptions and other text materials and an extensive set of source code for performing basic signal processing functions on the waveform data, such as down-sampling, de-multiplexing, channel summation and D/A conversion for Sun workstations (including playback of segments selected via inspection of transcripts in Emacs).  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1202348nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001200090024002900102042000700131245001100138264007300149336003800222336003300260337002600293338003200319500001200351500004200363506005100405520108300456546004201539655002801581700002301609700002601632700003301658700002301691700002301714700001701737700001801754856014901772856006501921m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1993    pau        u        eng d  a15856301018 aLDC93S28 aISLRN: 032-224-820-254-0  adc00aNTIMIT  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1993]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC93S2  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S21 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aNTIMIT was developed by the NYNEX Science and Technology Speech Communication Group to provide a telephone bandwidth adjunct to TIMIT (LDC93S1). NTIMIT was collected by transmitting all 6,300 original TIMIT recordings through a telephone handset and over various channels in the NYNEX telephone network and redigitizing them. The recordings were transmitted through ten Local Access and Transport Areas, half of which required the use of long-distance carriers. In order to calibrate the transmission characteristics of the various channels, stationary 1 kHz and frequency-sweeping tones were also recorded for each of the transmission channels. The re-recorded waveforms were time-aligned with the original TIMIT waveforms so that the TIMIT time-aligned transcriptions can be used with NTIMIT as well.

ICASSP-90, April 1990.

There are two main parts, often referred to as RM1 and RM2. RM1 contains three sections, Speaker-Dependent (SD) training data, Speaker-Independent (SI) training data and test and evaluation data. RM2 has an additional and larger SD data set, including test material. Resource Management Complete Set 2.0 contains RM1 and RM2. All RM material consists of read sentences modeled after a naval resource management task. The complete corpus contains over 25,000 utterances from more than 160 speakers representing a variety of American dialects. The material was recorded at 16KHz, with 16-bit resolution, using a Sennheiser HMD-414 headset microphone. All discs conform to the ISO-9660 data format. Resource Managment SD and SI Training and Test Data (RM1) The Speaker-Dependent (SD) Training Data contains 12 subjects, each reading a set of 600 "training sentences," two "dialect" sentences and ten "rapid adaptation" sentences, for a total of 7,344 recorded sentence utterances. The 600 sentences designated as training cover 97 of the lexical items in the corpus. The Speaker-Independent (SI) Training Data contains 80 speakers, each reading two "dialect" sentences plus 40 sentences from the Resource Management text corpus, for a total of 3,360 recorded sentence utterances. Any given sentence from a set of 1,600 Resource Management sentence texts was recorded by two subjects, while no sentence was read twice by the same subject. RM1 contains all SD and SI system test material used in five DARPA benchmark tests conducted in March and October of 1987, June 1988, and February and October 1989, along with scoring and diagnostic software and documentation for those tests. Documentation is also provided outlining use of the Resource Management training and test material at CMU in development of the SPHINX system. Example output and scored results for state-of-the-art speaker-dependent and speaker-independent systems (i.e. the BBN BYBLOS and CMU SPHINX systems) for the October 1989 benchmark tests are included. Extended Resource Management Speaker-Dependent Corpus (RM2) This set forms a speaker-dependent extension to the Resource Management (RM1) corpus.

ATIS0 Pilot contains spontaneous utterances elicited in a "Wizard-of-Oz" simulation, along with the relational database containing the travel information (excluding connecting flights). 36 speakers produced a total of 912 utterances. ATIS0 Read contains "read" versions of the spontaneous utterances for 20 of the 36 speakers above, for a total of 478 productions.

They read a total of 3,171 utterances, or approximately 317 utterances per speaker. This data was collected for the purpose of training speaker-dependent speech recognition systems for the ATIS0 domain. This section also contains the close-talking (Sennheiser) microphone data and corresponding data for the desk-top (Crown PCC-160) microphone.

All utterances have been transcribed and almost 10,000 of them annotated with categorizations and canonical reference answers. Unlike the ATIS0 corpus, much of the data in ATIS2 was collected using partially or fully-automated data collection systems. The fully-automated data collection systems were, in fact, working ATIS prototypes. For ATIS2, the ten-city relational database of ATIS0 was revised to accommodate connecting flights and fares and some table headings were renamed. In addition to training data, the February and November '92 ATIS Benchmark Tests are included as well. Each contains approximately 1,000 utterances from the pool of data collected by the five sites.

The first two CSR Corpora consist primarily of read speech with texts drawn from a machine-readable corpus of Wall Street Journal news text and are thus often known as WSJ0 and WSJ1. (Later sections of the CSR set of corpora, however, will consist of read texts from other sources of North American business news and eventually from other news domains). The texts to be read were selected to fall within either a 5,000-word or a 20,000-word subset of the WSJ text corpus. (See the documentation for details).

(TI) in 1980 and used initially in performance assessment tests of isolated-word speaker-dependent technology. (See "Speech Recognition: Turning Theory to Practice" by G. R. Doddington and T. B. Schalk, in IEEE Spectrum, Vol. 18, No. 9, September 1981.) The 46-word vocabulary consists of two sub-vocabularies: (1) the TI 20-word vocabulary (consisting of the digits zero through nine plus the words "enter," "erase," "go," "help," "no," "rubout," "repeat," "stop," "start," and "yes" as well as (2) the TI 26-word "alphabet set" (consisting of the letters "a" through "z"). *Data* The corpus contains read utterances from 16 speakers (eight males and eight females) each speaking 26 utterances of the 46-word vocabulary: 16 tokens designated as training and ten as test. Note these numbers reflect the aim of the collection and for various reasons, the full number of utterances was not reached for some speakers. See the included documentation for more information. The corpus was collected at Texas Instruments in a quiet acoustic enclosure using an Electro-Voice RE-16 Dynamic Cardiod microphone at 12.5kHz sample rate with 12-bit quantization. The files are in NIST SPHERE format and have a ".wav" filename extension.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aLiberman, Mark10aAmsler, Robert10aChurch, Ken10aFox, Ed10aHafner, Carole10aKlavans, Judy10aMarcus, Mitchell P., 1950-10aMercer, Bob10aPedersen, Jan10aRoossin, Paul10aWalker, Don10aWarwick, Susan10aZampolli, Antonio403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S903400nmm a22002773i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001200090024002900102042000700131245001200138264007300150336003800223336002600261337002600287338003200313500001200345500004200357506005100399520239600450546004202846655002002888856014902908856006503057m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1993    pau        u        eng d  a15856300048 aLDC93T18 aISLRN: 663-248-563-590-7  adc00aACL/DCI  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1993]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC93T1  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93T11 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aACL Data Collection Initiative contains text from the Wall Street Journal, the Collins English Dictionary, scientific abstracts provided by the U.S. Department of Energy and a variety of grammatically tagged and parsed materials from the Treebank project at the University of Pennsylvania. The total amount of uncompressed text is 620 Mbytes. The many formats of the original texts have been mapped into a markup language consistent with the SGML standard (ISO 8879). The format of the material from the Wall Street Journal uses a labelled bracketing, expressed in the style of SGML, although no formal SGML DTD is provided. The tag set has been modified by turning the Dow Jones header categories into tags and by creating ad hoc tags such as "". The original datelines are presented as separate text units; the text is divided and tagged into paragraphs and sentences with each sentence presented on a single line. Nothing has been done to modify the typographical methods used to subdivide headlines and stories into sections, nor are any of the text features within sentences (quotes, ellipsis, etc.) normalized. The Collins English Dictionary is present in two forms. One form was approximately parsed into fielded records as an exercise in learning a language called "FIT", by a student working under the direction of Lloyd Nakatani at ATT Bell Laboratories during the summer of 1990. The original digital image of the typographer's tape that the database version was prepared from had serious flaws that were not detected and corrected until later; the corrected version, a clean typographer's tape, is presented in a separate directory. A properly-analyzed database version will be provided in the future. The documentation includes notes developed during the new attempt to analyze the tape from scratch. The Department of Energy abstracts reside in files that are approximately one megabyte each. The original 950 separators have been replaced with newlines and space padding between articles was removed. An acronym dictionary that was extracted from the database as an indication of the material's topic areas has been included in a separate directory. Provisional material from the Penn Treebank project is divided into two subdirectories on this disk. The subdirectory "postext" contains text with part-of-speech annotations; "parstext" contains text with syntactic bracketing.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93T103830nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245002100139264007300160336003800233336002600271337002600297338003200323500001300355500004300368506005100411520274100462546004203203655002003245700002903265700001903294856014903313856006603462m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1993    pau        u        eng d  a15856302098 aLDC93T3A8 aISLRN: 741-001-210-040-2  adc00aTIPSTER Complete  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1993]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC93T3A  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93T3A1 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aLDC93T3A - Complete TIPSTER corpus LDC93T3B - Volume 1 of the TIPSTER corpus LDC93T3C - Volume 2 of the TIPSTER corpus LDC93T3D - Volume 3 of the TIPSTER corpus TIPSTER is sometimes also called the Text Research Collection Volume or TREC.

The second disk contains information from the same sources, but from different years. The third disk contains more information from the Computer Select disks, plus material from the San Jose Mercury News (1991), more AP newswire (1990) and about 250 megabytes of formatted U.S. Patents. The format of all the documents is relatively clean and easy to use, with SGML-like tags separating documents and document fields. There is no part-of-speech tagging or breakdown into individual sentences or paragraphs as the purpose of this collection is to test retrieval against real-world data. The three Tipster discs released have been re-issued with updates and corrections and all recipients of the earlier versions should have received these replacements free of charge.

There are also files which indicate the amplitude of the received AM carrier signal at 10 msec. intervals. Full transcripts, including the start and end times of each transmission, are provided for each audio file. Each flight is identified by its flight number. ATC0 consists of three subcorpora, one for each airport in which the transmissions were collected -- Dallas Fort Worth (DFW), Logan International (BOS) and Washington National (DCA). The complete set contains approximately 70 hours of controller and pilot transmissions collected via antennas and radio receivers which were located in the vicinity of the respective airports. Detailed information regarding the collection process and the equipment used can be found on each disc in the file, "atc.doc" in the "doc" directory. The ATC0 Corpus was collected by Texas Instruments under contract to DARPA. It was produced on CD-ROM by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for distribution by the Linguistic Data Consortium.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGodfrey, John J.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S14C01938nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245001100139264007300150336003800223336003300261337002600294338003200320500001300352500004300365506005100408520079100459546004201250655002801292700001801320700001801338700002101356700002001377856014901397856006601546m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1994    pau        u        eng d  a15856303738 aLDC94S158 aISLRN: 111-294-703-376-9  adc00aSPIDRE  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1994]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC94S15  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S151 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis is two-CD subset of the SWITCHBOARD collection (see above), selected for speaker ID research and with special attention to telephone instrument variation.

Combining the two sides of the conversations also permits speaker change detection, or speaker monitoring, experiments. There are 45 "target" speakers; four conversations from each target are included, of which two are from the same handset. There are also 100 calls in which no target appears. Since all conversations are two-sided, this results in 180 target sides and 180 + 200 = 380 nontarget sides.

The data was collected in 1989 by ITT under a US Government contract, but has not been available for public use before. Note that certain changes have been made to the corpus, mainly to insure the privacy of the speakers and some data has been withheld by the government for future use in testing. YOHO contains: * Combination lock phrases (e.g. 36-24-36) * Collected over three-month period in a real-world office environment * Four enrollment sessions per subject with 24 phrases per session * Ten test sessions per subject with four phrases per session * 8kHz sampling with 3.8 kHz analog bandwidth * 1.5 gigabytes of data The number of trials is thus sufficient to permit evaluation testing at high confidence levels. In each session, a speaker was prompted with a series of phrases to be read aloud each phrase was a sequence of three two-digit numbers (e.g. 35 - 72 - 41, pronounced thirty-five seventy-two forty-one). The first four sessions for a given speaker were enrollment sessions of 24 phrases and all additional sessions were verification trials of four phrases each. In all there are 552 enrollment sessions and 1,380 trial sessions, with a nominal time interval of three days between sessions.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aAutomatic speech recognition. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aCampbell, Joseph10aHiggins, Alan403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S1602186nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041006300132041008300195042000700278245002900285264007300314336003800387336003300425337002600458338003200484500001300516500004300529506005100572520076100623546017301384655002801557700002301585700003701608856014901645856006601794m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1994    pau        u        vie d  a15856303578 aLDC94S178 aISLRN: 650-021-622-719-80 avieatamakorajpnahinafreaengageraspaachiaperbeng07avieatamakorajpnahinafraaengadeuaspaacmnafasaprsapesbeng2iso639-3  adc00aOGI Multilanguage Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1994]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC94S17  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S171 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe corpus consists of responses to prompts spoken over commercial telephone lines by speakers of English, Farsi (Persian), French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Tamil and Vietnamese.

Speakers were asked to say their name, where they were calling from and where they grew up; they were asked to answer a couple of yes/no questions and to spell their first and last names; many were also asked to repeat a few specific words and to recite the letters of the alphabet. Each response to a prompt is stored as a separate waveform file and the files are organized according to prompt (response type); all responses from a given call have a unique caller-index number as part of the file named, so that responses can easily be sorted by speaker. Waveform data are stored in compressed form, using the NIST SPHERE 2.0 software package, which is available separately at no charge to users. SPHERE 2.0 provides the decompression software needed to extract the waveform data, as well as tools for accessing and modifying file headers. Time-aligned phonetic transcriptions are provided for a subset of responses and a complete log of each (giving speaker sex, quality judgments and orthographic transcriptions of all responses) is included in a form suitable for use as a relational data base.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aCole, Ronald Allan10aMuthusamy, Yeshwant Kumar, 1965-403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S1802636nmm a22006013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245002400139264007300163336003800236336003300274337002600307338003200333500001300365500004300378506005100421520070000472520005101172546004201223655002801265700002301293700002101316700001901337700002301356700002401379700002201403700001901425700002401444700002401468700002201492700002401514700002201538700002201560700002101582700002201603700001901625700001901644700001801663700001801681700001701699700002301716700001901739700001601758700001501774700001401789700001601803856014901819856006601968m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1994    pau        u        eng d  a15856302848 aLDC94S198 aISLRN: 396-239-314-326-3  adc00aATIS3 Training Data  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1994]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC94S19  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S191 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe ATIS3 corpus, on three CD-ROMs, includes over 774 scenarios completed by 137 subjects, yielding a total of over 7,300 utterances.

Subsequently, it was realized that a large body of unconstrained conversational material might be of interest to researchers working in other speech processing fields. The recordings were transcribed and the release prepared during 1993. The recordings were made at the Police Staff College, Bramshill, Hampshire, England. The participants were police officers taking part in the various courses at the college. This provided a wide range of regional accents and a range of ages from late teens to early fifties. Each speaker is described by nine demographic attributes. Three adjacent bedrooms were used. The two participants, each alone in their rooms, conversed by telephone. The third room was used as a monitoring and recording station. In addition to the telephone recordings, reference recordings were made using a high quality dynamic microphone in each room. It is these higher quality recordings, not the telephone speech, which are provided in the BRAMSHILL set. The recordings were made on a Sony Elcaset EL-7 cassette machine, chosen at the time because of its good speed stability. The microphone was a Shure SM-7 cardioid type. The speech data was sampled at 10 kHz, 16-bit resolution. Some attempt was made to control the acoustic environment. It is evident from listening to the recordings that, while these measures produced a reasonable recording environment, the rooms were far from soundproof. A variety of external noises (engines, aircraft, etc) can be heard on some of the recordings. Each speaker was given a pile of photographs. In response to a bleep signal, each speaker introduced himself by name and read a set of test sentences. After this, the main part of the conversation took place, in which participants were asked to determine which of each pair of photographs has been taken first (if indeed they were related at all). The conversations continued for 10 minutes until terminated by another bleep signal. During the digitization process, some periods of silence were removed, so some recordings now appear to be shorter than the original ten minutes. Furthermore, this means that recordings of two sides of a conversation are no longer time-aligned. In addition, to preserve the anonymity of the speakers, some passages (mainly the introductions) have been erased by replacing with binary zeroes. Finally the bleep signals have also been erased with binary zeroes. The transcriptions indicate where this has occurred. The speech was transcribed verbatim. No attempt was made to correct grammar, fill in missing words etc. Transcription conventions are detailed in the documentation. Every lexical word from the transcriptions is contained in the dictionary supplied in the INDEX directory. There are about 6,500 word types in the 600k words of the transcripts. Contractions, part-words, slang words, hesitation sounds and the non-speech sounds such are all treated as words in their own right in the dictionary.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aBritish Home Office403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S2003083nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245001500139264007300154336003800227336003300265337002600298338003200324500001300356500004300369506005100412520189900463520005102362546004202413655002802455700002102483700002002504700001802524856014902542856006602691m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1994    pau        u        eng d  a15856303498 aLDC94S218 aISLRN: 593-364-872-062-5  adc00aMACROPHONE  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1994]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC94S21  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S211 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aMACROPHONE consists of approximately 200,000 utterances by 5,000 speakers. It is designed to provide material sufficient and suitable for research, development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition technology for common telephone applications, such as shopping, transportation, database access and autodialing. In addition to application-oriented phrases and numerous digit strings, seven sentences are spoken by each talker to provide ensemble phoneme, diphone and triphone coverage of the language. The spoken material also refers to times, locations, monetary amounts, spellings and interactive operations. *Data* The utterances were collected automatically over the telephone network by recording directly from a T1 connection in 8 kHz, 8-bit mu-law format. The participants, roughly equal numbers of males and females, were solicited by a marketing firm from all regions of the United States. They ranged in age from the teens to the seventies and represented a broad range of educations and incomes as well. Each recorded utterance is accompanied by an orthographic transcription which also notes any unusual acoustic events or anomalies. Macrophone is the American English contribution to an international database of telephone speech corpora called POLYPHONE. Similar data sets are expected for major languages of the world and at least some of these will be made available through LDC. Prospects are currently good for American Spanish (by early 1995), Dutch, Standard French, Standard German, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Swiss French and Danish versions of POLYPHONE, all with basically the same structure and methods of collection. MACROPHONE was collected at SRI under LDC sponsorship. A paper describing it was presented at ICASSP-94: "Macrophone: An American English Telephone Speech Corpus for the POLYPHONE Project," by Jared Bernstein, Kelsey Taussig and Jack Godfrey.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aBernstein, Jared10aTaussig, Kelsey10aGodfrey, Jack403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S2104618nmm a22003133i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041002300132041003300155042000700188245003200195264007300227336003800300336002600338337002600364338003200390500001300422500004300435506005100478520345200529546007103981655002004052700001704072856014904089856006604238m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1994    pau        u        fre d  a15856303818 aLDC94T4A8 aISLRN: 804-587-727-227-70 afreaengaspabeng07afraaengaspabeng2iso639-3  adc00aUN Parallel Text (Complete)  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1994]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC94T4A  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94T4A1 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aLDC94T4A - Complete UN Parallel Text corpus LDC94T4B-1 - English text only LDC94T4B-2 - French text only LDC94T4B-3 - Spanish text only This set of three compact discs contains documents provided to the LDC by the United Nations, for use in research on machine translation technology. The documents come from the Office of Conference Services at the UN in New York and are drawn from archives that span the period between 1988 and 1993. This publication contains the English, French and Spanish archives, with data from each language stored on a separate disc in the set. Care has been taken to arrange the document files in a parallel directory structure for each language, so that corresponding translations of a document are found directly by means of the directory paths and file names. All parallel files in this corpus are English-based: for every file on the English disc, there will be a corresponding file on either the French or Spanish disc, or both. Tables are included on all discs to assist in determining which parallels are present. The total content by language is summarized below (values are approximate): No. of Millions Language documents of words ------------------------------------- English22,00059 French20,00058 Spanish14,40048 French/Spanish parallel data12,70038 (per language) ------------------------------------- In preparing the text for publication, we have applied a SGML tagging (Standard Generalized Markup Language) that preserves all typographic and meta-information that was present in the UN archival files. For those researchers who use SGML, a working DTD (Document Type Definition) is provided on each disc. For those who do not need SGML markup, a simple script is included, for use with the sed (stream-editor) utility, that will filter out the SGML-specific material and meta-information, leaving only the plain text. (Sed is a standard utility on unix systems, and is also available as free software for MS-based systems). The character set used is the 8-bit ISO 8859-1 Latin1, in which accented letters and some other non-ASCII characters occupy the upper 128 entries of the character table. Parallel samples of the three languages in this publication are listed below. * LDC1994T04 English Sample * LDC1994T04 French Sample * LDC1994T04 Spanish Sample Based on the combined usage of title strings and document numbers, it was possible to identify parallel sets amounting to over 60% of the data in the archive (a total of 56,684 files in 21,986 parallel sets). We have yet to find a reasonable method for doing a more careful search for parallels in the remaining 40%. Part of this residue is due to the fact that this corpus contains only English-based parallel sets parallel sets that included only French and Spanish versions have not been included in this release. Users of this corpus must be warned that the parallel sets identified by this automatic method will include errors. We have observed a number of cases (over 700 in the corpus as a whole) where the members of a parallel set show a serious discrepancy in quantity of text. Also, we must expect that at least some of these sets (and perhaps some less obvious cases) constitute a complete mismatch. The reftable files in the tables directory give an indication of the relative consistency among members of parallel set in terms of overall size. From these tables, the least likely candidates for parallelism can be easily identified.  aContent in French, English, and Spanish.

The total size of these is roughly 92 million (lexical) words. The corpora are marked up using TEI P2 conformant SGML (to varying levels of detail), with easy access to the source text without markup. Twelve of the component corpora are multilingual parallel corpora with from two to nine sub-corpora. All the alphabetic corpora (there is some Japanese and Chinese) are encoded in the ISO LATIN family of 8-bit character sets (ISO 8859-1, -5 and -7). The CD-ROM is in High Sierra format (ISO 9660), readable on UNIX, MSDOS and Apple systems at least. The amount of material per language varies, from about 36 million words (German) to about 5 thousand words (Bulgarian). The majority of sources are journalistic in nature (newspapers, magazines, broadcasts) additional sources include dictionaries (Albanian, Gaelic, Turkish, Japanese/English), literature, technical reports and proceedings or publications of international organizations.

The version now available from LDC, referred to as KING-92, is based on a 1992 reprocessing of the original recordings (see below). It contains recorded speech from 51 male speakers in two versions, which differ in channel characteristics: one from a telephone handset and one from a high-quality microphone. The speakers are further subdivided into two groups, 25 in one and 26 in the other, who were recorded at different locations. For each speaker and channel there are ten files, corresponding to sessions of about 30 to 60 seconds' duration each. The interval between sessions varies from a week to a month. The transcripts contain about 54k word tokens (4.8k types). KING is designed principally for closed set experiments in text-independent speaker identification or verification over toll-quality telephone lines, although the single-sided collection format does not permit simulation of real telephone traffic. The ten sessions allow for a variety of divisions into training and test data, with the possibility of multiple test sets. For example, one could examine the effects of the amount of training on performance, or examine the variability of performance over several test samples (sessions) given a fixed amount of training (but see below about the "Great Divide"). *Data* The collection method used in KING was to establish a call from a laboratory location at ITT (either San Diego, CA or Nutley, NJ) over long distance lines and back to another phone at the same location. The phones used by the test subjects were equipped with an additional microphone, so two parallel recordings were made of that side of the conversation, while the interlocutor's side was not recorded. The two parties either spoke spontaneously or carried out a variety of tasks designed to elicit natural-sounding speech: interpreting a drawing, solving a problem, describing a picture, etc. There were 25 speakers in Nutley and 26 in San Diego. Speech-to-noise ratios average about 10 dB worse for the Nutley telephone data than for San Diego; in fact it is less than 20 dB for over half the Nutley files. Users of this corpus therefore usually run separate experiments, or at least report results separately, according to site. A more subtle difference in the recordings, however, sometimes referred to as the "Great Divide," cuts across the telephone data for the San Diego speakers. This was apparently due to a minor equipment change which was made during the collection; it results in a slight but consistent change in the average long term spectrum of the telephone data recorded after the fifth session. Training and testing on data from the same side of this divide gives significantly better results than across it. Since the discovery of this difference, investigators now generally report results on the first and last five sessions of the San Diego telephone KING data separately, or they report within vs. across this boundary. A detailed description of the spectral differences can be found in a report by Thomas Crystal and Ned Neuburg which accompanies the CD-ROM version. Since there are a number of published papers with results based on the original KING corpus and two versions of the data in existence, note that the new CD-ROM version, called KING-92, is based on a 1992 re-issue of the data from ITT. It differs from the original corpus in a few details: * The original data was sampled at 10 kHz, but has now been resampled at 8 kHz; * Missing segments, most on the order of seconds, have been restored to the data and the alignment between the high quality microphone and the telephone handset data files has been corrected; * Originally both an orthographic and a phonetic transcription of the data, with time alignments, were part of the corpus, but there were numerous errors; only an unaligned orthographic transcription has been retained. * Documentation has been changed to reflect these differences and a description of the artifactual division between sessions 1-5 and 6-10 in the San Diego telephone data is included.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aHiggins, Alan10aVermilyea, Dave403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95S2203456nmm a22002773i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245001900139264007300158336003800231336003300269337002600302338003200328500001300360500004300373506005100416520242600467546004202893655002802935856014902963856006603112m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1995    pau        u        eng d  a15856304548 aLDC95S238 aISLRN: 388-101-290-949-9  adc00aCSR-III Speech  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1995]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC95S23  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95S231 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe third ARPA Continuous Speech Recognition (CSR) Benchmark Speech Test Collection is a three CD-ROM set that contains complete development test and evaluation test suites for speaker-independent, large-vocabulary speech recognition systems. The development and evaluation tests share a common structure, consisting of two core test components ("hubs") and seven specialized test components ("spokes"). The hub tests, which were mandatory for all ARPA CSR participants in the November '94 evaluations, provide a base-line for ASR performance, while the spokes provide the means for assessing the impact of particular speaking conditions or processing strategies in relation to base-line performance. Participants were free to take any combination of spoke tests according to their research interests. Taken together, the collection encompasses 180 speakers, each producing 20-40 sentences. These are organized into two complete development test sets and one evaluation set. The collection also includes complete documentation on the test specifications, data collection procedures, transcriptions and scoring protocols, together with the latest available version of NIST software for scoring ASR results and managing SPHERE waveform files. All speech data is accompanied by both the prompting texts and the detailed orthographic transcriptions of the utterances. This was the first ARPA CSR Benchmark Test in which prompting texts were drawn from a variety of news sources. Whereas earlier benchmarks were based on Wall Street Journal excerpts (from the period 1987-89), CSR-III prompts come a variety of North American Business News Services: Reuters News Service, New York Times, Wahington Post and Los Angeles Times as well as WSJ; all texts are drawn from financial news articles written during the period of April through June, 1994. (NAB stands for "North American Business," in contrast to earlier benchmarks and training collections labeled "WSJ"). An important companion to the 1994 Benchmark Speech data collection is the four-disk CSR-III Text Collection (LDC95T6), which includes the ARPA CSR 1994 Standard Language Model. This corpus is also available from the LDC as a 1995 release. Because of restrictions imposed by the copyright holders of much of the NAB text, both the speech and text collections are available to LDC members only.

This release of WSJCA0 represents version 1.1 of the corpus, which was initially released on tape by Cambridge University as of August 31, 1994. This collection was modelled directly on the ARPA CSR Corpus released by LDC in 1993: it used the same dual-microphone recording paradigm and a subset of prompting texts drawn from the Wall Street Journal. There are two key differences between WSJ0 and WSJCAM0: (1) the subjects in WSJCAM0 were native speakers of British English and (2) in addition to standard orthographic transcripts, WSJCAM0 also has information on the time alignment between the sampled waveform and both the words and the phonetic segments. The contents of the publication consist of the following: * Training data from head-mounted microphone * Development test data from head-mounted microphone, plus first set of evaluation test data * Training data from desk-mounted microphone * Development test data from desk-mounted microphone, plus second set of evaluation test data There are 90 utterances from each of 92 speakers that are designated as training material for speech recognition algorithms. An additional 48 speakers each read 40 sentences containing only words from a fixed 5,000 word vocabulary and another 40 sentences using a 64,000 word vocabulary, to be used as testing material. Each of the total of 140 speakers also recorded a common set of 18 adaptation sentences. Recordings were made from two microphones: a far-field desk microphone and a head-mounted close-talking microphone. Within the train and test sets, speech data are organized by speaker prompting texts and detailed transcriptions and speaker information are included in each speaker directory. All waveform files have NIST SPHERE headers. Waveform data are compressed using the Shorten algorithm developed by Tony Robinson at Cambridge University, as adapted for use in the NIST SPHERE software package.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aRobinson, Tony10aFransen, Jeroen10aPye, David10aFoote, Jonathan10aRenals, Steve10aWoodland, Phil10aYoung, Steve403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95S2402040nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245003200139264007300171336003800244336003300282337002600315338003200341500001300373500004300386506005100429520093500480546004201415655002801457700001701485700002101502856014901523856006601672m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1995    pau        u        eng d  a15856305788 aLDC95S258 aISLRN: 070-132-331-927-5  adc00aTRAINS Spoken Dialog Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1995]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC95S25  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95S251 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis release contains a corpus of task-oriented spoken dialogs. These dialogs were collected in 1993 at the University of Rochester Department of Computer Science as part of the TRAINS project, a project to develop a conversationally proficient planning assistant, which helps a user construct a plan to achieve some task involving the manufacturing and shipment of goods in a railroad freight system. The collection procedure was designed to make the setting as close to human-computer interaction as possible, but was not a "wizard" scenario, where one person pretends to be a computer. Thus these dialogs provide a snapshot into an ideal human-computer interface that would be able to engage in fluent conversations. Altogether, this corpus includes 98 dialogs, collected using 20 different tasks and 34 different speakers. This amounts to six and a half hours of speech, about 5,900 speaker turns and 55,000 transcribed words.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aAllen, James10aHeeman, Peter A.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95S2503934nmm a22005893i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245002000139264007300159336003800232336003300270337002600303338003200329500001300361500004300374506005100417520206500468546004202533655002802575700002302603700002102626700001902647700002302666700002402689700002202713700001902735700002402754700002402778700002202802700002402824700002202848700002202870700002102892700002202913700001902935700001902954700001802973700001802991700001703009700002303026700001903049700001603068700001503084700001403099700001603113856014903129856006603278m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1995    pau        u        eng d  a15856304388 aLDC95S268 aISLRN: 847-846-823-557-6  adc00aATIS3 Test Data  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1995]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC95S26  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95S261 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis release contains a corpus of speech and natural language data collected under the auspices of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Spoken Language Systems (ARPA-SLS) technology development program. The corpus, which contains data in the Air Travel Information Services (ATIS) domain, was designed by the ARPA-SLS Multi-site Atis Data COllection Working (MADCOW) group and was collected by five sites at locations across the U.S.: * BBN Systems & Technologies, Cambridge, MA * Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA * MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, Boston, MA * National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD * SRI International, Menlo Park, CA The corpora is part of the third phase of collection of ATIS data (ATIS3) and comprises the development test (NIST Speech Disc 17-4.2) and evaluation test material (NIST Speech Disc 17-5.1) used in the December 1994 ARPA SLS Benchmark Tests. As in the previous ATIS corpora, the speech contained in this corpus was elicited by presenting subjects with various hypothetical travel planning scenarios to solve. The resulting spontaneous spoken queries were recorded as the subjects interacted with partially or completely automated ATIS systems to solve the scenarios. Note that the ATIS3 training data is available on NIST Speech Discs 17-1.1 - 17-3.1. *Data* The recorded speech has been transcribed and annotated with categorizations and canonical reference answers. All of the utterances have been recorded using a close-talking, noise-canceling head-mounted Sennheiser microphone. For some subjects, secondary (noisier) microphone data was recorded simultaneously as well. This release also contains the ATIS3 46 city/52 airport relational database, a revised Principles of Interpretation and test implementation and scoring instructions as well as other general documentation.

The goal of PhoneBook is to serve as a large database of American English word utterances incorporating all phonemes in as many segmental/stress contexts as are likely to produce coarticulatory variations, while also spanning a variety of talkers and telephone transmission characteristics. We anticipate that it will be useful in ways analogous to TIMIT/NTIMIT. The core section of PhoneBook consists of a total of 93,667 isolated-word utterances, totalling 23 hours of speech. This breaks down to 7,979 distinct words, each said by an average of 11.7 talkers, with 1,358 talkers each saying up to 75 words. All data were collected in 8-bit mu-law digital form directly from a T1 telephone line. Talkers were adult native speakers of American English chosen to be demographically representative of the U.S. Given the large set of talkers being recruited for PhoneBook database, it made sense to exploit the opportunity to collect additional utterances. We have chosen spontaneous numerical utterances, because of widespread interest in them and the need for very large numbers of talkers for research into spontaneous-speech effects. We restricted to just three spontaneous digit sequences and one money amount, as the lists for the core of PhoneBook have been designed to approach the limit of reasonable duration for a caller's session. As a result, PhoneBook contains a total of 5,105 spontaneous utterances.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aPitrelli, John F.10aFong, Cynthia403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95S2702408nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041001300132041002300145042000700168245003200175264007300207336003800280336003300318337002600351338003200377500001300409500004300422506005100465520114000516546005001656655002801706700002101734700001701755700002501772700001601797700001801813856014901831856006601980m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1995    pau        u        spa d  a15856305198 aLDC95S288 aISLRN: 355-182-932-307-70 aspabeng07aspabeng2iso639-3  adc00aLATINO-40 Spanish Read News  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1995]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC95S28  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95S281 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis database provides a set of recordings for training speaker-independent systems that recognize Latin-American Spanish. It was recorded by the Entropic Research Laboratory in the period from July 11 through September 9 1994 in Palo Alto, California. The database comprises about 5,000 utterances files. These files include about 125 utterances from each of 40 different speakers, 20 male and 20 female. The recordings were all made with a high-quality, head-mounted microphone (Shure SM10A) in an office environment, and the utterances were digitized in 16-bit samples at 16 kHz. The Linguistic Data Consortium provided 13,000 sentences that had been selected from Latin American newspaper text by people working at Texas Instruments. The sentences are all shorter than 80 characters and are not grouped into larger constituents such as paragraphs or stories. The speech files have NIST SPHERE headers and are presented in compressed format, using the shorten speech compression algorithm developed by Tony Robinson at Cambridge Univesity, as implemented in the NIST SPHERE software package. This software is included with the data.  aContent in Spanish.

This corpus includes roughly 100 million words of French, 90 million words of German and 15 million words of Portuguese and has been marked using SGML. The text is taken from the following sources: * Approximately 60 million words of text in French and German have been made available from the Associated Press (AP) World Stream. AP World Stream is a compilation of AP news reports produced in 86 bureaus in 68 countries. The Associated Press Worldstream newswire service provides articles in six languages, interleaved on a single data stream. The data is collected via an Associated Press installed telephone line at the LDC. * Approximately 110 million words of text in French, German and Portuguese have been made available from Agence France Presse. Each language was supplied in separate data streams collected via a Dateno MKII satellite receiver and associated equipment at the LDC. * Approximately 20 million words of text in German have been made available from Deutsche Presse Agentur. The text is collected via an AP Datafeatures telephone line installed at the Linguistic Data Consortium. * A smaller part of the corpus comes from Le Monde newspaper. The Le Monde data covers about 5.6 million words of French. It is quite distinct from the AP and AFP materials in its markup approach, because it has been prepared in compliance with the conventions of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), rather than having been based on the model of the TIPSTER collections, which were originally developed prior to the establishment of the TEI conventions.  aContent in Portuguese, French, and German.

While the content is therefore limited to legislative discourse, it spans a broad assortment of topics and the stylistic range includes spontaneous discussion and written correspondance along with legislative propositions and prepared speeches. The collection presented here has been assembled by the LDC by way of archives from two distinct secondary sources. Material from one time period of parliamentary proceedings was acquired through the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, while material from another period was acquired through Bell Communications Research Inc. (Bellcore). The combined collection covers a time span from the mid-1970's through 1988, with no apparent duplication between the two data sources. Aside from covering different time periods, the two archives have different organization and have undergone different amounts and kinds of processing in being prepared as a parallel language resource. In addition, the Bellcore set itself comprises two distinct types of data -- one appears to be the main parliamentary proceedings (similar in nature to the IBM set), while the other consists of transcripts from committee hearings. The three sets have been kept distinct in this publication and each is described in greater detail in separate documentation files. In terms of what the three sets have in common: * They are rendered here using the 8-bit ISO-Latin1 character encoding standard. * They use a minimal amount of SGML tagging to identify sentences or paragraphs. * All sets are organized using a parallel file structure, in which the content of a given English text file is matched by the content of a corresponding French text file. * The SGML text files for the IBM and the Bellcore committee-hearings data are published in compressed form, using the public-domain GNU-Zip utility (gzip). The Bellcore main-session files are not compressed. In terms of differences between the three sets: * The IBM collection is presented as a sequence of parallel sentences (there are nearly 2.87 million parallel sentence pairs in the set). * The Bellcore data are presented as sequences of paragraphs. * The Bellcore main-session data is accompanied by mapping files that provide computed paragraph alignments and word-token correspondences; no additional alignment data are provided for the Bellcore committee texts (and none are needed for the IBM sentences).  aContent in French and English.

This corpus is an important companion to the 1994 Benchmark Speech data collection (LDC95S23). The text collection comprises both source text data (prepared by LDC and BBN) and derived statistical tables (compiled by CMU) of unigram, bigram and trigram word frequencies. The sources include all available WSJ texts, spanning 1987 through March 1994 and all AP and San Jose Mercury news data from the three TIPSTER volumes.

This material is a subset of the language model corpus for the DARPA CSR large-vocabulary speech recognition project. It also contains the first fully parsed version of the Brown Corpus, which has also been completely retagged using the Penn Treebank (PTB) tag set. Also included are tagged and parsed data from Department of Energy abstracts, IBM computer manuals, MUC-3 and ATIS. In addition, the release includes source code for programs that were used by the PTB project in creating portions of the data. Source code is also included for "tgrep," a program that permits the user to search for specific constituents in tree structures. All software is provided "as is." (We have learned since publication that the tgrep source code provided on the cd-rom is not readily portable, and compiling tgrep requires modification of the source files. Also included is a pre-compiled program file for tgrep, built for use on Sun sparc systems.) Release - 2 The PTB Project Release 2 features the new PTB-2 bracketing style, which is designed to allow the extraction of simple predicate/argument structure. Over one million words of text are provided with this bracketing applied, along with a complete style manual explaining the bracketing and new versions of tools for searching and treating bracketed data. This release also contains all the annotated text material from the earlier Treebank Preliminary Release, including the Brown Corpus. While these materials have not all been converted to the newer bracketing style, they have been cleaned up to remove problems that had appeared in the earlier release. The contents of Treebank Release 2 are as follows: * One million words of 1989 Wall Street Journal material annotated in Treebank-2 style. * A small sample of ATIS-3 material annotated in Treebank-2 style. * 300-page style manual for Treebank-2 bracketing, as well as the part-of-speech tagging guidelines. * The contents of the previous Treebank release (Version 0.5), with cleaner versions of the WSJ, Brown Corpus, and ATIS material (annotated in Treebank-1 style). * Tools for processing Treebank data, including "tgrep," a tree-searching and manipulation package (note that usability of this release of tgrep is limited: users of Sun sparc systems should have no problem, but others may find the software to be difficult or impossible to port). In addition, the PTB Project has provided some updates, announcements and a discussion forum for users. A file of updates and further information is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.cis.upenn.edu, in pub/treebank/doc/update.cd2. The PTB project selected 2,499 stories from a three year Wall Street Journal (WSJ) collection of 98,732 stories for syntactic annotation. These 2,499 stories have been distributed in both Treebank-2 (LDC95T7) and Treebank-3 (LDC99T42) releases of PTB. Treebank-2 & Treebank-3 both include the raw text for each story. Three "map" files are available in a compressed file (pennTB_tipster_wsj_map.tar.gz) as an additional download for users who have licensed Treebank-2 and provide the relation between the 2,499 PTB filenames and the corresponding WSJ DOCNO strings in TIPSTER.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aMarcus, Mitchell P., 1950-10aSantorini, Beatrice10aMarcinkiewicz, Mary Ann403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95T702312nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001200090024002900102041001300131041002300144042000700167245003200174264007300206336003800279336002600317337002600343338003200369500001200401500004200413506005100455520116200506546005101668655002001719700001701739700001601756856014901772856006501921m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1995    pau        u        jpn d  a15856304978 aLDC95T88 aISLRN: 177-142-310-728-10 ajpnbeng07ajpnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aJapanese Business News Text  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1995]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC95T8  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95T81 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe Linguistic Data Consortium announces the availability of a Japanese language text corpus composed of business and financial news from two sources: * Approximately 30 million words of text have been made available from the morning edition of Nihon Kezai Shimbun, the largest Japanese financial news daily newspaper; the release this year covers all text that was published during 1994. The data was received at the LDC on nine-track magnetic tape; the character encoding was EBCDIC, but was standardized to EUC, which the LDC has chosen as its standard for Japanese. * A smaller part of the corpus comes from Dow Jones Telerate, which markets its Japanese Language Service. This is a financial newswire produced by Kyodo News Service; its recipients are primarily managers of Japanese owned corporations, or Japanese employees working in North American brokerage houses, banking, etc. The text is received at the LDC via a digital transmission service installed by Telerate; special software was written by the LDC to poll a central database and download articles individually. The character encoding is EUC. This corpus is available to LDC members only.  aContent in Japanese.

(The Reuters collection comprises two distinct services: Reuters Spanish Language News Service and Reuters Latin American Business Report). All text data are stored in a standard compressed form. The fours sets of newswire data (AFP, APWS and two Reuters services) are each organized as one data file per day of collection. The period covered by these collections runs from December 1993 (for APWS and Reuters) or May 1994 (APWS) through December 1995. (The El Norte data, provided to us by INFOSEL Mexico, are arbitrarily grouped into files of about 1 megabyte in size when uncompressed; date information is not available for individual articles, but the general period of the collection is 1993). The approximate amounts of data per source (when uncompressed) is indicated below (in total megabytes and millions of words of text): Source MB MW AFP 345 44 APWS 253 33 REUSL 333 41 REULA 233 23 INFOSEL 209 31 The presentation of text data in these collections is modeled on the TIPSTER corpus. Within each data file, SGML tagging is used (1) to mark article boundaries, (2) to delimit the text portion within each article and (3) to label various pieces of information about the article that are external to the text content (e.g. headlines, bylines and so on). The copyright holders of this text have requested that it be made available to LDC members only. Due to the release date this corpus is available to 1995 and 1996 members. In order to obtain this corpus, current LDC members must submit a signed User Agreement Form.  aContent in Spanish.

CELEX was developed as a joint enterprise of the University of Nijmegen, the Institute for Dutch Lexicology in Leiden, the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, and the Institute for Perception Research in Eindhoven. Pre-mastering and production was done by the LDC. For each language, this data set contains detailed information on: * orthography (variations in spelling, hyphenation) * phonology (phonetic transcriptions, variations in pronunciation, syllable structure, primary stress) * morphology (derivational and compositional structure, inflectional paradigms) * syntax (word class, word class-specific subcategorizations, argument structures) * word frequency (summed word and lemma counts, based on recent and representative text corpora) The databases have not been tailored to fit any particular database management program. Instead, the information is in ASCII files in a UNIX directory tree that can be queried with tools, such as AWK or ICON. Unique identity numbers allow the linking of information from different files. Some kinds of information have to be computed online; wherever necessary, AWK functions have been provided to recover this information. README files specify the details of their use. A detailed User Guide describing the various kinds of lexical information available is supplied. All sections of this guide are POSTSCRIPT files, except for some additional notes on the German lexicon in plain ASCII. CELEX-2 The second release of CELEX contains an enhanced, expanded version of the German lexical database (2.5), featuring approximately 1,000 new lemma entries, revised morphological parses, verb argument structures, inflectional paradigm codes and a corpus type lexicon. A complete PostScript version of the Germanic Linguistic Guide is also included, in both European A-4 format and American Letter format. For German, the total number of lemmas included is now 51,728, while all their inflected forms number 365,530. Moreover, phonetic syllable frequencies have been added for (British) English and Dutch. Apart from this, and provision of frequency information alongside every lexical feature, no changes have been made to Dutch and English lexicons. Complete AWK-scripts are now provided to compute representations not found in the (plain ASCII) lexical data files, corresponding to the features described in CELEX User Guide, which is included as well. For each language, i.e. English, German and Dutch, the data contains detailed information on the orthography (variations in spelling, hyphenation), the phonology (phonetic transcriptions, variations in pronunciation, syllable structure, primary stress), the morphology (derivational and compositional structure, inflectional paradigms), the syntax (word class, word-class specific subcategorisation, argument structures) and word frequency (summed word and lemma counts, based on resent and representative text corpora) of both wordforms and lemmas. Unique identity numbers allow the linking of information from different files with the aid of an efficient, index-based C-program. Like its predecessor, this release is mastered using the ISO 9660 daa format, with the Rock Ridge extensions, allowing it to be used in VMS, MS-DOS, Macintosh and UNIX environments. As the new release does not omit any data from the first edition, the current release will replace the old one.  aContent in English, German, and Dutch.

CTIMIT has been designed to provide a large phonetically-labeled database for use in the design and evaluation of speech processing systems operating in diverse, often hostile, cellular telephone environments. CTIMIT was collected by members of the Voice Communication Initiative (VCI) at Lockheed-Martin Sanders' Signal Processing Center of Technology (SPCOT) as part of internal R&D efforts, with additional sponsorship from the Wireless Communications Group in the company's Advanced Engineering and Technology (AE&T) Division. Like NTIMIT (LDC93S2), CTIMIT is based on the original TIMIT recordings, which were passed through a sample of actual telephone circuits -- cellular circuits in the case of CTIMIT. Thus, the original phonetic segmentation and labeling of TIMIT continue to be applicable to CTIMIT as well as NTIMIT.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGeorge, E.

The primary microphone waveforms, which were recorded using a close-talking noise-cancelling head-mounted Sennheiser microphone (model HMD-414), are available from LDC on NIST Speech Disc 1-1.1 (LDC93S1). The secondary microphone used in the recording of the TIMIT corpus was a Breul & Kjaer (B&K) 1/2" free-field microphone (model 4165). While the Sennheiser microphone recordings are relatively "clean" with respect to non-speech noise, the FFMTIMIT recordings include significant low frequency noise, which was due to the HVAC system and mechanical vibration transmitted through the floor of the double-walled sound booth used in recording. Because it is noiser than its TIMIT counterpart, the data of FFMTIMIT may be used in the development of more noise-robust speech recognition systems. In addition, this data may be of value to researchers involved in vocal tract modeling because the B&K microphone has extremely flat free-field frequency response and calibration tones are provided. Note that the B&K TIMIT data contained with this release has not been processed through any highpass filter, (e.g., the 1,581-point filter described in the paper "The DARPA Speech Recognition Research Database" by Fisher, Doddington and Goudie-Marshall in "DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus CD-ROM," NISTIR 4930 / NTIS Order No. PB93- 173938.)  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGarofolo, John S.10aLamel, Lori F.10aFisher, William M.10aFiscus, Jonathan G.10aPallett, David S.10aDahlgren, Nancy L.10aZue, Victor403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96S3202574nmm a22003133i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245001600139264007300155336003800228336003300266337002600299338003200325500001300357500004300370506005100413520144300464546004201907655002801949700002401977700002202001700002202023856014902045856006602194m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1996    pau        u        eng d  a15856308618 aLDC96S338 aISLRN: 529-082-231-699-3  adc00aCSR-IV HUB3  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1996]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC96S33  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96S331 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis set of CD-ROMs contains all of the speech data provided to sites participating in the DARPA CSR November 1995 HUB3 Multi-Microphone tests.

The corpus consists of professionally read radio news data, including speech and accompanying annotations, suitable for speech and language research. The corpus includes speech from seven (four male, three female) FM radio news announcers associated with WBUR, a public radio station. The main radio news portion of the corpus consists of over seven hours of news stories recorded in the WBUR radio studio during broadcasts over a two year period. In addition, the announcers were also recorded in a laboratory at Boston University. In this, the lab news portion, the announcers read a total of 24 stories from the radio news portion. The announcers were first asked to read the stories in their non-radio style and then, 30 minutes later, to read the same stories in their radio style. Each story read by an announcer was digitized in paragraph size units, which typically include several sentences. The files were digitized at a 16k Hz sample rate using a 16-bit A/D. The paragraphs were annotated with the orthographic transcription, phonetic alignments, part-of-speech tags and prosodic markers. The orthographic transcripts were generated by hand and include indication of where the speaker took a breath.

This data is based on a 600-word subset of the 991-word RM1 vocabulary and contains spoken and spelled words pertaining to the RM1 naval resource management task. This corpus was collected simultaneously as part of the RM1 Continuous Speech Corpus (NIST Speech Discs 2-1-2-4) and contains speech from the same sets of subjects used in RM1. *Data* The speech data has been segmented into separate spelled and spoken-word waveform files for each subject-word utterance. Time-aligned word and phonetic transcriptions have been generated automatically using forced recognition and are included. The time-aligned transcriptions employ the same format and phone set as the TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus (NIST Speech Disc 1-1). See the TIMIT CD-ROM companion booklet, NISTIR 4930, pp. 29-31, for a description of the phone set. As with the continuous speech portion of RM1, this data is subsetted into speaker-independent and speaker-dependent partitions. These data sets are further partioned into training, development-test and evaluation-test subsets. See the "readme.doc" file in the top-level directory for more information about the data. Texas Instruments recruited the subjects and collected the speech. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) segmented the waveforms, generated the time-aligned transcriptions and produced this release.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96S3901746nmm a22002893i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245003800139264007300177336003800250336003300288337002600321338003200347500001300379500004300392506005100435520066500486546004201151655002801193700002001221856014901241856006601390m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1996    pau        u        eng d  a15856309268 aLDC96S408 aISLRN: 493-178-172-435-7  adc00aFrontiers in Speech Processing 94  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1996]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC96S40  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96S401 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis CD reflects the cooperative efforts of 28 researchers who attended the 1994 summer workshop in speech processing hosted by the Center for Computer Aids for Industrial Productivity (CAIP) at Rutgers University and sponsored by the National Security Agency.

There are also files which indicate the amplitude of the received AM carrier signal at 10 msec. intervals. Full transcripts, including the start and end times of each transmission, are provided for each audio file. Each flight is identified by its flight number. ATC0 consists of three subcorpora, one for each airport in which the transmissions were collected -- Dallas Fort Worth (DFW), Logan International (BOS) and Washington National (DCA). The complete set contains approximately 70 hours of controller and pilot transmissions collected via antennas and radio receivers which were located in the vicinity of the respective airports. Detailed information regarding the collection process and the equipment used can be found on each disc in the file, "atc.doc" in the "doc" directory. The ATC0 Corpus was collected by Texas Instruments under contract to DARPA. It was produced on CD-ROM by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for distribution by the Linguistic Data Consortium.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGodfrey, John J.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S14D02430nmm a22003133i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245005300139264007300192336003800265336003300303337002600336338003200362500001300394500004300407506005100450520123400501520005101735546004201786655002801828700002301856700002201879856014901901856006602050m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1996    pau        u        eng d  a15856306168 aLDC96S468 aISLRN: 491-813-496-892-1  adc00aCALLFRIEND American English-Non-Southern Dialect  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1996]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC96S46  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96S461 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe CALLFRIEND project supports the development of language identification technology. *Data* The corpus consists of 60 unscripted telephone conversations, lasting between 5-30 minutes.

For each conversation, both the caller and callee are native speakers of Southern American English. All calls are domestic and were placed inside the continental United States, Canada, Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic. Callers in the "Southern" collection of CALLFRIEND American English were identified primarily on the basis of vowel quality patterns that are common among native speakers raised in the southeastern United States (from Texas eastward to the Atlantic coast and from Virginia and Kentucky southward to the Gulf of Mexico). This category also includes a small number of African-American speakers, whose geographic origins may be more dispersed, but who share some of the vowel quality patterns distinctive of Southern white speakers. (Of course, other dialect features involving phonology, syntax and prosody, serve to differentiate these two subgroups within the "Southern" collection.)  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aCanavan, Alexandra10aZipperlen, George403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96S4701723nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041001300132041002300145042000700168245003100175264007300206336003800279336003300317337002600350338003200376500001300408500004300421506005100464520054500515546004901060655002801109700002301137700002201160856014901182856006601331m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1996    pau        u        fre d  a15856306328 aLDC96S488 aISLRN: 127-055-636-719-90 afrebeng07afrabeng2iso639-3  adc00aCALLFRIEND Canadian French  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1996]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC96S48  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96S481 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe CALLFRIEND project supports the development of language identification technology. *Data* The corpus consists of 60 unscripted telephone conversations, lasting between 5-30 minutes.

The focus of this evaluation was on detection of the presence of a hypothesized target speaker, given a segment of conversational speech over the telephone. *Data* The corpus consists of one Development Data disc and two Evaluation Data discs. Both sets include training and test segments. The Development Data includes both training and test segments for about 45 male and 45 female speakers. The training data consists of about four one minute segments of speech data for each target speaker. The test data contains shorter segments of speech data (three, 10, and 30 seconds) that were taken from different conversations for each speaker. The Evaluation Data includes about 20 male and 20 female target speakers and 200 male and 200 female non-target speakers. All of these speakers are different from the speakers in the Development Data set. Training data is supplied for each of the target speakers, in the same manner as the Development Data. Test data is supplied for both the target and the non-target speakers, in the same manner as the Development Data.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aPrzybocki, Mark10aMartin, Alvin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96S6104225nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041001300132041002300145042000700168245003400175264007300209336003800282336003300320337002600353338003200379500001300411500004300424506005100467520290600518546005103424655002803475700002203503700002303525700001603548700002203564700006203586856014903648856006603797m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1996    pau        u        jpn d  a15856309348 aLDC96S648 aISLRN: 734-085-058-125-60 ajpnbeng07ajpnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aJEIDA/JCSD-Channel 0 Complete  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1996]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC96S64  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96S641 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe Japanese Electronic Industry Development Association's (JEIDA) Common Speech Data Corpus (JCSD) was prepared by Jonathan Hamaker, Richard J. Duncan and Joe Picone of the Institute for Signal and Information Processing at Mississippi State University. *Data* This collection consists of high-fidelity recordings of 150 native speakers of Japanese; each speaker produces four repetitions of 323 short prompts, including city names, control words, monosyllabic words, isolated digits and strings of four digits. Each reading session was recorded with two microphones, yielding two channels that differ in audio quality for each utterance. Channel 0 (LDC96S64) contains data recorded with a standard dynamic microphone---a Sanken MU-2C microphone. Channel 1 (LDC96S65) contains data recorded simultaneously with a condenser microphone that presumably varied from site to site and is available separately.

Duncan and Joe Picone of the Institute for Signal and Information Processing at Mississippi State University. *Data* This collection consists of high-fidelity recordings of 150 native speakers of Japanese; each speaker produces four repetitions of 323 short prompts, including city names, control words, monosyllabic words, isolated digits and strings of four digits. Each reading session was recorded with two microphones, yielding two channels that differ in audio quality for each utterance. Channel 0 (LDC96S64) contains data recorded with a standard dynamic microphone---a Sanken MU-2C microphone. Channel 1 (LDC96S65) contains data recorded simultaneously with a condenser microphone that presumably varied from site to site and is available separately. A summary of the size and content of the corpus is given below: number of speakers 150 speakers males 75 females 75 range of speaker age 10 yrs. to 70 yrs. number of items per speaker 323 items isolated digits 15 four digit sequences 35 city names 100 monosyllables 110 control words (set A) 13 control words (set B) 24 control words (set C) 26 number of repetitions per item 4 repetitions total number of utterances 193,763 utterances (per channel) sample frequency 16 kHz sample type 16-bit linear number of microphones 2 (dynamic and condenser) For purposes of publication by the LDC, the corpus has been organized onto 40 CD-ROMs; the partitioning of the data files have been done primarily by channel (20 CD-ROMs each for channel 0 and channel 1) and secondarily by category of prompts. These prompts include: Description Number of items Control Words: Banking Services 13 Word Processors 24 Home Electronic Equipment 26 Digits: Isolated Digits 15 Four Digit Sequences 35 City Names: 100 a phonetically-rich subset of common Japanese city names Monosyllables: 110 all Japanese monosyllables plus several used to pronounce foreign words JEIDA/JCSD-Channel 0 and JEIDA/JCSD-Channel 1 can each be ordered as complete sets.

This release contains the evaluation sets (source data and human reference translations), DTD, scoring software, and evaluation plans for the Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English progress test sets for the NIST OpenMT 2008, 2009, and 2012 evaluations. The test data remained unseen between evaluations and was reused unchanged each time. The package was compiled, and scoring software was developed, at NIST, making use of Chinese and Arabic newswire and web data and reference translations collected and developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). The objective of the OpenMT evaluation series is to support research in, and help advance the state of the art of, machine translation (MT) technologies -- technologies that translate text between human languages. Input may include all forms of text. The goal is for the output to be an adequate and fluent translation of the original. The MT evaluation series started in 2001 as part of the DARPA TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction) program. Beginning with the 2006 evaluation, the evaluations have been driven and coordinated by NIST as NIST OpenMT. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities in MT. The OpenMT evaluations are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of automatic translation between human languages. To this end, they are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues and to be fully supported. For more general information about the NIST OpenMT evaluations, please refer to the NIST OpenMT website. This evaluation kit includes a single Perl script (mteval-v13a.pl) that may be used to produce a translation quality score for one (or more) MT systems. The script works by comparing the system output translation with a set of (expert) reference translations of the same source text. Comparison is based on finding sequences of words in the reference translations that match word sequences in the system output translation. LDC has released the following associated corpora: * NIST 2008 Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation (LDC2010T21) * NIST 2009 Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation (LDC2010T23) * NIST 2012 Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation (LDC2013T03) *Data* This release contains 2,748 documents with corresponding source and reference files, the latter of which contains four independent human reference translations of the source data. The source data is comprised of Arabic and Chinese newswire and web data collected by LDC in 2007. The table below displays statistics by source, genre, documents, segments and source tokens.

The Python re module was used to obtain those counts. The data in this package are in XML format compliant with the included DTD.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and Chinese.

Duncan and Joe Picone of the Institute for Signal and Information Processing at Mississippi State University. *Data* This collection consists of high-fidelity recordings of 150 native speakers of Japanese; each speaker produces four repetitions of 323 short prompts, including city names, control words, monosyllabic words, isolated digits and strings of four digits. Each reading session was recorded with two microphones, yielding two channels that differ in audio quality for each utterance. Channel 0 (LDC96S64) contains data recorded with a standard dynamic microphone---a Sanken MU-2C microphone. Channel 1 (LDC96S65) contains data recorded simultaneously with a condenser microphone that presumably varied from site to site and is available separately. A summary of the size and content of the corpus is given below: number of speakers 150 speakers males 75 females 75 range of speaker age 10 yrs. to 70 yrs. number of items per speaker 323 items isolated digits 15 four digit sequences 35 city names 100 monosyllables 110 control words (set A) 13 control words (set B) 24 control words (set C) 26 number of repetitions per item 4 repetitions total number of utterances 193,763 utterances (per channel) sample frequency 16 kHz sample type 16-bit linear number of microphones 2 (dynamic and condenser) For purposes of publication by the LDC, the corpus has been organized onto 40 CD-ROMs; the partitioning of the data files have been done primarily by channel (20 CD-ROMs each for channel 0 and channel 1) and secondarily by category of prompts. These prompts include: Description Number of items Control Words: Banking Services 13 Word Processors 24 Home Electronic Equipment 26 Digits: Isolated Digits 15 Four Digit Sequences 35 City Names: 100 a phonetically-rich subset of common Japanese city names Monosyllables: 110 all Japanese monosyllables plus several used to pronounce foreign words JEIDA/JCSD-Channel 0 and JEIDA/JCSD-Channel 1 can each be ordered as complete sets.

The CALLHOME American English Lexicon was originally distributed under the name COMLEX Pronouncing Lexicon, or PRONLEX. Organizations that have already received PRONLEX will not be required to purchase the CALLHOME American English Lexicon. *Data* The latest version of PRONLEX contains 90,988 lexical entries and includes coverage of WSJ30, WSJ64, Switchboard and CALLHOME English. (WSJ30K and WSJ64K are word lists selected from several years of Wall Street Journal texts used in recent ARPA Continuous Speech Recognition corpora. Switchboard is a three million word corpus of telephone conversations on a variety of topics.) The PRONLEX documentation describes the principles observed for word transcription. Although predictable variation in pronunciation due to dialect or variable reduction has not been notated in the lexicon itself, the documentation notes systematic dialectal variants, which may be generated by rule. In addition, alternate pronunciations are given for words whose pronunciation varies by part of speech (e.g., abstrAct, Abstract), or in less systematic but salient ways (especially names). Classes of exceptions to the transcription principles, such as names, function, words and foreign words, are tagged. Here is a sample page. The transcripts and documentation (LDC97T14) are available, as well as a corpus of telephone speech (LDC97L20).  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aKingsbury, Paul10aStrassel, Stephanie10aMcLemore, Cynthia Ann, 1958-10aMacIntyre, Robert403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97L2001932nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245003700139264007300176336003800249336003300287337002600320338003200346500001300378500004300391506005100434520072300485520005101208546004201259655002801301700002301329700001701352700002201369856014901391856006601540m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1997    pau        u        eng d  a15856311168 aLDC97S428 aISLRN: 952-976-147-406-5  adc00aCALLHOME American English Speech  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1997]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC97S42  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S421 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aCALLHOME American English Speech was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and consists of 120 unscripted 30-minute telephone conversations between native speakers of English.

The first release of the corpus was published by NIST and distributed by the LDC in 1992-3. Since that release, a number of corrections have been made to the data files as presented on the original CD-ROM set and all copies of the first pressing have been distributed. Switchboard is a collection of about 2,400 two-sided telephone conversations among 543 speakers (302 male, 241 female) from all areas of the United States. A computer-driven robot operator system handled the calls, giving the caller appropriate recorded prompts, selecting and dialing another person (the callee) to take part in a conversation, introducing a topic for discussion and recording the speech from the two subjects into separate channels until the conversation was finished. About 70 topics were provided, of which about 50 were used frequently. Selection of topics and callees was constrained so that: (1) no two speakers would converse together more than once and (2) no one spoke more than once on a given topic. *Data* In this release, assembled and published by the LDC, all known errors affecting the original publication of speech files were corrected. In addition, modifications have been made to the contents of the NIST Sphere headers of all speech files, to identify each file as being part of the new release and to make the usage of the sample_count header field consistent with standard Sphere usage. (In particular, the sample_count field should reflect the number of samples on each channel in the file. In the initial release, this field was improperly set to be the total number of samples in both channels of the file this has been corrected in the new release.) Since the 1997 release, the Switchboard transcripts have been carefully revised at The Institute for Signal and Information Processing (ISIP) and additional problems have been discovered and patched. Three speech files, part of the original release, were inadvertently left off the 1997 revision. After corpus users noted some problems in the original speaker attribution table, LDC audited the problem calls and corrected the attributions. The latest version of ISIP transcriptions, the ISIP update of the ICSI phonetic transcriptions, and corrected word alignments are all available at ISIP. The LDC makes the transcript summaries available via http. Researchers have used SWB-1 data for various annotation projects including discourse annotation/speech acts, part-of-speech tagging and parsing, up-to-date orthographic transcriptions, and phonetic transcriptions. This summary documents which files have been used for the various annotations. In addition to the index of these file characteristics, there is also a table detailing speaker attributes.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGodfrey, John J.10aHolliman, Edward403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S6203380nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245002400139264007300163336003800236336003300274337002600307338003200333500001300365500004300378506005100421520219100472520005102663546004202714655002802756700002102784700001702805700001702822856014902839856006602988m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1997    pau        u        eng d  a15856312058 aLDC97S638 aISLRN: 566-795-587-797-8  adc00aThe CMU Kids Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1997]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC97S63  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S631 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis database is comprised of sentences read aloud by children. It was originally designed in order to create a training set of children's speech for the SPHINX II automatic speech recognizer for its use in the LISTEN project at Carnegie Mellon University. *Data* The children range in age from six to eleven (see details below) and were in first through third grades (the 11-year-old was in 6th grade) at the time of recording. There were 24 male and 52 female speakers. Although the girls outnumber the boys, we feel that the small difference in vocal tract length between the two at this age should make the effect of this imbalance negligible. There are 5,180 utterances in all. The speakers come from two separate populations. Since the LISTEN reading coach needed good examples of reading aloud, it was decided that the majority of the speakers should be "good" readers. They were recorded in the summer of 1995 and were enrolled in either the Chatham College Summer Camp or the Mount Lebanon Extended Day Summer Fun program in Pittsburgh. They were recorded on-site. This set will hereafter be called SUM95. There are 44 speakers and 3,333 utterances in this set. The LISTEN system also needed examples of errorful reading and dialectic variants. The readers who supplied this type of speech come from a school which has a high population of children who are at risk of growing up poor readers and who could therefore benefit from any reading tutor or other system built upon this database. They come from Fort Pitt School in Pittsburgh and were recorded in April 1996. This subset will be referred to as FP. There are 32 speakers and 1,847 utterances in this set. The list of speakers, the set they are in and the number of sentences per speaker can be found in the "tables" directory, in the file named "speaker.tbl." It should be noted that although there will be some dialectal variation in the speech of the SUM95 subset, the speech of the FP subset gives us a very good representation of dialects of the children that may be targeted for the LISTEN system. However, the user should be aware that the speakers' dialect partly reflects what is locally called "Pittsburghese."  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aEskenazi, Maxine10aMostow, Jack10aGraff, David403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S6302507nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245005200139264007300191336003800264336003300302337002600335338003200361500001300393500004300406506005100449520124200500546004201742655002801784700001701812700002201829700002401851700002201875700002301897700002201920856014901942856006602091m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1997    pau        u        eng d  a15856310868 aLDC97S668 aISLRN: 827-422-903-193-6  adc00a1996 English Broadcast News Dev and Eval (HUB4)  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1997]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC97S66  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S661 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe 1996 Broadcast News Speech Corpus contains a total of 104 hours of broadcasts from ABC, CNN and CSPAN television networks and NPR and PRI radio networks with corresponding transcripts.

These occurrences are provided in about 192,800 sentences taken from the Brown corpus and the Wall Street Journal and have been hand tagged by students at the Linguistics Program of the National University of Singapore. WordNet 1.5 sense definitions of these nouns and verbs were used to identify a word sense for each occurrence of each word. *Data* In addition to providing the word occurrences in their full sentential context, the corpus includes complete listings of the WordNet 1.5 sense definitions used in the tagging. The following example illustrates the format of a sentence with a sense tag for the word "action," followed by the corresponding WordNet1.5 sense definition: ca01.db #020 `` These >> actions 8 proceeding, legal proceeding, judicial proceeding, proceedings -- (the institution of a legal action) => due process, due process of law -- (the administration of justice according to established rules and principles) => group action -- (action taken by a group of people) => act, human action, human activity -- (something that people do or cause to happen) (In the actual corpus, all tagged occurrences of a given noun or verb are stored together in one file, with each full sentence on one line; all noun and verb word sense definitions are stored together in two separate files.) This sense tagged corpus was provided by Hwee Tou Ng of the Defence Science Organisation (DSO) of Singapore. It was first reported in the following paper at ACL-96: "Integrating Multiple Knowledge Sources to Disambiguate Word Sense: An Exemplar-Based Approach," by Hwee Tou Ng and Hian Beng Lee, in Proceedings of the 34th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 40-47, Santa Cruz, California, USA, June 1996.

The aim was to create a corpus for the study of telephone transducer effects on speech which minimized confounding factors, such as variable telephone channels and background noise. HTIMIT was created by playing ten TIMIT sentences from 192 male and 192 females through a stereo loudspeaker into different transducers positioned directly in front of the loudspeaker and digitizing the output from the transducers. Ten (10) transducers (telephone handsets) were used. Most of these were not new; handsets with obvious damage were not used, but in order to obtain some diversity with a limited number of handsets, handsets were selected to have variable sound characteristics, transducer designs or, in the case of electrets, different grill designs. Further information about the handsets is provided in the corpus documentation. *Data* The collection procedure was not ideal with respect to realism of sound transduction, but it does allow for the collection of speech from a large number of speakers repeating identical speech on each instance. Furthermore, coupled with the phonetic markings from the original TIMIT corpus, HTIMIT offers the ability to study handset transducer effects on speech recognition systems. To address the realism of the sound transduction in HTIMIT, a second corpus using the same handsets but with live people speaking into the handsets is also available. This corpus is called the Lincoln Laboratory Handset Database (LLHDB) LDC93S68.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aReynolds, Douglas403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S6702214nmm a22002893i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245001000139264007300149336003800222336003300260337002600293338003200319500001300351500004300364506005100407520115900458546004201617655002801659700002201687856014901709856006601858m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1998    pau        u        eng d  a15856313618 aLDC98S688 aISLRN: 842-109-246-373-3  adc00aLLHDB  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1998]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC98S68  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S681 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aLLHDB consists of recordings of people speaking into ten different telephone handsets. The aim was to create a corpus for the study of telephone transducer effects on speech which minimized confounding factors, such as variable telephone channels and background noise. LLHDB was created by having volunteers speak prompted and extemporaneous speech into different transducers in a sound-proof room and directly digitizing the output from the transducers on a SunSparc A/D at a 8kHz sampling rate and a 16-bit resolution. *Data* There were three types of speech recorded for each handset. First, the speaker read the "rainbow passage" [Nolan 83], a 97 word passage sometimes used in phonetic research. Second, the speaker read ten sentences extracted from TIMIT (LDC93S1). Finally, the speaker was asked to describe a photograph for approximately 40 seconds (a different photograph was used for each handset). LLHDB contains speech from 53 speakers (24 males and 29 females) recruited from the laboratory. Because the same handsets are used in both HTIMIT (LDC98S67) and LLHDB, it is possible to compare the effects of the two different recording methods.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aReynolds, Douglas403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S6802809nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041001300132041002300145042000700168245004200175264007300217336003800290336003300328337002600361338003200387500001300419500004300432506005100475520167900526546005902205655002802264856014902292856006602441m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1998    pau        u        chi d  a15856313108 aLDC98S698 aISLRN: 333-068-970-015-50 achibeng07acmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aHUB5 Mandarin Telephone Speech Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1998]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC98S69  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S691 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis release of HUB5 Mandarin training data consists of 42 calls derived from the CALLFRIEND Mandarin Chinese Mainland Dialect (Language ID) collection.

It has been prepared to serve as a supplement to the 1996 Broadcast News Speech collection (consisting of over 100 hours of similar recordings). The primary motivation for this collection is to provide additional training data for the DARPA "HUB4" Project on continuous speech recognition in the broadcast domain. *Data* Transcripts have been made of all recordings in this publication, manually time aligned to the phrasal level, annotated to identify boundaries between news stories, speaker turn boundaries and gender information about the speakers. The transcription conventions are described in the file "transcrp.doc" -- please note that this file describes the transcription methods by reference to text formatting conventions used internally by the LDC during the transcription process. The released version of the transcripts is in SGML format, comparable to the format that was used in the 1996 Broadcast News Speech transcriptions and there is accompanying documentation and an SGML DTD file, included with the transcription release.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aFiscus, Jonathan G.10aGarofolo, John S.10aPrzybocki, Mark10aFisher, William M.10aPallett, David S.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S7103639nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041001300132041002300145042000700168245004700175264007300222336003800295336003300333337002600366338003200392500001300424500004300437506005100480520233700531546005902868655002802927700001602955700002602971700001702997700001903014700002903033856014903062856006603211m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1998    pau        u        chi d  a15856313968 aLDC98S728 aISLRN: 388-547-288-616-70 achibeng07acmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aTaiwanese Putonghua Speech and Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1998]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC98S72  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S721 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis set of data on Taiwanese accented Putonghua (PTH) was gathered by San Duanmu at the University of Michigan. The data was recorded in Taiwan from December 1994 to January 1995. Taiwanese accented PTH refers to PTH spoken by people who were born in Taiwan and whose first language is Taiwanese (Southern Min). *Data* A total of 40 speakers; ranging in age, education, birth place and family dialect; were recorded. There were five two-speaker dialogues and 30 single-speaker monologues. The dialogues were about 20 minutes each and the monologues were about 10 minutes each. Dialogues were recorded on two tracks, one for each speaker. Monologues were recorded on one track. The recordings were done in ordinary, but quiet rooms. The speakers were asked in advance to speak in conversation style, without notes, on any topic they chose, or no topic at all. Most speakers spoke spontaneously and the topic drifted freely. Some speakers talked about their professional work in a rather formal way. One speaker (#20, a public health official) used notes. Overall, the corpus provides an informative sampling of variation in speech style. The recording tools consisted of a portable DAT (Teac) which recorded at a 44.1 kHz sampling rate at 16 bits linear quantization. The microphones were AudioTechnica lapel microphones with a preamp and XLR connection to the DAT. The XLR helped low noise recordings and the AudioTechnica provided wide bandwidth, flat response over the speech range of interest, was unidirectional to minimize cross-talk and very light in comparison with standard microphones. Both single-speaker monologues and two-speaker dialogues were recorded using this system on standard DAT tape. For publication on CD-ROM, the original DAT recordings were downsampled to a 16 kHz sample rate. Before recording, all speakers read and signed the "Informed Consent Form," which was written in Chinese and which largely followed the standard format approved by the Human Subject Committee of the University of Michigan. The form stated that the participation in the recording was entirely voluntary and that the speech may be used for linguistic teaching and research purposes. The speech data are accompanied by transcripts. The monologues have start and end time stamps. The five dialogues are time stamped by speaker turn.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

It contains speech and transcripts of 30 hours of broadcast news from the following sources: Televisa, Univision and VOA. *Data* All acoustic files are in NIST SPHERE format, without compression. The sample data are 16-bit linear PCM, 16-KHz sample frequency, single channel. Most files contain 30 minutes of recorded material and some contain 60 or 120 minutes (approximately); the sampling format requires roughly two megabytes (MB) per minute of recording, so the file sizes are typically around 60 MB, with some files ranging up to 120 or 240 MB. The transcripts are in SGML format, using the same markup conventions that have been applied to the other 1997 Broadcast News speech corpora (in English and Mandarin) and are transmitted by FTP, not on the CD-ROMs with speech data.  aContent in Spanish.

This corpus was collected by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), in support of a project on Speaker Recognition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. This release consists of speech files only; these calls were not transcribed. *Data* Speakers were solicited by the LDC to participate in this telephone speech collection effort via the internet, publications (advertisements) and personal contacts. Potential participants responded from all areas of the United States, although the majority of the subjects were from the Mid-Atlantic area: (PA=303), (NJ=116), (NY=53), (DE=13), (CT=12), (MD=14), (OH=13) and (MA=8). Most of the participants in SWB-2 Phase I were college students from the following universities: Penn State University, University of Delaware, University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University and Rutgers University. Of the 657 participants, 358 were female and 299 were male. An LDC recruiter asked all participants for the following demographic information: age, sex, years of completed education, country of birth, city and state where raised. Each recruit was asked to participate in at least ten five-minute phone calls. Ideally each participant would receive five calls at a designated number and make five calls from phones with different telephone numbers (ANI codes). The average subject participated in 11 conversations; however, one gentleman participated in 64 calls. A suggested topic of discussion was given (read by the automated operator), although participants could chat about whatever they preferred. Each of the 657 participants placed their calls via a toll-free robot operator maintained by the LDC. Access to the robot operator was possible via a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) issued by the recruiting staff at the LDC when the caller enrolled in the project. Upon conclusion of the study all calls were audited by LDC staff members. Particular attention was paid to PIN verification (matching speaker with PIN), checking call duration and call quality. Upon completion of this process checks were issued and mailed to participants.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGraff, David10aCanavan, Alexandra10aZipperlen, George403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S7502195nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245003900139264007300178336003800251336003300289337002600322338003200348500001300380500004300393506005100436520108300487546004201570655002801612700002001640700001801660856014901678856006601827m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1998    pau        u        eng d  a15856312998 aLDC98S768 aISLRN: 773-295-516-240-5  adc00a1998 Speaker Recognition Benchmark  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1998]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC98S76  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S761 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe 1998 speaker recognition evaluation is part of an ongoing series of yearly benchmark tests conducted by NIST. These tests are intended to provide a stable reference point for measuring and comparing the performance of diverse methods for text-independent speaker recognition over the telephone and should be of interest to all researchers working in this area of speech technology development. The test sets and evaluation protocols have been designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported and to be accessible. *Data* In 1996 and 1997 handset variation was featured as a prominent technical challenge to be addressed. While handset variation remains a formidable challenge, the 1998 evaluation directs greatest attention toward speaker recognition performance for the case in which both training and test data are from the same source. The speech data were recorded by the LDC between January and March 1997 most of the speakers recruited for this collection were college students from the Great Lakes (Northern Midwest) region of the U.S.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aPrzybocki, Mark10aMartin, Alvin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S7601735nmm a22003373i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245002800139264007300167336003800240336003300278337002600311338003200337500001300369500004300382506005100425520052300476546004200999655002801041700003101069700001801100700002501118700002601143700001301169856014901182856006601331m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1998    pau        u        eng d  a15856314188 aLDC98S778 aISLRN: 074-386-777-466-6  adc00aVoicemail Corpus Part I  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1998]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC98S77  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S771 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis corpus was created by: M.

Of these three sources, the first two comprise the bulk of the collection and are represented in roughly equal amounts. Only a relatively small sample of KAZN-AM recordings is included, owing to the relatively high proportion of unusable material in that source(e.g., commercials, local traffic reports). Corresponding audio files are released as 1997 Mandarin Broadcast News Speech (HUB4-NE) LDC98S73. *Data* The transcripts were created by native speakers of Mandarin working at LDC. They are in GB-encoded form with SGML tags to identify story boundaries, speaker turn boundaries and phrasal pauses. The tags include time stamps to align the text with the speech data. Word segmentation (white-space between words) is included. A working DTD is provided, and the markup is consistent with that of the 1997 English and Spanish HUB4 collections.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

This initiative is directed toward computer processing of language data, both text and speech. The objective is namely to explore techniques for detecting the appearance of new and unexpected topics and for tracking the reappearance and evaluation of them. *Data* The TDT corpus comprises a set of stories that includes both newswire (text) and broadcast news (speech). Each story is represented as a stream of text, in which the text is either taken directly from the newswire (Reuters) or is a manual transcription of the broadcast news speech (CNN). The corpus spans the period from July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995. It contains approximately 16,000 stories, with about half taken from Reuters newswire and half from CNN broadcast news transcripts. An integral and key part of the corpus is the annotation of the corpus in terms of the events discussed in the stories. 25 events were defined that span a variety of event types and that cover a subset of the events discussed in the corpus stories. Annotation data for these events are included in the corpus and provide a basis for training TDT systems.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aAllan, James10aYang, Yiming10aCarbonell, Jaime10aYamron, Jon10aDoddington, George R.10aWayne, Charles403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98T2502875nmm a22003373i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041001300132041002300145042000700168245003000175264007300205336003800278336002600316337002600342338003200368500001300400500004300413506005100456520167900507546005902186655002002245700001902265700001702284700002102301856014902322856006602471m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1998    pau        u        chi d  a15856313298 aLDC98T268 aISLRN: 943-578-103-129-20 achibeng07acmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aHUB5 Mandarin Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1998]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC98T26  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98T261 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis release of HUB5 Mandarin training data consists of 42 calls derived from the CALLFRIEND Mandarin Chinese Mainland Dialect (Language ID) collection. The transcribed data is intended as additional training data in support of the project on Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition (LVCSR), also sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. The transcripts cover a contiguous 5-30 minute segment taken from a recorded conversation lasting up to 30 minutes. *Data* Speakers were solicited by the LDC to participate in this telephone speech collection effort via the internet, publications (advertisements) and personal contacts. A total of 200 call originators were found, each of whom placed a telephone call via a toll-free robot operator maintained by the LDC. Access to the robot operator was possible via a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) issued by the recruiting staff at the LDC when the caller enrolled in the project. The participants were made aware that their telephone call would be recorded, as were the call recipients. The call was allowed only if both parties agreed to being recorded. Each caller was allowed to talk up to 30 minutes. Upon successful completion of the call, the caller was paid $20 (in addition to making a free long-distance telephone call). Each caller was allowed to place only one telephone call. They were given no guidelines concerning what they should talk about. Once a caller was recruited to participate, he/she was given a free choice of whom to call. Most participants called family members or close friends. All calls originated in North America and were placed to various locations within North America.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

These calls were originally collected by the LDC in support of the project on Language Recognition, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. All of these calls are being designated as additional training data for the project on Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition (LVCSR) in Spanish. *Data* Speakers were solicited by the LDC to participate in this telephone speech collection effort via the internet, publications (advertisements) and personal contacts. A total of 200 call originators were found, each of whom placed a telephone call via a toll-free robot operator maintained by the LDC. Access to the robot operator was possible via a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) issued by the recruiting staff at the LDC when the caller enrolled in the project. Once a caller was recruited to participate, he/she was given a free choice of whom to call. Recruits were given no guidelines concerning what they should talk about. Most participants called family members or close friends. All calls originated in North America and were placed to various locations within North America, Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic. The participants were made aware that their telephone call would be recorded, as were the call recipients. The call was allowed only if both parties agreed to being recorded. Each caller was allowed to talk up to 30 minutes. Upon successful completion of the call, the caller was paid $20 (in addition to making a free long-distance telephone call). Each caller was allowed to place only one telephone call. HUB5 Spanish speech and transcript data may be obtained by contacting the LDC  aContent in Spanish.

The primary motivation for this collection is to provide additional training data for the DARPA "HUB4" Project on continuous speech recognition in the broadcast domain. *Data* This set of 18 CD-ROMs contains a total of 97 hours of recordings from radio and television news broadcasts, gathered between June 1997 and February 1998. Transcripts have been made of all recordings in this publication, manually time aligned to the phrasal level, annotated to identify boundaries between news stories, speaker turn boundaries and gender information about the speakers. The transcription conventions are described in the file "transcrp.doc" -- please note that this file describes the transcription methods by reference to text formatting conventions used internally by the LDC during the transcription process. The released version of the transcripts is in SGML format, comparable to the format that was used in the 1996 Broadcast News Speech transcriptions and there is accompanying documentation and an SGML DTD file, included with the transcription release.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aAlabiso, Jennifer10aMacIntyre, Robert10aGraff, David403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98T2802220nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041001300132041002300145042000700168245005400175264007300229336003800302336002600340337002600366338003200392500001300424500004300437506005100480520094700531520005101478546005001529655002001579700001701599700002201616700001701638856014901655856006601804m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1998    pau        u        spa d  a15856312808 aLDC98T298 aISLRN: 873-191-836-513-00 aspabeng07aspabeng2iso639-3  adc00a1997 Spanish Broadcast News Transcripts (HUB4-NE)  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1998]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC98T29  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98T291 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis corpus contains a portion of the acoustic data designated as the training set for the 1997 DARPA HUB4 Spanish Benchmark. It contains speech and transcripts of 30 hours of broadcast news from the following sources: Televisa, Univision and VOA. Corresponding speech data is released as 1997 Spanish Broadcast News Speech (HUB4-NE) (LDC98S74) *Data* All acoustic files are in NIST SPHERE format, without compression. The sample data are 16-bit linear PCM, 16-KHz sample frequency, single channel. Most files contain 30 minutes of recorded material, and some contain 60 or 120 minutes (approximately); the sampling format requires roughly two megabytes (MB) per minute of recording, so the file sizes are typically around 60 MB, with some files ranging up to 120 or 240 MB. The transcripts are in SGML format, using the same markup conventions that have been applied to the other 1997 Broadcast News speech corpora (in English and Mandarin).  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Spanish.

The same TIPSTER-style SGML markup is used in formatting the data. The data sources are as follows: Source Dates Approx. # Words Covered (Millions) ------------------------------------------------------- Los Angeles Times & 09/97-04/98 11 Washington Post New York Times News 01/97-04/98 116 Syndicate Associated Press 11/94-04/98 143 World Stream English ------------------------------------------------------- The previous North American News release included prior materials from both the LA Times/Washington Post and the New York Times; this supplement provides the continuation of those sources. *Data* The LDC has been collecting the Associated Press Worldstream newswire service in six languages since 1994. The is the first release of the English language portion of this service. The material in this set is typically NOT North American in origin -- the reporters who provide the stories may or may not be American born, but the locations and topics covered are much more heavily international in comparison to the North American wire services. Reports from Asia, Africa and Europe are found here that show up only rarely or not at all in North American newspapers, including political, financial and sports stories that are presumably geared to English-speaking readers in those parts of the world. This release, when combined with the LDC's earlier NA News Text Corpus, constitutes all the English-language newswire text collected by the LDC between January 1994 and April 1998, inclusive.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aMacIntyre, Robert403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98T3002676nmm a22002893i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245003300139264007300172336003800245336002600283337002600309338003200335500001300367500004300380506005100423520161300474546004202087655002002129700002202149856014902171856006602320m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1998    pau        u        eng d  a15856312218 aLDC98T318 aISLRN: 905-430-625-113-0  adc00a1996 CSR HUB4 Language Model  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1998]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC98T31  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98T311 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis corpus contains data from transcribed news broadcasts, designated for use in the baseline language model (LM) for the 1996 CSR HUB4 Evaluation. *Data* The LDC obtained the bulk of the data from broadcast news CD-ROMs produced by Primary Source Media, Inc. This portion includes the period from January 1992 to April 1996 and contains approximately one gigabyte of data uncompressed. This release also includes about 36 megabytes of material received on floppy disks covering the period from late May through June 1996, with somewhat different format from the bulk of the data. The text data are presented in two forms: (1) a relatively unprocessed ("raw" or "sentence-tagged") form and (2) a fully processed ("conditioned," "verbalized-punctuation") form. The "raw" form includes the header and footer information accompanying the articles, such as network, show name, headline, copyright, credits and so forth; the text and ancillary data are presented in a fairly consistent (though simple) SGML format. The "processed" form contains only the text content of the articles, together with SGML tags to mark the boundaries of articles, paragraphs and sentences; the text content has been modified by replacing numeric strings (dates, dollar amounts, quantities) with orthographic strings (e.g. "nineteen ninety six"), replacing abbreviations ("Inc.," "Ltd.," "Corp.," etc.) with corresponding full-word forms and replacing punctuation characters with corresponding word tokens (e.g. "," becomes "COMMA"). This release also includes an archive of the tools used to create the "processed" form of the data.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aMacIntyre, Robert403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98T3102968nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245001000139264007300149336003800222336002600260337002600286338003200312500001300344500004300357506005100400520189500451546004202346655002002388700002302408700002002431856014902451856006602600m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1998    pau        u        eng d  a15856313538 aLDC98T328 aISLRN: 380-519-899-609-3  adc00aJURIS  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1998]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC98T32  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98T321 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis publication represents a release of the JURIS (Justice Department Retrieval and Inquiry System) data collection that has been made available to the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) by the U.S. Department of Justice. The time span of the text ranges from the 1700s to the early 1990s. *Data* There are 1,664 individual text files in the corpus, 1011 on the first CD-ROM and 653 on the second. The original archive consisted of 219 files ranging between less than 1 MB and nearly 70 MB in size. In order to make the data more accessible for researchuse, we chose to divide the larger files into pieces, such that the average file size was about 2 MB when uncompressed (the largest uncompressed file size is about 4.5 MB). Divisions of the files were done at document boundaries, so all files contain whole documents. There are a total of 694,667 document units in the corpus and these can be categorized to some extent with regard to their content. The following is a partial list of categories and their descriptions drawn from JURIS documentation contained in the corpus. The terminology and organization of categories are those used in the JURIS documentation: * Case Law * Executive Order * Regulations * Federal Register * Statutory Law * Administrative Law * International Agreements * Freedom of Information Act and related documents * Indian Law * Tax Law * Brief As many of the documents contain Social Security Numbers of the parties involved, these have been redacted to protect the privacy of those individuals. All valid Social Security Numbers have been replaced with the string XXX-XX-XXXX. In some documents, number strings may be identified as Social Security Numbers, but they are in fact substitutions such as the series, 123-45-6789 or 987-65-4321. These ersatz numbers have been left unchanged. Some personal names have also been redacted and replaced with XXXXXXXX.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aCanavan, Alexandra10aMorgovsky, Paul403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98T3202564nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041001300132041002300145042000700168245003900175264007300214336003800287336002600325337002600351338003200377500001300409500004300422506005100465520124500516546005801761655002001819700001801839700002601857700001901883700001901902700002101921700003301942856014901975856006602124m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1997    pau        u        ara d  a15856315588 aLDC99L228 aISLRN: 155-303-991-688-20 aarabeng07aarzbeng2iso639-3  adc00aEgyptian Colloquial Arabic Lexicon  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1997]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC99L22  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99L221 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis lexicon represents the first electronic pronunciation dictionary of Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA), the spoken variety of Arabic found in Egypt.

The sources for the language model include Wall Street Journal (1987-1994), Associated Press (1989-1991), and San Jose Mercury News (1991); all taken from the three CD-ROM volumes of TIPSTER (LDC93T3A). To extend the coverage of common words that happen not to occur in the LDC corpora sampled, an additional 2,922 words (ie. compounds, companies, places, languages, and numerals) were added from other sources. Each word was read by the speaker in a quiet recording studio, using a Sennheiser HMD 410 microphone and a Sony DAT recorder. The recordings were downsampled to 16KHz for storage on disk with the individual lexical utterances segmented into separate waveform files, with a consistent margin of silence on both sides of each word. The CD-ROMs were created using the ISO-9660 Level 2 data format, along with Rock Ridge extensions. All common computer operating systems should be able to read the full-length file names. The corpus has since been converted to a web downloaded file.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aSeidl-Friedman, Amanda Hallie10aKobayashi, Masato10aCieri, Christopher403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99L2302018nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245001000139264007300149336003800222336003300260337002600293338003200319500001300351500004300364506005100407520089900458520005101357546004201408655002801450700002301478856014901501856006601650m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1999    pau        u        eng d  a15856314508 aLDC99S788 aISLRN: 651-984-335-857-7  adc00aSUSAS  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1999]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC99S78  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99S781 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aSpeech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) was created by the Robust Speech Processing Laboratory at the University of Colorado-Boulder under the direction of Professor John H.

A total of 32 speakers (13 female, 19 male), with ages ranging from 22 to 76 years were employed to generate in excess of 16,000 utterances. SUSAS also contains several longer speech files from four Apache helicopter pilots. Those helicopter speech files were transcribed by the Linguistic Data Consortium and are available in SUSAS Transcripts (LDC99T33). A common highly confusable vocabulary set of 35 aircraft communication words make up the database.

This corpus was collected by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) in support of a project on Speaker Recognition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. *Data* Participants in SWB-2 Phase II were recruited from the following midwestern college campuses: Iowa State University, Michigan State University, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of Wisconsin at Madison, Northwestern University, and Ohio State University. Solicitation methods included the Internet, newspaper advertisements and personal contacts. The majority of the participants resided in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Michigan and Illinois as follows: Minnesota - 156 speakers Wisconsin -- 105 speakers Ohio -- 70 speakers Iowa 64 speakers Michigan -- 41 speakers Illinois - 37 speakers Each recruit was asked to participate in at least ten five-minute phone calls. Ideally each participant would receive five calls at a designated number and make five calls from phones with different (ANI) codes. Participants were asked to discuss a specific topic (read by the automated operator) and not to provide personal information during their call. Each of the 679 participants placed their calls via a toll-free robot operator maintained by LDC. Access to the robot operator was possible via a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) issued by the recruiting staff at LDC when the caller enrolled in the project. Upon conclusion of the study all calls were audited by LDC staff members. Particular attention was paid to PIN verification (matching speaker with PIN), checking call duration, and call quality. Upon completion of this process, checks were issued and mailed to participants. The conversations have not been transcribed.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGraff, David10aWalker, Kevin10aCanavan, Alexandra403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99S7902207nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103042000700132245003900139264007300178336003800251336003300289337002600322338003200348500001300380500004300393506005100436520109500487546004201582655002801624700002001652700001801672856014901690856006601839m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1999    pau        u        eng d  a15856314268 aLDC99S808 aISLRN: 095-881-879-489-0  adc00a1997 Speaker Recognition Benchmark  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1999]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC99S80  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99S801 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe 1997 speaker recognition evaluation was part of an ongoing series of yearly evaluations conducted by NIST.

Corresponding transcript files were created by Federal Document Clearing House and enhanced by the LDC to include: story boundaries, disfluency markers, and speaker and gender identification. In keeping with HUB4 style transcription conventions, LDC spelled all digit strings in standard orthography. Commercial and music segments, while a part of the audio publication, were excluded from the transcripts. The timestamps mark the beginning of each speaker turn relative to the beginning of the recording and are precise to the 100th of a second. Although the transcripts were created using HUB4 conventions, the second and third pass quality checks, typically required by government sponsored evaluation projects, were skipped. *Data* The USC Marketplace recordings from the summer of 1996 were received on digital audio tapes (DATs) from the University of Southern California. LDC excluded from this set the roughly seven hours of broadcast that are currently included in the 1996 English Broadcast News publication. Marketplace is produced by USC Radio in Los Angeles, a division of the University of Southern California.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aCanavan, Alexandra10aMiller, Dave, 1960-10aMorgovsky, Paul403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99S8203026nmm a22003013i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001300075024002900088042000700117245005700124264007300181336003800254336003300292337002600325338003200351500001300383500004300396506005100439520188700490546004202377655002802419700001702447700002202464700002302486856014902509856006602658m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1999    pau        u        eng d8 aLDC99S838 aISLRN: 389-320-759-767-3  adc00aTactical Speaker Identification Speech Corpus (TSID)  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1999]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC99S83  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99S831 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe Tactical Speaker Identification Corpus (TSID), which was collected by Douglas Reynolds and Gerald C. O'Leary of MIT Lincoln Labs, contains recordings of 35 speakers (four female, 31 male), using a variety of different radio transmitters and receivers. *Data* The recording sessions were conducted by assembling the speakers into seven groups of five, then having each speaker perform the following tasks: - read a list of TIMIT sentences - read a list of digit strings - give directions for traveling from one point to another using a map (unscripted map task) Each speaker performed this set of tasks on each of three transmitters (xmtr1-3), and the utterances were recorded simlutaneously on DAT recorders attached to each of six receivers (rcvr1-6), which were located at some distance (well out of ear-shot) from the transmitter. Recordings were also made at the same time on a DAT recorder near the speaker using a head-mounted microphone to provide a reference wide-band recording of the speech (refwb). As a result, the corpus is organized along four dimensions: speaker, transmitter, receiver, and speaking task; this organization can be viewed as a four-dimensional matrix, with 35x3x7x3 cells. Due to some occasional mishaps and malfunctions during the collection, some cells in this matrix are either empty or only partially full. In addition to the tasks listed above, three pairs of speakers also participated in a two-way map task using xmtr3; in this case, one of the speakers in the task gives directions to the other for tracing a route on a map, and both speakers are recorded on a single audio channel at each of the receivers (except for the "refwb" recording: the two speakers were separated by some distance, using radio communication to perform the task, and only one of them used a head-mounted microphone and local DAT recorder for wide-band recording).  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGraff, David10aReynolds, Douglas10aO'Leary, Gerald C.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99S8306253nmm a22003373i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245003800177264007300215336003800288336003300326337002600359338003200385500001500417500004500432506005100477520497500528520005105503546005005554650004905604655002805653700001705681856014905698856006805847m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2006    pau        u        spa d  a15856339178 aLDC2006S378 aISLRN: 331-222-724-302-40 aspabeng07aspabeng2iso639-3  adc00aWest Point Heroico Spanish Speech  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2006]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2006S37  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006S371 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis file contains documentation on West Point Heroico Spanish Speech, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2006S37 and ISBN 1-58563-391-7. West Point Heroico Spanish Speech is a database of digital recordings of spoken Spanish. It was designed and collected by staff and faculty of the Department of Foreign Languages (DFL) and Center for Technology Enhanced Language Learning (CTELL) to develop acoustic models for speech recognition systems. The U.S. government uses these systems to provide speech-recognition enhanced language learning courseware to government linguists and students enrolled in various government language programs. Additionally, parts of this corpus were designed to model question/answer dialogues for use in domain-specific speech-to-speech translation systems. The corpus consists of two subcorpora, one collected in September 2001 at El Heroico Colegio Militar (HEROICO), the Mexican Military Academy in Mexico City, and the other at USMA at different times since 1997. The USMA subcorpus includes data from non-native speakers and data collected through a throat microphone. *Data* Two kinds of prompt scripts were used, one to elicit read speech and one for free-response answers to questions. The read speech prompts are also divided into two groups, one designed to elicit speech typical of language learning scenarios and the other for speech from educated native speakers. The scripts used to record read speech have a total of 724 distinct sentences. This number includes 205 short, simple sentences used in typical language learning scenarios. The other 519 sentences were extracted from lecture notes used at USMA in a military readings course. All of the read speech prompts are listed in two files in the transcripts directory: HEROICO- Recordings.txt and USMA-prompts.txt, containing the sentences read by informants at the Mexican Military Academy and USMA, respectively. Each line of these files has two fields separated by a tab, the first denoting the base name of the waveform file, and the second the prompt used in recording the utterence. The read speech data collected from informants at HEROICO are stored in the HEROICO/Recordings Spanish directory. The script used to elicit free-response answers contains 143 questions. The text that was actually presented to the informants is in the file named questions.txt in the transcripts directory. Data recorded from these prompts are stored in the HEROICO/Answers Spanish directory. The human-performed transcriptions of the informants answers are listed in the HEROICO-Answers.txt file in the transcripts directory. Again, each line of this file has two fields separated by a tab the first field contains two numbers separated by a slash. The first number is an identification index for the speaker. The second number is an index to the question. The second field on the line contains a word level transcription of the informants answer to the question indexed by the second number in the first field. So for example in the line: 100/10 no ella no tiene barba ni bigote no ella no tiene barba ni bigote is a transcription of the response speaker 100 gave to question 10. The corresponding waveform file is stored in the file 10.wav in the directory HEROICOAnswers Spanish100. Each speaker in the HEROICO subcorpus attempted to record 100 utter- ances by reading 75 sentences and giving 25 free-response answers to questions. Both native and non-native USMA informatnts read from the list of 205 simple sentences. The prompts used in the USMA subcorpus are listed in the file USMA-prompts.txt in the transcripts directory. This file has the same two-field format as the above transcription files. Some of the USMA informants wore an additional throat microphone. That data was recorded in a separate stream and stored in files whose names begin with the letter t. Data collected at USMA are stored under the USMA directory. The names of the directories under the USMA directory indicate whether the speaker was native or non-native. The speakers native country is also indicated in the case of native speakers. Speech data was collected at HEROICO using Pentium 450 mHz laptop computers running Windows 2000 with a 16-bit data size and sampling rate of 22,050 Hz. The recording script presented a visual display of the sentence to be recorded. The informant pressed a key and spoke the sentence. The recording was played back for review allowing the utterance to be re- recorded. A member of the data collection team was on hand during the recording session to verify recordings and provide technical assistance in case of malfunctioning equipment. The data from USMA was collected using several different microphones and formats. Most of the data were recorded on Pentium computers running Linux through an m-10 Shuer head-mounted microphone. Entropics ESPS programs were used in most cases, especially when both head-mounted and throat microphones were used.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Spanish.

L. Hansen and sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory. *Data* The transcripts in this release cover several speech files in the SUSAS collection, specifically, speech from four Apache helicopter pilots. The SUSAS speech database is partitioned into four domains, encompassing a wide variety of stresses and emotions. A total of 32 speakers (13 female, 19 male), with ages ranging from 22 to 76 years, were employed to generate in excess of 16,000 utterances. A common highly confusable vocabulary set of 35 aircraft communication words make up the database. All speech tokens were sampled using a 16-bit A/D converter at a sample rate of 8kHz.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aHansen, John H.

(NIKKEI), the largest Japanese daily financial newspaper, and Telerate, Inc. (formerly known as Dow Jones/Kyodo News Service), published primarily for managers of Japanese-owned corporations or Japanese employees working in North American financial institutions. The Telerate portion constitutes all newswire text collected by the LDC between December 1994 and September 1998. The Telerate data collected from June 1995 to September 1998 serves as a supplement to the original publication. All NIKKEI data was collected from December 1993 to November 1994 and is also available on the 1995 release of the Japanese Business News Text. The data, including SGML tags, breaks down as follows. # of Files Daily Average Size Total Size -------------------------------------------------- NIKKEI 364 514K 188MB Telerate 1060 336K 357MB The NIKKEI text was received on nine-track magnetic tape. The original character encoding was EBCDIC, but was converted to EUC encoding, which the LDC uses for its Japanese publications. The Telerate text was received via a digital transmission service installed at the LDC by Telerate. Custom software was written by the LDC to poll a central database and download articles individually. The character encoding is EUC. LDC added SGML tags automatically in order to identify individual stories within the daily collections.  aContent in Japanese.

Corresponding transcript files were created by Federal Document Clearing House and enhanced by the LDC to include: story boundaries, disfluency markers, and speaker and gender identification. In keeping with HUB4 style transcription conventions, LDC spelled all digit strings in standard orthography. Commercial and music segments, while a part of the audio publication, were excluded from the transcripts. The timestamps mark the beginning of each speaker turn relative to the beginning of the recording and are precise to the 100th of a second. Although the transcripts were created using HUB4 conventions, the second and third pass quality checks, typically required by government sponsored evaluation projects, were skipped. *Data* The USC Marketplace recordings from the summer of 1996 were received on digital audio tapes (DATs) from the University of Southern California. LDC excluded from this set the roughly seven hours of broadcast that are currently included in the 1996 English Broadcast News publication. Marketplace is produced by USC Radio in Los Angeles, a division of the University of Southern California.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aBroadcast journalismxLanguagevDatabases. 0aEnglish languagevDatabases. 0aSpeech perceptionxData processing.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aCanavan, Alexandra10aMiller, Dave, 1960-403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T3601602nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001300090024002900103041001300132041002300145042000700168245002900175264007300204336003800277336002600315337002600341338003200367500001300399500004300412506005100455520044400506546005300950655002001003700002101023700001701044856014901061856006601210m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s1999    pau        u        por d  a15856316048 aLDC99T408 aISLRN: 632-462-858-283-00 aporbeng07aporbeng2iso639-3  adc00aPortuguese Newswire Text  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[1999]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC99T40  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T401 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis corpus builds on the Portuguese data published previously in the European Language Newswire Text Corpus and contains the previously published material, as well as more recent material. *Data* The data in this corpus comes from Agence France Presse from May 13, 1994 through December 31, 1998 (June 27, 1996 - December 31, 1998 was previously unpublished by the LDC).

Our general strategy for SGML tagging is as follows: All document units (articles) are bounded by the tags DOC and /DOC, and within these units, the text content of each article is bounded by TEXT and /TEXT. Following each DOC tag is a DOCID tag that provides a unique identifying string for that article. Other tags within the DOC unit (but external to TEXT) provide additional information that was receieved with the article (e.g. headline, dateline, byline, keywords, etc), but the inventory and nature of additional information varies from one source to the next (and in some cases, from one article to the next), and this variability is reflected in the SGML tags that are used to preserve the information. Within the TEXT units, tagging is kept to a minimum, typically consisting only of paragraph tags.  aContent in Spanish.

CSLU: Foreign Accented English Release 1.2 consists of continuous speech in English by native speakers of 22 different languages: Arabic, Cantonese, Czech, Farsi, French, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Malay, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian and Iberian), Russian, Swedish, Spanish, Swahili, Tamil and Vietnamese. The corpus contains 4925 telephone-quality utterances, information about the speakers' linguistic backgrounds and perceptual judgments about the accents in the utterances. The speakers were asked to speak about themselves in English for 20 seconds. Three native speakers of American English independently listened to each utterance and judged the speakers' accents on a 4-point scale: negligible/no accent, mild accent, strong accent and very strong accent. This corpus is intended to support the study of the underlying characteristics of foreign accent and to enable research, development and evaluation of algorithms for the identification and understanding of accented speech.

CSLU: Yes/No Version 1.2 is a collection of answers to yes/no questions from various telephone speech corpora created by the Center for Spoken Language Understanding, Oregon Health and Science University (CSLU). The corpus contains approximately 20,000 examples of roughly 18,000 speakers saying "yes" or "no" in response to various questions. Each speech file in the corpus has a corresopnding orthographic transcription following the CSLU Labeling Conventions. In cases where a transcription did not already exist, the utterance was run through a speech recognizer to automatically obtain the transcription. The data were collected from both analog and digital phone lines. The analog data were recorded using a Gradient Technologies analog-to-digital conversion box. These files were recorded as 16-bit, 8 khz and stored in a linear format. The digital data were recorded with the CSLU T1 digital data collection system. These files were sampled at 8 khz 8-bit and stored as ulaw files. All of the data use the RIFF standard file format. This file format is 16-bit linearly encoded.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases. 0aTelephone callsvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aNoel, Mike403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007S0504657nmm a22003973i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245003000177264007300207336003800280336003300318337002600351338003200377500001500409500004500424506005100469520317300520520005103693546005903744650005003803650005103853650004503904655002803949700001903977700001603996700001304012700001704025856014904042856006804191m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2007    pau        u        chi d  a15856344258 aLDC2007S098 aISLRN: 378-255-081-778-80 achibeng07acmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aMandarin Affective Speech  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2007]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2007S09  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007S091 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aMandarin Affective Speech is a database of emotional speech consisting of audio recordings and corresponding transcripts collected in 2005 at the Advance Computing and System Laboratory, College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China. This corpus was designed with two goals: first, to serve as a tool for linguistic and prosodic feature investigation of emotional expression in Mandarin Chinese; and second, to provide a source of training and test data essential to support research in speaker recognition with affective speech. The speech database was recorded by eliciting speakers to express different emotional states in response to stimuli. The speakers read scenarios designed to elicite an emotional response such as a colleague's mistake for anger, a pleasant trip for elation, a hurry-up scene for panic and a puppy's death for sadness. The five emotional states recorded are characterized as follows: * Neutral - Simple statements without any emotion. * Anger - A strong feeling of displeasure or hostility. * Elation - Be glad or happy because of praise. * Panic - A sudden, overpowering terror, often affecting many people at once. * Sadness - Affected or characterized by sorrow or unhappiness *Data* Over 100 speakers participated in the data collection. After screening, recordings from 68 speakers (23 females, 45 males) were used in this corpus. Most of the speakers were in their twenties at the time of collection. Information about the speakers is contained in "SpeakerInfo.doc." Subjects were given a text to read that consisted of five phrases, fifteen sentences and two paragraphs designed to generate the emotional speech. The material included all the phonemes in Mandarin. Each subject read the phrases, paragraphs, and sentences portraying the five emotional states: neutral (unemotional), anger, elation, panic and sadness. Altogether this database contains 25,636 utterances. The read material was constructed as follows: * 5 phrases - "yes", "no" and three nouns as "apple", "train", "tennis ball". In Chinese, these words contain many different basic vowels and consonants. * 20 sentences - These sentences include all the phonemes and most common consonant clusters in Mandarin. The types of sentences are: simple statements, a declarative sentence with an enumeration, general questions (yes/no question), alternative questions, imperative sentences, exclamatory sentences, special questions (whquestions). * 2 paragraphs - Two readings, one selected from a famous Chinese novel, and the other stating a normal fact. All the data were recorded in a quiet office on an OLYMPUS DM-20 digital voice recorder with a sampling rate of 22050Hz. Afterwards, the recorded voice files were transferred to a personal computer by USB (Universal Serial Bus). The recordings were then converted into monophonic Windows PCM format at 8 kHz sampling frequency and 16 bits resolution. Further information about the data and methodology in this corpus is contained in the authors' paper, "MASC: A Speech Corpus in Mandarin for Emotional Analysis and Affective Speaker Recognition," in "MASC.pdf."  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

The Spring evaluation (RT-03S), implemented in March-April 2003, focused on Speech-To-Text (STT) tasks for broadcast news speech and conversational telephone speech in three languages: English, Mandarin Chinese and Arabic. That evaluation also included one Metadata Extraction (MDE) task, speaker diarization for broadcast news speech and conversational telephone speech in English. The Fall evaluation (RT-03F), implemented in October 2003, focused on MDE tasks including speaker diarization, speaker-attributed STT, SU (sentence/semantic unit) detection and disfluency detection for broadcast news speech and conversational telephone speech in English. For complete information about the evaluations, see the RT-03 Spring Evaluation Website and the RT-03 Fall Evaluation Website. *Data* The BN datasets were selected from TDT-4 sources collected in February 2001. The evaluation excerpts were transcribed to the nearest story boundary. The English BN dataset is approximately three hours long and is composed of 30-minute excerpts from six different broadcasts. The Mandarin Chinese BN dataset is approximately one hour long, consisting of 12-minute excerpts from five different broadcasts. The Arabic BN dataset is also approximately one hour long and contains 30-minute excerpts from two different broadcasts. The CTS datasets consist of material from various LDC telephone speech data. All evaluation excerpts were transcribed to the nearest turn. The English CTS set is approximately 6 hours long and is composed of 5-minute excerpts from 72 different conversations: 36 from the Switchboard Cellular collection and 36 from the Fisher collection. The Mandarin Chinese CTS dataset is approximately one hour long and consists of 5-minute excerpts from 12 different conversations from the CallFriend Mandarin Chinese data. The Arabic CTS set is also approximately one hour long and contains 5-minute excerpts from 12 different conversations from the CallHome Egyptian Arabic data. No manual (human-annotated) segmentations were provided. Sites were required to generate their own segmentations automatically. Unlike the BN audio files where the full broadcasts were provided, the CTS audio files contain only the evaluation excerpts. Each audio excerpt is a SPHERE-headered, two channel interleaved 8-bit mulaw file.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Egyptian Arabic, Standard Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese.

The purpose of the NSP was to collect a large amount of speech produced by male and female talkers representing the primary regional varieties of American English: New England, Mid-Atlantic, North, Midland, South and West. This release contains approximately 60 hours of speech or nearly one hour of speech from each of 60 white American English speakers --including five male and five female talkers from the six dialect regions -- reading words and sentences. The corpus can be used for perceptual and acoustic experiments designed to explore the role of variation in spoken language processing. Such applications include speech science experiments and sociolinguistic or sociophonetic research. *Data* The speakers were recruited from the Indiana University community; they were all 18-25 years old at the time of recording, had lived exclusively in one region prior to age 18, and both parents of each speaker were also raised in the same region. Further demographic information about the speakers is provided in the file talkers.txt. The materials include 102 high predictability sentences and five repetitions of each of 10 hVd words. The high predictability sentences are 5-8 words in length and the final word in each sentence is highly predictable based on the preceding semantic context. The 10 hVd words are: heed, hid, hayed, head, had, hod, hud, hoes, hood and who'd. Participants were recorded one at a time by an experimenter in a sound attenuated booth (IAC Audiometric Testing Room, Model 402). Both the experimenter and the participant sat in the sound booth during testing. During the recording session, the participant was seated in front of a ViewSonic LCD flatscreen monitor (ViewPanel VG151) which mirrored the screen of a Macintosh Powerbook G3 laptop. The participant wore a Shure head-mounted microphone (SM10A) that was positioned approximately one inch from the left corner of the talker's mouth. The microphone output was fed to an Applied Research Technology microphone tube pre-amplifier. The output gain on the pre-amplifier was adjusted by the experimenter while the participant read the Grandfather Passage as a warm-up before recording began. The output of the microphone pre-amplifier was connected to a Roland UA-30 USB audio interface which digitized the signal and transmitted it via USB ports to the laptop where each utterance was recorded in an individual AIFF 16-bit digital sound file at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz (converted to .wav format files for this release) The experimenter held the laptop on her lap and wore headphones connected to the Roland device so that she could hear the same audio signal that inputted into the laptop for recording.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzUnited StatesvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aClopper, Cynthia G.10aPisoni, David B.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007S1505070nmm a22003973i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245007500177264007300252336003800325336002600363337002600389338003200415500001500447500004500462506005100507520360000558520005104158546005804209650002904267650004904296655002004345700002204365700001404387700002004401700001604421700001804437856014904455856006804604m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2005    pau        u        ara d  a15856334108 aLDC2005T208 aISLRN: 661-115-390-052-20 aarabeng07aarbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aArabic Treebank: Part 3 (full corpus) v 2.0 (MPG + Syntactic Analysis)  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2005]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2005T20  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T201 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis file contains documentation on the Arabic Treebank: Part 3 (full corpus) v 2.0 (MPG + Syntactic Analysis), Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2005T20 and ISBN 1-58563-341-0. The goal of the Arabic Treebank project is to support the development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing (NLP), human language technologies, automatic content extraction (topic extraction and/or grammar extraction), cross-lingual information retrieval, information detection, and other forms of linguistic research on Modern Standard Arabic in general. The LDC was sponsored to develop an Arabic POS and Treebank of 1,000,000 words, and this corpus is part three of that project. In this release, we provide both syntactic (treebank) annotation and annotation on part of speech (POS), gloss, and word segmentation. Treebanks are language resources that provide annotations of natural languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the phrase level, and the sentence level. Treebanks have become crucially important for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing (NLP), human language technologies, automatic content extraction (topic extraction and/or grammar extraction), cross-lingual information retrieval, information detection, and other forms of linguistic research in general. This corpus is designed for those who study and use languages either professionally or academically, and who need text corpora in their work. The Penn Arabic Treebank is particularly suitable for language developers, computational linguists and computer scientists who are interested in various aspects of natural language processing. The Penn Arabic Treebank, which was part of the DARPA TIDES project, started in the Fall of 2001 with the objective of annotating via human intervention and automatically a large Arabic machine-readable text corpus. As in previous Penn Treebanks, two different kinds of information need to be produced by two different (human and computer) processes. The Arabic Treebank project consists therefore of two distinct phases: (a) Part-of-Speech (=POS) tagging, which divides the text into lexical tokens and gives relevant information about each token such as lexical category, inflectional features, and a gloss (referred to as POS for convenience, although it includes morphological and gloss information not traditionally included with part-of-speech annotation), and (b) Arabic Treebanking (=ArabicTB), which characterizes the constituent structures of word sequences, provides categories for each non-terminal node, and identifies null elements, co-reference, traces, etc. Both tasks started in November 2001 with an initial pilot consisting of 734 files representing roughly 166K words of written Modern Standard Arabic newswire from the Agence France Presse corpus, which has since been released as "Arabic Treebank: Part 1 v 3.0," LDC Catalog No. LDC2005T02. The second part was released as the 168K-word corpus "Arabic Treebank: Part 2 v 2.0," LDC Catalog No. LDC2004T02. The current Arabic Treebank: Part 3 corpus consists of 600 stories from the An Nahar News Agency. This corpus is also referred to as ANNAHAR. The new features include complete vocalization of all Imperfect Verb mood endings: Indicative, Subjunctive, and Jussive. The POS only annotation of this ANNAHAR corpus was released in 2004 under the catalog number LDC2004T11 (Arabic Treebank: Part 3 v 1.0). In addition to the treebank annotation, this release (i.e., Arabic Treebank: Part 3 v 2.0) also includes the POS annotation in LDC2004T11.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

In 2004 HKUST was contracted to collect and transcribe 200 hours of Mandarin Chinese conversational telephone speech from Mandarin speakers in mainland China under the DARPA EARS framework. The first 50 hours of speech and transcripts were released in June 2004 to the EARS community for the RT-04 NIST evaluation. NIST partitioned the remaining 150 hours of collection into training, development and evaluation sets. This release contains the training and development sets with 873 and 24 calls, respectively. Subject recruitment was done in several cities across mainland China. Most subjects did not previously know each other. To encourage more meaningful conversation, topics similar to those in Fisher English were designed. All calls were operator-assisted, namely, an operator would call two participants as scheduled to initiate a call. Subjects were asked about demographic questions before they were bridged for normal conversation. Their answers to the demographic questions were recorded on separate files. Subjects were allowed to talk up to 10 minutes. With a few exceptions, most calls are of the maximum length. Although subjects were allowed to make up to three calls, all subject made just one call in this release with one exception, where PIN 10683 and PIN 10686 belong to a single individual. Each side of a call was recorded on a separate .wav file, sampled at 8-bits (a-law encoded), 8Khz. They were multiplexed later in sphere format with a-law encoding preserved. In the case where one side was shorter than the other, the shorter side was padded with silence. In the release, the file name of each recorded call is in the format of "date_time_Apin_Bpin.sph" and the corresponding transcript is in the same format with .txt extension. *Speaker demographics* Subjects were asked to provide several pieces of demographic information, including gender, age, native language/dialect, birthplace, education, occupation, phone type, etc. Given that Standard Mandarin is not the native dialect in many regions of China but is the official language of education and speakers may or may not have regional accents speaking Mandarin, it was decided that subjects' birthplaces were divided into Mandarin-dominant and non-Mandarin-dominant regions and all calls were audited and classified into standard and accented types without further distinctions. Selected demographics - age, gender, birthplace, phone type and accent for each side of the call and the topic ID for the call - are provided as a tab-delimited, plain-text, tabular file. *Transcription* All calls were fully transcribed from the beginning to the end. Standard simplified Chinese characters, encoded in GBK (CP-936), were used. Speech is segmented at natural boundaries wherever possible and each segment is no more than 10 seconds long. HKUST formulated transcription guidelines based on LDC's RT-03 transcription guidelines. For more information, refer to "trans-guidelines.pdf" included in the release. The transcripts provided by HKUST were XML-formatted with each side of a call in a separate file. LDC multiplexed the two sides into a single file with turns interleaved in temporal order (based on the initial time stamps), and converted the format into the LDC format. All transcripts were checked against RT-04 formatting standards. The following is a list of RT-04 conventions that are different from those in the transcription guidelines. * Speaker noise: curly brackets, e.g. {laugh}, instead of angel brackets; * Foreign language: TEXT instead of TEXT. The Chinese text is not segmented into words, though there are occasional white spaces within some turns.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

Apple Computer, Inc. supported the development of this data and also supplied the list of words and phrases collected. Callers responded to questions and repeated a list of phrases as they were prompted. *Data* Subjects calling the analog system (998 callers) were employees of Apple Computer, Inc. and were solicited through interoffice email within the company. Subjects calling the digital system (2010 callers) were responding to USEnet postings or newspaper advertisements placed in several cities across the United States. Each subject called the CSLU data collection system by dialing a toll-free number. The analog data were collected via a Worldport Pod on an Apple Quadra A/V. The digital data were collected with the CSLU T1 digital data collection system. Callers were prompted to answer certain questions including, What is your native language? In which city and state did you spend most of your childhood? What time is it now? What day is today? Callers were also instructed to repeat various comnand and control type phrases, including "play previous message again", "make a meeting for today", "quit", "who is at work", "what is the area code for this state", "hello, what are my messages", "help", "please send a car from the city", "delete my email tomorrow", "read this text", "erase all information", "record extended phonebook", "transfer all calls to home at twelve o'clock", "record urgent message" and "find the operator". Each recorded utterance was listened to by a human verifier to determine if the speaker adequately followed the directions. If an utterance contained extraneous words or excessive noise, it was not included in the corpus.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishxData processingvDatabases. 0aTelephone callsvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aNoel, Mike403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007S1302787nmm a22003373i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245003500141264007300176336003800249336003300287337002600320338003200346500001500378500004500393506005100438520151900489520005102008546004202059650004202101650001902143655002802162700001802190700002402208856014902232856006802381m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2005    pau        u        eng d  a15856335508 aLDC2005S168 aISLRN: 514-959-558-272-6  adc00aRT-04 MDE Training Data Speech  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2005]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2005S16  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005S161 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis file contains documentation on the MDE RT-04 Training Data Speech, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2005S16 and ISBN 1-58563-355-0.

His term articulation index meant something like perceptual index of syllables, where those syllables were not necessarily words, and reflected how well speakers could correctly identify syllables in the presence of noise. This corpus was created to facilitate similar experiments, as well as to potentially facilitate new methods in speech recognition research. The basic concept behind the corpus was to record speakers pronouncing syllables of English, some of which might be real words, but most of which are nonsense syllables. The goal was to have each speaker say a set of 2,000 syllables common to all speakers, as well as a set of 20 syllables unique to that speaker. LDC has also released Articulation Index LSCP (LDC2015S12) *Data* This release contains recordings of 20 American English speakers (12 males, 8 females) saying 2005 common syllables, 1845 of which are common to all speakers, and 400 unique syllables (20 syllables/ speaker). The recordings were made in small, sound-treated anechoic room at LDC. The speakers wore two microphones: a Sennheiser 410 headset and a Nortel Liberator wireless phone headset. The Sennheiser's signal traveled through a Symetrix 302 Dual Microphone Preamp, Sony PCM-R300 DAT deck and Townshend Datlink to a Sun Sparcserver 20 where it was written to disk at 16 KHz, 16-bit, pcm data. The Nortel's signal was transmitted to a wireless base station at a telephone connected via the network to LDC's telephone recording platform where it was caputred to disk as 8 KHz, 8-bit, u-law data. The speakers were prompted via a computer interface that displayed one prompt at a time, allowing them to iterate through the prompts by pressing a "next" button. Each recording session lasted approximately 15 minutes.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aSpeech perceptionvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aWright, Jonathan403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005S2202218nmm a22003973i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245005100177264007300228336003800301336002600339337002600365338003200391500001500423500004500438506005100483520077200534520005101306546005801357650002901415650004901444655002001493700002201513700001401535700002001549700001601569700001801585856014901603856006801752m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2005    pau        u        ara d  a15856334378 aLDC2005T308 aISLRN: 165-794-218-631-90 aarabeng07aarbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aArabic Treebank: Part 4 v 1.0 (MPG Annotation)  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2005]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2005T30  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T301 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis file contains documentation on the Arabic Treebank: Part 4 v 1.0 (MPG Annotation), Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2005T30 and ISBN 1-58563-343-7.

West Point Croatian Speech is a database of digital recordings of spoken Croatian . It was collected by staff and faculty of the Department of Foreign Languages (DFL) and Center for Technology Enhanced Language Learning (CTELL) to develop acoustic models for speech recognition systems. The US government uses These systems to provide speech recognition enhanced language learning courseware to government linguists and students enrolled in various government language programs. In addition, parts of this corpus were designed to model question-answer dialogues for use in domain-specific speech to speech translation systems. The corpus consists of two subcorpora collected in 2000 and 2001 in Zagreb Croatia. Informants were recruited from the English department at the University of Zagreb and the Croatian Military Academy. The 2000 subcorpus consists entirely of read speach, while the 2001 corpus includes free response answers to questions in addition to read speech. The read speech in the two subcorpora were elicited from two different prompt scripts. Each informant in 2000 attempted to read 100 sentences from a total of 200 carefully designed sentences. These sentences were written by Christine Tomei. Dr. Tomei's design analysis can be found in the file design-2000.txt. Informants in 2001 read short text passages extracted from Croatian language webpages. Thus the scripts used to record read speech contain a total of 6,329 distinct sentences. The read speech prompts are listed in the files read-200[01].txt in the transcripts directory. Each line of these files has two fields separated by a tab, the first denoting the base name of the waveform file, and the second the prompt used in recording the utterence. The read speech data are stored under the Recordings Croatian directory. The script used to elicit free response answers contains 143 questions. The text that was actually presented to the informants is in the file named questions.txt in the transcripts directory. Data recorded from these prompts are stored in the Answers Croatian directory. The human-performed transcriptions of the informant's answers are listed in the answers.txt file in the transcripts directory. Again, each line of this file has two fields separated by a tab, the first field contains two numbers separated by a slash. The first number is an identification index for the speaker. The second number is an index to the question. The second field on the line contains a word level transcription of the informants's answer to the question indexed by the second number in the first field. So, for example, in the line: 1/15 eh roena je u splitu eh roena je u splitu is a transcription of the response speaker one gave to question 15. The corresponding waveform file is stored in the file 15.wav in the directory Answers Croatian1. These recordings were transcribed by Milan Sokolich. Mr. Sokoloch also wrote a pronouncing dictionary that includes grammatical tags. His work is stored in the file named raw-lexicon.txt. The file lexicon.txt contains a processed version of the raw-lexicon.txt file. Each speaker in the 2001 subcorpus attempted to record 105 utterances by reading 75 sentences and giving 35 free response answers to 35 questions. Speech data was collected using Pentium 450 mHz laptop computers running Windows 2000 with a 16-bit data size and sampling rate of 22,050 Hz. The recording script presented a visual display of the sentence to be recorded. The informant pressed a key and spoke the sentence. The recording was played back for review allowing the utterance to be re-recorded. A member of the data collection team was on hand during the recording session to verify recordings and provide technical assistance in case of malfunctioning equipment.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Croatian.

Specifically, predicate-argument relations have been added to the syntactic trees of the first update to Chinese Treebank 5.0 as an additional layer of annotation. *Data* Chinese Proposition Bank 1.0 includes annotations for files chtb_001.fid to chtb_931.fid, or the first 250K words of the first update of Chinese Treebank 5.0. There is a total of 37,183 propositions. Auxiliary verbs are not annotated. Some verbs have light verb and non-light verbs uses and in these cases only the non-light verbs are annotated. All the annotations in this release are the result of double blind annotation followed by adjudication of differences. The following table summarizes the framesets in CPB 1.0: Total verbs framed 4,865 Total framesets 5,298 Verbs with multiple framesets 351 Average framesets per verb 1.09 *Annotation Format* Each P-A structure is represented in a line of space separated columns. The columns are as follows ctb-filename sentence terminal tagger frameset inflection arglabel arglabel ... The content of each column is described in detail below. ctb-filename the name of the file in the Penn Chinese TreeBank 5.0 update 1 sentence the number of the sentence in the file (starting with 0) terminal the number of the terminal in the sentence that is the location of the verb. Note that the terminal number counts empty constituents as terminals and starts with 0. This will hold for all references to terminal number in this description. An example: (IP (NP-SBJ (DNP (NP (NN 货币)(NN 回笼))(DEG 的))(NP (NN 增加)))(PU ，) (VP (PP-BNF (P 为)(IP (NP-SBJ (-NONE- *PRO*))(VP (VV 平抑)(NP-OBJ (NP (DP (DT 全)) (NP (NN 区)))(NP (NN 物价))))))(VP (VV 发挥)(AS 了)(NP-OBJ (NN 作用)))) (PU 。)) The terminal numbers: 货币 0 回笼 1 的 2 增加 3 ，4 为 5 *PRO* 6 平抑 7 全 8 区 9 物价 10 发挥 11 了 12 作用 13 。14 tagger the name of the annotator, or "gold" if it's been double annotated and adjudicated. frameset The frameset identifier from the frames file of the verb. For example, '发挥.01' refers to the frameset ID "f1" in the frame file for the verb '发挥' (frames/0930-fa-hui.xml). The names of the frame files are composed of numerical id, plus the pinyin of the verb. The numerical ids can be found in the enclosed verb list (verbs.txt). inflection The inflection field is a carry-over from the Penn English Proposition Bank, and is set to '-----', meaning no annotation in the Chinese Proposition Bank. arglabel A string representing the annotation associated with a particular argument or adjunct of the proposition. Each arglabel is dash '-' delimited and has the following columns 1) column for the address of a constituent The address of the constituent are in one of the two forms. form 1: : A single node in the syntactic tree of the sentence in question, identified by the first terminal the node spans together with the height from that terminal to the syntax node (a height of 0 represents a terminal). For example, in the sentence (IP (NP-TPC (DP (DT 这些))(CP (WHNP-1 (-NONE- *OP*)) (CP (IP (NP-SBJ (-NONE- *T*-1)) (VP (ADVP (AD 已))(VP (VV 开业))))(DEC 的)))(NP (NN 外商)(NN 投资)(NN 企业))) (NP-ADV (NN 绝大部分))(NP-SBJ (NN 生产)(NN 经营)(NN 状况))(VP (ADVP (AD 较)) (VP (VA 好)))(PU 。)) the address of "1:3" represents the top IP node and "2:2" represents the CP node form 2: terminal number:height*terminal number:height*... A trace chain identifying coreference within sentence boundaries. For example in the sentence (IP (NP-TPC (DP (DT 这些))(CP (WHNP-1 (-NONE- *OP*)) (CP (IP (NP-SBJ (-NONE- *T*-1)) (VP (ADVP (AD 已))(VP (VV 开业))))(DEC 的)))(NP (NN 外商)(NN 投资)(NN 企业))) (NP-ADV (NN 绝大部分))(NP-SBJ (NN 生产)(NN 经营)(NN 状况))(VP (ADVP (AD 较)) (VP (VA 好)))(PU 。)) the address of of "2:0*1:0*6:1" represents the fact nodes '2:0' (-NONE- *T*-1), '1:0' (-NONE- *OP*) and '6:1' (NP (NN 外商)(NN 投资)(NN 企业)) are coreferential. form 3: terminal number:height,terminal number:height,... This represents a collection of different pieces of one argument. This form is rarely used in the annotation of the verbs, since most discontinuous constituents have well-defined relations between their components. Therefore the components of a discontinuous constituent are assigned the same label with a secondary tag representing their semantic relations. For example, if a constituent is marked as ARG0-CRD, it means that there is another constituent having the same label and together they fill the ARG0 role of the verb. 2) column for the 'label' The argument label one of {rel, ARGM} + { ARG0, ARG1, ARG2, ... }. The argument labels correspond to the argument labels in the frames files (see ./frames). ARGM for adjuncts of various sorts, and 'rel' refers to the surface string of the verb. 3) column for 'functional tag' (optional for numbered arguments; required for ARGM) Functional tags for "split" numbered arguments: PSR - possessor PSE - possessee CRD - coordinator PRD - predicate QTY - quantity Propositional tags for numbered arguments: AT, AS, INTO, TOWARDS, TO, ONTO Functional tags for ARGM: ADV - adverbial, default tag BNF - beneficiary CND - conditional DIR - directional DIS - discourse DGR - degree EXT - extent FRQ - frequency LOC - location MNR - manner NEG - negation PRP - purpose and reason TMP - temporal TPC - topic  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

The goal of the project was to amass recordings from no less than 100 adult speakers (50 males and 50 females) to form a substantial corpus of high-quality read speech. The project was conducted by the Center for Technology Enhanced Language Learning, part of the U.S. Military Academy's Department of Foreign Languages. Many of the 100-plus volunteers who provided the recordings were members of the staff and faculty of the Department of Foreign Languages. Other volunteers were friends and colleagues from other organizations who worked in offices in Washington Hall. The largest group of volunteers was from Cadet Company G, Third Regiment, United States Corps of Cadets. Cadet Company G3, encouraged by their tactical officer, Major Scott Custer, adopted the speech data collection effort as a community service project. Every female cadet in Company G3 recorded her voice, as did many of the male cadets, including the cadet company commander and Major Custer. The 185 sentences comprising the data collection script were written to elicit examples of all or most all of the possible syllables used in spoken American English. The G3 Corpus audio data comes from 53 female and 56 male volunteers, each of whom recorded approximately 104 utterances. The recordings are sampled at a 16-bit resolution, 22,050 samples per second. Recordings were made using headset microphones (Shure M10) with preamplifiers attached to the line input jack of desktop computers. The total amount of speech is about 15 hours.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aMorgan, John10aLaRocca, Stephen A.10aBellinger, Sherri10aRuscelli, Charles (Chip)403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005S3003751nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245004800177264007300225336003800298336002600336337002600362338003200388500001500420500004500435506005100480520252800531520005103059546005903110655002003169700001903189856014903208856006803357m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2005    pau        u        chi d  a15856336828 aLDC2005T348 aISLRN: 410-883-638-016-60 achibeng07acmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aChinese <-> English Name Entity Lists v 1.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2005]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2005T34  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T341 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis file contains documentation for Chinese English Name Entity Lists, v.1.0, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2005T34 and ISBN 1-58563-368-2. These Chinese-English bi-directional name entity lists are compiled from Xinhua News Agency newswire texts. Not every irregularity in the original source has been detected and normalized. Some Chinese characters are not encoded in the source and brackets are used to describe their composition. Except for the person name lists, most instances were left untouched in the created lists. An effort was made to replace GB-encoded characters (such as Roman numbers) in the English translation with ASCII characters. However no attempt has been made to do the opposite for Chinese names. The use of slashes as delimiters presents another problem. Some names may have internal slashes. Initially, double quotes ("") were used to enclose the name with an internal slash to avoid confusion without realizing that these is just one " in ASCII (as opposed to a set of enclosing " in GB). Later it was decided to use &slash;. In future releases, some lists will be changed for greater consistency. Finally, most of the English names in the source use lower cases throughout. An effort was made to capitalize the initial letter (and possibly some middle ones) for person names, but not for any other kind of names as most other names have multiple words, some of which may contain articles and prepositions. The word "English" is somewhat misleading here. Although most of the foreign words are English or can appear in English texts, there are also many non-English words written in Roman alphabet - some of which may have English equivalents while others do not. No efforts have been made to eliminate those non-English names where English equivlants are available. The entire set consists of nine pairs of lists. The English->Chinese version of each pair was created by reversing the Chinese->English, both sorted by the Unix built-in sort function. The contents are as follows * Place Names, Chinese to English: 276,382 * Place Names, English to Chinese: 298,993 * Organization Names, Chinese to English: 30,800 * Organization Names, English to Chinese: 37,145 * Corporate Names, Chinese to English: 54,747 * Corporate Names, English to Chinese 58,468 * Press Organization Names, Chinese to English: 29,757 * Press Organization Names, English to Chinese: 32,922 * Intl.

This is a comprehensive archive of newswire text data that has been acquired from Arabic news sources by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), at the University of Pennsylvania. Arabic Gigaword Second Edition includes all of the content of the first edition of Arabic Gigaword (LDC2003T12) as well as new data. Five distinct sources of Arabic newswire are represented here: Agence France Presse (afp_arb; formally afa) Al Hayat News Agency (hyt_arb; formally alh) An Nahar News Agency (nhr_arb; formally ann) Ummah Press (umh_arb) Xinhua News Agency (xin_arb; formally xia) The seven-letter codes in the parentheses above consist of the three-character source name IDs and the three-character language code ("arb") separated by an underscore ("_") character. The three-letter language code represents the standard Arabic in the ISO 639-3 standard. In the first edition of the Arabic Gigaword corpus, a simpler three-character-code scheme was used to identify both the source and the language. The new convention allows us to distinguish data sets by source and language more naturally when a single newswire provider distributes data in multiple languages. Ummah Press is a new source added to the Second Edition. The following table shows the new data that appear for the first time in the Second Edition. Agence France Presse 2003.01-2004.12 143,766 documents Al Hayat News Agency 2002.01-2003.12 64,308 documents An Nahar News Agency 2003.01-2004.01 16,316 documents Ummah Press 2003.01-2004.12 4,641 documents Xinhua News Agency 2003.06-2004.12 10,6236 documents *Data* There are 423 files, totaling approximately 1.4GB in compressed form (5,359 MB uncompressed, and 1,591,983 K-words). The table below presents the following categories of information: source of the data, number of files per source, Gzip-MB shows totals for compressed file sizes, Totl-MB shows totals for uncompressed file sizes (i.e. approximately 5.3 gigabytes total), K-words are the number of space-separated tokens in the text, excluding SGML tags.

Owing to the use of UTF-8, the SGML tagging within each file shows up as lines of single-byte-per-character (ASCII) text, whereas lines of actual text data, including article headlines and datelines, contain a mixture of single-byte and multi-byte characters. In general, single-byte characters in the text data will consist of digits and punctuation marks (where the original source relied on ASCII punctuation codes, rather than Arabic-specific punctuation), whereas multi-byte characters consist of Arabic letters and a small number of special punctuation or other symbols. This variable-width character encoding is intrinsic to UTF-8, and all UTF-8 capable processes will handle the data appropriately. Each data file name consists of the seven-letter prefix, an underscore character ("_"), and a six-digit date (representing the year and month during which the file contents were generated by the respective news source), followed by a ".gz" file extension, indicating that the file contents have been compressed using the GNU "gzip" compression utility (RFC 1952). Therefore, each file contains all the usable data received by LDC for the given month from the given news source. All text data are presented in SGML form, using a very simple, minimal markup structure. The file gigaword_a.dtd in the "dtd" directory provides the formal "Document Type Declaration" for parsing the SGML content. The corpus has been fully validated by a standard SGML parser utility (nsgmls), using this DTD file. Unlike older corpora, the present corpus uses only the information structure that is common to all sources and serves a clear function: headline, dateline, and core news content (usually containing paragraphs). All sources have received a uniform treatment in terms of quality control, and have been categorized into three distinct "types": story this type of DOC represents a coherent report on a particular topic or event, consisting of paragraphs and full sentences multi this type of DOC contains a series of unrelated "blurbs," each of which briefly describes a particular topic or event: "summaries of today's news," "news briefs in ... (some general area like finance or sports)" and so on other these DOCs clearly do not fall into any of the above types; these are things like lists of sports scores, stock prices, temperatures around the world, and so on The general strategy for categorizing DOCs into these three classes was, for each source, to discover the most common and frequent clues in the text stream that correlated with the "non-story" types. When none of the known clues was in evidence, the DOC was classified as a "story." Other "Gigaword" corpora (in English and Chinese) had a fourth category, "advis" (for "advisory"), which applied to DOCs that contain text intended solely for news service editors, not the news-reading public. In preparing the Arabic data, the task of determining patterns for assigning "non-story" type labels was carried out by a native speaker of Arabic, and (for whatever reason) this person did not find the "advis" category to be applicable to any of the data. As described in the introduction section, a new naming scheme for file names and document IDs is used in the Second Edition. All of the documents in the first edition of the Arabic Gigaword corpus can be mapped to the same documents in this edition by changing the prefix of DOC IDs and file names as below. The upper case letters are used for the DOC IDs; the lower case letters are used for the file and directory names.

The Spanish Gigaword Corpus is a comprehensive archive of newswire text data that has been acquired over several years by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) at the University of Pennsylvania. This is the first edition of the Spanish Gigaword Corpus, though some of the data included here has been released previously in other LDC corpora. The three distinct international sources of Spanish newswire in this edition, and the time spans of collection covered for each, are as follows: * Agence France-Presse, Spanish Service (afp_spa) May 1994 - Dec 2005 * Associated Press Worldstream, Spanish (apw_spa) Nov 1993 - Dec 2005 * Xinhua News Agency, Spanish Service (xin_spa) Sep 2001 - Dec 2005 The seven-letter codes in the parentheses above include the three-character source name abbreviations and the three-character language code ("spa") separated by an underscore ("_") character. The three-letter language code conforms to LDC's new internal convention based on the new ISO 639-3 standard. The seven-letter codes are used in both the directory names where the data files are found, and in the prefix that appears at the beginning of every data file name. It is also used (in all UPPER CASE) as the initial portion of the DOC "id" strings that uniquely identify each news story. *Data* The overall totals for each source are summarized below. Note that the "Totl-MB" numbers show the amount of data you get when the files are uncompressed (i.e. approximately 5 gigabytes, total); the "Gzip-MB" column shows totals for compressed file sizes as stored on the DVD-ROM; the "K-wrds" numbers are simply the number of whitespace-separated tokens (of all types) after all SGML tags are eliminated.

The American National Corpus (ANC) project fosters the development of a corpus comparable to the British National Corpus (BNC), covering American English. Corpus-analytic work has demonstrated that the BNC is inappropriate for the study of American English, due to the numerous differences in use of the language. The availability of a corpus of American English will significantly contribute to language and linguistic research, the development of language understanding computer applications (e.g., language translation and search and retrieval software), and the compilation of reference works such as dictionaries and thesauri. It will also provide a rich national resource for use in education at all levels. ANC Second Release contains over 20 million words: 10+ million words added in the Second Release, and a new corrected and validated version of the 11 million word ANC First Release. The Second Release also contains software for searching and retrieving multiple stand-off annotations. ANC Second Release contains texts from the following sources (* denotes new source in the Second Release): * Transcribed telephone speech (LDC and Project MORE) * The New York Times * Berlitz Travel Guides (Langensheidt Publishers) * Slate Magazine (Microsoft) * ICIC Corpus of Fundraising Texts (Indiana Center for Intercultural Communication)* * The Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE) (University of Michigan, English Language Institute)* * Various non-fiction * Various fiction (Orin Hargraves, Ferd Eggan)* * Various medical research articles (BioMed Central, Public Library of Science)* * Anonymized posts to the Phoenix Board/Buffistas.org* ANC Second Release contains data governed under two types of licenses, an open license and a restricted license. Both the Open License Agreement and the Restricted License Agreement need to be signed in order to receive ANC Second Release, and the data must be used in acordance with the agreement by which it is governed. The ANC will ultimately contain a core corpus of at least 100 million words, including both written and spoken (transcripts) data comparable across genres to the BNC. The genres in the ANC will be expanded to include new types of language data that have become available in recent years, such as web blogs and web pages, chats, email, and rap music lyrics. In addition to the core 100 million words, the ANC will include an additional component of potentially several hundreds of millions of words, chosen to provide both the broadest and largest selection of data possible. The American National Corpus is being developed with the help of consortium of publishers of American English dictionaries and companies with interests in language processing was formed in 1999. Consortium members are providing materials for inclusion in the corpus, and provided initial financial support for the project.

Each verb and adjective occurring in the Treebank has been treated as a semantic predicate and the surrounding text has been annotated for arguments and adjuncts of the predicate. The verbs and adjectives have also been tagged with coarse grained senses. This work was done in the Computer and Information Sciences Department at the University of Pennsylvania. The XML format and KSC 5,601 character set encoding are used in the frames file. *Data* There are two basic components to Korean Propbank: * The Verb Lexicon. A frames file, consisting of one or more frame sets, has been created for each predicate occurring in the Treebank. These files serve as a reference for the annotators and for users of the data. 2,749 such files have been created, totaling about ~10 MB of uncompressed data. * The Annotation. There are two annotation files. The virginia-verbs.pb file has 9,588 annotated predicate tokens. These predicate tokens include all those occurring in over 54,000 words of the Korean English Treebank Annotations, totaling ~791 KB of uncompressed data. The newswire-verbs.pb file has 23,707 annotated predicate tokens. These predicate tokens include all those occurring in over 131,000 words of the Korean Treebank Version 2.0, totaling ~2,054 KB of uncompressed data.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Korean.

To support the development of automatic means for evaluating translation quality, LDC was sponsored to solicit four sets of human translations for a single set of Chinese source materials. LDC was also asked to produce translations from various commercial-off-the-shelf-systems (COTS, including commercial Machine Translation (MT) systems as well as MT systems available on the Internet). There are a total of five sets of COTS outputs and six output sets from TIDES 2003 MT Evaluation participants. To determine if automatic evaluation systems, such as BLEU, track human assessment, LDC also performed human assessments on one COTS output and the six TIDES research systems. The corpus includes the assessment results for one of the five COTS systems, the assessment results for the six TIDES research systems, and the specifications used for conducting the assessments. *Data* Source Data Selection Two sources of journalistic Chinese text were selected to provide the Chinese material: - Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua): 50 news stories - Agence France Presse (AFP): 50 news stories (total: 100 stories) There are 100 source files and 1,100 translation files. All source data were drawn from LDC's January and February 2003 collection of Xinhua Chinese data and AFP Chinese data. The story selection from the two newswire collections was controlled by story length: all selected stories contain between 280 and 605 Chinese characters. The overall count of Chinese words (excluding markup), by source, is shown in the following table: AFP 22,450 Xinhua 19,650 ------------- 42,100 For the Chinese data, there are approximately 21K-words, while for the English translations, there are 396K-words in total and 16K unique words. Source Data Preparation for Human Translation The original source files used GB-2312 encoding for the Chinese characters, and SGML tags for marking sentence and paragraph boundaries and other information about each story. The character encoding is unaltered. To facilitate translation, nearly all sgml tags were removed or replaced by "plain text" markers. Specifically, each story was presented to the human translators in the following format: --Segment 1-- {Chinese text to be translated} --Segment 2-- {Chinese text to be translated} --Segment 3-- {Chinese text to be translated} ... Each --Segment-- corresponds to a Chinese sentence. The rationale for using the term "segment" instead of "sentence" was to discourage the translators from inserting additional "-Sentence-" markers if a Chinese sentence was translated into two or more English sentences. The markers were intended to assure that the resulting translations would be easily alignable to the source texts, so extra care was taken to ensure that they would be kept intact and properly oriented. Some normalization was performed on all files to conform to the above format, including splitting long segments into smaller chunks and adding segment markers. As a last step, all files were converted from UNIX-style line termination (new-line only) to MS-DOS-style (carriage-return plus line-feed) on the assumption that most (possibly all) translators would use MS-Windows-based editors. Human Translation Procedure and Quality Assessment Each initially selected translation team received the translation guidelines and a sample pair of source and translation (excluded from the final release) for review. After the team indicated that they understood the task requirements and would be willing to participate in the project, 100 news stories were sent to them. Each translation team returned the first five AFP stories for quality checking to ensure that the team was following the guidelines and that the translation quality was acceptable. LDC returned translations to the translation team for any deviations from the guidelines or for quality issues detected. Subsequent translation submissions were continuously monitored for conformance and quality. Once the full set of translations was complete, a final pass of reformatting and validation was carried out to assure alignability of segments and to convert the translated texts into SGML format. Each translation team was also asked to complete and return a questionnaire to describe their procedures and professional background. Machine Translation Procedure Complete sets of automatic MT translations were also produced by submitting the 100 stories to each of the five publicly-available MT systems. Starting from the original SGML text format, special alterations were made to the files on an as-needed basis, so that they would be accepted and handled correctly by the various systems. Also, the systems differed in terms of the input and retrieval methods required to submit the source data for translation and to save the translated text in alignable form. Human Assessment Procedure The goal of this effort was to evaluate the quality of TIDES research, human translation teams and commercial off-the shelf (COTS) systems. Translations were evaluated on the basis of adequacy and fluency. Adequacy refers to the degree to which the translation communicates information present in the original source language text. Fluency refers to the degree to which the translation is well-formed according to the grammar of the target language. Final Data Format and Validation For the present release, the corpus content is organized into source and translation directories. Within translation there is a separate subdirectory for each translation service or system, identified as follows: Human translators: E01 E02 E03 E04 COTS systems: E05 E06 E07 E08 E09 Research systems: E11 E12 E14 E15 E17 E22 The source directory and each of the human and COTS translation subdirectories contain 100 files with one news story per file. Corresponding file names are identical across all directories, consisting of "docid.sgm." Within each source file, the content is formatted in SGML as follows: [Chinese text in GB-2312 character encoding] [Chinese text in GB-2312 character encoding] ... Ranking of Manual Translations Ranking of manual translations was performed by two LDC staff members, one a Chinese-dominant bilingual and the other an English native monolingual. There was overall agreement on the ranking between the two and minor discrepancies were resolved through discussion and comparison of additional files. The ranking for the manual translations is: best-----------------------------worst E01 > E02 > E03 > E04 > The ranking method was unstructured and somewhat casual -- it is not intended to be definitive, or even accountable.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English and Mandarin Chinese.

The recording procedure involved a "mimicking" approach which resulted in a high degree of natural time-alignment between different speakers. The acoustic wave and the concurrent laryngograph signal were recorded for one "free" and two "mimicked" renditions of each sentence. Pitch marks, calculated from the laryngograph signal, and time marks, the output of a forced-alignment algorithm, have been added to the corpus.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases. 0aSpeech synthesisvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aKain, Alexander403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006S0104336nmm a22004213i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041002300134041003300157042000700190245004200197264007300239336003800312336002600350337002600376338003200402500001500434500004500449506005100494520266100545520005103206546008903257650005503346650005003401650004903451650005003500650004203550655002003592700002403612700002403636700001803660700001903678856014903697856006803846m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2006    pau        u        chi d  a15856337638 aLDC2006T068 aISLRN: 458-031-085-383-40 achiaaraaengbeng07acmnaarbaengbeng2iso639-3  adc00aACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2006]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2006T06  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T061 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis publication contains the complete set of English, Arabic and Chinese training data for the 2005 Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) technology evaluation. The corpus consists of data of various types annotated for entities, relations and events was created by Linguistic Data Consortium with support from the ACE Program, with additional assistance from LDC. This data was previously distributed as an e-corpus (LDC2005E18) to participants in the 2005 ACE evaluation. The objective of the ACE program is to develop automatic content extraction technology to support automatic processing of human language in text form. In November 2005, sites were evaluated on system performance in five primary areas: the recognition of entities, values, temporal expressions, relations, and events. Entity, relation and event mention detection were also offered as diagnostic tasks. All tasks with the exception of event tasks were performed for three languages, English, Chinese and Arabic. Events tasks were evaluated in English and Chinese only. The current publication comprises the official training data for these evaluation tasks. A complete description of the ACE 2005 Evaluation can be found on the ACE Program website maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

The annotation follows the TimeML 1.2.1 specificationavailable at www.timeml.org. *Data* TimeML aims to capture and represent temporal information. This is accomplished using four primary tag types: TIMEX3 for temporal expressions, EVENT for temporal events, SIGNAL for temporal signals, and LINK for representing relationships. For a detailed description of TimeML, see the TimeML 1.2.1 Specification and Guidelines. Here, we give a summary of each tag. TIMEX3. This tag is used to capture dates, times, durations, and sets of dates and times. All TIMEX3 tags include a type and a value along with some other possible attributes. The value is given according to the ISO 8601 standard. The TIMEX3 tag allows specification of a tempral anchor. This facilitates the use of temporal functions to calculate the value of an underspecified temporal expression. For example, an article might include a document creation time such as "January 3, 2006." Later in the article, the temporal expression "today" may occur. By anchoring the TIMEX3 for "today" to the document creation time, we can determine the exact value of the TIMEX3. EVENT. The EVENT tag is used to annotate those elements in a text that mark the semantic events described by it. Any event that can be temporally anchored or ordered is captured with this tag. An EVENT includes a class attribute with values such as occurrence, state, or reporting. The class of an EVENT may indicate what relationships the event participates in. In addition to the EVENT tag, events are also annotated with one or more MAKEINSTANCE tags that include information about a particular instance of the event. This includes part of speech, tense, aspect, modality, and polarity. When an event participates in a relationship, it is actually the event instance that is referenced. This is to allow for statements such as "John taught on Monday but not on Tuesday." Here, there are actually two instances of the teaching-event: one that has a positive polarity and one that is negative. Further, each instance participates in its own temporal relationship with respect to "Monday" and "Tuesday." SIGNAL. The SIGNAL tag is used to annotate temporal function words such as "after," "during," and "when." These signals are then used in the representation of a temporal relationship. The following three tags are link tags. They capture temporal, subordination, and aspectual relationships found in the text. These tags do not consume any actual text, but they do relate the three tag types above to each other. TLINK. Temporal links are represented with a TLINK tag. A TLINK can temporally relate two temporal expressions, two event instances, or a temporal expression and an event instance. Along with an identification marker for each of these two elements, a relation type is given such as before, includes, or ended by. When a signal is present that helps to define the relationship, an ID for the SIGNAL is given as well. SLINK. This tag is used to capture subordination relationships that involve event modality, evidentiality, and factuality. An SLINK includes an event instance ID for the subordinating event and an event instance ID for the subordinated event. Possible relation types for SLINK include modal, evidential, and factive. An SLINK will typically not include a signal ID unless it has the relation type conditional. Three specific EVENT classes interact with SLINK: reporting, i_state, and i_action. ALINK. An aspectual connection between two event instances is represented with ALINK. As with SLINK, this tag includes two event instance IDs, one that introduces the ALINK and one that is the event argument to that event. The introducing event has the class aspectual. Some possible relation types for ALINK are initiates, terminates, and continues. TimeBank 1.2 contains 183 articles with just over 61,000 non-punctuation tokens. The count for each TimeML tag is listed below: EVENT 7935 MAKEINSTANCE 7,940 TIMEX3 1,414 SIGNAL 688 ALINK 265 SLINK 2,932 TLINK 6,418 Total 27,592  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aSpace and time in languagevDatabases. 0aNatural language processing (Computer science) 0aMachine learning.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aPustejovsky, J.

The Speech Controlled Computing corpus was designed to support the development of small footprint, embedded ASR applications in the domain of voice control for the home. It consists of the recordings of 125 speakers of American English from four dialect regions, three age groups and two gender groups, pronouncing isolated words. The four primary dialect regions covered by the corpus are North, South, West and Midland as defined by Williams Labov's Atlas of North American English. The three primary age groups covered by the corpus are 18-29, 30-49 and 50+. The recordings were conducted in a sound-attenuated room at LDC with the AKG C4000B studio condenser microphone. The omni-directional mode of the C4000B was used. Each speaker read a randomized word list consisting of 2,100 words (100 distinct words appearing 21 times each). Speech utterances were digitized and recorded to a DAT, as well as to a hard disk drive via the Townshend DATLINK+ digital audio interface. Speech utterances were audited as they were recorded, and any utterances detected by the recorder that were not spoken clearly or correctly were re-recorded. This included extraneous clicks, coughs, sighs and breathing that may have corrupted the recorded words. Utterances that were spoken too soft or too loud were also re-recorded. The digitized utterances were automatically segmented and aligned to the word list. Then each utterance was audited and the segmentation was checked, and corrected if necessary, by an annotator using an auditing and segmenting tool developed by LDC. Finally, sound files containing individual utterances were generated using the alignment and segmentation information. The sound files for this corpus were created with 100 msec of silent time before and after each utterance. Any files that contained noticeable clipping were automatically removed.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionxData processing. 0aEnglish languagexDialectszUnited StatesvDatabases. 0aLinguisticsvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aCieri, Christopher10aMiller, Dave, 1960-10aMartey, Nii O.10aMaeda, Kazuaki403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006S3002248nmm a22003973i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090041001300119041002300132042000700155245004400162264007300206336003800279336002600317337002600343338003200369500001500401500004500416506005100461520080700512520005101319546004901370650003601419650004901455655002001504700001601524700001701540700001901557700002001576700001801596700001901614856014901633856006801782m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2006    pau        u        kor d8 aLDC2006T098 aISLRN: 365-025-522-700-10 akorbeng07akorbeng2iso639-3  adc00aKorean Treebank Annotations Version 2.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2006]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2006T09  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T091 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe Korean Treebank Annotations Version 2.0 is an extension of the Korean English Treebank Annotations corpus, LDC2002T26 (2002). It is essentially an electronic corpus of Korean texts annotated with morphological and syntactic information. The original texts for the Korean Treebank 2.0 were selected from The Korean Newswire corpus published by LDC, catalog number LDC2000T45, which is a collection of Korean Press Agency news articles from June 2, 1994 to March 20, 2000. Korean Treebank 2.0 is based on the March 2000 portion of the corpus and includes 647 articles. The annotated corpus can find many uses, including training of morphological analyzers, part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers. The text is encoded as KSC-5601(EUC-KR). Version 1.1 of the treebank is included in this release.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Korean.

The Speaker Recognition corpus (formerly known as Speaker Verification), consists of telephone speech from 91 participants. Each participant has recorded speech in twelve sessions over a two-year period answering questions like "what is your eye color" or responding to prompts like "describe a typical day in your life." Most of the utterances in the release of the corpus have corresponding non-time-aligned word level transcriptions. In most of the CSLU data collections, each participant calls a toll free telephone number and answers a few question. CSLU records the speech, transcribes it, then packages it as a released corpus. The Speaker Recognition data collection was quite a bit more complicated. The goal of the data collection was to collect speech from each participant over a two-year period. Each participant called call the data collection system 12 times over the two-year period and say the same utterances each time. Some of the recording sessions were only a few days apart and others several weeks apart. Participant followed the following calling schedule. During the first month, they called twice in a week. No calls were made in the second and third months. In the fourth month they made one call. No calls were made in the fifth and sixth months. This pattern repeated three more times for a total of 12 calls per participant. In order to balance the workload required to remind participants to call and to avoid large data collection bursts on the system, the participants were divided into 12 groups. Each group began the two-year schedule on subsequent months. The first group started in September 1996. The second group started in October 1996. And so on.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases. 0aConversationvDatabases. 0aTelephone callsvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognition.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aCSLU403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006S2607399nmm a22003853i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041002800152042000700180245004400187264007300231336003800304336002600342336003300368337002600401338003200427500001500459500004500474506005100519520593700570520005106507546006006558650004006618650004306658655002006701655002806721700002506749700002206774856014906796856006806945m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2008    pau        u        tam d  a15856346468 aLDC2008L018 aISLRN: 054-578-209-297-70 atamaengbeng07atamaengbeng2iso639-3  adc00aAn English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2008]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2008L01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008L011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aAn English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb represents over twenty-five years of work led by Harold F. Schiffman, Professor, emeritus, of Dravidian Lingusitics and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania's Department of South Asia Studies. It contains translations for 6597 English verbs and defines 9716 Tamil verbs. This release presents the dictionary in two formats: Adobe PDF and XML. The PDF format displays the dictionary in a human readable form and is suitable for printing. The XML version is a purely electronic form which, while readable by humans, is intended mainly for application development and the creation of searchable electronic databases. In the electronic XML version each entry contains the following: the English entry or head word; the Tamil equivalent (in Tamil script and transliteration); the verb class and transitivity specification; the spoken Tamil pronunciation (audio files in mp3 format); the English definition(s); additional Tamil entries (if applicable); example sentences or phrases in Literary Tamil, Spoken Tamil (with a corresponding audio file in .mp3 format) and an English translation; and Tamil synonyms or near-synonyms, where appropriate. Some foods referenced in the example sentences are illustrated in html files that include detailed description of each dish. It is expected that the dictionary will be useful for Tamil learners, scholars and others interested in the Tamil language. *The Tamil Verb* Tamil is an official language of India, Singapore and Sri Lanka and has roughly 66 million native speakers worldwide. Most Tamil speakers live in the Tamil Nadu State of India and northeastern Sri Lanka, but the extended diaspora includes Malaysia, Mauritius and Singapore. Tamil is also a Classical Language of India. A member of the Dravidian language family, it boasts a rich literary tradition stretching back over 2200 years. Tamil is a diglossic language, meaning that it consists of at least two distinct forms. Spoken Tamil (ST) refers to the numerous vernacular dialects, and Literary Tamil (LT) refers to the form of the language used in print and most broadcast news media. The dialects of Spoken Tamil fall along regional divisions and along caste lines; there is no widely adopted standard for ST, although one seems to be emerging. Educated Tamil speakers, on the other hand, generally use LT with little variation in written communication. It appears, however, that a common dialect of ST may be emerging as a result of a growing broadcast media and increased rates of higher education. That dialect resembles the upper caste (non-Brahman) dialects spoken in the urban centers of Tamil Nadu and borrows verbs from LT. The spoken examples in An English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb reflect this emerging common dialect. Tamil is also an agglutinative language, meaning that it constructs verbs by appending inflections in the form of suffixes onto basic verb-stem morphemes. These inflections primarily denote tense, aspect, voice and mood. As far as voice is concerned, however, though LT may mark a verb as passive on occasion, ST rarely makes this distinction. These suffixes mark whether a verb is transitive or intransitive, that is, they indicate whether the subject is acted on by the verb or whether the subject is the actor. Mood is implied by verb tense, but may also be provided by verbal auxiliaries expressing various degrees of probability, futurity, ability, and their negatives. Tamil also may add suffixes that mark aspectual distinctions, such as whether an action is considered to be perfective ('complete' and/or 'definite') or whether it is ongoing or imperfective ('continuous' or 'durative'), as well as other distinctions. Aspect is a category that is undergoing increasing grammaticalization and is therefore more usual in ST than in LT. As is common with this process, aspectual distinctions are 'speaker-centered', i.e. they provide personal observations (some analysts have referred to this as 'attitude' or 'point of view', which is of course what the word 'aspect' originally means) which describe the speaker's frame of mind concerning the event depicted in the sentence -- whether it is perceived to be beneficial or detrimental, positive or negative, voluntary or involuntary, etc. Aspectual distinctions vary widely among dialects, both because of the variability of the grammaticalization process and for historical reasons, and Tamil speakers can code-switch among different dialects depending on context and audience. In addition, ST and LT treat the grammar of verbs differently. Finding exact equivalents between English and Tamil verbs is very difficult as a result of Tamil's diglossic nature and because of the difficulty of mapping English aspectual distinctions onto Tamil aspectual categories. An English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb seeks to meet needs not currently addressed by existing English-Tamil dictionaries. The main goal of this dictionary is to get an English-knowing user to a Tamil verb, irrespective of whether he or she begins with an English verb or some other item, such as an adjective; this is because what may be a verb in Tamil may in fact not be a verb in English, and vice versa. Since the number of English entries is limited (slightly less than 10,000) there may not be main entries for certain low-frequency items like 'pounce' but this item does appear as a synonym for 'jump, leap', and some other verbs, so searching for 'pounce' will get the user to a Tamil verb via the synonym field. The main goal is therefore to specifically concentrate on supplying the kinds of information lacking in all previous attempts to capture the equivalencies between English and Tamil. *Data* The text in the XML version of the dictionary is UTF-8.

This corpus was developed as part of ?Trawl? (Automatic Voice Identification System in Telephone Channel). The purpose of the project was to develop software for automatic identification of speakers based on voice samples acquired through telephone channels. The training of the system was performed with the telephone speech corpus RuSTeN. *Data* The RuSTeN (Russian through Switched Telephone Network) database was recorded between March 2001 and February 2003 by Speech Technology Center using the "forget-me-not" professional telephone recording and archiving software package developed by STC. The files were recorded with sample frequency 11025 Hz, one-channel, 16-bit linear. Each of the speakers made at least five calls from different locations and/or telephone sets. Most of the calls were made from home or an office environment with uncontrolled noise level. Additionally, one call per speaker was made from a public telephone (with either street or metro station noise in the background). The recordings are spontaneous (sometimes guided by the near-end speaker) conversations between the caller and the speech database collector on various subjects (the weather, the caller's biography, hobbies, etc.) and include approximately 150 seconds of the far-end and at least five seconds of the near-end speaker. Besides, each time the caller was asked to utter the usual digits set (0-9) and the words "yes" and "no." The time interval between two successive sessions is at least two days. The database contains 125 speakers (far-end), 58 male and 67 female. Each far-end speaker is represented by at least five speech files. The sound files are in the wav-format. The speech filenames contain the following information: FFF (far-end speaker number) and SS (session number).  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Russian.

Corpus design and data collection were carried out by staff and faculty of the Department of Foreign Languages (DFL) and Center for Technology Enhanced Language Learning (CTELL), located at the United States Military Academy (USMA), West Point, New York. The corpus was designed to develop speech recognition systems that would be used by the US government for speech-recognition enhanced language learning courseware. The prompt scripts were created from 20,000 distinct sentences, along with a subset of prompts designed to elicit free response answers to questions for use in domain-specific speech to speech translation systems. Each speaker attempted to record 100 utterances. Three data collection scripts were designed by Ms. Jennifer Son, a native speaker of Korean, under contract with the Department of Foreign Languages.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Korean.

The N4 NATO Native and Non-Native Speech corpus was developed by the NATO research group on Speech and Language Technology in order to provide a military-oriented database for multilingual and non-native speech processing studies. Speech data was recorded in the naval transmission training centers of four countries (Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Canada). The material consists of native and non-native speakers speakers using NATO English procedure between ships and reading from a text, "The North Wind and the Sun," in both English and the speaker's native language. Speech technology is covering an increasing number of languages, and systems are becoming more robust with regard to speech variablity such as speaking style and accents. However, for real applications, especially in a multilingual and multinational context, further robustness to regional and even non-native accents is necessary. Among numerous corpora available for speech research few have specifically addressed this issue. The NATO Speech and Language Technology group decided to create a corpus geared towards the study of non-native accents. The group chose naval communications as the common task because it naturally includes a great deal of non-native speech and because there were training facilities where data could be collected in several countries. *Data* The database was collected in four countries (Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Canada) during naval communication training sessions in 2000-2002. For each country, the main part of the recordings consists of a NATO Naval procedure in English where the typical sentence sounds like "This is alpha, whiskey, roger. I make two seven zero six hostile, two seven zero six. Out." In addition each speaker read a text, "The North Wind and the Sun," in English and his or her native language. The audio material was recorded on DAT and downsampled to 16kHz-16bit, and all the audio files have been manually transcribed and annotated with speakers identities using the tool, Transcriber. Navy procedure recordings and text readings have been stored in different files. The first digit in the filename indicates the type of speech Among speech segments, the duration of Navy procedure recordings range from 1.3h to 2.3h for a total of 7.5h. The duration of the native language text readings range from 1.5min to 22.9min for a total of around one hour.

The series had its first evaluation in 1996. 2003 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE-03) was part of this ongoing series of evaluations of language recognition technology. Further information regarding this evaluation may be found on the 2003 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation website and in the NIST 2003 evaluation plan. The task evaluated was the detection of a given target language. Given a test segment of speech, a target language was assigned as a test hypothesis, and the task was to determine whether this test hypothesis was true or false. This release contains both the 1996 and 2003 NIST Language Recognition Evaluations. *Data* Each speech file is one side of a "four wire" telephone conversation represented as 8-bit, 8kHz mulaw data. There are 11,830 speech files in sphere(.sph) format for a total of around forty six hours of speech. The speech data was compiled from the LDC's CALLFRIEND, CALLHOME, and Switchboard-2 corpora. Each file contains one test segment. The test segments are divided into three-second, ten-second, and thirty-second tests, each in its own directory.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Vietnamese, Tamil, Spanish, Iranian Persian, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, French, English, German, Mandarin Chinese, and Egyptian Arabic.

The collaboration was supported by TUBITAK, the Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey, through a combined doctoral scholarship program. The corpus was used to port CSLR's speech recognition system, SONIC, to Turkish. The corpus contains text, speech and alignment files. The corpus is of size ~600Mbytes. 120 speakers (60 male and 60 female) speak 40 sentences each (aproximately 300 words per speaker), which makes approximately 500 minutes of speech in total. The 40 sentences are selected randomly for each speaker from a triphone-balanced set of 2,462 Turkish sentences. The speakers are selected from students, faculty and staff at METU and all are native speakers of Turkish. The age range is from 19 to 50 years with an average of 23.9 years.

In 2004, HKUST was contracted to collect and transcribe 200 hours of Mandarin Chinese conversational telephone speech from Mandarin speakers in mainland China under the DARPA EARS framework. The first 50 hours of speech and transcripts were released in June 2004 to the EARS community for the RT-04 NIST evaluation. NIST partitioned the remaining 150 hours of collection into training, development and evaluation sets. This release contains the training and development sets with 873 and 24 calls, respectively. *Data Collection* Subject recruitment was done in several cities across mainland China. Most subjects did not previously know each other. To encourage more meaningful conversation, topics similar to those in Fisher English were designed. All calls were operator-assisted, namely, an operator would call two participants as scheduled to initiate a call. Subjects were asked about demographic questions before they were bridged for normal conversation. Their answers to the demographic questions were recorded on separate files. Subjects were allowed to talk up to 10 minutes. With a few exceptions, most calls are of the maximum length. Although subjects were allowed to make up to three calls, all subjects made just one call in this release with one exception, where PIN 10683 and PIN 10686 belong to a single individual. Each side of a call was recorded on a separate .wav file, sampled at 8-bits (a-law encoded), 8Khz. They were multiplexed later in sphere format with a-law encoding preserved. In the case where one side was shorter than the other, the shorter side was padded with silence. In the release, the file name of each recorded call is in the format of date_time_Apin_Bpin.sph and the corresponding transcript is in the same format with .txt extension. *Speaker demographics* Subjects were asked to provide several pieces of demographic information, including gender, age, native language/dialect, birthplace, education, occupation, phone type, etc. Given that Standard Mandarin is not the native dialect in many regions of China but is the official language of education and speakers may or may not have regional accents speaking Mandarin, it was decided that subjects birthplaces were divided into Mandarin-dominant and non-Mandarin-dominant regions and all calls were audited and classified into standard and accented types without further distinctions. Selected demographics - age, gender, birthplace, phone type and accent for each side of the call and the topic ID for the call - are provided as a tab-delimited, plain-text, tabular file.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

It contains all of the data in Chinese Gigaword Second Edition -- from Central News Agency (Taiwan), Xinhua News Agency and Lianhe Zaobao -- annotated with full part of speech tags. In order to avoid any problems or confusion that could result from differences in character-set specifications in the source data, all text files in this corpus have been converted to UTF-8 character encoding. With some exceptions described in the readme file, all characters in the text are either single-byte ASCII or multi-byte Chinese. All sources have been categorized into four distinct "types": * story: This type of DOC represents a coherent report on a particular topic or event, consisting of paragraphs and full sentences. * multi: This type of DOC contains a series of unrelated "blurbs," each of which briefly describes a particular topic or event; examples include "summaries of today's news," "news briefs in ..." (some general area like finance or sports), and so on. * advis: These are DOCs which the news service addresses to news editors; they are not intended for publication to the "end users." * other: These DOCs clearly do not fall into any of the above types; they include items such as lists of sports scores, stock prices, temperatures around the world, and so on. *Data* The table below lists the number files, their compressed and uncompressed size, number of words and number of documents divided by source. #Files = number of files. Rzip-MB = compressed size in megabytes. Totl-MB = uncompressed size in megabytes. K-words = number of words in thousands. #DOCs = number of documents.

The utterances consist of both read speech (for phonetic coverage) and responses to questions (for spontaneous speech). The corpus contains 477 speakers and 8,080 separate utterances. A total of 2,540 utterances have been transcribed at the word level (without time alignments), and 5,479 utterances have been transcribed at the phoneme level (with time alignments). Protocol design, recording and transcription were performed by the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and the Universidade de Caxias do Sul. *Data* The data has been recorded at 44.1 kHz (mono, 16-bit) and stored in RIFF format. The recording was conducted with a direct connection from the microphone to the sound card. The sound card was SoundBlaster-compatible. For the prompted sentences, the sentence was hidden from view when recording began, so that the speaker might utter the sentence more naturally. Verification of the recording quality was performed immediately after each utterance recording; the data-collection software allowed the speaker to re-record utterances in case the recording was not of sufficient quality. The acoustic environment was not controlled, in order to allow for background conditions that would occur in application environments.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Portuguese.

CAC 2.0 consists of 650,000 words from various 1970s and 1980s newspapers, magazines and radio and television broadcast transcripts manually annotated for morphology and syntax. The CAC 2.0 offers: * For linguists: language material reflecting the real usage of the language. * For computational linguists: tools and a considerable amount of data for natural language applications that are not feasible without morphological and syntactical text processing. * For TrEd annotation tool users: the possibility to use voice control for the tool. * For teachers and their students: an interesting didactic tool for practising Czech language morphology and syntax. The CAC was created by a team from the Institute of the Czech Language, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, led by Marie Těitelová, during the period from 1971 to 1985. The original purpose of the corpus was to build a frequency dictionary of the Czech language. Researchers were aware, however, that in order to make the CAC useful for future users, whether linguists or natural language processing systems developers, it was necessary to design annotation schemes and to develop tools that would add as much linguistic information as possible to the data. In 1996, the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT), which provided morphological and syntactic analytic layers of annotation to certain Czech media data, was launched independently of the CAC. During the work on the PDT's second version, its researchers decided to transfer PDT's internal format and annotation scheme to the CAC with the goals of making the CAC and the PDT fully compatible and of integrating the CAC into the PDT. To that end, the CAC was manually annotated for morphology and syntax. CAC 2.0 adds the surface syntax annotation; in the terminology of the PDT, this annotation is called an analytical layer. The following PDT resources are available from LDC: Prague Dependency Treebank 1.0, LDC2001T10, Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0, LDC2006T01, Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank 1.0, LDC2004T23 and Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 1.0. *Annotation Description and Examples* A morphological layer of annotation provides the word tokens with further data (annotation), which characterizes the morphological properties of the word tokens (as apparent in the lemma which is the canonical form of a lexeme), the part of speech, and morphological categories (case, number, tense, person, etc.). Formally, part of speech classes combine together with values of morphological categories to represent morphological tags (or, simply, tags). In the CAC 2.0, tags are designed according to the PDT as strings of definite length (15 positions) where each position corresponds to a single category. Example: The word form Prahu (a form of "Prague") is analysed as an affirmative (11th position) noun (1st and 2nd position), feminine (3rd position), singular (4th position), and accusative (5th position). All of the other positions are correctly filled with the symbol "-" that represents the irrelevance of the morphological category towards the part of speech. For example, one does not determine a person and tense with nouns (8th and 9th position). Examples of lemmas and tags of particular word forms Word token Lemma Tag Description Prahu Praha NNFS4-----A---- Noun, feminine, singular, accusative, affirmative 123 123 C=------------- Digit token ) ) Z:------------- Punctuation mark (right parenthesis) An a-layer annotation assigns each word unit the corresponding data characterising the syntactical features of the unit and therefore its relation to the other sentence elements along with its sentence function. Formally, the sentence relations are represented by a dependency tree. Example: Syntactical annotation of the sentence Obecná odpověď na tuto otázku je sotva mo-ná.(Lit.: A general response to this question is hardly possible.) Each word unit (word, number, punctuation mark) is represented by a single node in the resulting tree. Note that due to technical reasons each tree is rooted by one extra node - the tree in our example therefore consists of 9 nodes. The annotation approach builds on the tradition of the Prague linguistic school, where the predicate (usually verb) is understood to be the centre of the sentence. Therefore the predicate is placed as a direct daughter of the root. The final punctuation is also placed as a daughter of the root node. Two constituents of the sentence are dependent on the predicate - odpověď (answer) and mo-ná (possible). Please note that each node in the tree is annotated with the word form, lemma, morphological tag and analytic function. Looking at the node representing the word odpověď (answer), we can see its form is a feminine noun in nominative singular and that this unit stands in the role of subject of the sentence, which is expressed by the analytic function Subj. Example of an a-layer annotation The conception of the main internal format of the CAC 2.0 treats the annotation layers separately where each layer of annotation in the document corresponds to one file. (In the case of the CSTS format, all layers of annotation are contained in one file.) This relationship in the CAC 2.0 means that there are three instances (files) for every document, one for the w-layer, one for the m-layer and a third one for the a-layer. However, the distinction between layers does not restrict interconnection between groups for particular layers of annotation. In fact, the opposite is true as will be demonstrated later in this section. The word layer does not reflect the segmentation of the text into sentences; this segmentation occurs on the m-layer. This means that unlike the w-layer, the m-layer contains final punctuation. Additionally, the number of word tokens in both layers may differ. The differences originate from the concatenation of the incorrectly split word into one word, or reversely, from the division of incorrectly connected words into more units. The correctly written text should be contained in the m-layer. Example: The three following figures illustrate the w-layer and m-layer interconnection. Also the interconnection of the files in the sense of the number of word units is captured and denoted by arrows. All three examples were chosen from the CAC 2.0 deliberately so that the user can directly view the instances; the name of the document and number of the sentence is provided for every sentence. Figure 2.2 serves to illustrate the 1:1 ratio of the layers. The layers do not differ except for the final punctuation. Technical interconnection of the w-layer and m-layer: The insertion of a word token exemplifies the situation where a word token is inserted into the text - the year information was clearly missing. Since it is almost impossible for the corrector to add the missing year, the symbol "#" is used as this symbol has no counterpart on the w-layer. In contrast, Figure 2.4 illustrates the situation where more m-layer units corresponds to the same w-layer unit - the word unit pedagogicko-psychologické (E: psychological-pedagogical) has been divided into three separate units. Technical interconnection of the w-layer and m-layer: No changes other than the final-sentence punctuation Figure 2.3. Technical interconnection of the w-layer and m-layer: The insertion of a word tokend Figure 2.4. Technical interconnection of the w-layer and m-layer: The division of a word token The interconnection between the a-layer and m-layer means that each m-layer word unit corresponds exactly to one node of the dependency tree on the a-layer, and vice versa. The only exception is the technical root, which has no counterpart on the m-layer. *Corpus Tools* CAC 2.0 contains the following tools: * Bonito: a corpus manager that searches CAC 2.0 texts. * LAW: a morphological annotations editor. * TrEd: a syntactical annotations editor. * Negraph: a corpus viewer. * tool_chain: automatically processes Czech texts.  aContent in Czech.

The length of the n-grams ranges from unigrams (single words) to five-grams. This data is expected to be useful for statistical language modeling, e.g., for machine translation or speech recognition, as well as for other uses. *Source Data* The n-gram counts were generated from approximately 1 trillion word tokens of text from publicly accessible Web pages. *Character Encoding* The input encoding of documents was automatically detected, and all text was converted to UTF8. *Tokenization* The data was tokenized in a manner similar to the tokenization of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank. Notable exceptions include the following: * Hyphenated word are usually separated, and hyphenated numbers usually form one token. * Sequences of numbers separated by slashes (e.g. in dates) form one token. * Sequences that look like urls or email addresses form one token. *Data Sizes* File sizes: approx. 24 GB compressed (gzip'ed) text files Number of tokens: 1,024,908,267,229 Number of sentences: 95,119,665,584 Number of unigrams: 13,588,391 Number of bigrams: 314,843,401 Number of trigrams: 977,069,902 Number of fourgrams: 1,313,818,354 Number of fivegrams: 1,176,470,663 *Sample Data* The following is an example of the 3-gram data contained this corpus: ceramics collectables collectibles 55 ceramics collectables fine 130 ceramics collected by 52 ceramics collectible pottery 50 ceramics collectibles cooking 45 ceramics collection , 144 ceramics collection . 247 ceramics collection 120 ceramics collection and 43 ceramics collection at 52 ceramics collection is 68 ceramics collection of 76 ceramics collection | 59 ceramics collections , 66 ceramics collections . 60 ceramics combined with 46 ceramics come from 69 ceramics comes from 660 ceramics community , 109 ceramics community . 212 ceramics community for 61 ceramics companies . 53 ceramics companies consultants 173 ceramics company ! 4432 ceramics company , 133 ceramics company . 92 ceramics company 41 ceramics company facing 145 ceramics company in 181 ceramics company started 137 ceramics company that 87 ceramics component ( 76 ceramics composed of 85 ceramics composites ferrites 56 ceramics composition as 41 ceramics computer graphics 51 ceramics computer imaging 52 ceramics consist of 92 The following is an example of the 4-gram data in this corpus: serve as the incoming 92 serve as the incubator 99 serve as the independent 794 serve as the index 223 serve as the indication 72 serve as the indicator 120 serve as the indicators 45 serve as the indispensable 111 serve as the indispensible 40 serve as the individual 234 serve as the industrial 52 serve as the industry 607 serve as the info 42 serve as the informal 102 serve as the information 838 serve as the informational 41 serve as the infrastructure 500 serve as the initial 5331 serve as the initiating 125 serve as the initiation 63 serve as the initiator 81 serve as the injector 56 serve as the inlet 41 serve as the inner 87 serve as the input 1323 serve as the inputs 189 serve as the insertion 49 serve as the insourced 67 serve as the inspection 43 serve as the inspector 66 serve as the inspiration 1390 serve as the installation 136 serve as the institute 187 serve as the institution 279 serve as the institutional 461 serve as the instructional 173 serve as the instructor 286 serve as the instructors 161 serve as the instrument 614 serve as the instruments 193 serve as the insurance 52 serve as the insurer 82 serve as the intake 70 serve as the integral 68  aContent and documentation in English. 0aLanguage and languagesxWord frequencyvDatabases. 0aLinguisticsxStatistical methodsvDatabases. 0aMachine learning. 0aNatural language processing (Computer science) 0aAutomatic speech recognition.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aBrants, Thorsten10aFranz, Alex403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T1302965nmm a22003853i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245003800177264007300215336003800288336002600326337002600352338003200378500001500410500004500425506005100470520151700521520005102038546004902089650004902138650005102187650004402238655002002282700002402302700001902326700001702345856014902362856006802511m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2006    pau        u        kor d  a15856339928 aLDC2006T148 aISLRN: 030-163-048-673-00 akorbeng07akorbeng2iso639-3  adc00aKorean Broadcast News Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2006]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2006T14  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T141 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThis data set consists of 18 text files containing transcripts prepared by the LDC for Voice of America satellite radio news broadcasts in Korean. The broadcasts were recorded by the LDC at transmission time during a two week period between January 21, 2000 and February 7, 2000. *Data* Nine of the broadcasts are 30 minutes long, and the other nine broadcasts are 60 minutes long. The file names indicate the date (YYYYMMDD)and the begin and end times (HHMM EST) of the original transmission. The character encoding is Unicode UTF-8, and the file contents are structured using SGML. The markup strategy used here was defined by NIST specifically for use in transcripts of broadcast news speech. The "docs" directory provides a working DTD file, a complete description (in the form of a PostScript file) of the document structure, tags and attributes, and a simple text file listing the 18 data file names in the corpus. The transcripts have been manually time aligned at the phrasal level and annotated to identify boundaries between news stories and speaker turns; speaker names and gender are given where identifiable. These annotations are all provided via the SGML tags and their attributes. A strong effort has been made to identify all unique speakers across the transcripts. However, there may be cases where an individual speaker has not been recognized and has been given a unique, anonymous identification.

These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities. They are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of text-independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluation was designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported, and to be accessible. NIST has been coordinating Speaker Recognition Evaluations since 1996. Each evaluation begins with the announcement of the official evaluation plan which clearly states the rules and tasks involved with the evaluation. The evaluation culminates with a follow-up workshop, where NIST reports the official results and researchers share in their findings. The data consists of conversational telephone speech collected by the LDC.

The two distinct international sources of French newswire in this edition, and the time spans of collection covered for each, are as follows: * Agence France-Presse (afp_fre) May 1994 - July 2006 * Associated Press French Service (apw_fre) Nov 1994 - July 2006 The seven-letter codes in parentheses include the three-character source name abbreviations and the three-character language code ("fre") separated by an underscore ("_") character. The three-letter language code conforms to LDC's new internal convention based on the ISO 639-3 standard. The overall totals for each source are summarized below. Note that the "Totl-MB" numbers show the amount of data you get when the files are uncompressed (i.e. approximately 15 gigabytes, total); the "Gzip-MB" column shows totals for compressed file sizes as stored on the DVD-ROM; the "K-wrds" numbers are simply the number of whitespace-separated tokens (of all types) after all SGML tags are eliminated.

There are two distinct varieties: Northern, centered around Syria and Lebanon; and Southern, spoken in Jordan and Palestine. Northern Levantine Arabic speakers include approximately 8.8 million speakers in Syria and 6 million speakers in Lebanon. Southern Levantine Arabic speakers include approximately 3.5 million speakers in Jordan, 1.6 million speakers in Palestine and nearly one million speakers in Israel. Fisher Levantine Arabic Conversational Telephone Speech contains 279 telephone conversations totaling 45 hours of speech. The majority of the speakers are from Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine. Speaker Distribution by Region Jordan 60% Palestine 15% Lebanon 15% Syria 8% other 2% The Fisher telephone conversation collection protocol was created at LDC to address a critical need of developers trying to build robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Previous collection protocols, such as CALLFRIEND and Switchboard-II and the resulting corpora, have been adapted for ASR research but were in fact developed for language and speaker identification respectively. Although the CALLHOME protocol and corpora were developed to support ASR technology, they feature small numbers of speakers making telephone calls of relatively long duration with narrow vocabulary across the collection. CALLHOME conversations are challengingly natural and intimate. Under the Fisher protocol, a very large number of participants each make a few calls of short duration speaking to other participants, whom they typically do not know, about assigned topics. This maximizes inter-speaker variation and vocabulary breadth although it also increases formality. Previous protocols such as CALLHOME, CALLFRIEND and Switchboard relied upon participant activity to drive the collection. Fisher is unique in being platform driven rather than participant driven. Participants who wish to initiate a call may do so; however the collection platform initiates the majority of calls. Participants need only answer their phones at the times they specified when registering for the study. To encourage a broad range of vocabulary, Fisher participants are asked to speak on an assigned topic which is selected at random from a list, which changes every 24 hours and which is assigned to all subjects paired on that day. Some topics are inherited or refined from previous Switchboard studies while others were developed specifically for the Fisher protocol. *Data* The conversations in this corpus are a subset of the conversations in Levantine Arabic QT Training Data Set 5, Speech, LDC2006S29. The individual audio files are in NIST Sphere format.

The recordings in this release were collected by Appen Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia in 2006. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) provided this corpus to the LDC for distribution. Urdu is an Indo-Aryan language spoken throughout South Asia that developed under the Mughal Empire and Delhi Sultinate between 1200 AD and 1800 AD. It has Persian, Turkish and Arabic influences, but in fact is a dialect of Hindustani. The word "Urdu" refers to the standardized register of Hindustani, but there are many non-standard idiolects as well. Urdu is the twentieth most spoken language in the world. It is the native language of over 60 million people, it is the offical language of Pakistan, and it is one of India's national languages. Urdu is also spoken in Afghanistan. The ARL Urdu Speech Database is a collection of recorded speech from 200 adult native Urdu speakers from Pakistan and Northern India. The distribution of speaker dialects is as follows: Accent Number of Speakers South Sindh 29 North Sindh 30 South Punjab 27 North Punjab 29 Captial Area 29 North West Regions 30 Baluchistan 26 The database is divided into two parts, a training set containing approximately 80% of the data and a test set comprised of 20% of the data. This release consists of approximately 80% of the complete dataset (training and test). *Data* Each speaker was presented with 400 prompts to read: sentences, place names, and person names. Two microphones set at different distances to the speaker were used for the recordings. The recorded speech was stored in raw format files with headers stored in separate directories. Each utterance is transcribed in the corresponding label file for each recording. The transcriptions were encoded in UTF-8. Punctuation was omitted and numbers were written out in full. *Update* Earlier versions were missing the content list file. This is now available as part of the complete download file.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Urdu.

The six distinct international sources of English newswire included in this edition are the following: Agence France-Presse, English Service (afp_eng) Associated Press Worldstream, English Service (apw_eng) Central News Agency of Taiwan, English Service (cna_eng) Los Angeles Times/Washington Post Newswire Service (ltw_eng) New York Times Newswire Service (nyt_eng) Xinhua News Agency, English Service (xin_eng) The seven-letter codes in the parentheses above include the three-character source name abbreviations and the three-character language code ("eng") separated by an underscore ("_") character. The three-letter language code conforms to LDC's internal convention based on the new ISO 639-3 standard. The seven-letter codes are used in both the directory names where the data files are found, and in the prefix that appears at the beginning of every data file name. As with other Gigaword releases, some of the content in the this corpus has been published previously by the LDC in a variety of other, older corpora, particularly the North American News text corpora, the various TDT corpora, and the AQUAINT text corpus, as well as earlier editions of Gigaword English. *New in the Third Edition* * New newswire data contents from January 2005 to December 2006 have been added for all of the five newswire sources that were represented in the first edition. * A new source, the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post newswire service, has been added. * A small handful of corrections to older APW data have been made to remove a few non-English stories, clean up some character "noise", and rectify the encoding for a few non-ASCII characters. * The CNA content introduced in Gigaword English 2nd Edition has been completely updated to repair data corruptions caused by occasional character encoding problems; as a result of the update, there may be differences in the inventory and/or ID strings of DOC elements in this portion of the corpus, relative to the previous edition. (The nature of encoding problems is explained below under "SOURCE SPECIFIC PROPERTIES".) * Many of the files (141 out of 722) include a small number of UTF-8 "wide" characters, typically accented letters found in proper names and borrowed words (some sources also use special punctuation marks, non-breaking spaces, etc). Apart from the replacement/update of all CNA files, the data content of the 2nd edition has been included in the present release without modification.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzUnited StatesvDatabases. 0aForeign newsvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aGraff, David10aKong, Junbo10aChen, Ke10aMaeda, Kazuaki403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007T0702821nmm a22004213i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041002300134041003300157042000700190245002700197264007300224336003800297336002600335337002600361338003200387500001500419500004500434506005100479520118800530520005101718546008901769650003701858650005001895650004901945650005001994650004202044655002002086700001702106700001602123700001902139700002402158856014902182856006802331m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2006    pau        u        eng d  a15856341748 aLDC2006T188 aISLRN: 492-763-586-162-20 aengachiaarabeng07aengacmnaarbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aTDT5 Multilingual Text  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2006]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2006T18  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T181 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe TDT5 corpora were created by Linguistic Data Consortium with support from the DARPA TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization) Program. This release contains the complete set of English, Arabic and Chinese newswire text used in the 2004 Topic Detection and Tracking technology evaluations. The topic relevance annotations corresponding to this publication can be found in LDC Publication LDC2006T19, TDT5 Topics and Annotations. Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) refers to automatic techniques for finding topically related material in streams of data such as newswire and broadcast news. There were four TDT tasks defined for the 2004 evaluation: the tracking of known topics, the detection of unknown topics, the detection of initial stories on unknown topics, and the detection of pairs of stories on the same topic (links). Of these four tasks, the topic tracking task and the link detection task are considered to be "primary." Previous TDT evaluations also included a story segmentation task. This task applied only to broadcast news. Since TDT5 does not include broadcast news, there is no story segmentation task in the 2004 TDT Evaluation.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, and Standard Arabic.

The corresponding speech files are available in Arabic Broadcast News Speech (LDC2006S46). This work was undertaken in the Networking Data Centers (NetDC) project (MLIS-5017, NSF III-9982201) in conjunction with the European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

The goal of the NetDC project was to improve the infrastructure for language resources by designing and implementing new modes of cooperation between LDC and ELRA. *Data* The character encoding is entirely in ASCII; Buckwalter transliteration is used for rendering the Arabic text content. Time alignment and structural markup are rendered via "pseudo-SGML" tags, which are presented one tag per line, with the first character of the line being an open angle bracket. The lines of transcription text (i.e. the speech and annotation content between the time-stamp tags) all begin with a single space character, and present exactly one token per line. (A "token" may be a spoken Arabic word, a punctuation mark, or a single Arabic word enclosed by "(%" and ")", which represents an annotation of a non-speech condition or event (e.g. "music", "noise", "laugh", etc).  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

The data was extracted from news articles published by Xinhua News Agency and Agence France Presse and was obtained using the automatic parallel sentence identification method described in the following publication: Dragos Stefan Munteanu, Daniel Marcu, 2005. Machine Translation Performance by Exploiting Non-parallel Corpora, Computational Linguistics, 31(4):477-504 The corpus contains 1,124,609 sentence pairs; the word count on the English side is approximately 31M words. The sentences in the parallel corpus preserve the form and encoding of the texts in the original Gigaword corpora. For each sentence pair in the corpus the authors provide the names of the documents from which the two sentences were extracted, as well as a confidence score (between 0.5 and 1.0), which is indicative of their degree of parallelism. The parallel sentence identification approach is designed to judge sentence pairs in isolation from their contexts, and can therefore find parallel sentences within document pairs which are not parallel. The fact that two documents share several parallel sentences does not necessarily mean the documents are parallel. In order to make this resource useful for research in Machine Translation (MT), the authors made efforts to detect potential overlaps between this data and the standard test and development data sets used by the MT community. The NIST 2002-2005 MT evaluation data sets contain several articles from Xinhua News Agency and Agence France Presse.

The original transcripts and the corresponding broadcast news audio are available as separate LDC publications, 1997 Mandarin Broadcast News Transcripts (HUB4-NE) (LDC98T24) and 1997 Mandarin Broadcast News Speech (HUB4-NE) (LDC98S73). The source data is comprised of 30 hours of recorded Mandarin broadcasts collected by the LDC in 1997 from Voice of America, China Central TV and KAZN-AM, a commercial radio station based in Los Angeles, CA. The original transcript segmentation is suitable for speech recognition, but does not support machine translation and machine translation evaluation. Therefore, the Mandarin side of these aligned transcripts was resegmented for this release. In all other respects, the Mandarin transcripts in this publication are identical to the original transcripts. The dataset in this release consists of 376K words of English text and 517K characters of Mandarin text. The English text was produced by translators with no access to the original audio. The translators were given specific guidelines for translation, and those are included in this distribution.

TREC Video Retrieval Evaluation (TRECVID) is sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to promote progress in content-based retrieval from digital video via open, metrics-based evaluation. The keyframes in this release were extracted for use in the NIST TRECVID 2005 Evaluation. TRECVID is a laboratory-style evaluation that attempts to model real world situations or significant component tasks involved in such situations. In 2005 there were four main tasks with associated tests: * shot boundary determination * low-level feature extraction * high-level feature extraction * search (interactive, manual, and automatic) For a detailed description of the TRECVID Evaluation Tasks, please refer to the NIST TRECVID 2005 Evaluation Description. *Data* The source data is Arabic, Chinese and English language broadcast programming collected in November 2004 from the following sources: Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. (Arabic); China Central TV and New Tang Dynasty TV (Chinese); and CNN and MSNBC/NBC (English). Shots are fundamental units of video, useful for higher-level processing. To create the master list of shots, the video was segmented. The results of this pass are called subshots. Because the master shot reference is designed for use in manual assessment, a second pass over the segmentation was made to create the master shots of at least 2 seconds in length. These master shots are the ones used in submitting results for the feature and search tasks in the evaluation. In the second pass, starting at the beginning of each file, the subshots were aggregated, if necessary, until the currrent shot was at least 2 seconds in duration, at which point the aggregation began anew with the next subshot. The keyframes were selected by going to the middle frame of the shot boundary, then parsing left and right of that frame to locate the nearest I-Frame. This then became the keyframe and was extracted. Keyframes have been provided at both the subshot (NRKF) and master shot (RKF) levels. In a small number of cases (all of them subshots) there was no I-Frame within the subshot boundaries. When this occured, the middle frame was selected. There is one anomaly: at the end of the first video in the test collection, a subshot occurs outside a master shot.) The emphasis in the common shot boundary reference is on the shots, not the transitions. The shots are contiguous. There are no gaps between them. They do not overlap. The media time format is based on the Gregorian day time (ISO 8601) norm. Fractions are defined by counting pre-specified fractions of a second.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Standard Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese.

It is a subset of the original Enron Email Data Set of 1.5 million emails that was posted on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission website as a matter of public record during the investigation of Enron. The original set suffered from document integrity problems; attempts were made to improve the quality of the data and to remove some sensitive and private information. Dr. William Cohen of Carnegie Mellon University took the lead in distributing the improved corpus, consisting of 517,431 Enron employee emails that covered the period 1999-2002. This corpus is a subset of the Carnegie Mellon data set and covers the period from January 2001 to December 2001. The email topics reflect the business activities and interests of Enron employees in that year: California energy problems and the subsequent state and Federal investigations, Enron's downfall (newsfeeds and interoffice communications), Enron's venture with the Dabhol India Power Company, Enrononline (Enron's trading infrastructure), competitors (Dynegy, El Paso Pipeline) and even fantasy football and college football. Eliminated from this data set are duplicates, emails that are too small and emails that are not really topics but are types (personnel memos and personal quips). The manual indexing was performed in the summer of 2006 by two people who worked closely together: a research associate familiar with the Enron saga and a junior in economics at the University of Tennessee. The original Enron Email Data Set is the first large email set made available to researchers, but until now there has been no ability to assess the performance of topic detection and tracking algorithms with the email set. Having an annotated subset such as this one should provide text mining researchers with a way to evaluate the accuracy of new algorithms for clustering and classification. This data set can also be used to provide communication context for researchers using the Enron Email Data Set in social network analysis. Previous annotations such as the one developed at UC Berkeley have been primarily based on email type rather than the specific topic(s) of discussion. This annotation can be used to qualify the discussion topics between individuals and groups comprising a social network of Enron employees. Due to the complexity of this corpus' directory structure, it will be distributed as compressed tar file on a cd. Most compression utilities will uncompress the package.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aElectronic mail messagesvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aBerry, Michael W.10aBrowne, Murray10aSigner, Ben403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007T2204399nmm a22004333i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041002300134041003300157042000700190245003900197264007300236336003800309336002600347337002600373338003200399500001500431500004500446506005100491520274000542520005103282546008903333650004903422650004703471650004903518650004203567655002003609700002303629700001603652700001903668700001803687700001903705700002403724856014903748856006803897m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2007    pau        u        eng d  a15856345228 aLDC2007T208 aISLRN: 570-571-401-317-70 aengaaraachibeng07aengaarbacmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 1 Distillation Training  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2007]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2007T20  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007T201 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 1 Distillation Training, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2007T20 and isbn 1-58563-452-2, constitutes the final release of training data created by LDC for the DARPA GALE Program Phase 1 Distillation technology evaluation. Distillation is one of three primary technology components for the DARPA GALE Program, along with Transcription and Translation. Distillation engines respond to queries from English-speaking users, delivering pertinent, consolidated information in easy-to-understand forms. The distillation engine processes English and foreign language material, both speech and text, from multiple sources and documents, removing redundancy and presenting an integrated response to the user. This release consists of 248 English, Chinese and/or Arabic queries and their responses, created by LDC annotators. Queries conform to one of ten template types. Query responses may include document and snippet relevance judgments, nuggets, nugs and supernugs. 158 of the 248 queries have been annotated for all features, while the remainder are labeled for only some features. In addition, not all queries have been exhaustively annotated for a given feature, given resource constraints during corpus development. The table below indicates the number of queries that have been labeled for each template in each source language. English Chinese Arabic Template 1 15/28 9/17 12/16 Template 3 16/29 9/29 13/29 Template 4 15/23 7/18 11/18 Template 5 21/39 10/39 20/36 Template 6 15/20 7/19 7/20 Template 8 12/14 6/13 5/14 Template 9 14/23 7/21 10/21 Template 11 11/22 8/15 2/14 Template 15 12/21 8/11 5/11 Template 16 13/24 10/12 8/12 Total 144/243 81/194 93/191 *Annotation* The annotation task involves responding to a series of user queries. For each query, annotators first find relevant documents and identify snippets (strings of contiguous text that answer the query) in the Arabic, Chinese or English source document. Annotators then create a nugget for each fact expressed in the snippet. Semantically equivalent nuggets are grouped into cross-language, cross-document "supernugs". Judges at BAE Systems finally provide relevance weights for each supernug. Queries in this release have been annotated for the following tasks: * searching for relevant documents and providing yes/no judgements * extracting snippets * resolution of pronouns, and certain types of temporal and locative expressions contained in the snippets * creating nuggets, i.e. atomic pieces of information that an annotator considers a valid answer to the query * building nugs, i.e. clusters of semantically-equivalent nuggets for each language * building supernugs, i.e. clusters of semantically-equivalent nugs across languages  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Standard Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese.

That lack of semantics causes problems throughout the applications. Misinterpreting the meaning of an ambiguous word results in failing to extract data, incorrect alignments for translation, and ambiguous language models. Incorrect coreference resolution results in missed information (because a connection is not made) or incorrectly conflated information (due to false connections). Some richer semantic representation is badly needed. The OntoNotes project is a collaborative effort between BBN Technologies, the University of Colorado, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute to produce such a resource. It aims to annotate a large corpus comprising various genres of text (news, conversational telephone speech, weblogs, use net, broadcast, talk shows) in three languages (English, Chinese, and Arabic) with structural information (syntax and predicate argument structure) and shallow semantics (word sense linked to an ontology and coreference). OntoNotes builds on two time-tested resources, following the Penn Treebank for syntax and the Penn PropBank for predicate-argument structure. Its semantic representation will include word sense disambiguation for nouns and verbs, with each word sense connected to an ontology, and coreference. The current goals call for annotation of over a million words each of English and Chinese, and half a million words of Arabic over five years. The authors wish to make this resource available to the natural language research community so that decoders for these phenomena can be trained to generate the same structure in new documents. Lessons learned over the years have shown that the quality of annotation is crucial if it is going to be used for training machine learning algorithms. Taking this cue, we ensure that each layer of annotation in OntoNotes will have at least 90% inter- annotator agreement. Our pilot studies have shown that predicate structure, word sense, ontology linking, and coreference can all be annotated rapidly and with better than 90% consistency.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English and Mandarin Chinese.

Rich Transcription (RT) is broadly defined as a fusion of speech-to-text technology and metadata extraction technologies designed to provide the basis for a generation of more usable transcriptions of human-human meeting speech. The data in this release contains portions of meeting speech collected, and/or transcribed by the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at Berkeley, the Interactive Systems Laboratories (ISL) at Carnegie Mellon University, NIST and LDC. The complete meeting speech and corresponding transcript data sets are available from LDC's catalog as follows: ICSI Meeting Speech (LDC2004S02), ICSI Meeting Transcripts (LDC2004T04), ISL Meeting Speech Part 1 (LDC2004S05), ISL Meeting Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2004T10), NIST Meeting Pilot Corpus Speech (LDC2004S09) and NIST Meeting Pilot Corpus Transcripts and Metadata (LDC2004T13). The RT-04S development data consists of the 80-minute test set used in the RT-02 Meeting Recognition Evaluation, specifcally, approximately 10 minutes of recordings of eight meetings held at ISCI, CMU, LDC and NIST. For RT-04S, NIST re-released that data with additional distant mics (if the data collection sites provided them). Although the development data is comprised of 10-minute excerpts from the same data collection sites which are represented in the RT-04S evaluation data set (2004 Spring NIST Rich Transcription (RT-04S) Evaluation Data, LDC2007S12), it is not completely reflective of the evaluation test data since it contains lapel mics in lieu of head mics for the LDC and CMU data and some different distant mics for LDC data. For more information about the development test data, see NIST's RT-04S Development Data Documentation. RT-04S included the following tasks in the meeting domain: Speech-to-Text Transcription (STT) tasks Microphone conditions: * Multiple distant microphones * Single distant microphone * Individual head microphone Processing time conditions: * Unlimited time STT * Less than or equal to twenty times realtime * Less than or equal to ten times realtime * Less than or equal to one times realtime Diarization (SPKR) task (who spoke when) Microphone conditions: * Multiple distant microphones * Single distant microphone Input conditions: * Speech input only * Speech plus reference transcript input Processing time conditions: * Unlimited time * Less than or equal to twenty times realtime * Less than or equal to ten times realtime * Less than or equal to one time realtime  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aConversationvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzUnited StatesvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aFiscus, Jonathan G.10aGarofolo, John S.10aLe, Audrey10aMartin, Alvin10aSanders, Greg10aPrzybocki, Mark10aPallett, David S.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007S1103525nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245006500141264007300206336003800279336003300317337002600350338003200376500001500408500004500423506005100468520198100519520005102500546004202551650002902593650006402622650004502686655002802731700002402759700002202783700001502805700001802820700001802838700002002856700002202876856014902898856006803047m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2007    pau        u        eng d  a15856344848 aLDC2007S128 aISLRN: 581-401-882-415-9  adc00a2004 Spring NIST Rich Transcription (RT-04S) Evaluation Data  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2007]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2007S12  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007S121 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  a2004 Spring NIST Rich Transcription (RT-04S) Evaluation Data contains the test material (meeting speech and reference transcripts) used in the RT-04S evaluation administered by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Speech Group.

The Chinese Treebank project began at the University of Pennsylvania in 1998 and continues at Penn and the University of Colorado. Chinese Treebank 6.0 is the latest version produced from this effort, consisting of 780,000 words (over 1.28 million Chinese characters) that are segmented, part-of-speech tagged and fully bracketed. The data sources include newswire from Xinhua News Agency, articles from Sinorama Magazine, news from the website of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and transcripts from various broadcast news programs. The LDC published Chinese Treebank 1.0 in 2000; it was later corrected and released in 2001 as Chinese Treebank 2.0 (LDC2001T11) and consisted of approximately 100,000 words. The LDC released Chinese Treebank 4.0 (LDC2004T05), an updated version containing roughly 400,000 words, in 2004. A year later, the LDC published the 500,000 word Chinese Treebank 5.0 (LDC2005T01). For information about Chinese Treebank methodology and guidelines, consult the attached documentation files and the Penn-CU Chinese Treebank Project website. This release encompasses 2,036 text files, containing 28,295 sentences, 781,351 words and 1,285,149 hanzi (Chinese characters). The data is provided in two encodings: GBK and UTF-8, and the annotation has Penn Treebank-style labeled brackets. Details of the annotation standard can be found in the enclosed segmentation, POS-tagging and bracketing guidelines. The data is provided in four different formats: raw text, word segmented, word segmented and POS-tagged, and syntactically bracketed.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

The complete set of Korean Telephone Conversations consists of the following: * Korean Telephone Conversations Speech * Korean Telephone Conversations Transcripts * Korean Telephone Conversations Lexicon The Korean telephone conversations were originally recorded as part of the Callfriend project. The Callfriend Korean telephone speech was collected by Linguistic Data Consortium primarily in support of the Language Identification (LID) project, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. The calls were later transcribed for use in other projects. Korean Telephone Conversations Speech consists of 100 telephone conversations, 49 of which were published in 1996 as CALLFRIEND Korean, while the remaining 51 are previously unexposed calls. The recorded conversations are between native speakers of Korean and last up to 30 minutes, of which the transcribed speech covers between 15 and 18 minutes. All speakers were aware that they were being recorded. They were given no guidelines concerning what they should talk about. Once a caller was recruited to participate, he/she was given a free choice of whom to call. Most participants called family members or close friends. All calls originated in either the United States or Canada. Korean Telephone Conversations Transcripts consists of 100 text files, totalling approximately 190K words and 25K unique words. All files are in Korean orthography: orthographic Korean characters are in Hangul, encoded in KSC5601 (Wansung) system. Please follow this link for a sample transcript: txt | gif. Korean Telephone Conversations Lexicon covers the tokens occurring in the Korean Telephone Conversations Transcripts. The lexicon contains five tab-separated information fields: * orthographic form in Hangul (head-word), encoded in the KSC-5601 (Wansung) system * orthographic form in Yale romanization * pronunciation * frequency of the word in Korean Telephone Conversations Transcripts * morphological analysis of the word Please follow this link for a sample page from the lexicon: txt | gif.  aContent in Korean.

This edition includes all of the contents in Chinese Gigaword Second Edition (LDC2005T14) as well as new data collected after the publication of that edition. Also, an archive of articles from a new newswire source (Agence France Presse) has been added in the third edition. The four distinct international sources of Chinese newswire included in this edition are the following: * Agence France Presse (afp_cmn) * Central News Agency, Taiwan (cna_cmn) * Xinhua News Agency (xin_cmn) * Zaobao Newspaper (zbn_cmn) The seven-letter codes in the parentheses above are used for the directory names and data files for each source, and are also used (in ALL_CAPS) as part of the unique DOC "id" string assigned to each news article. *Data* The original data archives received by the LDC from Agence France Presse, Xinhua News Agency and Zaobao were encoded in GB-2312, whereas those from Central News Agency (CNA) were encoded in Big-5. To avoid the problems and confusion that could result from differences in character-set specifications, all text files in this corpus have been converted to UTF-8 character encoding. *New in the Third Edition* * Over six years worth of articles (October 2000 through December 2006) from Agence France Presse are being released for the first time. * Two years worth of new articles (January 2005 through December 2006) have been added to the Xinhua data set. * Nearly two years worth of content was added to the CNA data set. There was a gap in the LDC's collection from this source during 2006: no CNA Chinese content was collected between July 27 and December 17 2006, inclusive, so there are no data files for August through November of that year, and the December data file is about half its expected size. * A small set of older stories (October through December 1998) have been added from Zaobao; these were previously published by LDC as part of TDT3 Multilanguage Text Version 2.0 (LDC2001T58) and are being included in Gigaword for the first time.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

All children -- approximately 100 children at each grade level -- read approximately 60 items from a total list of 319 phonetically-balanced but simple words, sentences or digit strings. Each utterance of spontaneous speech begins with a recitation of the alphabet and contains a monologue of about one minute in duration. This release consists of 1017 files containing approximately 8-10 minutes of speech per speaker. Corresponding word-level transcriptions are also included. This corpus was developed to facilitate research about the characteristics of children's speech at different ages and to train and evaluate recognizers for use in language training and other interactive tasks involving children, including to train recognizers used in language development with deaf children. *Data* Data collection was performed using the CSLU Speech Toolkit and two computers running Windows NT 4.0. Each computer was manned by a CSLU staff member who monitored progress and helped the child with any difficulties. The average time at the computer was 20 minutes, yielding approximately 8-10 minutes of speech digitized at 16 bits and 16kHz using Soundblaster 16 PnP audio cards with head-mounted microphones. The prompted speech, consisting of 200 isolated words and 10 numeric strings, was presented as text appearing below an animated character that produced accurate visible speech synchronized with recorded prompts. A text prompt was also displayed. The child then reproduced the prompted word. Once the prompted speech collection was completed, the experimenter then asked the subject a series of questions designed to elicit spontaneous speech (i.e "Tell me about your favorite movie").  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishxData processingvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aShobaki, Khaldoun10aHosom, John-Paul10aCole, Ronald Allan403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007S1805814nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245003400177264007300211336003800284336002600322337002600348338003200374500001500406500004500421506005100466520445400517520005104971546005805022650002905080650004005109650004905149655002005198700001705218856014905235856006805384m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2007    pau        u        ara d  a15856346038 aLDC2007T408 aISLRN: 769-869-926-619-30 aarabeng07aarbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aArabic Gigaword Third Edition  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2007]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2007T40  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007T401 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aArabic Gigaword Third Edition is a comprehensive archive of newswire text data acquired from Arabic news sources by the LDC at the University of Pennsylvania. Arabic Gigaword Third Edition includes all of the content of Arabic Gigaword Second Edition (LDC2006T02) as well as new data collected after the publication of that edition. Also, an archive from a new newswire source -- Assabah -- has been included in the third editon. The six distinct sources of Arabic newswire represented in the third edition are: * Agence France Presse (afp_arb) * Assabah (asb_arb) * Al Hayat (hyt_arb) * An Nahar (nhr_arb) * Ummah Press (umh_arb) * Xinhua News Agency (xin_arb) The seven-character codes in the parantheses above consist of the three-character source name IDs and the three-character language code ("arb") separated by an underscore ("_") character. The epochs and document counts for the data in the third edition are set forth below: Newly Added Data Source Date Span Document Count Agence France Presse 2005.01 - 2006.12 137815 Assabah News Agency 2004.09 - 2006.12 15410 (new source) Al Hayat News Agency 2005.01 - 2006.1 8799 (no data for 2004) An Nahar News Agency 2005.01 - 2006.12 104950 (no data for 2004) Xinhua News Agency 2005.01 - 2006.12 135472 *Data* This release contains 547 files, totalling approximately 1.8GB in compressed form (6,673 MB uncompressed) and 1,994,735 K-words.

Certain data and formatting issues observed in previous releases of Arabic Gigaword have been normalized in the third edition: * Approximately 15,000 stories from older AFP files (1994 - 2002) contained very brief documents where the text content was not recognized as such; in those cases, the TEXT element appeared empty while the HEADLINE element contained anywhere from three to several lines of text. The content of these documents has been rearranged. The first line remains as the headline and the rest of the lines have been moved into the text segment. All stories of this sort had been originally classified as "other", and that classification has not been changed in this edition. * Al Hayat data from 2002 and 2003 contained some Arabic-Indic digits, despite the intention to convert all digit strings to the ASCII digit characters for consistency. The digits have now been converted to the ASCII range. For more details about the encoding challenges presented by this data, see the readme file accompanying this corpus. * Some Al Hayat data had stray angle-bracket characters (""), which have been rendered as "". There were also some defective "Doc-ID" strings (the 'id' attribute in the "" tag that begins each news story) in the January 2001 data. * Some An Nahar data had "bare" ampersand characters ("&") which have been rendered as "&". * Some Xinhua documents included empty sub-elements (HEADLINE, DATELINE and/or TEXT sections containing no data); when HEADLINE or DATELINE were empty, these tags were removed. When the TEXT segment was empty, the document as a whole was removed. * In several Xinhua stories, the Doc-ID string, which is supposed to provide the year, month, date and sequence number for the story, had become garbled, yielding an incorrect or impossible date string. A separate data file in the "docs" directory, called "docid_changes.txt", lists the changes in document inventory and Doc-ID strings. * Xinhua stories typically end with a formulaic Arabic string (meaning "end-of-story"), which should not have been included as part of the final paragraph in each story. * In general, consistent line-wrapping was applied to make the overall text presentation consistent across all sources and with Gigaword releases in other languages. The markup pattern was also applied consistently for all sources without exception.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

The corpus contains additional language resources for the Hungarian text, including a monolingual corpus, morphological toolset and aligner. Hungarian-English Parallel Text, Version 1.0 is a joint work of the Media Research and Education Center at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BUTE) and the Corpus Linguistics Department at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Institute of Linguistics. Additional information about this release is available from the corpus website maintained by BUTE. *File formats, character encoding* This publication is issued on CD as a tarred zip file. Commonly available utilities such as Gnu Zip or Stuffit will readily extract this publication from its compressed form. Sentence pair (.bi) files consist of tab-separated, matching sentence pairs. The .bi files do not contain segments where deletion or contraction occurred. They are also filtered based on quality, so the full reconstruction of the raw texts is impossible. Some .bi files were shuffled (sorted alphabetically). Alignment "ladder" (.lad) files preserve the whole of both input texts with ordering, even those segments that were not successfully aligned. In .lad files, every line is tab-separated into two columns. The first is a segment of the Hungarian text. The second is a (supposedly corresponding) segment of the English text. Such segments of the source or target text will generally consist of exactly one sentence on both sides, but can also consist of zero, or more than one, sentence. In the latter case, the special separating token " ~~~ " is placed between sentences. The encoding of the sentence pair and the alignment files is mixed: ISO Latin-2 on the Hungarian side, and ISO Latin-1 on the English side. The overwhelming majority of the texts use compatible subsets of these two encodings, so for viewing, the files can be considered ISO Latin-2 encoded. hu and en are the raw texts used, in ISO Latin-2 and ISO Latin-1 encoding respectively.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Hungarian.

Blogs are posts to informal web-based journals of varying topical content. GALE Phase 1 Arabic Blog Parallel Text was prepared by the LDC and consists of 102K words (222 files) of Arabic blog text and its English translation from thirty-three sources. This release was used as training data in Phase 1 of the DARPA-funded GALE program. LDC has released the following GALE Phase 1 & 2 Arabic Parallel Text data sets: * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 1 (LDC2007T24) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 2 (LDC2008T09) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Blog Parallel Text (LDC2008T02) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 1 (LDC2009T03) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 2 (LDC2009T09) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 1 (LDC2012T06) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 2 (LDC2012T14) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Newswire Parallel Text (LDC2012T17) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text (LDC2012T18) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Web Parallel Text (LDC2013T01) *Source Data* The task of preparing this corpus involved four stages of work: data scouting, data harvesting, formatting, and data selection. Data scouting involved manually searching the web for suitable blog text. Data scouts were assigned particular topics and genres along with a production target in order to focus their web search. Formal annotation guidelines and a customized annotation toolkit helped data scouts to manage the search process and to track progress. Data scouts logged their decisions about potential text of interest (sites, threads and posts) to a database. A nightly process queried the annotation database and harvested all designated URLs. Whenever possible, the entire site was downloaded, not just the individual thread or post located by the data scout. Once the text was downloaded, its format was standardized (by running various scripts) so that the data could be more easily integrated into downstream annotation processes. Original-format versions of each document were also preserved. Typically a new script was required for each new domain name that was identified. After scripts were run, an optional manual process corrected any remaining formatting problems. The selected documents were then reviewed for content suitability using a semi-automatic process. A statistical approach was used to rank a documents relevance to a set of already-selected documents labeled as good. An annotator then reviewed the list of relevance-ranked documents and selected those which were suitable for a particular annotation task or for annotation in general. Those newly-judged documents in turn provided additional input for the generation of new ranked lists. Manual sentence units/segments (SU) annotation was also performed on a subset of files following LDCs Quick Rich Transcription specification. Three types of end of sentence SU are identified: - statement SU - question SU - incomplete SU *Translation* After files were selected, they were reformatted into a human-readable translation format, and the files were then assigned to professional translators for careful translation. Translators followed LDCs GALE Translation guidelines, which describe the makeup of the translation team, the source, data format, the translation data format, best practices for translating certain linguistic features (such as names and speech disfluencies), and quality control procedures applied to completed translations. Translators were instructed to return a 50-sentence sample as soon as it was completed. The sample was reviewed by LDCs bilingual language specialists. Subsequent deliveries were subject to quality controls as described in the translation guidelines. Low quality translations were returned to the translators for revision. TDF Format All final data are in Tab Delimited Format (TDF). TDF is compatible with other transcription formats, such as the Transcriber format and AG format, and it is easy to process. Each line of a TDF file corresponds to a speech segment and contains 13 tab delimited fields: field data_type ----- --------- 1 file unicode 2 channel int 3 start float 4 end float 5 speaker unicode 6 speakerType unicode 7 speakerDialect unicode 8 transcript unicode 9 section int 10 turn int 11 segment int 12 sectionType unicode 13 suType unicode A source TDF file and its translation are the same except that the transcript in the source TDF is replaced by its English translation. Encoding All data are encoded in UTF8. *Sponsorship* This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

The kind of information recognized and extracted from text includes entities, values, temporal expressions, relations and events. SpatialML is a mark-up language for representing spatial expressions in natural language documents. SpatialML's focus is primarily on geography and culturally-relevant landmarks, rather than biology, cosmology, geology, or other regions of the spatial language domain. The goal is to allow for potentially better integration of text collections with resources such as databases that provide spatial information about a domain, including gazetteers, physical feature databases and mapping services. In ACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations, the authors applied SpatialML tags to the English training data (originally annotated for entities, relations and events) in ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus, LDC2006T06. (NOTE: 2005 ACE training data and evaluation data were distributed as e-corpora (LDC2005E18, LDC2005E23) to participants in the 2005 ACE evaluation. Some of the files in ACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations may originate from one of those e-corpora, not from LDC2006T06). The SpatialML annotation scheme is intended to emulate earlier progress on time expressions such as TIMEX2, TimeML and the 2005 ACE guidelines. The main SpatialML tag is the PLACE tag. The central goal of SpatialML is to map PLACE information in text to data from gazetteers and other databases to the extent possible. Therefore, semantic attributes such as country abbreviations, country subdivision and dependent area abbreviations (e.g., US states), and geo-coordinates are used to help establish such a mapping. LINK and PATH tags express relations between places, such as inclusion relations and trajectories of various kinds. Information in the tag along with the tagged location string should be sufficient to uniquely determine the mapping, when such a mapping is possible. This also means that redundant information is not included in the tag. To the extent possible, SpatialML leverages ISO and other standards towards the goal of making the scheme compatible with existing and future corpora. The SpatialML guidelines are compatible with existing guidelines for spatial annotation and existing corpora within the ACE research program. In particular, the English Annotation Guidelines for Entities (Version 5.6.6 2006.08.01) were exploited, specifically the GPE, Location, and Facility entity tags, and the Physical relation tags, all of which are mapped to SpatialML tags. Ideas were also borrowed from Toponym Resolution Markup Language of Leidner (2006), the research of Schilder et al. (2004) and the annotation scheme in Garbin and Mani (2005). Information recorded in the annotation is compatible with the feature types in the Alexandria Digital Library. This corpus also leverages the integrated gazetteer database (IGDB) of Mardis and Burger (2005). Last but not least, this annotation scheme can be related to the Geography Markup Language (GML) defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), as well as Google Earth's Keyhole Markup Language (KML), to express geographical features. SpatialML goes beyond these schemes, however, in terms of providing a richer markup for natural language that includes semantic features and relationships that allow mapping to existing resources such as gazetteers. Such a markup can be useful for (i) disambiguation, (ii) integration with mapping services, and (iii) spatial reasoning. In relation to (iii), it is possible to use spatial reasoning not only for integration with applications, but for better information extraction, e.g., for disambiguating a place name based on the locations of other place names in the document. SpatialML goes to some length to represent topological relationships among places, derived from the RCC8 Calculus (Randell et al. 1992, Cohn et al. 1997). Addtional information about SpatialML is contained in the paper "SpatialML: Annotation Scheme for Marking Spatial Expressions in Natural Lanugage," which is included in the online documentation for this corpus.

The goal of the project is to annotate a large corpus comprising various genres of text (news, conversational telephone speech, weblogs, use net, broadcast, talk shows) in three languages (English, Chinese, and Arabic) with structural information (syntax and predicate argument structure) and shallow semantics (word sense linked to an ontology and coreference). OntoNotes Release 2.0 is a continuation of the OntoNotes project and is supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Contract No. HR0011-06-C-0022. OntoNotes Release 1.0 (LDC2007T21) contains 400k words of Chinese newswire data (from Xinhua News Agency and Sinorama Magazine) and 300k words of English newswire data (from the Wall Street Journal). OntoNotes Release 2.0 adds the following to the corpus: 274k words of Chinese broadcast news data (from China Broadcating System, China Central TV, China National Radio, China Television System and Voice of America); and 200k words of English broadcast news data (from ABC, CNN, NBC, Public Radio International and Voice of America). Natural language applications like machine translation, question answering, and summarization currently are forced to depend on impoverished text models like bags of words or n-grams, while the decisions that they are making ought to be based on the meanings of those words in context. That lack of semantics causes problems throughout the applications. Misinterpreting the meaning of an ambiguous word results in failing to extract data, incorrect alignments for translation, and ambiguous language models. Incorrect coreference resolution results in missed information (because a connection is not made) or incorrectly conflated information (due to false connections). OntoNotes builds on two time-tested resources, following the Penn Treebank for syntax and the Penn PropBank for predicate-argument structure. Its semantic representation will include word sense disambiguation for nouns and verbs, with each word sense connected to an ontology, and coreference. The current goals call for annotation of over a million words each of English and Chinese, and half a million words of Arabic over five years. The authors wish to make this resource available to the natural language research community so that decoders for these phenomena can be trained to generate the same structure in new documents. Lessons learned over the years have shown that the quality of annotation is crucial if it is going to be used for training machine learning algorithms. Taking this cue, each layer of annotation in OntoNotes will have at least 90% inter-annotator agreement. Pilot studies have shown that predicate structure, word sense, ontology linking, and coreference can all be annotated rapidly and with better than 90% consistency.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English and Mandarin Chinese.

The goal of the project is to annotate the 1 million word Wall Street Journal corpus in Treebank-2 (LDC95T7) with discourse relations holding between the eventualities and propositions mentioned in text, which serve as the arguments to the relation. Discourse relations are assumed to have exactly two arguments. PDTB, version 2.0. is a continuation of PDTB, version 1.0. (made available freely in 2006 but no longer available). Following a lexically grounded approach to annotation, the PDTB annotates relations realized explicitly by Explicit connectives drawn from syntactically well-defined classes, as well as relations between adjacent sentences when no Explicit connective appears to relate the two. Arguments of relations are annotated in each case. For Explicit connectives, arguments are unconstrained in terms of their distance from the connective and can be found anywhere in the text. Between adjacent sentences where no Explicit connective appears, four scenarios hold: (a) the sentences may be related by a discourse relation that has no realization in the second sentence, in which case a connective (called an Implicit connective) is provided to express the inferred relation (b) the sentences may be related by a discourse relation that is realized by some alternative non-connective expression, in which case these alternative lexicalizations are annotated as the carriers of the relation (labelled as AltLex) (c) the sentences may be related not by a discourse relation, but merely by an entity-based coherence relation, in which case the presence of such a relation is labelled (as EntRel) and (d) the sentences may not be related at all, in which case they are labelled as such (NoRel). In addition to the argument structure of relations, the PDTB provides (a) sense annotations for each discourse relation while also capturing the polysemy of connectives, and (b) attribution annotations of relations and each of their arguments, with each instance of attribution providing the corresponding text span along with four features to capture the semantic contribution of the attribution. Both sense and attribution annotations are provided for Explicit, Implicit, and AltLex relations, but not for EntRel and NoRel. The lexically grounded approach in the PDTB exposes a clearly defined level of discourse structure which will support the extraction of a range of inferences associated with discourse connectives. To date, the PDTB group has carried out various experiments on the corpus, particularly examining the following issues: * alignment between syntax and discourse, particularly with regards to attribution * sense disambiguation of discourse connectives * complexity of dependencies in discourse The annotations in Penn Discourse Treebank Version 2.0 are linked to the Penn Treebank. The PDTB group will continue to explore these issues and to focus on more extended projects such as discourse parsing, automatic summarization, and natural language generation. Further work will also explore foundational issues in discourse. PDTB, version 2.0. annotates 40600 discourse relations, distributed into the following five types: * 18459 Explicit Relations * 16053 Implicit Relations * 624 Alternative Lexicalizations * 5210 Entity Relations * 254 No Relations  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aDiscourse analysisvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aPrasad, Rashmi10aLee, Alan10aDinesh, Nikhil10aMiltsakaki, Eleni10aCampion, Geraud10aJoshi, Aravind10aWebber, Bonnie403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T0504745nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090042000700119245001800126264007300144336003800217336003300255337002600288338003200314500001500346500004500361506005100406520345000457520005103907546004203958650006604000650004204066650004504108655002804153700002104181856014904202856006804351m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2008    pau        u        eng d8 aLDC2008S038 aISLRN: 493-213-123-848-0  adc00aSTC-TIMIT 1.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2008]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2008S03  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008S031 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aSTC-TIMIT 1.0 is a telephone version of TIMIT Acoustic Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus, LDC93S1 (TIMIT). TIMIT contains broadband recordings of 630 speakers of eight major dialects of American English reading ten phonetically rich sentences. Created in 1993, TIMIT was designed to provide speech data for acoustic-phonetic studies and for the development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems. Since that time, several corpora have been developed using the TIMIT database: NTIMIT, LDC93S2 (transmitting TIMIT recordings through a telephone handset and over various channels in the NYNEX telephone network and redigitizing them); CTIMIT, LDC96S30 (passing TIMIT files through cellular telephone circuits); FFMTIMIT, LDC96S32 (re-recording TIMIT files with a free-field microphone); and HTIMIT, LDC98S67 (re-recording a subset of TIMIT files through different telephone handsets). What differentiates STC-TIMIT 1.0 from other TIMIT-derived corpora is that the entire TIMIT database was passed through an actual telephone channel in a single call. Thus, a single type of channel distortion and noise affect the whole database. The process was managed using a Dialogic switchboard for the calling and receiving ends. No transducer (microphone) was employed; the original digital signal was converted to analog using the switchboard's A/D converter, transmitted trough a telephone channel and converted back to digital format before recording. As a result, the only distortion introduced is that of the telephone channel itself. The STC-TIMIT 1.0 database is organized in the same manner as in the original TIMIT corpus: 4620 files belonging to the training partition and 1680 files belonging to the test partition. Files were recorded using 8kHz sampling frequency and muLaw encoding. Additionally four sets of two calibration tones were generated. These were passed through the telephone line approximately at the start of every 1/4th of the whole database (both the source and recorded calibration tones in each set are provided). Calibration tones are: * 2 sec. 1kHz tone * 2 sec. sweep tone from 10 Hz to 4000 Hz. Utterances in STC-TIMIT 1.0 are time-aligned with those of TIMIT with an average precision of 0.125 ms (1 sample), by maximizing the cross-correlation between pairs of files from each corpus. Thus, labels from TIMIT may be used for STC-TIMIT 1.0, and the effects of telephone channels may be studied on a frame-by-frame basis. *Data* Originally a single wav file was created by concatenation of all files in the TIMIT database. This file was downsampled to 8kHz and compressed using muLaw encoding. Two telephone lines within the same building were connected to a Dialogic(R) card. One of the lines was used as the calling-end and played the speech file, while the other line was used as the receiving-end and recorded the new signal. The whole recording process was conducted in a single call. Incoming speech was recorded using 8kHz sampling frequency and muLaw encoding. After recording, the file was pre-cut according to the length of the corresponding TIMIT database file. Each resulting file was then aligned to its corresponding file in TIMIT using the xcorr routine in Matlab(R). Based on these results, the recorded file was sliced again from the original recorded file using the newly-generated alignments. Thus, each file in STC-TIMIT 1.0 is aligned to its equivalent in TIMIT and has the same length.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishxData processingvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aMorales, Nicolas403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008S0304225nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041002800152042000700180245004400187264007300231336003800304336002600342337002600368338003200394500001500426500004500441506005100486520278100537520005103318546007103369650004203440650003903482650005403521655002003575700001503595700002403610856014903634856006803783m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2008    pau        u        eng d  a15856346978 aLDC2008T068 aISLRN: 160-931-786-050-60 aengachibeng07aengacmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 1 Chinese Blog Parallel Text  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2008]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2008T06  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T061 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aBlogs are posts to informal web-based journals of varying topical content. GALE Phase 1 Chinese Blog Parallel Text was prepared by the LDC and consists of 313K characters (277 files) of Chinese blog text and its translation selected from eight sources. This release was used as training data in Phase 1 of the DARPA-funded GALE program. *Source Data* Preparing the source data involved four stages of work: data scouting, data harvesting, formatting, and data selection. Data scouting involved manually searching the web for suitable blog text. Data scouts were assigned particular topics and genres along with a production target in order to focus their web search. Formal annotation guidelines and a customized annotation tooklit helped data scouts to manage the search process and to track progress. Data scouts logged their decisions about potential text of interest (sites, threads and posts) to a database. A nightly process queried the annotation database and harvested all designated URLs. Whenever possible, the entire site was downloaded, not just the individual thread or post located by the data scout. Once the text was downloaded, its format was standardized (by running various scripts) so that the data could be more easily integrated into downstream annotation processes. Original-format versions of each document were also preserved. Typically, a new script was required for each new domain name that was identified. After scripts were run, an optional manual process corrected any remaining formatting problems. The selected documents were then reviewed for content-suitability using a semi-automatic process. A statistical approach was used to rank a document's relevance to a set of already-selected documents labeled as "good." An annotator then reviewed the list of relevance-ranked documents and selected those which were suitable for a particular annotation task or for annotation in general. These newly-judged documents in turn provided additional input for the generation of new ranked lists. Manual sentence units/segments (SU) annotation was also performed on a subset of files following LDC's Quick Rich Transcription specification. Three types of end of sentence SU were identified: * statement SU * question SU * incomplete SU *Translation* After files were selected, they were reformatted into a human-readable translation format, and the files were then assigned to professional translators for careful translation. Translators followed LDC's GALE Translation guidelines, which describe the makeup of the translation team, the source data format, the translation data format, best practices for translating certain linguistic features (such as names and speech disfluencies), and quality control procedures applied to completed translations.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English and Mandarin Chinese.

It consists of 599 distinct newswire stories from the Lebanese publication An Nahar with part-of-speech (POS), morphology, gloss and syntactic treebank annotation in accordance with the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) Guidelines developed in 2008 and 2009. This release represents a significant revision of LDCs previous ATB3 publications: Arabic Treebank: Part 3 v 1.0 LDC2004T11 and Arabic Treebank: Part 3 (full corpus) v 2.0 (MPG + Syntactic Analysis LDC2005T20. The ongoing PATB project supports research in Arabic-language natural language processing and human language technology development. The methodology and work leading to the release of this publication are described in detail in the documentation accompanying this corpus and in two research papers, Enhancing the Arabic Treebank: A Collaborative Effort toward New Annotation Guidelines and Consistent and Flexible Integration of Morphological Annotation in the Arabic Treebank. *Data* ATB3 v 3.2 contains a total of 339,710 tokens before clitics are split, and 402,291 tokens after clitics are separated for the treebank annotation. This release includes all files that were previously made available to the DARPA GALE program community (Arabic Treebank Part 3 - Version 3.1, LDC2008E22). A number of inconsistencies in the 3.1 release data have been corrected here. These include changes to certain POS tags with the resulting tree changes. As a result, additional clitics have been separated, and some previously incorrectly split tokens have now been merged. One file from ATB3 v 2.0, ANN20020715.0063, has been removed from this corpus as that text is an exact duplicate of another file in this release (ANN20020715.0018). This reduces the number of files from 600 files in ATB3 v 2.0 to 599 files in ATB 3 v 3.2. *Sponsorship* This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

Hindi, a member of the Indo-Iranian language family, is the primary national language of India and is spoken by approximately 500 million people making it the fifth largest language in the world. Inspired by the well-known English language Wordnet, Hindi Wordnet is the first wordnet for an Indian language. Wordnets are systems for analyzing the different lexical and semantic relations between words. Specifically, a wordnet is a word sense network in which words are grouped into sematically equivalent units called synsets. Each synset represents a lexical concept, and synsets are linked to each other by semantic relations (between synsets) and lexical relations (between words). Similar in design to the Princeton Wordnet for English, Hindi Wordnet incorporates additional features to capture the complexities of Hindi. This release of Hindi Wordnet consists of 56,928 unique words and 26,208 synsets. Additional information about the development of Hindi Wordnet is available at the Hindi WordNet web site. *Data* Hindi WordNet contains nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Each entry consists of the following elements: * Synset: a set of synonymous words. For example, ?विद्यालय, पाठशाला, स्कूल? (vidyaalay, paaThshaalaa, skuul) represents the concept of school as an educational institution. The words in the synset are arranged according to the frequency of usage. * Gloss: the concept. It consists of two parts: Text definition: It explains the concept denoted by the synset. For example, ?वह स्थान जहाँ प्राथमिक या माध्यमिक स्तर की औपचारिक शिक्षा दी जाती है? (vah sthaan jahaaM praathamik yaa maadhyamik star kii aupacaarik sikshaa dii jaatii hai) explains the concept of school as an educational institution. Example sentence: It gives the usage of the words in the sentence. Generally, the words in a synset are replaceable in the sentence. For example,"इस विद्यालय में पहली से पाँचवीं तक की शिक्षा दी जाती है? (is vidyaalay me pahalii se pancvii tak kii shikshaa dii jaatii hai) gives the usage for the words in the synset representing schoolas an educational institution. * Position in Ontology: An ontology is a hierarchical organization of concepts, or more specifically, a categorization of entities and actions. A separate ontological hierarchy exists for each syntactic category (noun, verb, adjective adverb). Each synset is mapped into some place in the ontology.. This release of Hindi WordNet is made available as a complete Java application along with an API to facilitate further development.  aContent in Hindi.

The U.S. government uses such systems to provide speech-recognition enhanced language learning courseware to government linguists and students enrolled in various government language programs. The data in this corpus was collected in March 1999 in Brasilia, Brazil using informants from a Brazilian military academy. The corpus consists of read speech from 60 female and 68 male native and non-native speakers. The speech was elicited from a prompt script containing 296 sentences and phrases typically used in language learning situations. The prompts are listed in the file prompts.txt. Each line of this file has two fields separated by a tab: the first field denotes the base name of the waveform file; and the second field denotes the prompt used to record the utterance. A pronouncing dictionary developed by Dr. Sheila Ackerlind with help from cadet Sterling Packer is provided in the file SANTIAGO.txt. The speech was collected using four laptop computers running MS Windows. Three of the computers recorded with a 16 bit data size and sampling rate of 22050 Hz, the other laptop recorded with an 8 bit data size at a sampling rate of 11025 Hz. The recording script presented a visual display of the sentence to be recorded. The informant pressed a key and spoke the sentence. The recording was played back for review, allowing the utterance to be re-recorded. A member of the data collection team was present during the recording session to verify recordings and to provide technical assistance in case of malfunctioning equipment.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Portuguese.

The goal of the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE) is to establish the baseline of current performance capability for language recognition of conversational telephone speech and to lay the groundwork for further research efforts in the field. NIST conducted two previous evaluations in 1996 and 2003. For the 2005 LRE, the emphasis was on research directed toward a general base of technology to be ported to various language recognition tasks with minimum effort and the development of the ability to make more difficult discriminations between similar languages and dialects of the same language. That focus augmented the traditional evaluation goals, those being: * to drive the technology forward * to measure the state-of-the-art * to find the most promising algorithmic approaches The task evaluated was the detection of a given target language or dialect. From a test segment of speech and a target language or dialect, the system to be evaluated determined whether the speech was from the target language or dialect. The evaluation consisted of speech from the following languages and dialects: * English (American) * English (Indian) * Hindi * Japanese * Korean * Mandarin (Mainland) * Mandarin (Taiwan) * Spanish (Mexican) * Tamil The 2005 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation Plan, which includes a description of the evaluation tasks, is included with this release. Further information regarding this evaluation is also available at the NIST Language Recognition Evaluation website. *Data* Each speech file is one side of a "4-wire" telephone conversation represented as 8-bit 8 kHz mulaw data. There are 11,106 speech files in sphere (.sph) format for a total of 73.2 hours of speech. The speech data was compiled from LDC's CALLFRIEND corpora and from data collected by Oregon Health and Science University, Beaverton, Oregon. Each test segment was prepared using an automatic speech activity detection algorithm to identify areas and durations of speech. The test segments were stored in SPHERE file format, one segment per file. Unlike previous evaluations, areas of silence were not removed from the segments. Segments were chosen to contain a specified approximate duration of actual speech. Auxiliary information was included in the SPHERE headers to document the source file, start time, and duration of all excerpts that were used to construct the segment. The test segments contain three nominal durations of speech: 3 seconds, 10 seconds, and 30 seconds. Actual speech durations vary, but were constrained to be within the ranges of 2-4 seconds, 7-13 seconds, and 25-35 seconds, respectively. Note that this refers to duration of actual speech contained in segments as determined by the speech activity detection algorithm; signal durations in general are longer due to areas of silence in the segments. Shorter speech duration test segments are subsets of longer speech duration test segments; i.e., each 10-second test segment is a subset of a corresponding 30-second test segment, and each 3-second test segment is a subset of a corresponding 10-second segment. Performance was evaluated separately for test segments of each duration. NIST recommends using data from the 1996 and 2003 evaluations as development data. This data may be found in 2003 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation, LDC2006S31. Because the 1996 and 2003 evaluations did not cover Indian-accented English, this release includes a development data set of Indian-accented English.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Tamil, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese.

Alphadigit Version 1.3 is a collection of 78,044 utterances from 3,025 speakers saying six-digit strings of letters and digits over the telephone for a total of approximately 82 hours of speech. Each speech file has corresponding orthographic and phonemic transcriptions. This corpus was created by the Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU), Oregon Health & Science University, Beaverton, Oregon. *Data* Speakers were recruited using USEnet postings. Respondents registered for the collection by completing an online form. Once registered, they received a list of 18-29 six-digit strings (e.g., "a 2 b 4 5 g") and participation instructions. Speakers called the CSLU data collection system by dialing a toll-free number and were prompted for each string; 1102 different strings were used throughout the course of the data collection. The lists were set up to balance for phonetic context between all letter and digit pairs. The data were recorded directly from a digital phone line without digital-to-analog or analog-to-digital conversion at the recording end using the CSLU T1 digital data collection system. The sampling rate was 8khz and the files were stored in 8-bit mu-law format on a UNIX file system. The files have been converted to RIFF standard file format, 16-bit linearly encoded. *Transcription* All of the files included in this corpus have corresponding non-time-aligned word-level transcriptions and time aligned phoneme-level transcriptions (automatic forced alignment) that comply with the conventions in the CSLU Labeling Guide. Non time-aligned orthographic transcriptions provide quick access to the content of an utterance; they may contain markers for word boundaries to support access and retrieval at the lexical level. Phonetic/phonemic transcriptions represent the phonetic content of an utterance at a given level of detail that is made explicit by the use of diacritics. Phonetic phenomena transcribed include excessive nasalization, glottalization, frication on a stop, centralization, lateralization, rounding and palatalization.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aCole, Ronald Allan10aNoel, M.10aLander, T.10aDurham, T.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008S0608410nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041002800134041004800162042000700210245004200217264007300259336003800332336002600370337002600396338003200422500001500454500004500469506005100514520707700565520005107642546013407693655002007827700002007847856014907867856006808016m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2008    pau        u        yor d  a15856350068 aLDC2008L038 aISLRN: 973-344-578-516-80 ayoracpeaengaspabeng07ayoratrfaluqagulaengaspabeng2iso639-3  adc00aGlobal Yoruba Lexical Database v. 1.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2008]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2008L03  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008L031 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe Global Yoruba Lexical Database v. 1.0 is a set of related dictionaries providing definitions and translations for over 450,000 words from the Yoruba language and its variants: Standard Yoruba (over 368,000 words), Gullah (over 3,600 words), Lucumí (over 8,000 words) and Trinidadian (over 1,000 words). Yoruba is a Niger-Congo language (sub classification: Kwa > Yoruboid) spoken natively by nearly 20 million people, the vast majority of them in southwestern Nigeria. There are also approximately a half million Yoruba speakers in Benin, as well as speakers in Togo and Ghana and among the emigrant populations in the United States and the United Kingdom. In addition, roughly two million people in Nigeria speak Yoruba as a second language. The Yoruba language diaspora is wide, stretching from southwestern Nigeria and Benin westward to the Caribbean and islands along the southeastern United States coast. Yoruba and other African dialects arrived in the Americas and the Caribbean as a consequence of the Atlantic slave trade. Throughout the region, Yoruba dialects blended with each other and with languages like Spanish and French to form a variety of creoles such as Gullah in the United States and Nagô in Brazil. Many of those creoles have become the language of liturgy and music in Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, Trinidad, Jamaica and parts of the United States and Canada. The ultimate goal of this dictionary is to provide coverage for all Yoruba dialects across the globe. For that reason, it will continue to be a work in progress. The current standard orthography is tone-driven. Yoruba has three tones: a high tone, a middle tone and a low tone. Each syllable in a Yoruban word must have at least one tone and long vowels may have two tones. While there are no explicit rising or falling tones, combinations of the languages three basic tones may produce the same effect. Grammatically, Yoruba is a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) language. Verbs have no infinitive forms, past or present tense and typically have only a single syllable. Discrete auxiliary words provide information on the verb tense. Nor do Yoruba nouns have plural or singular form their number derives from the context in which the word occurs. The Yoruba dialect continuum consists of over fifteen varieties, with considerable phonological and lexical differences among them and some grammatical ones as well. Peripheral areas of dialectal regions often have some similarities to adjoining dialects. Standard Yoruba is a koine used for education, writing, broadcasting, and contact between speakers of different dialects. It is also called Literary Yoruba, common Yoruba, or simply Yoruba without qualification. Though in large part based on the Ò?yò? and Ibadan dialects, it incorporates several features from other dialects and has a simplified vowel harmony system and some other features not found in other Yoruba dialects. *Data * This release encompasses the following languages and dialects: Languages Description Number of words Yoruba->English This dictionary of Standard Yoruba contains detailed lexicographic entries which include the part of speech, the English definition of the Yoruba headword, cross references, examples in English and the morphemic decomposition of the Yoruba headword. 142,389 English->Yoruba This dictionary maps the English headword back to Standard Yoruba and includes the part of speech, Yoruba definition, and morphemic decomposition of the Yoruba word. 226,585 Gullah->English and Yoruba Gullah is a creole spoken in the coastal Low Country of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States. Although the language is no longer spoken to a great extent, its words are still commonly used for personal names and nicknames. The dictionary translates from Gullah headwords to English and to Standard Yoruba. 3,636 Lucumí->Spanish, English and Yoruba Lucumí is the ritual language of the Santeria religion practiced in Cuba. The Lucumí dictionary translates from a Lucumí headword to Cuban Spanish to English to Standard Yoruba. At the time of this publication in 2008, some entries do not have complete translations and only map from Lucumí to Cuban Spanish. 8,075 Trinidadian->English and Yoruba Trinidadian is a creole which blends English, French, Spanish and African languages. The Trinidadian dictionary presents those words that have Yoruban roots and maps from the Trinidadian headword to English and Standard Yoruba. 1,187 The dictionaries in this publication are presented in two formats, Toolbox databases and XML. Short for The Field Linguists Toolbox, Toolbox is a lexicographical database system published by SIL. SIL makes Toolbox freely available for download. In order to use the Global Yoruba Lexical Database v. 1.0, Toolbox must first be installed on the users local computer. The orthography of the text in the databases conforms to that presented to students in the Nigerian school system. The basic Yoruba alphabet is: a b d e e? f g gb h i j k l m n o o? p r s s? t u w y The letter gb is a digraph, two letters that combine to form a single phoneme. In written Yoruba, gb functions as a single letter. In the Toolbox presentation, this has been taken into account and the software sorts the words accordingly in all functions. The XML presentation has been sorted according to the above alphabet but is a static, flat file. For that reason, developers creating applications from the XML files will need to take into account the digraph when writing searching and reporting functions. As Yoruba is a tonal language, the written language uses additional diacritic marks to denote tones. The orthography uses three tones: * Low: denoted with a grave symbol () as in à * Mid: plain letter without diacritics * High: denoted with an acute (´) symbol as in á Both the Toolbox and XML presentations encode the text in Unicode UTF-8 using normalized form C. Unicode normalized forms govern the order in which letters and characters are composed and processed by software systems. Normalized form C is the standard form used by most web systems and is a W3C standard for the web. The Toolbox presentation uses the Aria Unicode MS font for display. The Tahoma and Lucida Grande fonts will also display the Yoruba alphabet under UTF-8 encoding. Since XML only provides information about document structure, fonts are not specified in the XML versions of the dictionaries. Displaying non-Western letters:Windows users will need to install and configure their computers for Extended Language support. To do this, open the Windows Control Panel and click the Regional and Language Options icon. In the Regional and Language Options window that opens, select the Languages pane. Under the Supplemental Language Support section, check both check boxes and click okay.

All of the annotation was based on Penn Treebank II standards, with some modifications for special characteristics of the biomedical text. The entity definitions were developed and revised in an extensive process of interaction between domain experts and biomedically trained annotators. The data was prepared by the Linguistic Data Consortium for the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, with funding from the National Science Foundation under Grant No. ITR EIA-0205448, Information Technology Research (ITR) program, in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals R&D. *Data Description* The corpus contains 1100 PubMed abstracts comprising approximately 313,000 total words of text. Each file has been tokenized and its biomedical portions (274,000 words) exhaustively annotated for paragraph, sentence, and part of speech, and non-exhaustively annotated for 5 types of named entity. Each token has a part-of-speech tag. Tokens and POS tags: Tokens in biomedical and chemical notation and terms, and spelled-out numbers, may contain whitespace and/or punctuation ("beta, 20 diol", "(Na+ + K+)ATPase", "two hundred seven"); and named entity mentions may comprise several tokens ("polychlorinated biphenyl preparations"). Tokens and entities do not span sentence boundaries. Biomedical and non-biomedical text: The title and body of each abstract are considered to be biomedical text, and the automatic and manual annotations in them have been extensively curated. Everything else, such as citation information and author names, is considered non-biomedical; this has not been entity annotated, and its automated tokenization and part of speech tags have not been curated and are known to be unreliable. In non-biomedical text, the tag "section" is used instead of "sentence", allowing users to include or exclude these parts. There are approximately 327,000 words of biomedical text and 39,000 words of non-biomedical text. *Principles and Methods* Many annotation projects start with an already annotated corpus, such as the Penn Treebank or the Brown Corpus, which is treated as unchangeable. As a result, annotation practices have sometimes involved compromises which might not have been necessary if the earlier annotation had been able to integrate the requirements of the later work. Such integration is necessary here because of the scope of this project, involving highly technical biomedical texts, entity definitions driven by the needs of biomedical research, and the goal of making the annotation layers work together as much as possible, e.g., using entity information in the treebank annotation of prenominal modifiers. Such integration is also possible given the relatively long term of the grant (five years) and because researchers were starting with fresh text, applying all layers of annotation themselves. The texts are annotated at the following layers: * Paragraph * Sentence * Biomedical entity * Token and part of speech * Syntax (treebanking) (some texts only) * Semantic relations Paragraph, sentence, tokenization, POS, and syntactic annotation (treebanking) are applied by automatic taggers and manually corrected ; entity annotation is manual. The authors originally used a POS tagger trained on Penn Treebank data, which made many errors on the very different text of these biomedical abstracts. When there was enough manually-corrected data to train a tagger, overall accuracy rose from 88.53% to 97.33% (Kulick et al. 2004 (slides)). Annotation at all layers except entity is based on the Penn Treebank II guidelines, with a number of modifications that have been found necessary, many of which were subsequently adopted by the Penn Treebank. Entity definitions came originally from domain experts and were developed and refined in dialogue with the annotators. All annotation is standoff: the source text is never modified, annotations being made in a separate file.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aMedicinevTerminologyvDatabases. 0aMedicinexAbstracting and indexingvDatabases. 0aMedicinexData processingvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aLiberman, Mark10aMandel, Mark10aGlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals R&D403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T2007088nmm a22003373i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245004500141264007300186336003800259336002600297337002600323338003200349500001500381500004500396506005100441520582800492546004206320650005006362650004206412655002006454700002006474700002106494700001806515856014906533856006806682m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2008    pau        u        eng d  a15856348168 aLDC2008T138 aISLRN: 377-937-743-934-7  adc00aBLLIP North American News Text, Complete  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2008]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2008T13  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T131 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aBrown Laboratory for Linguistic Information Processing (BLLIP) North American News Text, Complete, LDC2008T13, isbn 1-58563-482-4, contains a Penn Treebank-style parsing of approximately 24 million sentences from the North American News Text Corpus (LDC95T21). The North American News Text Corpus consists of English news text from the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post (1994-1997), the New York Times (1994-1996), Reuters News Service (1994-1996) and the Wall Street Journal (1994-1996). BLLIP North American News Text is released in two versions: BLLIP North American News Text, Complete (LDC2008T13), a members-only corpus that contains sentences from all sources in The North American News Text Corpus; and BLLIP North American News Text, General Release (LDC2008T14), a corpus available to nonmembers that does not include the Wall Street Journal data from The North American News Text Corpus. To complement the Complete and General Release versions of BLLIP North American News Text, LDC is re-releasing The North American News Text Corpus in two versions. North American News Text, Complete LDC2008T15, the members-only original version, is now available as a 2008 Membership Year corpus. North American News Text, General Release (LDC2008T16) (which does not include news text from the Wall Street Journal), is available to nonmembers for the first time. The directory structures of each of these publications has been restructured to be identical to the directory structure of the BLLIP releases. *Methodology* A key problem in natural language processing is syntactic ambiguity resulting from uncertain relationships between words and their connections to sentence clauses. Sentences that can be constructed with correct syntax in more than one way are ambiguous, and such sentences generate multiple parse trees when they are separated into clauses by parts of speech. Traditional parsing techniques, such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, typically achieve a 90% accuracy rate because most sentences are not ambiguous. Resolving ambiguous sentences requires a probabilistic approach. Using the relative frequencies of grammar rules, statistical processing techniques assign probabilities for each clause. These probabilities are then summed up over each complete sentence parse and a probability is assigned for that sentence parse. In that way, the most likely parse can be determined. The data in this release was parsed into Penn Treebank-style parse trees using a re-ranking parser developed by Eugene Charniak and Mark Johnson. The Charniak and Johnson parser is statistically-based and uses a generative first stage followed by a discriminative second stage. Both stages were trained on the Wall Street Journal data in Treebank-2 (LDC95T7) and Treebank-3 (LDC99T42). BLLIP 1987-1989 WSJ Corpus Release 1 (LDC2000T43) contains a complete Treebank-style parsing of that Wall Street Journal material. In order to produce BLLIP North American News Text, the Charniak-Johnson parser used a simplified context free grammar in the first stage to generate a set of n best parses. Those parses were then pruned by eliminating the parses at the edges of the distribution. In the second stage, a maximum entropy-based parser using a complete grammar was applied. The output trees are ranked in order of probability. *Data* The parses in BLLIP North American News Text include constituency and POS tagging information for each of the 50-best parses of each sentence. Each file contains a sequence of n-best lists. An n-best list is a list of the top n parses of each sentence with the corresponding parser probability and re-ranker score. Following is an example of a simple n-best list: 50 reute9406_007.0356_13 4.9244 -147.337 (S1 (S (NP (PRP He)) (VP (VBD argued) (SBAR (S (NP (DT the) (NN country)) (ADVP (RB first)) (VP (AUX had) (S (VP (TO to) (VP (VB define) (NP (NP (DT the) (NNS institutions)) (PP (IN of) (NP (DT the) (NN presidency) (, ,) (NN government) (CC and) (NN parliament))))))))))) (. .))) 3.56482 -151.575 (S1 (S (NP (PRP He)) (VP (VBD argued) (SBAR (S (NP (DT the) (NN country)) (ADVP (RB first)) (VP (AUX had) (S (VP (TO to) (VP (VB define) (NP (NP (NP (DT the) (NNS institutions)) (PP (IN of) (NP (DT the) (NN presidency)))) (, ,) (NP (NN government) (CC and) (NN parliament)))))))))) (. .))) 3.35952 -151.173 (S1 (S (NP (PRP He)) (VP (VBD argued) (SBAR (S (NP (DT the) (NN country)) (ADVP (RB first)) (VP (AUX had) (S (VP (TO to) (VP (VB define) (NP (NP (DT the) (NNS institutions)) (PP (IN of) (NP (NP (DT the) (NN presidency)) (, ,) (NP (NN government) (CC and) (NN parliament)))))))))))) (. .))) 2.67662 -148.374 (S1 (S (NP (PRP He)) (VP (VBD argued) (SBAR (S (NP (DT the) (NN country)) (VP (ADVP (RB first)) (AUX had) (S (VP (TO to) (VP (VB define) (NP (NP (DT the) (NNS institutions)) (PP (IN of) (NP (DT the) (NN presidency) (, ,) (NN government) (CC and) (NN parliament))))))))))) (. .))) In the above example, the first number ("50") indicates the number of parses. The next token is the article id from the North American News Text Corpus ("reute9406_007.0356"), followed by an underscore, followed by the number of the sentence in the article ("13"). The parses follow; for brevity, only three parses out of the fifty are presented here. Each parse consists of a reranker score (4.9244 for the first parse) and parser log probability (-147.337 for the first parse), a new line, and then the parse tree itself. Parse trees are given in Penn Treebank format. Note that the n-best list is sorted by decreasing reranker scores.

This corpus was originally released in 1995 as the North American News Text Corpus (LDC95T21) and is reissued to complement the release of the Brown Laboratory for Linguistic Information Processing (BLLIP) North American News Text sets (LDC2008T13, LDC2008T14), which consist of Penn Treebank-style parsing of that news text. North American News Text is reissued in two versions: North American News Text, Complete LDC2008T15, the members-only original version, now available as a 2008 Membership Year corpus; and North American News Text, General Release LDC2008T16 (which does not include text from the Wall Journal Street Journal), available to nonmembers for the first time. The directory structure of each of these publications has been restructured to be identical to the directory structure of the BLLIP releases. *Data* The table below contains a breakdown of the sources, epochs and word counts for the data in the North American News Text releases: Source Dates # Words (millions) Los Angeles Times & Washington Post May, 1994 - August 1997 52 New York Times News & Syndicate July, 1994 - December 1996 173 Reuters News Service (General and Finanical) April, 1994 - December 1996 85 Wall Street Journal (not in General Release) July, 1994 - December 1996 40 The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post services include a range of other newspaper sources in their syndicated newswires. The Los Angeles Times/Washington Post material in this corpus includes some news text from the following sources: * Newsday * The Baltimore Sun * The Hartford Courant The New York Times material in this corpus contains some data from the following sources, although New York Times articles predominate: * Bloomberg Business News * The Boston Globe * Los Angeles Daily News * Fort Worth Star-Telegram * Newsweek * Cox News Service * The Arizona Republic * Seattle Post-Intelligencer * San Francisco Examiner * Houston Chronicle * San Francisco Chronicle * Economist Newspaper Ltd. * Hearst Newspapers The text content of each data file (following uncompression with the GNU-unzip utility) consists of plain ASCII character data with SGML tags to indicate article boundaries and organization of information within each article. There are differences among the five primary newswire sources in terms of the number and types of SGML tags used in the text, but the following tag structure is common to all data sets: -- start of a new article ... -- some variety of "header" tags appears here -- start of the text content of the article -- all paragraph boundaries are marked by this tag ... -- text data as it is provided by the newswire service -- end of text content of the article ... -- some variety of "trailer" tags appears here -- end of article In general, the differences in format among the various newswire sources will be found in the SGML tags that appear between and , and those that appear between and . The actual text content of articles (the region between and ) is consistent in format across sources, except for some uses of the SGML "&..;" notation to represent special characters in the data. For example, "&MD;" is used in the "latwp" material to represent the "em-dash" character, which is typically used to separate the "dateline" from the opening sentence in the first paragraph of each article. There may also be differences in how quotation marks are rendered. As this re-release is intended to complement the BLLIP North American News Text releases, the directory structure of this corpus is identical to that of the BLLIP publications.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aGraff, David403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T1504925nmm a22002893i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245004600141264007300187336003800260336002600298337002600324338003200350500001500382500004500397506005100442520384600493546004204339655002004381700001704401856014904418856006804567m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2008    pau        u        eng d  a15856348408 aLDC2008T168 aISLRN: 637-707-612-417-4  adc00aNorth American News Text, General Release  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2008]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2008T16  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T161 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aNorth American News Text, General Release, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2008T16 and isbn 1-58563-484-0, is a collection of English news text from the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, New York Times and Reuters. This data is a subset of the data contained in the North American News Text Corpus (LDC95T21) released in 1995 and is reissued to complement the release of the Brown Laboratory for Linguistic Information Processing (BLLIP) North American News Text sets (LDC2008T13, LDC2008T14), which consist of Penn Treebank-style parsing of the North American News Text Corpus text. North American News Text is reissued in two versions: North American News Text, Complete, LDC2008T15, the members-only original version, now available as a 2008 Membership Year corpus; and North American News Text, General Release LDC2008T16 (which does not include text from the Wall Street Journal), available to nonmembers for the first time. The directory structure of each of these publications has been restructured to be identical to the directory structure of the BLLIP releases. *Data* The table below contains a breakdown of the sources, epochs and word counts for the data in the North American News Text releases: Source Dates # Words (millions) Los Angeles Times & Washington Post May 1994 - August 1997 52 New York Times News & Syndicate July 1994 - December 1996 173 Reuters News Service (General and Finanical) April 1994 - December 1996 85 Wall Street Journal (not in General Release) July 1994 - December 1996 40 The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post services include a range of other newspaper sources in their syndicated newswires. The Los Angeles Times/Washington Post material in this corpus includes some news text from the following sources: * Newsday * The Baltimore Sun * The Hartford Courant The New York Times material in this corpus contains some data from the following sources, although New York Times articles predominate: * Bloomberg Business News * The Boston Globe * Los Angeles Daily News * Fort Worth Star-Telegram * Newsweek * Cox News Service * The Arizona Republic * Seattle Post-Intelligencer * San Francisco Examiner * Houston Chronicle * San Francisco Chronicle * Economist Newspaper Ltd. * Hearst Newspapers The text content of each data file (following uncompression with the GNU-unzip utility) consists of plain ASCII character data with SGML tags to indicate article boundaries and organization of information within each article. There are differences among the five primary newswire sources in terms of the number and types of SGML tags used in the text, but the following tag structure is common to all data sets: -- start of a new article ... -- some variety of "header" tags appears here -- start of the text content of the article -- all paragraph boundaries are marked by this tag ... -- text data as it is provided by the newswire service -- end of text content of the article ... -- some variety of "trailer" tags appears here -- end of article In general, the differences in format among the various newswire sources will be found in the SGML tags that appear between and , and those that appear between and .

LDC's CALLHOME Mandarin Chinese collection includes telephone speech, associated transcripts and a lexicon. CALLHOME Mandarin Chinese Speech consists of 120 unscripted telephone conversations between native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. All calls, which lasted up to thirty minutes, originated in North America and were placed to locations overseas; most participants called family members or close friends. CALLHOME Mandarin Chinese Transcripts covers a contiguous five or ten-minute segment from each of the telephone speech files. The transcripts are in tab-delimited format with GB2312 encoding, are timestamped by speaker turn for alignment with the speech signal and are provided in standard orthography. CALLHOME Mandarin Chinese Lexicon is comprised of over 40,000 words from twenty CALLHOME Mandarin transcripts. CALLHOME Mandarin Chinese Transcripts - XML Version, the latest addition to this collection, presents the entire original corpus of 120 transcripts in XML format with UTF-8 encoding, retokenization and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. The retokenization and POS information were supplied using the Chinese Lexical Analysis System (ICTCLAS) developed by the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. ICTCLAS aims to incorporate Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging, disambiguation and unknown words recognition into a single theoretical framework using multi-layered hierarchical hidden Markov models. In addition to the original applications for Mandarin Chinese CALLHOME data (e.g., speech recognition), CALLHOME Mandarin Chinese Transcripts - XML Version will be useful in the grammatical study of spoken Mandarin. *Data* This XML corpus retains all of the linguistic analyses (e.g., timestamps, spoken features and proper nouns) from the original transcripts release, but the mnemonics used in the original release were migrated into XML markup following the mapping rules described below: All analyses in the original release were retained at the sacrifice of tokenization and part-of-speech tagging accuracy (e.g., some mnemonics encoding spoken features may split a word, which can affect the tagging accuracy). However, the results of the automated processing were substantially post-edited. For example, four aspect markers in Chinese (-le, -guo, -zhe and zai) were disambiguated and corrected by hand; all of the classifiers (also called "measure words") were re-tagged using a more fine-grained annotation scheme developed on the Lancaster University project. In addition, a large number of obvious typographical errors in the original release were corrected in the process of post-editing.

GALE Phase 1 Chinese Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 3 is the last of the three-part GALE Phase 1 Chinese Broadcast News Parallel Text, which, along with other corpora, was used as training data in year 1 (Phase 1) of the DARPA-funded GALE program. LDC has previously released GALE Phase 1 Chinese Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 1 and GALE Phase 1 Chinese Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 2. *Source Data* A total of 19.1 hours of Chinese broadcast news recordings were selected from three sources: VOA, CCTV (a broadcaster from Mainland China) and Phoenix TV (a Hong Kong-based satellite TV station). The transcripts and translations represent recordings of five different programs. A manual selection procedure was used to choose data appropriate for the GALE program, namely, news programs focusing on current events. Stories on topics such as sports, entertainment and business were excluded from the data set. The following table is a summary of the files included in this release. Source Program Epoch (YYYY.MM) #hours #characters VOA VOA Mandarin 1997.05.20 and 1997.06.18 2.0 25,051 CCTV CCTV4 Daily News 2005.11-2006.01 4.8 57,376 CCTV4 News3 2005.05-2006.01 2.6 33,361 Phoenix TV Global Report 2005.10-2005.12 5.9 61,339 Good Morning China 2005.12-2006.01 3.8 48,976 The VOA files are named mv970520c.tdf and mv970618a.tdf. The corresponding speech recordings for the VOA data can be found in 1997 Mandarin Broadcast News Speech (HUB4-NE), LDC98S73. *Transcription* The selected audio snippets were carefully transcribed by LDC annotators and professional transcription agencies following LDC's Quick Rich Transcription specification. Manual sentence units/segments (SU) annotation was also performed as part of the transcription task. Three types of end of sentence SU are identified: (1) statement SU, (2) question SU and (3) incomplete SU. *Translation* After transcription and SU annotation, files were reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to professional translators for careful translation. Translators followed LDC's GALE Translation guidelines, which describe the makeup of the translation team, the source data format, the translation data format, best practices for translating certain linguistic features (such as names and speech disfluencies) and quality control procedures applied to completed translations. *TDF Format* All final data are in Tab Delimited Format (TDF). TDF is compatible with other transcription formats, such as the Transcriber format and AG format, and it is easy to process. Each line of a TDF file corresponds to a speech segment and contains 13 tab delimited fields: field data_type; file; channel int; start float; end float; speaker; speakerType; speakerDialect; transcript; section int; turn int; segment int; sectionType; and suType. A source TDF file and its translation are the same except that the transcript in the source TDF is replaced by its English translation. *Sponsorship* This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

CSLU: ISOLET Spoken Letter Database Version 1.3 is a database of letters of the English alphabet spoken in isolation under quiet laboratory conditions and associated transcripts. The data was collected in 1990 and consists of two productions of each letter by 150 speakers (7800 spoken letters) for approximately 1.25 hours of speech. The subjects were recruited through advertising and consisted of 75 male speakers and 75 female speakers. Each subject received a free dessert at a local restaurant in exchange for his or her participation in the data collection. All speakers reported English as their native language. Their ages varied from 14 to 72 years; the speakers' average age was 35 years. *Data* Speech was recorded in the OGI speech recognition laboratory. The room measured 15' by 15' with a tile floor, standard office wall board and drop ceiling and contained two Sun workstations and three disk drives. The recording equipment was selected to mimic the equipment used to collect the TIMIT database as closely as possible. The speech was recorded with a Sennheiser HMD 224 noise-canceling microphone, low pass filtered at 7.6 kHz. Data capture was performed using the AT&T DSP32 board installed in a Sun 4/110. The data were sampled at 16 kHz and converted to RIFF(.WAV) format. The subjects were seated in front of a Sun workstation and prompted with letters in random order. After each prompt, the subject would strike the return key and say the letter. Two seconds of speech were recorded and immediately played back for verification. If the subject spoke too soon or too late and missed the two-second buffer, or if the experimenter or subject decided that the letter was misspoken, the recording was repeated. There was no attempt to elicit ideal speech. A letter was judged to be misspoken only if there was a significant departure from normal pronunciation. After the recording session, each utterance was verified by a human examiner for two determinations. First, the examiner viewed a waveform of the utterance to determine that the speech was padded with silence. The examiner then listened to the speech and noted any ambiguous or misspoken utterances. All utterances noted by the examiner were examined by two additional human examiners. If a majority of the examiners perceived that an utterance was abnormal, that utterance, and the rest of the utterances from that speaker, were removed from the corpus. The transcriptions of the recorded speech are time-aligned phonetic transcriptions conforming to the CSLU Labeling standards. Time-aligned word transcriptions are represented in a standard orthography or romanization. Speech and non-speech phenomena are distinguished. The transcriptions are aligned to a waveform by placing boundaries to mark the beginning and ending of words. In addition to the specification of boundaries, this level of transcription includes additional commentary on salient speech and non-speech characteristics, such as glottalization, inhalation, and exhalation.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexPhonologyvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexAlphabetvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexPronunciationxNative speakersvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aCole, Ronald Allan10aMuthusamy, Yeshwant Kumar, 1965-10aFanty, Mark403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008S0704121nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245004000141264007300181336003800254336002600292337002600318338003200344500001500376500004500391506005100436520286700487520005103354546004203405650004203447650005003489655002003539700001903559856014903578856006803727m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2008    pau        u        eng d  a15856348678 aLDC2008T198 aISLRN: 429-488-225-160-9  adc00aThe New York Times Annotated Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2008]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2008T19  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T191 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe New York Times Annotated Corpus contains over 1.8 million articles written and published by the New York Times between January 1, 1987 and June 19, 2007 with article metadata provided by the New York Times Newsroom, the New York Times Indexing Service and the online production staff at nytimes.com. The corpus includes: * Over 1.8 million articles (excluding wire services articles that appeared during the covered period). * Over 650,000 article summaries written by library scientists. * Over 1,500,000 articles manually tagged by library scientists with tags drawn from a normalized indexing vocabulary of people, organizations, locations and topic descriptors. * Over 275,000 algorithmically-tagged articles that have been hand verified by the online production staff at nytimes.com. * Java tools for parsing corpus documents from .xml into a memory resident object. As part of the New York Times' indexing procedures, most articles are manually summarized and tagged by a staff of library scientists. This collection contains over 650,000 article-summary pairs which may prove to be useful in the development and evaluation of algorithms for automated document summarization. Also, over 1.5 million documents have at least one tag. Articles are tagged for persons, places, organizations, titles and topics using a controlled vocabulary that is applied consistently across articles. For instance if one article mentions "Bill Clinton" and another refers to "President William Jefferson Clinton", both articles will be tagged with "CLINTON, BILL". The New York Times has established a community website for researchers working on the data set at http://groups.google.com/group/nytnlp and encourages feedback and discussion about the corpus. *Data* The text in this corpus is formatted in News Industry Text Format (NITF) developed by the International Press Telecommunications Council, an independent association of news agencies and publishers. NITF is an XML specification that provides a standardized representation for the content and structure of discrete news articles. NITF encompasses structural markup such as bylines, headlines and paragraphs. The format also provides management attributes for categorizing articles into topics, summarization usage restrictions and revision histories. The goals of NITF are to answer the essential questions inherent in news articles: Who, What, When, Where and Why. * Who: Who owns the copyright, who has rights to republish the article and who the article is about. * What: The subjects reported, the named entities inside the article and the events it describes. * When: When the article was written, when it was issued and when it was revised. * Where: Where the article was written, where the events took place and where it was delivered. * Why: The metadata describing the newsworthiness of the article.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aSandhaus, Evan403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T1908323nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245002700141264007300168336003800241336002600279337002600305338003200331500001500363500004500378506005100423520697300474520005107447546004207498650003807540650004207578650005107620655002007671700001907691700001707710700001707727856014907744856006807893m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2008    pau        u        eng d  a15856349058 aLDC2008T218 aISLRN: 206-787-441-605-3  adc00aPennBioIE Oncology 1.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2008]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2008T21  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T211 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe PennBioIE Oncology Corpus consists of 1414 PubMed abstracts on cancer, concentrating on molecular genetics, and comprising approximately 327,000 words of biomedical text,tokenized and annotated for paragraph, sentence, part of speech, and 24 types of biomedical named entities in five categories of interest. 318 of the abstracts have also been syntactically annotated. All of the annotation was based on Penn Treebank II standards, with some modifications for special characteristics of the biomedical text. The entity definitions were developed and revised in an extensive process of interaction between domain experts and biomedically trained annotators. The oncology data comprises two subcorpora: * The Sanger subcorpus (san) consists of abstracts of 577 articles previously annotated by the Sanger Institute for global mention of oncological named entities. These annotations were metadata reflecting the presence or absence of such mentions anywhere in the text, without reference to specific strings. The articles concentrate on variations in a small set of human genes associated with many different types of cancer; they were not part of ongoing work at Sanger, and the annotations were never published. We did not refer to the Sanger annotations after selection of the abstracts. * The neuroblastoma subcorpus (nb) consists of 837 abstracts of articles dealing with this particular type of cancer selected by colleagues at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. They do not all concentrate on genetics, but they mention a much larger number of genes than the Sanger files do. The data was prepared by the Linguistic Data Consortium for the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, with funding from the National Science Foundation under Grant No. ITR EIA-0205448, Information Technology Research (ITR) program, in collaboration with Dr. Peter White's group in Pediatric Oncology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. *Data Description* The corpus contains 1412 PubMed abstracts comprising approximately 381,000 total words of text. Each file has been tokenized and its biomedical portions (327,000 words) exhaustively annotated for paragraph, sentence, and part of speech, and non-exhaustively annotated for 16 ("Level 1") or 23 ("Level 2") types of named entity. Each token has a part-of-speech tag. Tokens and POS tags: Tokens in biomedical and chemical notation and terms, and spelled-out numbers, may contain whitespace and/or punctuation ("beta, 20 diol", "(Na+ + K+)ATPase", "two hundred seven"); and named entity mentions may comprise several tokens ("polychlorinated biphenyl preparations"). Tokens and entities do not span sentence boundaries. Biomedical and non-biomedical text: The title and body of each abstract are considered to be biomedical text, and the automatic and manual annotations in them have been extensively curated. Everything else, such as citation information and author names, is considered non-biomedical; this has not been entity annotated, and its automated tokenization and part of speech tags have not been curated and are known to be unreliable. In non-biomedical text, the tag "section" is used instead of "sentence", allowing users to include or exclude these parts. There are approximately 274,000 words of biomedical text and 54,000 words of non-biomedical text. (Because of a problem with software maintenance, about 24,000 tokens in biomedical text, mostly in the nb2 subcorpus, are missing POS tags.) Domains: The abstracts are divided across two domains: * the molecular genetics of cancer, from a list selected by the Cancer Genome Project of the Sanger Institute (v0.9: 588 files; v1.0: 577 files) * neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that develops from nerve tissue in infants and children (v0.9: 569 files; v1.0: 837 files = 392 from v0.9 + 445 new) The difference between the domains is apparent in the ratio of distinct mentions (types) of tumor types and of gene, after normalization: 3.5 times as many tumor types in the Sanger files, but 5.8 times as many genes in the neuroblastoma files. Other divisions of the corpus: The files are further subdivided by annotation level into three subcorpora, each with its own subdirectory on this CD and its own set of metadata files. * nb1: neuroblastoma annotated to level 1 (407 files) * nb2: neuroblastoma annotated to level 2 (430 files) * san: Sanger annotated to level 2 (all 577 files) Metadata is also provided for * onco: the entire v1.0 oncology corpus (1414 files) * nb: nb1 + nb2, all the neuroblastoma data regardless of annotation level (837 files) * o2: nb2 + san, all the level 2 data regardless of subcorpus (1007 files) Version 0.9 is included in this release in a separate directory. It is similarly organized, though with only one level of annotation, less detailed than v1.0's level 1: * onco09: all the v0.9 oncology corpus (1157 files) * nb09: neuroblastoma (569 files) * san09: Sanger (588 files) A subset of the v0.9 data was also syntactically annotated (treebanked): * onco09t: (318 files) * nb09t: (115 files) * san09t: (203 files) *Principles and Methods* Many annotation projects start with an already annotated corpus, such as the Penn Treebank or the Brown Corpus, which is treated as unchangeable. As a result, annotation practices have sometimes involved compromises which might not have been necessary if the earlier annotation had been able to integrate the requirements of the later work. Such integration is necessary here because of the scope of this project, involving highly technical biomedical texts, entity definitions driven by the needs of biomedical research, and the goal of making the annotation layers work together as much as possible, e.g., using entity information in the treebank annotation of prenominal modifiers. Such integration is also possible given the relatively long term of the grant (five years) and because researchers were starting with fresh text, applying all layers of annotation themselves. The texts are annotated at the following layers: * Paragraph * Sentence * Biomedical entity * Token and part of speech * Syntax (treebanking) (some texts only) * Semantic relations (some oncology texts only) Paragraph, sentence, tokenization, POS, and syntactic annotation (treebanking) are applied by automatic taggers and manually corrected; entity annotation is manual. The authors originally used a POS tagger trained on Penn Treebank data, which made many errors on the very different text of these biomedical abstracts. When there was enough manually-corrected data to train a tagger, overall accuracy rose from 88.53% to 97.33% (Kulick et al. 2004 (slides)). Annotation at all layers except entity is based on the Penn Treebank II guidelines, with a number of modifications that have been found necessary, many of which were subsequently adopted by the Penn Treebank. Entity definitions came originally from domain experts and were developed and refined in dialogue with the annotators.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aOncologyvTerminologyvDatabases. 0aOncologyxData processingvDatabases. 0aOncologyxAbstracting and indexingvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aLiberman, Mark10aMandel, Mark10aWhite, Peter403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T2102193nmm a22003133i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245001800141264007300159336003800232336002600270337002600296338003200322500001500354500004500369506005100414520107800465546004201543655002001585700001701605700001701622700002301639856014901662856006801811m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2008    pau        u        eng d  a15856349218 aLDC2008T238 aISLRN: 652-357-402-514-3  adc00aNomBank v 1.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2008]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2008T23  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T231 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aNomBank is an annotation project at New York University that provides argument structure for instances of common nouns in the Penn Treebank (Treebank-2 and Treebank-3). NomBank 1.0 was released by the Nombank project in December 2007. It covers all of the "markable" nouns in the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal data. Specifically, it includes 114,576 propositions that were derived from looking at a total of 202,965 noun instances and choosing only those nouns who arguments occur in the text. The work of NomBank is related to the PropBank project at the University of Colorado. NomBank marks the sets of arguments that cooccur with nouns in Proposition Bank I, just as PropBank records such information for verbs. Related resources and further information about NomBank are available from the NomBank project website. *Data* NomBank v. 1.0 is a human-readable version of NomBank 1.0.

COMLEX resources are distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and consist of the following: COMLEX English Syntax Lexicon (LDC98L21), an English dictionary consisting of approximately 38,000 lemmas with detailed information about the syntactic characteristics of each lexical item and subcategorization (complement structures); and COMLEX Syntax Text Corpus Version 2.0 (LDC96T11). COMNOM adds classes to COMLEX Syntax lexical entries using NOMLEX-PLUS, a dictionary with approximately 8,000 entries. COMNOM collected prepositions from NOMLEX-PLUS sub-categorizations (:VERB-SUBC, :OBJECT, :SUBJECT, etc.), deduced essential complements from them and added them to the existing COMLEX entry. Further information about the methodology used in COMNOM can be found in Meyers, "Those Other NomBank Dictionaries -- Manual for Dictionaries that Come with NomBank". Related resources and further information about COMNOM and NomBank are available from the Nom Bank project website. A license to COMLEX English Syntax Lexicon (LDC98L21) or COMLEX Syntax Text Corpus Version 2.0 (LDC96T11) is required in order to obtain COMNOM v. 1.0. *Data* This release includes three versions of COMNOM which correspond to the three versions of NOMLEX-PLUS and are characterized by the amount of corpus training that influenced their creation. The data used for training are the Wall Street Journal materials in the Penn Treebanks (Treebank-2 and Treebank-3), with annotations from Proposition Bank I and NomBank 1.0. The three versions are: * COMNOM-clean.1.0 -- contains no information derived from annotated data * COMNOM.1.0 -- contains information from the entire annotated corpus * COMNOM-training.1.0 -- contains information from annotated data in sections 02-21 of the corpus only.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aMeyers, Adam10aReeves, Ruth10aMacleod, Catherine403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T2404464nmm a22003373i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245006100141264007300202336003800275336002600313337002600339338003200365500001500397500004500412506005100457520316400508520005103672546004203723650005003765650003803815655002003853700001903873700001703892856014903909856006804058m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2008    pau        u        eng d  a15856349488 aLDC2008T258 aISLRN: 541-800-982-573-5  adc00aAQUAINT-2 Information-Retrieval Text Research Collection  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2008]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2008T25  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T251 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aAQUAINT-2 Information-Retrieval Text Research Collection, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2008T25 and ISBN 1-58563-494-8, was developed by LDC for NIST's (National Institute for Standards and Technology) AQUAINT 2007 Question-Answer (QA) track. It consists of approximately 2.5 GB of English news text from six distinct sources collected by LDC (Agence France Presse, Associated Press, Central News Agency (Taiwan), Los Angeles Times-Washington Post, New York Times and Xinhua News Agency) covering the period from October 2004 through March 2006. The AQUAINT-2 collection is the second part of a series intended to provide data useful for developing, evaluating and testing information extraction and retrieval systems. It follows the publication of The AQUAINT Corpus of English News Text (LDC2002T31). The AQUAINT (Advanced Question-Answering for Intelligence) program addresses interactivity with scenarios or tasks. The scenario provides a context in which questions will be asked and answered, and the task reflects the overall assignment. The program is committed to solve a single problem: how to find topically relevant, semantically related, timely information in massive amounts of data in diverse languages, formats, and genres. AQUAINT technology is advancing the development of components and functions that allows users to pose a series of intertwined, complex questions and obtain comprehensive answers in the context of broad information-gathering tasks. In addition, while most information retrieval systems present only links to documents, AQUAINT is producing technology that will present answers to the user's questions. This question-answering technology is being developed with features for managing semantic similarity, co-reference, event characterization, opinions, linguistic and social and world inferencing, redundancy, deception, and missing or contradictory information. In order to allow the analyst to guide the exploration in concert with the machine, AQUAINT technology employs interactive question-answering, the automatic suggestion of additional paths of exploration, and the inferencing of the social context of the information search. *Data* AQUAINT-2 Information-Retrieval Text Research Collection is a subset of LDC's English Gigaword Third Edition (LDC2007T07). The collection comprises approximately 2.5 GB of text (about 907K documents) spanning the time period October 2004 - March 2006. For each source, all of the usable data collected by LDC was processed into a consistent XML format in which the stories for a given month are concatenated in chronological order into a single "DOCSTREAM" element; each story is a single "DOC" element within that stream and has a globally unique "id" attribute.

Historically, most linguistic resources were not generally available to interested researchers but were restricted to single laboratories or to a limited number of users. Inspired by the success of selected readily available and well-known data sets, such as the Brown University text corpus, LDC was founded in 1992 to provide a new mechanism for large-scale corpus development and sharing of resources. In 2008, LDC is a growing consortium that includes more than 100 companies, universities, and government members that has distributed over 50,000 corpora to a global audience. With the support of its members, LDC is able to provide critical services to the language research community. These services include: maintaining the data archives, producing and distributing data via media (DVD-ROM or CD-ROM) or web downloads, negotiating intellectual property agreements with potential information providers and would-be members, and maintaining relations with other like-minded groups around the world. Resources available from LDC (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu) include speech, text and video data and lexicons in multiple languages, as well as software tools to facilitate the use of corpus materials. *Data* The LDC Spoken Language Sampler provides a variety of speech, transcript and lexicon samples and is designed to illustrate the variety and breadth of the resources available from LDC Publication Catalog. * most excerpts are truncated to be much shorter than the original files, typically one minute and thirty seconds of speech * signal amplitude has been adjusted where necessary to normalize playback volume * some corpora are published in compressed form, but all samples here are uncompressed * LDC typically uses NIST SPHERE file format for audio data, but the audio files in this sampler have been converted to MS-WAV/audio (RIFF) file format for compatibility with typical browser audio utilities. The sampler includes samples from the following corpora and lexicons. Audio samples range from 30 seconds to 90 seconds and are accompanied by transcripts. An English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb This dictionary contains translations for over 6000 English verbs and defines over 9000 Tamil verbs. Entries include the English word, the Tamil equivalent in transliteration and Tamil script and audio examples in Spoken Tamil pronunciation. CALLFRIEND Farsi A corpus of 60 unscripted telephone calls between friends and acquaintances speaking in their native language, Farsi. CALLFRIEND Tamil A corpus of 60 unscripted telephone calls between friends and acquaintances speaking in their native language, Tamil. CALLHOME Japanese A corpus of 120 unscripted telephone conversations between native Japanese speakers and a corpus of associated transcripts. CALLHOME Spanish A corpus of 120 unscripted telephone conversations between native Spanish speakers and a corpus of associated transcripts. CSLU Kids Speech Developed at Oregeon State Universitys Center for Spoken Language Understanding, this corpus is a collection of spontaneous and prompted speech from 1100 children from Kindergarten through Grade 10. Fisher Levantine Arabic A collection of 279 Levantine Arabic telephone conversations and transcripts from speakers of several nationalities. Grassfields Bantu Fieldwork: Dschang Tone Paradigms Tone paradigms from Yémba (Bamileke Dschang), a Bamileke (Grassfields Bantu) language spoken by 300,000+ people in Southwestern Cameroon.

It is a collection of naturally produced numbers taken from utterances in various CSLU telephone speech data collections. The corpus consists of approximately fifteen hours of speech and includes isolated digit strings, continuous digit strings, and ordinal/cardinal numbers. The numbers have several sources, among them, phone numbers, numbers from street addresses and zip codes, uttered by 12618 speakers in a total of 23902 files. In most of CSLU's telephone data collections, callers were asked for their phone number, birthdate or zip code. Callers would also occasionally leave numbers in the midst of another utterance. The numbers in those situations were extracted from the host utterance and added to the corpus. Additional information about this publication is available from the corpus web page at CSLU. * Data:* The speech data was collected over analog and digital telephone lines. The analog data was recorded using a Gradient Technologies analog-to-digital conversion box; those files were recorded as 16-bit, 8 khz and stored in a linear format. The digital data was recorded with the CSLU T1 digital data collection system; those files were sampled at 8khz, 8-bit and stored as ulaw files. All of the data in this release has been linearly encoded in 16-bit RIFF standard file format. Each file includes an orthographic transcription following the CSLU Labeling guidelines which are included in the documentation for this publication. Also, many of the utterances have been phonetically labeled. * Statistics: * CSLU: Numbers Version 1.3 consists of approximately fifteen hours of speech.

The data was obtained in two different sessions with a time separation of about two months. The goal of the corpus is to provide a range of speaking styles and voice modifications for speakers sharing the same accent. Other existing corpora, in particular CSLU Speaker Recognition Version 1.1, TIMIT and the IViE corpus (English Intonation in the British Isles), served as referents in the selection of material. This design decision was made to ensure that methods designed and evaluated on the CHAINS corpus might be directly testable on these other corpora, which were recorded using quite different dialects and channel characteristics. Additional documentation about the corpus and its methodolgy is available at the CHAINS website. *Data* The data was collected in two recording sessions in a total of six different speaking styles. The first recording session was carried out in a professional recording studio in December 2005. Speakers were recorded in a sound-attenuated booth reading text in the solo, synchronous and retell styles using a Neumann U87 condenser microphone. Additional tracks using other microphones (near and far-field) were also recorded and may be made available upon request to the authors. The second recording session took place from March 2006 to May 2006 in a quiet office environment, using an AKG C420 headset condenser microphone. Speakers read text in the rsi, whisper and fast modes. The six different speaking styles were: * solo reading * synchronous reading * spontaneous speech (retell) * reptitive synchronous imitation (rsi) * whispered fast reading * fast speech reading In two of the speaking conditions adopted, speakers modified their speech in a constrained fashion towards a known target in the synchronous condition, the speech of the co-speaker served as a target, while in rsi, there was an explicit known static target. The presence of a known target which speakers aim to copy raises the bar in the discovery and design of procedures for automatic speaker identification, as the target speech provides a potentially highly confusing foil. The whisper and fast speech conditions are also well defined speaking styles which require substantial voice modification by the speaker. Participants were recruited through the University College Dublin and were paid for their participation. No participant had any known speech or hearing deficit. The speakers were from the United Kingdom, the eastern part of Ireland (Dublin and adjacent counties) and the United States. Further information about the speakers, their gender and dialect is available in the documentation released with this corpus.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aCummins, Fred10aGrimaldi, Marco10aLeonard, Thomas10aSimko, Juraj403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008S0906543nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090041001800119041003300137042000700170245005700177264007300234336003800307336002600345337002600371338003200397500001500429500004500444506005100489520508500540520005105625546007805676650002905754650004905783650004205832655002005874700001505894700001905909700002405928856014905952856006806101m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2009    pau        u        eng d8 aLDC2009T098 aISLRN: 131-245-215-805-90 aengaarabeng07aengaabvaarabeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 2  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2009]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2009T09  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009T091 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 2 was prepared by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and contains a total of 145,000 words (263 files) of Arabic newsgroup text and its translation selected from thirty-five sources. Newsgroups consist of posts to electronic bulletin boards, Usenet newsgroups, discussion groups and similar forums. This release was used as training data in Phase 1 (year 1) of the DARPA-funded GALE program. This is the second of a two-part release. GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 1 was releasd in early 2009. LDC has released the following GALE Phase 1 & 2 Arabic Parallel Text data sets: * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 1 (LDC2007T24) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 2 (LDC2008T09) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Blog Parallel Text (LDC2008T02) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 1 (LDC2009T03) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 2 (LDC2009T09) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 1 (LDC2012T06) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 2 (LDC2012T14) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Newswire Parallel Text (LDC2012T17) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text (LDC2012T18) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Web Parallel Text (LDC2013T01) *Source Data* Preparing the source data involved four stages of work: data scouting, data harvesting, formatting and data selection. Data scouting involved manually searching the web for suitable newsgroup text. Data scouts were assigned particular topics and genres along with a production target in order to focus their web search. Formal annotation guidelines and a customized annotation toolkit helped data scouts to manage the search process and to track progress. The data scouting process is described in the GALE task specification. Data scouts logged their decisions about potential text of interest (sites, threads and posts) to a database. A nightly process queried the annotation database and harvested all designated URLs. Whenever possible, the entire site was downloaded, not just the individual thread or post located by the data scout. Once the text was downloaded, its format was standardized (by running various scripts) so that the data could be more easily integrated into downstream annotation processes. Original-format versions of each document were also preserved. Typically, a new script was required for each new domain name that was identified. After scripts were run, an optional manual process corrected any remaining formatting problems.The selected documents were then reviewed for content-suitability using a semi-automatic process. A statistical approach was used to rank a document's relevance to a set of already-selected documents labeled as "good." An annotator then reviewed the list of relevance-ranked documents and selected those which were suitable for a particular annotation task or for annotation in general. These newly-judged documents in turn provided additional input for the generation of new ranked lists. Manual sentence unit/segment (SU) annotation was also performed on a subset of files following LDC's Quick Rich Transcription guidelines. Three types of end of sentence SU were identified: * statement SU * question SU * incomplete SU *Translation* After files were selected, they were reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to professional translators for careful translation. Translators followed LDC's GALE translation guidelines, which describe the makeup of the translation team, the source data format, the translation data format, best practices for translating certain linguistic features (such as names and speech disfluencies) and quality control procedures applied to completed translations. *Final Data* A source file and its translation share the same file name across directories. TDF Format All final data are presented in Tab Delimited Format (TDF). TDF is compatible with other transcription formats, such as the Transcriber format and AG format, making it easy to process. Each line of a TDF file corresponds to a speech segment and contains 13 tab delimited fields: field data_type 1 file unicode 2 channel int 3 start float 4 end float 5 speaker unicode 6 speakerType unicode 7 speakerDialect unicode 8 transcript unicode 9 section int 10 turn int 11 segment int 12 sectionType unicode 13 suType unicode A source TDF file and its translation are the same except that the transcript in the source TDF is replaced by its English translation. Some fields are inapplicable to newsgroup text. Those include the channel, start time, end time and speaker dialect fields. Those fields are either empty or contain values as place holder. Encoding All data are encoded in UTF-8. *Sponsorship* This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

English CTS Treebank with Structural Metadata was created to support EARS work in English. It applies EARS metadata extraction annotations and Penn Treebank methods to conversations from Switchboard-1 Release 2 (LDC97S62) and from data collected for EARS under the Fisher Protocol (released in EARS as LDC2004E16, LDC2004E29 and LDC2005E73). The purpose of the EARS program was to develop robust speech recognition technology to address a range of languages and speaking styles. LDC provided conversational and broadcast speech and transcripts, annotations, lexicons and texts for language modeling in each of the EARS languages (Arabic, Chinese, English). LDC also supported a metadata extraction (MDE) research evaluation, the goal of which was to enable technology to take raw speech-to-text (STT) output and to refine it into forms of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. In simple terms, this means the creation of automatic transcripts that are maximally readable. This readability might be achieved in a number of ways: removing non-content words like filled pauses and discourse markers from the text; removing sections of disfluent speech; and creating boundaries between natural breakpoints in the flow of speech so that each sentence or other meaningful unit of speech might be presented on a separate line within the resulting transcript. Natural capitalization, punctuation and standardized spelling, plus sensible conventions for representing speaker turns and identity are further elements in the readable transcript. Some of the data developed by LDC for the MDE task is contained in the LDC Catalog, i.e., RT-04 MDE Training Data Speech, LDC2005S16 and RT-04 MDE Training Data Text/Annotations, LDC2005T24. *Data* Speech The telphone speech used in English CTS Treebank with Structural Metadata was drawn from Switchboard-1 Release 2 (LDC97S62) and from data collected for EARS under the Fisher Protocol (released in EARS as LDC2004E16, LDC2004E29 and LDC2005E73). The speech for all files was recorded on two channels with a sampling rate of 8000 Hz and was encoded in ulaw format. The Fisher data was transcribed by LDC staff; for the Switchboard data, transcripts developed at the Institute for Signal and Information Processing at Mississippi State University were used. Structural Metadata Annotation The transcribed data was annotated to SimpleMDE V6.2 , an annotation task defined by LDC that consisted of the following elements: Edit Disfluencies (repetitions, revisions, restarts and complex disfluencies), Fillers (including, e.g., filled pauses and discourse markers) and SUs, or syntactic/semantic units. Each of these elements is described below: * Edit Disfluencies: Edit disfluencies, or speech repairs, occur when speakers correct or alter their utterances or abandon them entirely and start over. Edit disfluencies have a more complex internal structure than fillers, consisting of the original utterance (reparandum), an interruption point, an optional editing phase and a correction. There are four types of disfluencies annotated in SimpleMDE: repetitions; revisions; restarts; and complex disfluencies, which consist of multiple or nested edits. In SimpleMDE, annotators labeled only the deletable region (DELREG) of the disfluency which corresponded to the reparandum. In cases where the reparandum contained multiple disfluent utterances, annotators identified the maximal extent of the disfluent portion, starting with the left edge of the first disfluency and continuing to the right edge (IP) of the final disfluency. * Fillers: While the term filler has traditionally been synonymous with filled pause, SimpleMDE uses the term to encompass a broad set of vocalized space-fillers: filled pauses (FPs), discourse markers (DMs), explicit editing terms (EETs) and asides/parentheticals (A/Ps). Excepting the last category, fillers can be understood as words that do not alter the propositional content of the material into which they are inserted. For example, FPs include nonlexemes, such as um or ah, that speakers use to indicate hesitation or to maintain control of a conversation. A DM is a word or phrase that functions primarily as a structuring unit of spoken language, such as actually, now, anyway, see, basically, so, I mean, well, let's see, you know, like, you see. DMs often signal the speaker's intention to mark a boundary in discourse, like a change in speaker or the beginning of a new topic. There is no exhaustive list of DMs for a given language due to their wide range of functions, colloquial variations, and the difficulty of defining them precisely. Furthermore, words that are used as discourse markers can be used for other purposes. EETs occur during an edit disfluency and consist of an overt statement (e.g., I'm sorry) from the speaker recognizing the disfluency. Asides and parentheticals (A/Ps) are different from the other filler types in that they convey semantic information in the form of a short side comment before returning to the main topic. This may be either on a new topic (asides) or on the same topic of the larger utterance (parentheticals). Both break up the stream of discourse and are often accompanied by noticeable prosodic features. * Syntactic Units: One of the goals of MDE annotation is the identification of all units within the discourse that function to express a complete thought or idea on the part of the speaker.Within MDE these elements are called SUs (Syntactic, Semantic or Slash Units). As with disfluency annotation, the goal of SU labeling is to improve transcript readability by presenting information in small, structured, coherent chunks. There are four sentence-level SUs. Statements are complete SUs that function as a declarative statement and are marked with /.; questions are complete SUs that function as an interrogative and are marked with /?. Backchannels are an open class of words uttered by the non-dominant speaker to indicate engagement in the conversation and are marked with /@. Incomplete SUs occur when an utterance does not constitute a grammatically complete sentence, phrase or continuer, and does not express a complete thought; these are marked with /-. To enhance inter-annotator consistency, there are also sentence-internal clausal and coordinating SUs (/, and /&). Parsing and Treebank Annotation The existing MDE annotations were converted from RTTM format into a format appropriate for the automatic parser, enabling the generation of accurate parses in a form that would require as little hand modification by the Treebank team as possible. RTTM is a format developed by NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology) for the EARS program that labeled each token in the reference transcript according to the properties it displays (e.g., lexeme versus non-lexeme, edit, filler, SU). The initial parse trees were produced using an entropy-based parser, which was trained on Switchboard transcripts supplemented with Wall Street Journal data (with a 4:1 ratio). These parses served as the starting point for a manual process which corrected the initial pass for each conversation. To provide high quality parses, scripts were used to separate the edited material from the fluent part of each SU prior to parsing it using the MDE annotations. The edits were then parsed and reinserted into the tree for presentation to the annotators. Some important issues are listed below: * Words were tokenized in Syntactic Units using LDC's scripts. * All of the punctuation provided in the markup was maintained in the SU for parsing because it was likely to enhance parse accuracy and was expected to appear in the final tree annotations. * For parsing complex edits, contiguous edits were concatenated into one unit for parsing. In a few cases, edits occur across SUs in MDE annotations. * Special treatment was required in the scripts for regions unannotated for MDE, complex edits, and SUs that were comprised solely of edited material. * The string was "EDITED" as the non-terminal tag for edit regions inserted into the fluent parse trees.   aAdditionally a terminal node for the IP ((DISFL-IP +) was added at the end of the edits in an attempt to make the tree follow the conventions used in the Switchboard Treebank. Manual treebank annotation was performed in accordance with existing treebank guidelines for conversational telephone speech as well as in accordance with revised general guidelines for treebanking.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexData processing. 0aAutomatic speech recognition.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aBies, Ann10aLee, Haejoong10aStrassel, Stephanie10aWalker, Christopher403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009T0104773nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041002800152042000700180245007100187264007300258336003800331336002600369337002600395338003200421500001500453500004500468506005100513520337900564520005103943546007103994650003904065650003104104655002004135700001504155700002404170856014904194856006804343m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2009    pau        u        eng d  a15856349998 aLDC2009T028 aISLRN: 306-125-545-782-00 aengachibeng07aengacmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 1 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text - Part 1  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2009]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2009T02  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009T021 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 1 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text - Part 1, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2009T02 and ISBN 1-58563-499-9, contains transcripts and English translations of 20.4 hours of Chinese broadcast conversation programming from China Central TV (CCTV) and Phoenix TV. It does not contain the audio files from which the transcripts and translations were generated. GALE Phase 1 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text - Part 1, along with other corpora, was used as training data in year 1 (Phase 1) of the DARPA-funded GALE program. *Source Data:* A total of 20.4 hours of Chinese broadcast conversation programming were selected from two sources: CCTV (a broadcaster from Mainland China), and Phoenix TV (a Hong Kong -based satellite TV station). The transcripts and translations represent recordings of eight different programs. A manual selection procedure was used to choose data appropriate for the GALE program, namely conversation (talk) programs focusing on current events. Stories on topics such as sports, entertainment and business were excluded from the data set. The following table is a summary of the files included in this release.

It contains approximately seven hours of audiovisual recordings of fourteen American English speakers producing syllables, word lists and sentences used in both academic and clinical settings. All talkers were from the North Midland dialect region -- roughly defined as Indianapolis and north within the state of Indiana -- and had lived in that region for the majority of the time from birth to 18 years of age. Each participant read 238 different words and 166 different sentences. The sentences spoken were drawn from the following sources: * Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) Everyday Sentences (Lists A-J) * Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 (Lists I-IV) * Vowels in /hVd/ context (separate words) * Texas Instruments/Massachusetts Institute for Technology (TIMIT) sentences The CID Everyday Sentences were created in the 1950s from a sample developed by the Armed Forces National Research Committee on Hearing and Bio-Acoustics. They are considered to represent everyday American speech and have the following characteristics: the vocabulary is appropriate to adults; the words appear with high frequency in one or more of the well-known word counts of the English language; proper names and proper nouns are not used; common non-slang idioms and contractions are used freely; phonetic loading and "tongue-twisting" are avoided; redundancy is high; the level of abstraction is low; and grammatical structure varies freely. Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 is a phonemically-balanced set of monosyllabic English words used clinically to test speech perception in adults with hearing loss. The /hVd/ vowel list was created to elicit all of the vowel sounds of American English. The TIMIT sentences are a subset (34 sentences) of the 2342 phonetically-rich sentences read by speakers in the TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus LDC93S1. TIMIT was designed to provide speech data for the acquisition of acoustic-phonetic knowledge and for the development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems. TIMIT speakers were from eight dialect regions of the United States. The Audiovisual Database of Spoken American English will be of interest in various disciplines: to linguists for studies of phonetics, phonology, and prosody of American English; to speech scientists for investigations of motor speech production and auditory-visual speech perception; to engineers and computer scientists for investigations of machine audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR); and to speech and hearing scientists for clinical purposes, such as the examination and improvement of speech perception by listeners with hearing loss. *Data* Participants were recorded individually during a single session. A participant first completed a statement of informed consent and a questionnaire to gather biographical data and then was asked by the experimenter to mark his or her Indiana hometown on a state map. The experimenter and participant then moved to a small, sound-treated studio where the participant was seated in front of three navy blue baffles. A laptop computer was elevated to eye-level on a speaker stand and placed approximately 50-60 cm in front of the participant. Prompts were presented to the participant in a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation. The experimenter was seated directly next to the participant, but outside the camera angle, and advanced the PowerPoint slides at a comfortable pace. Participants were recorded with a Panasonic DVC-80 digital video camera to miniDV digital video cassette tapes. All participants wore a Sennheiser MKE-2060 directional/cardioid lapel microphone throughout the recordings. Each speaker produced a total of 94 segmented files which were converted from Final Cut Express to Quicktime (.mov) files and then saved in the appropriately marked folder. If a speaker mispronounced a sentence or word during the recording process, the mispronunciations were edited out of the segments to be archived. The remaining parts of the recording, including the correct repetition of each prompt, were then sequenced together to create a continuous and complete segment. The fourteen participants were between 19 and 61 years of age (with a mean age of 30 years) and native speakers of American English.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagezUnited StatesxSpoken EnglishvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases. 0aComputational linguistics.7 aVideo recordings2lcgft10aRichie, Carolyn10aWarburton, Sarah10aCarter, Megan403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009V0106327nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041003300152042000700185245005700192264007300249336003800322336002600360337002600386338003200412500001500444500004500459506005100504520488200555520005105437546007905488650004905567650004205616655002005658700001505678700001905693700002405712856014905736856006805885m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2009    pau        u        eng d  a15856350658 aLDC2009T038 aISLRN: 146-868-323-212-90 aengaarabeng07aengaarbaarabeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 1  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2009]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2009T03  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009T031 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 1, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2009T03 and isbn 1-58563-506-5, was prepared by LDC and contains a total of 178,000 words (264 files) of Arabic newsgroup text and its translation selected from thirty-five sources. Newsgroups consist of posts to electronic bulletin boards, Usenet newsgroups, discussion groups and similar forums. This release was used as training data in Phase 1 (year 1) of the DARPA-funded GALE program. LDC has released the following GALE Phase 1 & 2 Arabic Parallel Text data sets: * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 1 (LDC2007T24) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 2 (LDC2008T09) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Blog Parallel Text (LDC2008T02) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 1 (LDC2009T03) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 2 (LDC2009T09) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 1 (LDC2012T06) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 2 (LDC2012T14) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Newswire Parallel Text (LDC2012T17) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text (LDC2012T18) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Web Parallel Text (LDC2013T01) *Source Data* Preparing the source data involved four stages of work: data scouting, data harvesting, formatting and data selection. Data scouting involved manually searching the web for suitable newsgroup text. Data scouts were assigned particular topics and genres along with a production target in order to focus their web search. Formal annotation guidelines and a customized annotation toolkit helped data scouts to manage the search process and to track progress. Data scouts logged their decisions about potentital text of interest (sites, threads and posts) to a database. A nightly process queried the annotation database and harvested all designated URLs. Whenever possible, the entire site was downloaded, not just the individual thread or post located by the data scout. Once the text was downloaded, its format was standardized (by running various scripts) so that the data could be more easily integrated into downstream annotation processes. Original-format versions of each document were also preserved. Typically, a new script was required for each new domain name that was identified. After scripts were run, an optional manual process corrected any remaining formatting problems. The selected documents were then reviewed for content-suitability using a semi-automatic process. A statistical approach was used to rank a document's relevance to a set of already-selected documents labeled as "good." An annotator then reviewed the list of relevance-ranked documents and selected those which were suitable for a particular annotation task or for annotation in general. These newly-judged documents in turn provided additional input for the generation of new ranked lists. Manual sentence unit/segment (SU) annotation was also performed on a subset of files following LDC's Quick Rich Transcription specification. Three types of end of sentence SU were identified: * statement SU * question SU * incomplete SU *Translation* After files were selected, the files were reformatted into a human-readable translation format, and the files were then assigned to professional translators for careful translation. Translators followed LDC's GALE translation guidelines, which describe the makeup of the translation team, the source data format, the translation data format, best practices for translating certain linguistic features (such as names and speech disfluencies) and quality control procedures applied to completed translations. TDF Format All final data are presented in Tab Delimited Format (TDF). TDF is compatible with other transcription formats, such as the Transcriber format and AG format maklng it easy to process. Each line of a TDF file corresponds to a speech segment and contains 13 tab delimited fields: field data_type 1 file unicode 2 channel int 3 start float 4 end float 5 speaker unicode 6 speakerType unicode 7 speakerDialect unicode 8 transcript unicode 9 section int 10 turn int 11 segment int 12 sectionType unicode 13 suType unicode A source TDF file and its translation are the same except that the transcript in the source TDF is replaced by its English translation. Some fields are inapplicable to newsgroup text. Those include the channel, start time, end time and speaker dialect fields. Those fields are either empty or contain values as a place holder.

It consists of proposition bank-style annotations for approximately 500 English biomedical journal abstracts. The source abstracts, annotated in accordance with Penn Treebank II guidelines, are contained in the GENIA Treebank (GTB). The GTB was developed at the Tsujii Laboratory at the University of Tokyo. The purpose of the GENIA Project is to develop tools and resources for automatic information extraction of biomedical information. One result of that work is the GENIA corpus, a collection of 2000 biomedical journal abstracts containing semantic class annotation for biomedical terms, part-of-speech (POS) tags and coreferences. The GTB is a subset of that corpuse. BioProp Version 1.0 adds a proposition bank to the GTB. Proposition Bank (PropBank) contains annotations of predicate argument structures and semantic roles in a treebank schema in the newswire domain. To construct BioProp Version 1.0, a semantic role labeling (SRL) system trained on PropBank was used to annotate the GTB. SRL, also called shallow semantic parsing, is a popular semantic analysis technique. In SRL, sentences are represented by one or more predicate-argument structures (PAS), also known as propositions. Each PAS is composed of a predicate (e.g., a verb) and several arguments (e.g., noun phrases) that have different semantic roles, including main arguments such as agent and patient, and adjunct arguments, such as time, manner and location. The term "argument" refers to a syntactic constituent of the sentence related to the predicate, and the term "semantic role" refers to the semantic relationship between a sentence's predicate and argument. To suit the needs in the biomedical domain, the PropBank annotation guidelines were modified to characterize semantic roles as components of biological events. Specifically, thirty verbs were selected according to their frequency of use or importance in biomedical texts. Since targets in information extraction are relations of named entities, only sentences containing protein or gene names were used to count each verb's frequency. Verbs of general usage were filtered out in order to keep the focus on biomedical verbs. Some verbs that do not have a high frequency but play important roles in describing biomedical relations, such as "phosphorylate" and "transactivate," were also selected. The BioProp annotation was based on Levin?s verb classes as defined in the VerbNet lexicon. In VerbNet, the arguments of each verb are represented at the semantic level, and thus have associated semantic roles. However, since some verbs may have different usages in biomedical and newswire texts, it is necessary to customize the framesets of biomedical verbs. After selecting the predicate verbs, a semi-automatic method was used to annotate BioProp. The annotation process consisted of the following steps: * Identification of predicate candidates * Automatic annotation of the biomedical semantic roles using newswire SRL system * Transformation of automatic tagging results into WordFreak format * Review by human annotators *Data* BioProp Version 1.0 consists of approximately 150,000 words. Each line in the corpus provides a PAS annotation that can be mapped to a sentence in the GTB.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aMedical sciencesvPeriodicalsxAbstracting and indexingxData processing. 0aAutomatic indexing.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aHsu, Wen-Lian403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009T0405598nmm a22003853i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041003300152042000700185245007900192264007300271336003800344336002600382337002600408338003200434500001500466500004500481506005100526520411100577520005104688546007904739650003804818650002504856650003104881655002004912700002004932700001804952700002504970856014904995856006805144m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2009    pau        u        eng d  a15856350818 aLDC2009T058 aISLRN: 415-470-503-471-50 aengaarabeng07aengaarbaarabeng2iso639-3  adc00a2008 NIST Metrics for Machine Translation (MetricsMATR08) Development Data  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2009]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2009T05  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009T051 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aNIST MetricsMATR is a series of research challenge events for machine translation (MT) metrology, promoting the development of innovative, even revolutionary, MT metrics that correlate highly with human assessments of MT quality.

NIST runs those metrics on certain held-back test data for which it has human assessments measuring quality and then calculates correlations between the automatic metric scores and the human assessments. This release contains the development data received by participants in NIST Metrics for Machine Translation 2008 Evaluation (MetricsMATR08). Specifically, this corpus is comprised of a subset of the materials used in the NIST Open MT06 evaluation and includes human reference translations, system translations, and human assessments of adequacy and preference. The source data consists of twenty-five Arabic language newswire documents with a total of 249 segments. The data in each segment includes four human reference translations in English and system translations from eight different MT06 machine translation systems. In addition to the data and reference translations, this release inlcudes software tools for evaluation and reporting and documentation describing how the human assessments were obtained and how they are represented in the data. The evaluation plan contains further information and rules on the use of this data. The MetricsMATR program seeks to overcome several drawbacks to the methods employed for the evaluation of MT technology. Currently, automatic metrics have not yet proved able to predict the usefulness and reliability of MT technologies with confidence. Nor have automatic metrics demonstrated that they are meaningful in target languages other than English. Human assessments, however, are expensive, slow, subjective and difficult to standardize. These problems, and the need to overcome them through the development of improved automatic (or even semi-automatic) metrics, have been a constant point of discussion at past NIST MT evaluation events. MetricsMATR aims to provide a platform to address these shortcomings. Specifically, the goals of MetricsMATR are: * To inform other MT technology evaluation campaigns and conferences with regard to improved metrology. * To establish an infrastructure that encourages the development of innovative metrics. * To build a diverse community that will bring new perspectives to MT metrology research. * To provide a forum for MT metrology discussion and for establishing future directions of MT metrology. *Data* The MetricsMATR08 development data set released here is reflective of the test data set only to a degree; the evaluation data set contains more varied data -- from more genres, more source languages, more systems and different evaluations -- than this development data set. There are also more types of human assessments for the test data. The MetricsMATR08 test data remains unseen to allow for repeated use as test data. The software used for obtaining the human judgments included in this data set is the same software used for the NIST Open MT08 human assessments. It includes a description of the adequacy and preference assessment tasks and the instructions given to the judges. All segments assessed were judged by two independent judges. Adequacy judgments were performed for all segments of each document. Preference judgments were performed for the first four segments of each document such that full pair-wise comparisons between all eight MT systems were obtained. All judgments were performed against only one reference translation. The score represents an adjudicated score over the two individual judgments. The official results of MetricsMATR08 on the test data for the metrics submitted to MetricsMATR08 are publicly available. NIST performed the same analyses on the MetricsMATR08 development data after the evaluation. These results are not publicly available, but will likely be available on request in the future by contacting mt_poc@nist.gov.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Standard Arabic, and Arabic.

It consists of Japanese "word" n-grams and their observed frequency counts generated from over 255 billion tokens of text. The length of the n-grams ranges from unigrams to seven-grams. The n-grams were extracted from publicly accessible web pages that were crawled by Google in July 2007. This data set contains only n-grams that appear at least 20 times in the processed sentences. Less frequent n-grams were simply discarded. Those web pages requiring user authentication, pages containing "noarchive" or "noindex" meta tags, and pages under other special restrictions were excluded from the final release. While the aim was to process only Japanese pages, the corpus may contain some pages in other languages due to language detection errors. This dataset will be useful for research in areas such as statistical machine translation, language modeling and speech recognition, among others. *Data* Before the n-grams were collected, the web pages were converted into UTF-8 encoding, normalized into Unicode Normalization Form KC (see below), and split into sentences. Ill-formed sentences were filtered out, and the remaining sentences were segmented into "words". All strings were normalized into Unicode Normalization Form KC (NFKC), which is described in http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/. Japanese strings were normalized according to the following rules: * Full-width letters/digits were converted to ASCII letters/digits * Half-width katakana were converted to full-width katakana * Glyphs for Roman digits were converted to ASCII characters * Certain Japanese-specific symbols were converted The vocabulary was restricted to "words" that appeared at least 50 times in the processed sentences. Statistical information about the corpus is set forth in the following table: Data size The total compressed data size is about 26GB.

It does not contain the audio files from which the transcripts and translations were generated. This release, along with other corpora, was used as training data in Phase 1 (year 1) of the DARPA-funded GALE program. GALE Phase 1 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text - Part 1 was released in January 2009. *Source Data* A total of 24 hours of Chinese broadcast conversation programming was selected from three sources: CCTV (a broadcaster from Mainland China), Phoenix TV (a Hong Kong-based satellite TV station) and VOA. The transcripts and translations represent recordings of seven different programs. A manual selection procedure was used to choose data appropriate for the GALE program, namely, conversation (talk) programs focusing on current events. Stories on topics such as sports, entertainment and business were excluded from the data set. The following table is a summary of the files included in this release. Source Program Epoch (YYYY.MM) #hours #characters CCTV Today's Focus 2006.01 2.1 36,398 Phoenix TV Asian Journal 2005.09 - 2005.11 2.5 27,876 Behind the Headlines 2006.01 1.5 7,170 A Date with Lu Yu 2005.10 - 2006.01 10.9 129,782 News Hacker 2005.10 - 2005.11 3.0 43,070 Passion on China 2005.10 2.0 21,482 VOA News08 2005.03 2.0 28,621 *Transcription* The selected audio snippets were carefully transcribed by LDC annotators and professional transcription agencies following LDC's Quick Rich Transcription specification. Manual sentence units/segments (SU) annotation was also performed as part of the transcription task. Three types of end of sentence SU are identified: * statement SU * question SU * incomplete SU *Translation* After transcription and SU annotation, files were reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to professional translators for careful translation. Translators followed LDC's GALE Translation guidelines which describe the makeup of the translation team, the source data format, the translation data format, best practices for translating certain linguistic features (such as names and speech disfluencies) and quality control procedures applied to completed translations. TDF Format All final data are in Tab Delimited Format (TDF). TDF is compatible with other transcription formats, such as the Transcriber format and AG format, and it is easy to process. Each line of a TDF file corresponds to a speech segment and contains 13 tab delimited fields: field data_type 1 file unicode 2 channel int 3 start float 4 end float 5 speaker unicode 6 speakerType unicode 7 speakerDialect unicode 8 transcript unicode 9 section int 10 turn int 11 segment int 12 sectionType unicode 13 suType unicode A source TDF file and its translation are the same except that the transcript in the source TDF is replaced by its English translation.

Most recent annotation efforts for language have focused on small pieces of the larger problem of semantic annotation rather than producing a single unified representation. The Unified Linguistic Annotation (ULA) project, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, seeks to integrate into one framework different layers of annotation (e.g., semantics, discourse, temporal, opinions) using various existing resources, including PropBank, NomBank, TimeBank, Penn Discourse Treebank and coreference and opinion annotations. The project represents a concerted effort of researchers from several institutions to develop a large word corpus with balanced and annotated data. The ULA Text Collection is provided as a resource for the ULA effort. It consists of two datasets, the Language Understanding Annotation Corpus from the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Human Language Technology and ACE Reflex Entity Translation Training Dev/Test developed by LDC. The Language Understanding Annotation Corpus (LDC2009T10). The Language Understanding Annotation Corpus consists of over 9000 words of English text (6949 words) and Arabic text (2183 words) annotated for committed belief, event and entity coreference, dialog acts and temporal relations. The materials were chosen from various sources to represent "informal input," that is, text that contains colloquial forms. The documents in the corpus include excerpts from newswire stories, telephone conversation transcripts, emails, contracts and written instructions. REFLEX Entity Translation Training/DevTest (LDC2009T11). REFLEX Entity Translation Training/DevTest is the complete set of training data and development test data for the 2007 REFLEX Entity Translation evaluation sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It contains approximately 67.5k words of newswire and weblog text for each of English, Chinese and Arabic (or approximately22.5k words in each language) translated ito each of the other two languages. The data is annotated for entities and TIMEX2 extents and normalization.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Standard Arabic, and Arabic.

The participants were researchers from BBN Technologies, Carnegie Mellon University and Columbia University who were developing representations of text semantics, machine translation and summarization systems. The resulting corpus contains over 9000 words of English text (6949 words) and Arabic text (2183 words) annotated for committed belief, event and entity coreference, dialog acts and temporal relations. The source materials were chosen from various genres to represent "informal input," that is, text that contains colloquial forms. The documents in the corpus include excerpts from newswire stories, telephone conversation transcripts, emails, contracts and written instructions. The problem was modeled as an extended exercise in extracting information elements from a "document" (that is, from discrete language records in written or spoken forms). The goal was to answer two broad questions: * What are the elements of knowledge that can be derived from a document? * Can the representation, and hence, the annotation, be laid out in terms of iterative layers, the accumulation of which would represent the sum of the knowledge? The annotations attempted to resolve these questions in the following ways: * Belief/Opinion/Confidence. Committed belief annotation distinguishes between statements which assert belief or opinion, those which contain speculation, and statements which convey facts or otherwise do not convey belief. The goal is to be able to determine automatically from a given text what beliefs can be ascribed to the author and with what strength the author holds those beliefs. * Dialog Acts. Dialog act annotation seeks to determine the forward and backward links between pairs of dialog acts. * Coreference (entities and events). Event coreferences indicate which events are related to other events at the document level. Entity relations within these related events provide further information about e.g., the main actors, targets and causes of the events. * Temporal relations. Temporal annotations mark the temporal relationship between the different events and time anchors mentioned in a document, that is, it highlights what the text is saying about the time line of time-mentions.  aContent in English, Standard Arabic, and Arabic.

This release constitutes the complete set of training data and development test data for the 2007 REFLEX Entity Translation evaluation sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and consists of approximately 67.5k words of newswire and weblog text for each of three languages: English, Chinese and Arabic. The data set is made up of 22.5k words of English data, 22.5k words of Chinese data, and 22.5k words of Arabic data translated into each of the other two languages and annotated for entities and TIMEX2 extents and normalization. Entity Annotation. The annotations identify seven types of entities: Person, Organization, Location, Facility, Weapon, Vehicle and GeoPolitical Entity. Each type is further divided into subtypes (for instance, Person subtypes include Individual, Group and Indefinite). Annotators tagged all mentions of each entity within a document, whether named, nominal or pronominal. For every mention, the annotator identified the maximal extent of the string that represents the entity and labeled the head of each mention. Nested mentions were also captured. Each entity was classified according to its type and subtype. Each entity mention was further tagged according to its class such as specific, generic, attributive, negatively quantified or under specified. Annotators also reviewed the entire document to group mentions of the same entity together; they also labeled cases of metonymy, where the name of one entity is used to refer to another entity (or entities) related to it. TIMEX2 Annotation. TIMEX2 annotation of events and temporal relations fulfills two objectives. The first is the interpretation of expressions that refer to time. Such expressions tell when something happened, or how long something lasted, or how often something occurs. Such expressions also often require knowledge of the temporal context in order to truly understand them. A second objective is the normalization of temporal expressions. This facilitates interoperability between systems. Problems occur, for example, when a programmer in France encodes "October sixteenth 1962" as "1962.10.16" and one in the U.S. encodes it as "10/16/1962".

Transcripts corresponding to the audio files in this corpus are provided in Czech Broadcast Conversation MDE Transcripts (LDC2009T20). These corpora join LDC's other Czech broadcast data sets: Czech Broadcast News Speech (LDC2004S01), Czech Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2004T01), Voice of America (VOA) Czech Broadcast News Audio (LDC2000S89), and Voice of America (VOA) Czech Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2000T53). Czech Broadcast Conversation Speech consists of 72 single channel recordings of Radioforum, a live talk program broadcast by Czech Radio 1 (CRo1) every weekday evening. Its format consists of invited guests (most often politicians) spontaneously answering topical questions posed by one or two interviewers. The number of interviewees in a single program varies from one to three, but typically, one interviewer and two interviewees appear in the program. The material includes passages of interactive dialogue, but longer stretches of monologue-like speech comprise the majority of the collected data. Radioforum also has an interactive segment where listeners call the studio and ask their own questions. That telephony speech was not transcribed in the current release. *Data* Individual recordings range from 27 minutes to 36 minutes each. The recordings were collected during the period from February 12, 2003 through June 26, 2003. The signal is mono, sampled at 22.05 kHZ with 16-bit resolution, stored in Windows PCM waveform format. The names of the audio files refer to the broadcast date (rfYYMMDD.wav).

The 2008 Shared Task developed syntactic dependency annotations, including information such as named-entity boundaries and the semantic dependencies model roles of both verbal and nominal predicates. The materials in the Shared Task data consist of excerpts from the following corpora: Treebank-3 LDC99T42, BBN Pronoun Coreference and Entity Type Corpus LDC2005T33, Proposition Bank I LDC2004T14 (PropBank) and NomBank v 1.0 LDC2008T23. The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) is accompanied every year by a shared task intended to promote natural language processing applications and evaluate them in a standard setting. The 2004 and 2005 CoNLL shared tasks were dedicated to semantic role labeling (SRL) in a monolingual setting (English). In 2006 and 2007, the shared tasks were devoted to the parsing of syntactic dependencies and used corpora from up to thirteen languages. The 2008 shared task employed a unified dependency-based formalism and merged the task of syntactic dependency parsing and the task of identifying semantic arguments and labeling them with semantic roles. LDC has also released the following CoNLL Shared Task data sets: * 2006 CoNLL Shared Task - Ten Languages (LDC2015T11) * 2006 CoNLL Shared Task - Arabic & Czech (LDC2015T12) * 2009 CoNLL Shared Task Part 1 (LDC2012T03) * 2009 CoNLL Shared Task Part 2 (LDC2012T04) * 2015-2016 CoNLL Shared Task (LDC2017T13) *Data* The 2008 shared task was divided into three subtasks: * parsing syntactic dependencies * identification and disambiguation of semantic predicates * identification of arguments and assignment of semantic roles for each predicate Several objectives were addressed in this shared task: * SRL was performed and evaluated using a dependency-based representation for both syntactic and semantic dependencies. While SRL on top of a dependency treebank has been addressed before, the approach of the 2008 Shared Task was characterized by the following novelties: * The constituent-to-dependency conversion strategy transformed all annotated semantic arguments in PropBank and NomBank v 1.0, not just a subset; * The annotations addressed propositions centered around both verbal (PropBank) and nominal (NomBank) predicates. * Based on the observation that a richer set of syntactic dependencies improves semantic processing, the syntactic dependencies modeled are more complex than the ones used in the previous CoNLL shared tasks. For example, the corpus includes apposition links, dependencies derived from named entity (NE) structures, and better modeling of long-distance grammatical relations. * A practical framework is provided for the joint learning of syntactic and semantic dependencies. Due to the complexity of the 2008 shared task, only a single language, English, was used.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aSurdeanu, Mihai10aJohansson, Richard10aMarquez, Lluis10aMeyers, Adam10aNivre, Joakim403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009T1210743nmm a22003853i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041002800152042000700180245005900187264007300246336003800319336002600357336003300383337002600416338003200442500001500474500004500489506005100534520846600585520085109051546006009902650004009962650004310002655002010045655002810065700002510093700002210118856014910140856006810289m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2009    pau        u        tam d  a15856350738 aLDC2009L018 aISLRN: 140-507-539-817-70 atamaengbeng07atamaengbeng2iso639-3  adc00aAn English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb Second Edition  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2009]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2009L01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009L011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aAn English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb represents over twenty-five years of work led by Harold F. Schiffman, Professor, emeritus, of Dravidian Linguistics and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania's Department of South Asia Studies. It contains translations for 6597 English verbs and defines 9716 Tamil verbs. This release presents the dictionary in two formats: Adobe PDF and XML. The PDF format displays the dictionary in a human readable form. The XML version is a purely electronic form which, while readable by humans, is intended mainly for application development and the creation of searchable electronic databases. In the electronic XML version each entry contains the following: the English entry or head word; the Tamil equivalent (in Tamil script and transliteration); the verb class and transitivity specification; the spoken Tamil pronunciation (audio files in mp3 format); the English definition(s); additional Tamil entries (if applicable); example sentences or phrases in Literary Tamil, Spoken Tamil (with a corresponding audio file in .mp3 format) and an English translation; and Tamil synonyms or near-synonyms, where appropriate. Some foods referenced in the example sentences are illustrated in html files that include detailed description of each dish. It is expected that the dictionary will be useful for Tamil learners, scholars and others interested in the Tamil language. *What's New in the Second Edition?* * Errors in the Tamil text and the roman transliteration have been corrected. * Audio files have been updated and corrected and missing files have been added. * A brand new search and browse application that can access the audio has been included in this edition. This application can be accessed from the tools directory. * The XML structure has been modified to normalize the presentation of synonyms. *The Tamil Verb* Tamil is an official language of India, Singapore and Sri Lanka and has roughly 66 million native speakers worldwide. Most Tamil speakers live in the Tamil Nadu State and northeastern Sri Lanka, but the extended diaspora includes Malaysia, Mauritius and Singapore. Tamil is also a Classical Language of India. A member of the Dravidian language family, it boasts a rich literary tradition stretching back over 2200 years. Tamil is a diglossic language, meaning that it consists of at least two distinct forms. Spoken Tamil (ST) refers to the numerous vernacular dialects, and Literary Tamil (LT) refers to the form of the language used in print and most broadcast news media. The dialects of Spoken Tamil fall along regional divisions and along caste lines; there is no widely adopted standard for ST, although one seems to be emerging. Educated Tamil speakers, on the other hand, generally use LT with little variation in written communication. It appears, however, that a common dialect of ST may be emerging as a result of a growing broadcast media and increased rates of higher education. That dialect resembles the upper caste (non-Brahman) dialects spoken in the urban centers of Tamil Nadu and borrows verbs from LT. The spoken examples in An English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb reflect this emerging common dialect. Tamil is also an agglutinative language, meaning that it constructs verbs by appending inflections in the form of suffixes onto basic verb-stem morphemes. These inflections primarily denote tense, aspect, voice and mood. As far as voice is concerned, however, though LT may mark a verb as passive on occasion, ST rarely makes this distinction. These suffixes mark whether a verb is transitive or intransitive, that is, they indicate whether the subject is acted on by the verb or whether the subject is the actor. Mood is implied by verb tense, but may also be provided by verbal auxiliaries expressing various degrees of probability, futurity, ability, and their negatives. Tamil also may add suffixes that mark aspectual distinctions, such as whether an action is considered to be perfective ('complete' and/or 'definite') or whether it is ongoing or imperfective ('continuous' or 'durative'), as well as other distinctions. Aspect is a category that is undergoing increasing grammaticalization and is therefore more usual in ST than in LT. As is common with this process, aspectual distinctions are 'speaker-centered', i.e. they provide personal observations (some analysts have referred to this as 'attitude' or 'point of view', which is of course what the word 'aspect' originally means) which describe the speaker's frame of mind concerning the event depicted in the sentence -- whether it is perceived to be beneficial or detrimental, positive or negative, voluntary or involuntary, etc. Aspectual distinctions vary widely among dialects; both because of the variability of the grammaticalization process and for historical reasons, and Tamil speakers can code-switch among different dialects depending on context and audience. In addition, ST and LT treat the grammar of verbs differently. Finding exact equivalents between English and Tamil verbs is very difficult as a result of Tamil's diglossic nature and because of the difficulty of mapping English aspectual distinctions onto Tamil aspectual categories. An English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb seeks to meet needs not currently addressed by existing English-Tamil dictionaries. The main goal of this dictionary is to get an English-knowing user to a Tamil verb, irrespective of whether he or she begins with an English verb or some other item, such as an adjective; this is because what may be a verb in Tamil may in fact not be a verb in English, and vice versa. Since the number of English entries is limited (slightly less than 10,000) there may not be main entries for certain low-frequency items like 'pounce' but this item does appear as a synonym for 'jump, leap', and some other verbs, so searching for 'pounce' will get the user to a Tamil verb via the synonym field. The main goal is therefore to specifically concentrate on supplying the kinds of information lacking in all previous attempts to capture the equivalencies between English and Tamil. This dictionary addresses the following problem areas: * Verb classes: English-Tamil dictionaries, both current and previously extant, do not provide the user with any information about the morphological class of the Tamil verb, nor do they give information as to whether a verb is transitive or intransitive. This kind of information is readily available in Tamil-English dictionaries, but not in English-Tamil dictionaries. * Spoken Tamil: No English-Tamil dictionary gives information about the spoken or colloquial pronunciation of Tamil. Nor do they indicate whether a verb found in Literary Tamil is also used in Spoken Tamil. Information about ST is harder to get than Tamil in any other form. No electronic databases exist for ST, and many speakers of Tamil do not consider ST to be worth devoting any attention to. For non-Tamil speakers attempting to learn Tamil, however, ST is necessary for day-to-day functioning in a Tamil environment, and this dictionary is intended to meet their needs, not primarily the needs of native speakers. * Example Sentences: Currently extant English-Tamil dictionaries give few if any example sentences that illustrate the morphological and/or syntactic frames in which verbs occur. This is particularly important for ST, since it is morphologically and syntactically more complex than LT, especially in the verb phrase. * Modern Usage: Most extant English-Tamil dictionaries are now seriously out of date. Their compilers have often simply replicated the data found in previous dictionaries, with the result that the English represented in them is that of previous centuries. The Tamil forms given are also lacking in modernity, but for other reasons. * Syntactic Complexity of the Verb Phrase: Because the Tamil verb is morphologically complex, and the verb phrase therefore syntactically very complex, the authors decided to focus only on the Tamil verb. Tamil nouns are, in contrast, morphologically simple, and the noun phrase is remarkably uncomplicated. Tamil nouns have no gender distinctions (except where there is biological gender), no agreement, and adjectives are not inflected for number or gender. The Tamil Nadu government has spent much time and energy creating lexica and glossaries for various modern usages for Tamil, but these have mainly generated new nominal terminology, not verbs.   aThis is partly because LT cannot borrow verbs easily, i.e. it cannot take a 'foreign' word and add Tamil morphological material to it, such as tense marking and person-number-gender marking, which all Tamil finite verbs must have. ST, on the other hand, has no problem with borrowings or other innovative word-formation devices. Spoken Tamil, however is not deemed worthy of being used in such contexts. * Sound Files: Finally, this dictionary, because of its electronic format, contains sound recordings of every Spoken Tamil example sentence, which of course could not be a part of any previous dictionaries printed on paper. Since most readers of LT already possess a familiarity with some form of ST, sound files for verbs in this form are not provided. The spoken verbs in this dictionary are drawn from the emerging common dialect of Tamil.  aContent in Tamil and English.

The audio files corresponding to the transcripts in this corpus are contained in Czech Broadcast Conversation Speech (LDC2009S02). These corpora join LDC's other Czech broadcast data sets: Czech Broadcast News Speech (LDC2004S01), Czech Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2004T01), Voice of America (VOA) Czech Broadcast News Audio (LDC2000S89), and Voice of America (VOA) Czech Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2000T53).

A total of 40 hours of recordings were collected during the period from February 12, 2003 through June 26, 2003. Individual recordings range from 27 minutes to 36 minutes each. Radioforum's format consists of invited guests (most often politicians) spontaneously answering topical questions posed by one or two interviewers. The number of interviewees in a single program varies from one to three, but typically, one interviewer and two interviewees appear in the program.

Radioforum also has an interactive segment where listeners call the studio and ask their own questions. That telephony speech was not transcribed in the current release. Czech Broadcast Conversation MDE Transcripts was created to extend Metadata Extraction (MDE) research to conversational Czech. The goal of MDE is to take raw speech recognition output and refine it into forms that are of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. In simple terms, this means the creation of automatic transcripts that are maximally readable. This readability might be achieved in a number of ways: removing non-content words like filled pauses and discourse markers from the text; removing sections of disfluent speech; and creating boundaries between natural breakpoints in the flow of speech so that each sentence or other meaningful unit of speech might be presented on a separate line within the resulting transcript. Natural capitalization, punctuation and standardized spelling, plus sensible conventions for representing speaker turns and identity are further elements in the readable transcript. The transcripts and annotations in this corpus are stored in three different formats: TRS (Transcriber - http://trans.sourceforge.net), QAn (Quick Annotator - http://www.mde.zcu.cz/qan.html), and RTTM. TRS represents a standard speech transcript. QAn and RTTM contain essentially identical information about structural metadata (MDE); the main difference between them is formatting. Character encoding in all files is ISO-8859-2. All filenames have the form rfYYMMDD.format where "rf" stands for Radioforum, the following six digits indicate the date of broadcast, and the extension ".format" corresponds to the data format of the particular file ".trs", ".qan", or ".rttm". More information can be found on the website Structural Metadata Annotation for Czech. *Data* The radio programs recorded for this corpus were transcribed with two purposes. First, in order to produce precise time-aligned verbatim transcripts of the audio recordings, manual transcripts were created using guidelines based on those employed in Czech Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2004T01). Second, the transcripts were annotated wiith MDE markup to provide structural information about the conversations. Manual time-aligned verbatim transcription The original guidelines for time-aligned verbatim transcription used for the Czech broadcast news data were adjusted to better accommodate specifics of the recorded broadcast coversation. Those revised guidelines instructed annotators how to deal with the following phenomena, among others: * Speaker turns: a corresponding time stamp and speaker ID are inserted every time there is a speaker change in the audio. * Turn-internal breakpoints: to break up long turns, breakpoints roughly corresponding to 'sentence' boundaries within a speaker turn are inserted. * Overlapping speech: an overlapping speech region is recognized when more than one speaker talks simultaneously; within this region, each speaker's speech is transcribed separately (if intelligible). * Background noises: [NOISE] tags are used to mark noticeable background noises. * Speaker noises: speaker-produced noises are identified with one of the following tags: [BREATH], [COUGH], [LAUGH], [LIP-SMACK]. * Filled pauses: filled pauses produced by a speaker to indicate hesitation or to maintain control of a conversation are transcribed either as [EE-HESITATION] or as [MM-HESITATION], based on their pronunciation. * Interjections: certain interjections typically used as back channels or to express speaker's agreement or disagreement are transcribed using the [HM] (agreement) and [MH] (disagreement) tags. * Unintelligible speech: regions of unintelligible speech are marked with a special symbol. * Numbers: all numerals are transcribed as complete words. * Mispronounced words: mispronounced words (reading errors, slips of the tongue) are transcribed in the spelling corresponding to their pronunciation in the audio (i.e., the incorrect pronunciation is represented) and marked with a special symbol. * Word fragments: the pronounced part of the word is transcribed and a single dash is used to indicate point at which word was broken on. * Punctuation: standard punctuation (limited to commas, periods, and question marks) is used to enhance transcript readability. Because the verbatim transcripts were created by a large number of annotators, they were manually revised for maximum correctness and consistency. MDE annotation MDE is an annotation task which annotates Edit Disfluencies (repetitions, revisions, restarts and complex disfluencies), Fillers (including, e.g., filled pauses and discourse markers) and SUs, or syntactic/semantic units. Originally, the structural MDE annotation standard was defined for English. When developing structural metadata annotation guidelines for Czech, the guidelines developed by LDC for English were followed to the extent possible. Lanaguage-dependent modifications were made based on the description of the syntax of Czech compound and complex sentences. MDE Annotation marks the following phenomena: * Edit Disfluencies: Edit disfluencies, or speech repairs, occur when speakers correct or alter their utterances or abandon them entirely and start over. * Fillers: While the term filler has traditionally been synonymous with filled pause, SimpleMDE uses the term to encompass a broad set of vocalized space-fillers: filled pauses (FPs), discourse markers (DMs), explicit editing terms (EETs) and asides/parentheticals (A/Ps). * Sentence-like units: One of the goals of MDE annotation is the identification of all units within the discourse that function to express a complete thought or idea on the part of the speaker.Within MDE these elements are called SUs (Syntactic, Semantic or Slash Units).

Like the original release, Version 2.0 contains all of the data in Chinese Gigaword Second Edition -- from Central News Agency, Xinhua News Agency and Lianhe Zaobao -- annotated with full part of speech tags. In addtion, this new release removes residual noises in the original and improves tagging accuracy by incorporating lexica of unknown words. The changes represented in Version 2.0 include the following: * A single-width space is used consistently between two segmented words. * The position of the newline character remains fixed, better reflecting the source files from Chinese Gigaword Second Edition (LDC2005T14). * The original coding of partial Latin letters or Arabic numerals is preserved. * 1,192 documents from Central News Agency (Taiwan) and 13 documents from Xinhua News Agency that were missing from the first publication are included. * A set of heuristics for building out-of-vocabulary dictionaries to improve annotation quality of very large corpora is incorporated. Documents in the corpus were assigned one of the following categories: * story: This type of DOC represents a coherent report on a particular topic or event, consisting of paragraphs and full sentences. * multi: This type of DOC contains a series of unrelated "blurbs," each of which briefly describes a particular topic or event; examples include "summaries of today's news," "news briefs in ..." (some general area like finance or sports), and so on. * advis: These are DOCs which the news service addresses to news editors; they are not intended for publication to the "end users." * other: These DOCs clearly do not fall into any of the above types; they include items such as lists of sports scores, stock prices, temperatures around the world, and so on. *Data* Basic statistics of data from each source are summarized below.

By comparing to word lists generated from the ICTCLAS version of an automatic tagged Xinhua portion of Chinese Gigaword, a set of heuristics for building out-of-vocabulary dictionaries to improve quality were proposed. Randomly selected texts for evaluating effects of these out-of-vocabulary dictionaries were manually checked. Experimental results indicate that there were 30,562 correct words (about 97.3 %) of tested words.

Newsgroups consist of posts to electronic bulletin boards, Usenet newsgroups, discussion groups and similar forums. This release was used as training data in Phase 1 (year 1) of the DARPA-funded GALE program. . *Source Data* Preparating the source data involved four stages of work: data scouting, data harvesting, formating, and data selection. Data scouting involved manually searching the web for suitable newsgroup text. Data scouts were assigned particular topics and genres along with a production target in order to focus their web search. Formal annotation guidelines and a customized annotation toolkit helped data scouts to manage the search process and to track progress. Data scouts logged their decisions about potential text of interest (sites, threads and posts) to a database. A nightly process queried the annotation database and harvested all designated URLs. Whenever possible, the entire site was downloaded, not just the individual thread or post located by the data scout. Once the text was downloaded, its format was standardized (by running various scripts) so that the data could be more easily integrated into downstream annotation processes. Original-format versions of each document were also preserved. Typically, a new script was required for each new domain name that was identified. After scripts were run, an optional manual process corrected any remaining formatting problems. The selected documents were then reviewed for content-suitability using a semi-automatic process. A statistical approach was used to rank a document's relevance to a set of already-selected documents labeled as "good." An annotator then reviewed the list of relevance-ranked documents and selected those which were suitable for a particular annotation task or for annotation in general. These newly-judged documents in turn provided additional input for the generation of new ranked lists. Manual sentence unit/segment (SU) annotation.was also performed on a subset of files following LDC's Quick Rich Transcription specification. Three types of end of sentence SU were identified: statement SU, question SU and incomplete SU. *Translation* After files were selected, they were reformatted into a human-readable translation format, and the files were then assigned to professional translators for careful translation. Translators followed GALE Translation guidelines which describe the makeup of the translation team, the source data format, the translation data format, best practices for translating certain linguistic features (such as names and speech disfluencies), and quality control procedures applied to completed translations. TDF Format All final data are in Tab Delimited Format (TDF). TDF is compatible with other transcription formats, such as the Transcriber format and AG format, and it is easy to process. Each line of a TDF file corresponds to a speech segment and contains 13 tab delimited fields: field data_type 1 file unicode 2 channel int 3 start float 4 end float 5 speaker unicode 6 speakerType unicode 7 speakerDialect unicode 8 transcript unicode 9 section int 10 turn int 11 segment int 12 sectionType unicode 13 suType unicode A source TDF file and its translation are the same except that the transcript in the source TDF is replaced by its English translation. Some fields are inapplicable to newsgroup text. Those include the channel, start time, end time and speaker dialect fields. These fields are either empty or contain values as a placeholder. Encoding All data are encoded in UTF8. *Sponsorship * This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

This second edition updates Spanish Gigaword First Edition (LDC2006T12) and adds data collected from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008. The three distinct international sources of Spanish newswire in this edition, and the time spans of collection covered for each, are as follows: * Agence France-Presse, Spanish Service (afp_spa) May 1994 - Dec 2008 * Associated Press Worldstream, Spanish (apw_spa) Nov 1993 - Dec 2008 * Xinhua News Agency, Spanish Service (xin_spa) Sep 2001 - Dec 2008 The seven-letter codes in the parentheses above include the three-character source name abbreviations and the three-character language code (spa) separated by an underscore (_) character. The three-letter language code conforms to LDCs internal convention based on the ISO 639-3 standard. These codes are used in the directory names where the data files are found and in the prefix that appears at the beginning of every data file name. They are also used (in all UPPER CASE) as the initial portion of the DOC id strings that uniquely identify each news story. *Data* The overall totals for each source are summarized below. Note that the Totl-MB numbers show the amount of data obtained when the files are uncompressed (i.e. approximately 7 gigabytes, total) the Gzip-MB column shows totals for compressed file sizes as stored on the DVD-ROM the K-wrds numbers are simply the number of whitespace-separated tokens (of all types) after all SGML tags are eliminated.

It consists of approximately 550,000 words of Arabic newswire text and its English translation from Agence France Presse (France), An Nahar (Lebanon) and Assabah (Tunisia). The source Arabic text was used in LDC's Arabic Treebank, specifically, in Part 1 (Part 1 v. 2.0; Part 1 v. 3.0), Part 3 (Part 3 v. 1.0; Part 3 v. 2.0) and Part 4 (Part 4 v. 1.0). A subset of Agence France Presse (AFP) source text from Arabic Treebank: Part 1 v. 2.0 was previously translated and released by LDC in Arabic Treebank: Part 1 - 10K-word English Translation, LDC2003T07. The English translations in this corpus were provided by translation agencies using LDC's Arabic Translation Guidelines. *Data* The number of stories and their epochs for each source are as follows: AFP 734 stories; July 2000 - November 2000 An Nahar 600 stories; January 2002 - December 2002 Assabah 397 stories; September 2004 - November 2004 Total 1731 stories Word count of Arabic tokens by source is shown in the following table: AFP 102,564 An Nahar 299,681 Assabah 149,259 Total 551,504 The original source files used different encodings for the Arabic characters, including UTF8 and ASMO.

FactBank 1.0 was built on top of TimeBank 1.2 and a fragment of the AQUAINT TimeML Corpus, both of which used the TimeML specification language. This resulted in a double-layered annotation of event factuality. TimeBank 1.2 and AQUAINT TimeML encode most of the basic structural elements expressing factuality information while FactBank 1.0 represents the resulting factuality interpretation. The combination of the factuality values in FactBank with the structural information in TimeML-annotated corpora facilitates the development of tools aimed at automatically identifying the factuality values of events, a component fundamental in tasks requiring some degree of text understanding, such as Textual Entailment, Question Answering, or Narrative Understanding. FactBank annotations indicate whether the event mention describes actual situations in the world, situations that have not happened, or situations of uncertain interpretation. Event factuality is not an inherent feature of events but a matter of perspective. Different discourse participants may present divergent views about the factuality of the very same event. Consequently, in FactBank, the factuality degree of events is assigned relative to the relevant sources at play. In this way, it can adequately reflect the divergence of opinions regarding the factual status of events, as is common in news reports. The annotation language is grounded on established linguistic analyses of the phenomenon, which facilitated the creation of a battery of discriminatory tests for distinguishing between factuality values. Furthermore, the annotation procedure was carefully designed and divided into basic, sequential annotation tasks. This made it possible for hard tasks to be built on top of simpler ones, while at the same time allowing annotators to become incrementally familiar with the complexity of the problem. As a result, FactBank annotation achieved a relatively high interannotation agreement, kappa=0.81, a positive result when considered against similar annotation efforts. *Data* All FactBank markup is standoff and is represented through a set of 20 tables which can be easily loaded into a database. Each table resides in an independent text file, where fields are separated by three consecutive bars (i.e., |||). The data in fields of string type are presented between simple quotations ('). Because FactBank 1.0 was built on top of TimeBank 1.2 and AQUAINT TimeML, both of which are marked up with inline XML-based annotation, this release contains the TimeBank 1.2 and AQUAINT TimeML annotation in standoff, table-based format as well.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aJournalismxObjectivityxData processing. 0aFacts (Philosophy)xData processing. 0aGrammar, Comparative and generalxParsingxData processing.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aSauri, Roser10aPustejovsky, J.

The corpus consists of 36 speakers (22 male, 14 female) uttering 11 specified words. The speakers repeated the following words six times on each of four channels: startrek, supernova, tektronix, generation, nebula, processing, singularity, 71523, abracadabra, sungeeta and computer. The four channels used were office phone, home phone, carbon microphone telephone and speaker phone. Each speech file has a corresponding time-aligned phoneme-level transcription (achieved using automatic forced alignment) and an automatically-generated world-level transcription. Humans reviewed each utterance in two passes and classified it as good, bad, noisy or different. The results of this verification process are included in the /docs directory. *Data* The data was recorded with the CSLU T1 digital data collection system. Each utterance is recorded as a separate file. These files were sampled at 8 khz 8-bit and stored as ulaw files. All of the data use the RIFF standard file format.

The goal of the project is to annotate a large corpus comprising various genres of text (news, conversational telephone speech, weblogs, use net, broadcast, talk shows) in three languages (English, Chinese, and Arabic) with structural information (syntax and predicate argument structure) and shallow semantics (word sense linked to an ontology and coreference). OntoNotes Release 3.0 is a continuation of the OntoNotes project and is supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Contract No. HR0011-06-C-0022. OntoNotes Release 1.0 (LDC2007T21) contains 400k words of Chinese newswire data (from Xinhua News Agency and Sinorama Magazine) and 300k words of English newswire data (from the Wall Street Journal). OntoNotes Release 2.0 (LDC2008T04) added the following to the corpus: 274k words of Chinese broadcast news data (from China Broadcasting System, China Central TV, China National Radio, China Television System and Voice of America); and 200k words of English broadcast news data (from ABC, CNN, NBC, Public Radio International and Voice of America). OntoNotes Release 3.0 incorporates the following new material: 250k words of English newswire data (from the Wall Street Journal and Xinhua News Agency), 200k of English broadcast news data (from ABC, CNN, NBC, Public Radio International and Voice of America); 200k words of English broadcast conversation material (translated from China Central TV and Phoenix TV); 250k words of Chinese newswire data (from Xinhua News Agency and Sinorama Magazine); 250k words of Chinese broadcast news material (from China Broadcasting System, China Central TV, China National Radio, China Television System and Voice of America); 150k words of Chinese broadcast conversation data (from China Central TV and Phoenix TV); and 200k words of Arabic newswire material (from An Nahar). Natural language applications like machine translation, question answering and summarization currently are forced to depend on impoverished text models like bags of words or n-grams, while the decisions that they are making ought to be based on the meanings of those words in context. That lack of semantics causes problems throughout the applications. Misinterpreting the meaning of an ambiguous word results in failing to extract data, incorrect alignments for translation, and ambiguous language models. Incorrect coreference resolution results in missed information (because a connection is not made) or incorrectly conflated information (due to false connections). OntoNotes builds on two time-tested resources, following the Penn Treebank for syntax and the Penn PropBank for predicate-argument structure. Its semantic representation will include word sense disambiguation for nouns and verbs, with each word sense connected to an ontology, and coreference. The current goals call for annotation of over a million words each of English and Chinese, and half a million words of Arabic over five years. *Data* Each data directory has been stored as a Gnu Zipped Tar File (.tgz) due to the complexity and depth of each directory and the limitations of the ISO CD9660 file system for CD and DVD media. These directories may be easily unpacked using the Unix command line or using utilities such as StuffIt or WinZip under Windows.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Standard Arabic, Chinese, and Arabic.

It consists of word n-grams and their observed frequency counts for ten European languages: Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish and Swedish. The length of the n-grams ranges from unigrams (single words) to five-grams. The n-gram counts were generated from approximately one hundred billion word tokens of text for each language, or approximately one trillion total tokens. The n-grams were extracted from publicly-accessible web pages from October 2008 to December 2008. This data set contains only n-grams that appeared at least 40 times in the processed sentences. Less frequent n-grams were discarded. While the aim was to identify and collect pages from the specific target languages only, it is likely that some text from other languages may be in the final data. This dataset will be useful for statistical language modeling, including machine translation, speech recognition and other uses. *Data* The input encoding of documents was automatically detected, and all text was converted to UTF8.

NXT Switchboard Annotations was developed in a collaboration among researchers from Edinburgh University, Stanford University and the University of Washington. The original Switchboard corpus is a collection of spontaneous telephone conversations between previously unacquainted speakers of American English on a variety of topics chosen from a pre-determined list. A subset of one million words from those conversations was annotated for syntactic structure and disfluencies as part of the Penn Treebank project. Phonetic transcripts were generated by the International Computer Science Institute, University of California Berkeley and later corrected by the Institute for Signal Information Processing, Mississippi State Univeristy. The Penn Treebank transcripts provided the basis for the NXT Switchboard corpus, and the noun phrases from that subset were annotated for animacy. The Treebank transcript was then aligned with the corresponding subset from the corrected Mississippi State (MS-State) transcript in order to provide word timing information. Focus/contrast and prosodic annotations, as well as phone/syllable alignment were next added to the annotations. The previous annotations of dialog acts and prosody were converted to NITE XML. Lastly, hand annotations for markables were added to provide information about their animacy and information structure, including coreferential links. *NXT Annotation* NXT is an open source toolkit that enables mutiple linguistic annotations to be assembled into a unified database. It uses a stand-off XML data format that consists of several XML files that point to each other. The NXT format provides a data model that describes how the various annotations for a corpus relate to one another. For that reason, it does not impose any particular linguistic theory or any particular markup structure. Instead, users define their annotations in a "metadata" file that expresses their contents and how they relate to each other in terms of the graph structure for the corpus annotations overall. The relationships that can be defined in the data model draw annotations together into a set of intersecting trees, but also allow arbitrary links between annotations over the top of this structure, giving a representation that is highly expressive, easier to process than arbitrary graphs and structured in a way that helps data users. NXT's other core component is a query language designed specifically for working with data conforming to this data model. Together, the data model and query language allow annotations to be treated as one coherent set containing both structural and timing information. The data in NXT Swtichboard Annotations was converted from the Penn Treebank bracketed format in which the Switchboard corpus was originally distributed using an XML-based tool for syntactic query that comes with a ready-made Switchboard converter. Conversion was performed using a set of XSL stylesheets to extract each of the multiple XML files associated with one dialogue. The data was divided into separate XML files representing the orthographic transcription, syntax, turn structure, disfluencies and movement, or the relationship between traces and their sources. Transcription consists of a flat list of terminals: words, punctuation, traces, and so on. Syntax starts with a flat list of parses and works down through nonterminals, grounding in terminals (which are in the transcription file, but are referenced by pointers that indicate they are to be treated as if they were part of the tree itself). Turn structure is simply a flat list of turns that themselves contain parses as children, again via pointers into the syntax file. Yet another file couples reparanda and repairs into disfluencies by pointing to the appropriate nonterminals using named roles. A movement file similarly links sources with their target traces. While this representation may seem awkward, it has advantages over the original arrangement. First, it places the information in a single tree structure, with co-indexing for the crossing links that are sometimes required for disfluency and movement. Secondly, it facilitates querying the crossing structures, since they are treated on a par with other structures within the data. Although this ease is not particularly important for the initial, syntactic data, it is crucial for a correct understanding of discourse phenomena such as coreference. Third, separating the tags into their various types makes it easier to add data using external processes (part-of-speech taggers, named entity recognizers, and the like). Fourth, different people can change different data files at the same time without conflict, as long as neither edit the files they point to and both are able to lock complete paths of files pointing to the data they are revising.

This second edition updates French Gigaword First Edition (LDC2006T7) and adds material collected from August 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008. The two distinct international sources of French newswire in this edition, and the time spans of collection covered for each, are as follows: * Agence France-Presse (afp_fre) May 1994 - Dec 2008 * Associated Press Worldstream, French (apw_fre) Nov 1994 - Dec 2008 The seven-letter codes in parentheses include the three-character source name abbreviations and the three-character language code (fre) separated by an underscore (_) character. The three-letter language code conforms to LDCs internal convention based on the ISO 639-3 standard. These codes are used in the directory names where the data files are found and in the prefix that appears at the beginning of every data file name. They are also used (in all UPPER CASE) as the initial portion of the DOC id strings that uniquely identify each news story. *Data* The overall totals for each source are summarized below. The Totl-MB numbers show the amount of data obtained when the files are uncompressed (i.e., approximately 15 gigabytes, total) the Gzip-MB column shows totals for compressed file sizes as stored on the DVD-ROM and the K-wrds numbers are the number of whitespace-separated tokens (of all types) after all SGML tags are eliminated.

Since the source data is generated manually on a daily basis, there will be a small percentage of human errors common to all sources: missing whitespace, incorrect or variant spellings, badly formed sentences, and so on, as are normally seen in newspapers. No attempt has been made to address this property of the data.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in French.

The goal of the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE) is to establish the baseline of current performance capability for language recognition of conversational telephone speech and to lay the groundwork for further research efforts in the field. NIST conducted three previous language recognition evaluations, in 1996, 2003 and 2005. The most significant differences between those evaluations and the 2007 task were the increased number of languages and dialects, the greater emphasis on a basic detection task for evaluation and the variety of evaluation conditions. Thus, in 2007, given a segment of speech and a language of interest to be detected (i.e., a target language), the task was to decide whether that target language was in fact spoken in the given telephone speech segment (yes or no), based on an automated analysis of the data contained in the segment. Further information regarding this evaluation can be found in the evaluation plan which is included in the documentation for this release. The training data for LRE 2007 consists of the following: * 2003 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation, LDC2006S31. This material is comprised of: (1) approximately 46 hours of conversational telephone speech segments in the target languages and dialects and (2) the 1996 LRE test data (conversational telephone speech in Arabic (Egyptian colloquial), English (General American, Southern American), Farsi, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese (Mainland, Taiwan), Spanish (Caribbean, non-Caribbean), Tamil and Vietnamese). * 2005 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation, LDC2008S05. This release consists of approximately 44 hours of conversational telephone speech in English (American, Indian), Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese (Mainland, Taiwan), Spanish (Mexican) and Tamil. * Supplemental test data to be released by LDC in late 2009, 2007 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation Supplemental Training Data, LDC2009S05. *Data* Each speech file in the test data is one side of a 4-wire telephone conversation represented as 8-bit 8-kHz mu-law format. There are 7530 speech files in SPHERE (.sph) format for a total of 66 hours of speech. The speech data was compiled from LDCs CALLFRIEND, Fisher Spanish and Mixer 3 corpora and from data collected by Oregon Health and Science University, Beaverton, Oregon. The test segments contain three nominal durations of speech: 3 seconds, 10 seconds and 30 seconds. Actual speech durations vary, but were constrained to be within the ranges of 2-4 seconds, 7-13 seconds and 23-35 seconds, respectively. Non-speech portions of each segment were included in each segment so that a segment contained a continuous sample of the source recording. Therefore, the test segments may be significantly longer than the speech duration, depending on how much non-speech was included. Unlike previous evaluations, the nominal duration for each test segment was not identified.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Yue Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Tamil, Spanish, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Persian, English, German, Mandarin Chinese, Bengali, Standard Arabic, Dari, Iranian Persian, and Arabic.

Also available from the ACL, this release contains most of the papers that appear up to February 2007 in the web-based ACL Anthology, a dynamic repository that currently hosts over 16,500 articles drawn from a range of conferences and workshops as well as past issues of the Computational Linguistics journal. The ACL Anthology Reference Corpus is designed to be a standard, real-world digital collection testbed for experiments in bibliographic and bibliometric research. The ACL is the international scientific and professional society for scholars working on problems involving natural language and computation. Membership includes the ACL quarterly journal, Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored conferences, discounts on ACL-sponsored publications and participation in ACL Special Interest Groups. Since 1988, Computational Linguistics has been the primary forum for research on computational linguistics and natural language processing. *Data* The material in the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus was scanned at 600dpi grayscale for archival storage, down-sampled to 300dpi black-and-white, assembled into articles and stored in the "PDF Image with Hidden Text" format.

Arabic Gigaword Fourth Edition includes all of the content of Arabic Gigaword Third Edition (LDC2007T40) as well as newly-collected data. In addition, three new sources have been added in the fourth edition: Al-Ahram, Asharq Al-Awsat and Al-Quds Al-Arabi. Nine distinct international sources of Arabic newswire are represented here: * Al-Ahram (ahr_arb) * Asharq Al-Awsat (aaw_arb) * Agence France Presse (afp_arb) * Assabah (asb_arb) * Al Hayat (hyt_arb) * An Nahar (nhr_arb) * Al-Quds Al-Arabi (qds_arb) * Ummah Press (umh_arb) * Xinhua News Agency (xin_arb) The seven-character codes shown above represent both the directory names where the data files are found and the 7-letter prefix that appears at the beginning of every file name. The 7-letter codes consist of the three-character source name IDs and the three-character language code ("arb") separated by an underscore ("_") character. These news services all use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), so there should be a fairly limited scope for orthographic and lexical variation due to regional Arabic dialects. However, to the extent that regional dialects might have an influence on MSA usage, the following should be noted: * Al-Ahram is based in Cairo, Egypt. * Asharq Al-Awsat is based in London, England, UK. * An Nahar is based in Beirut, Lebanon. * Al Hayat was originally a Lebanese news service, but it has been based in London during the entire period represented in this archive. * Assabah is based in Tunisia. * The Xinhua and Agence France Presse (AFP) services are obviously international in scope (Xinhua is based in Beijing, AFP in Paris), and the regional distribution of Arabic reporters and editors for these services is not known. * The content provided by Ummah Press comes from diverse sources throughout the Arabic-speaking world. * Al-Quds Al-Arabi is based in London, England, UK. *New in the Fourth Edition* * New Sources This release marks the first edition of Arabic Gigaword to include content from Al-Ahram, Asharq Al-Awsat and Al-Quds Al-Arabi covering the period from November 2006 through December 2008. * New Data for Existing Sources This release contains all data collected by LDC from January 2007 through December 2008, except for Ummah Press for which data from January 2005 through December 2008 is included.

NIST Open MT is an evaluation series to support research in, and help advance the state of the art of, technologies that translate text between human languages. Participants submit machine translation output of source language data to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology); the output is then evaluated with automatic and manual measures of quality against high quality human translations of the same source data. This program supports the growing interest in system combination approaches that generate improved translations from output of several different machine translation (MT) systems. MT system combination approaches require data sets composed of high-quality human reference translations and a variety of machine translations of the same text. The NIST Open Machine Translation 2008 Evaluation (MT08) Selected Reference and System Translations set addresses this need. The data in this release consists of the human reference translations and corresponding machine translations for the NIST Open MT08 test sets, which consist of newswire and web data in the four MT08 language pairs -- Arabic-to-English, Chinese-to-English, English-to-Chinese (newswire only) and Urdu-to-English. Two documents per language pair and genre were removed at random from the test sets for release. For the machine translations, only output from one submission (in most cases, the participant's primary submission) per training condition (Constrained and Unconstrained training, where available) per participant is included. See section 2 of the MT08 Evaluation Plan for a description of the training conditions. The resulting data set has the following characteristics: * Arabic-to-English: 120 documents with 1312 segments, output from 17 machine translation systems. * Chinese-to-English: 105 documents with 1312 segments, output from 23 machine translation systems. * English-to-Chinese: 127 documents with 1830 segments, output from 11 machine translation systems. * Urdu-to-English: 128 documents with 1794 segments, output from 12 machine translation systems. The data is organized and annotated in such a way that subsets for each language pair and/or data genre and/or training condition can be extracted and used separately, depending on the user's needs.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Urdu, Mandarin Chinese, Standard Arabic, English, Chinese, and Arabic.

It consists of metadata extraction (MDE) annotations for the approximately 26 hours of transcribed broadcast news speech in Czech Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2004T01). The audio files corresponding to the transcripts in this corpus are contained in Czech Broadcast News Speech (LDC2004S01). Czech Broadcast News MDE Transcripts joins LDC's other holdings of Czech broadcast data: Czech Broadcast Conversation Speech (LDC2009S02), Czech Broadcast Conversation MDE Transcripts (LDC2009T20), Voice of America (VOA) Czech Broadcast News Audio (LDC2000S89) and Voice of America (VOA) Czech Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2000T53). The audio recordings were collected from February 1, 2000 through April 22, 2000 from three Czech radio stations (Cesky rozhlas 1 Radiozurnal - CRo1, Cesky rozhlas 2 Praha - CRo2 and Cesky rozhlas 3 Vlatva - CRo3) and two television stations (Ceska televize - CTV and Prima TV). The broadcasts included both public and commercial subjects and were presented in various styles, ranging from a formal style to a colloquial style more typical for commercial broadcast companies that do not primarily focus on news. The goal of MDE research is to take raw speech recognition output and refine it into forms that are of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. In simple terms, this means the creation of automatic transcripts that are maximally readable. This readability might be achieved in a number of ways: removing non-content words like filled pauses and discourse markers from the text; removing sections of disfluent speech; and creating boundaries between natural breakpoints in the flow of speech so that each sentence or other meaningful unit of speech might be presented on a separate line within the resulting transcript. Natural capitalization, punctuation, standardized spelling and sensible conventions for representing speaker turns and identity are further elements in the readable transcript. The transcripts and annotations in this corpus are stored in two formats: QAn (Quick Annotator), and RTTM. Character encoding in all files is ISO-8859-2. More information can be found on the website Structural Metadata Annotation for Czech. *Sponsorship* The completion of this corpus was facilitated by funding provided by the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic under projects No. 2C06020 and ME909.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Czech.

Each file is a text recording from one of these chat rooms for a short period on a particular day. Users should be aware that some of the conversations in this corpus feature subjects and language that some people may find offensive or objectionable, including discussions of a sexual nature. This corpus was developed by researchers at the Department of Computer Science, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. Although much work has been accomplished in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in traditional written and spoken language domains, relatively little has been performed in the newer computer-mediated communication (CMC) domains enabled by the Internet, such as text-based chat. One factor inhibiting research in this area has been the dearth of annotated CMC corpora available to the broader research community, despite the increasing use of CMC in a variety of areas and applications. NPS Internet Chatroom Conversations is one of the first text-based chat corpora tagged with lexical and discourse information. This corpus might be used to develop stochastic NLP applications that perform tasks such as conversation thread topic detection, author profiling, entity identification, and social network analysis. Each post is annotated with a chat dialog-act tag, and individual tokens within each post are annotated with part-of-speech tags. 3,507 tokenized posts were automatically tagged using a part-of-speech tagger trained on the Penn Treebank corpora, combined with a regular expression that identified privacy-masked user names and emoticons. Similarly, simple regular expression matching was employed to assign an initial chat dialog-act to each of this subset of posts. This initial tagging was verified by hand (with corrections made where necessary). The remaining 7,060 posts were POS-tagged using a POS tagger that was trained on the newly hand-tagged chat data and the Penn Treebank corpora. Dialog-act tagging on the remaining posts was accomplished using a back-propagation neural network trained on 21 features of the initial dialog-act-labeled posts. The tagging of this second group of posts was also manually verified (and corrected where necessary). Ultimately, all of the 10,567 privacy-masked posts, representing 45,068 tokens, were annotated with manually verified part-of-speech and dialog act information. Filenames consist of date, target age group, and number of posts. For example, the file 10-19-20s_706posts.xml contains 706 posts gathered from the 20s chat room on October 19, 2006. The posts have been privacy-masked in two ways. First, all usernames have been changed to generic names of the form "UserN", where N is a unique integer consistently used for each respective poster across all files. The posts were then read by humans to remove other personally identifiable information. Within each file, usernames are prepended with the date and chat room portions of the filename. So in the above filename example, UserN becomes 10-19-20sUserN.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aOnline chat groups. 0aConversationxData processing. 0aEnglish languagexData processing.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aForsyth, Eric10aLin, Jane10aMartell, Craig403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010T0505485nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041003300152042000700185245005800192264007300250336003800323336002600361337002600387338003200413500001500445500004500460506005100505520402400556520005104580546008104631650005004712650002504762650004804787655002004835700001504855700002404870856014904894856006805043m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2010    pau        u        eng d  a15856353598 aLDC2010T038 aISLRN: 782-233-680-153-50 aengachibeng07aengacmnazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 1 Chinese Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 2  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2010]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2010T03  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010T031 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 1 Chinese Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 2 was prepared by LDC and contains 223,000 characters (98 files) of Chinese newsgroup text and its translation selected from twenty-one sources. Newsgroups consist of posts to electronic bulletin boards, Usenet newsgroups, discussion groups and similar forums. This release was used as training data in Phase 1 (year 1) of the DARPA-funded GALE program. *Source Data* Preparating the source data involved four stages of work: data scouting, data harvesting, formating, and data selection. Data scouting involved manually searching the web for suitable newsgroup text. Data scouts were assigned particular topics and genres along with a production target in order to focus their web search. Formal annotation guidelines and a customized annotation toolkit helped data scouts to manage the search process and to track progress. Data scouts logged their decisions about potential text of interest (sites, threads and posts) to a database. A nightly process queried the annotation database and harvested all designated URLs. Whenever possible, the entire site was downloaded, not just the individual thread or post located by the data scout. Once the text was downloaded, its format was standardized (by running various scripts) so that the data could be more easily integrated into downstream annotation processes. Original-format versions of each document were also preserved. Typically, a new script was required for each new domain name that was identified. After scripts were run, an optional manual process corrected any remaining formatting problems. The selected documents were then reviewed for content-suitability using a semi-automatic process. A statistical approach was used to rank a document's relevance to a set of already-selected documents labeled as "good." An annotator then reviewed the list of relevance-ranked documents and selected those which were suitable for a particular annotation task or for annotation in general. These newly-judged documents in turn provided additional input for the generation of new ranked lists. Manual sentence unit/segment (SU) annotation.was also performed on a subset of files following LDC's Quick Rich Transcription specification. Three types of end of sentence SU were identified: statement SU, question SU and incomplete SU. *Translation* After files were selected, they were reformatted into a human-readable translation format, and the files were then assigned to professional translators for careful translation. Translators followed GALE Translation guidelines which describe the makeup of the translation team, the source data format, the translation data format, best practices for translating certain linguistic features (such as names and speech disfluencies), and quality control procedures applied to completed translations. TDF Format All final data are in Tab Delimited Format (TDF). TDF is compatible with other transcription formats, such as the Transcriber format and AG format, and it is easy to process. Each line of a TDF file corresponds to a speech segment and contains 13 tab delimited fields: field data_type 1 file unicode 2 channel int 3 start float 4 end float 5 speaker unicode 6 speakerType unicode 7 speakerDialect unicode 8 transcript unicode 9 section int 10 turn int 11 segment int 12 sectionType unicode 13 suType unicode A source TDF file and its translation are the same except that the transcript in the source TDF is replaced by its English translation. Some fields are inapplicable to newsgroup text. Those include the channel, start time, end time and speaker dialect fields. These fields are either empty or contain values as a placeholder.

Transcripts cover roughly 163 hours of telephone speech from 136 native Caribbean Spanish and non-Caribbean Spanish speakers. The Fisher telephone conversation collection protocol was created at LDC to address a critical need of developers trying to build robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Previous collection protocols, such as CALLFRIEND and Switchboard-II and the resulting corpora, have been adapted for ASR research but were in fact developed for language and speaker identification respectively. Although the CALLHOME protocol and corpora were developed to support ASR technology, they feature small numbers of speakers making telephone calls of relatively long duration with narrow vocabulary across the collection. CALLHOME conversations are challengingly natural and intimate. Under the Fisher protocol, a very large number of participants each make a few calls of short duration speaking to other participants, whom they typically do not know, about assigned topics. This maximizes inter-speaker variation and vocabulary breadth although it also increases formality. Previous protocols such as CALLHOME, CALLFRIEND and Switchboard relied upon participant activity to drive the collection. Fisher is unique in being platform driven rather than participant driven. Participants who wish to initiate a call may do so; however the collection platform initiates the majority of calls. Participants need only answer their phones at the times they specified when registering for the study. To encourage a broad range of vocabulary, Fisher participants are asked to speak on an assigned topic which is selected at random from a list, which changes every 24 hours and which is assigned to all subjects paired on that day. Some topics are inherited or refined from previous Switchboard studies while others were developed specifically for the Fisher protocol. In collecting data for this corpus, attempts were made to provide a representative distribution of subjects across a variety of demographic categories including: gender, age, dialect region, and education level. This corpus joins other Fisher corpora: Arabic CTS Levantine Fisher Training Data Set 3 (LDC2005S07, LDC2005T03), Fisher English Training Part 2 (LDC2005S13, LDC2005T19), Fisher English Training Speech Part 1 (LDC2004S13, LDC2004T19), and Fisher Levantine Arabic Conversational Telephone Speech (LDC2007S02, LDC2007T04) *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (tdf) with UTF-8 character encoding. They were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool "XTrans", which allowed for improved handling of multi-channel audio and overlapping speakers. XTrans is available from LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's Transcription Guidelines (NQTR), which are included with the documentation for this release. The first line of each transcript file provides the column headings; the next two lines are "comments" that can be ignored (these are used by XTrans; they are distinguished from non-comment lines by having an initial semicolon ";"). Actual transcript data, with time stamps, channel number, transcript text and additional information, begins at line 4 of each transcript file. Fisher Spanish - Speech (LDC2010S01) provides the digital audio used as the basis for the transcriptions in this corpus, in the form of 2-channel mu-law sample data with 8000 samples per second (as captured from the public telephone network), for 819 telephone conversations of 10 to 12 minutes in duration. The audio files are in NIST SPHERE format (1024-byte ASCII file headers). Native speakers of Caribbean Spanish and non-Caribbean Spanish were recruited from within the continental United States and Puerto Rico. The following tables provide an overview of the demographics of the participants. The Subjects Table file, provided in the documentation, may be used to answer questions about specific combinations of participant characteristics (including level of participation).

ACE 2005 Mandarin SpatialML Annotations applies SpatialML tags to a subset of the source Mandarin training data in ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus (LDC2006T06). Annotations for entities, relations, and events, which were included in ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus, are not included in the current SpatialML release. For SpatialML markup to ACE 2005 English data, see ACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations (LDC2008T03). SpatialML is a mark-up language for representing spatial expressions in natural language documents. SpatialML focuses is on geography and culturally-relevant landmarks, rather than biology, cosmology, geology, or other regions of the spatial language domain. The goal is to allow for better integration of text collections with resources such as databases that provide spatial information about a domain, including gazetteers, physical feature databases and mapping services. The ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) Program seeks to develop extraction technology to support automatic processing of source language data (in the form of natural text, and as text derived from automatic speech recognition and optical character recognition). This includes classification, filtering, and selection based on the language content of the source data, i.e., based on the meaning conveyed by the data. Thus the ACE program requires the development of technologies that automatically detect and characterize this meaning. The annotation efforts of the ACE program supports the development of automatic content extraction technology to support automatic processing of human language in text form. The kind of information recognized and extracted from text includes entities, values, temporal expressions, relations and events The SpatialML annotation scheme is intended to emulate earlier progress on time expressions such as TIMEX2, TimeML, and the 2005 ACE guidelines. The main SpatialML tag is the PLACE tag which encodes information about location. The central goal of SpatialML is to map location information in text to data from gazetteers and other databases to the extent possible by defining attributes in the PLACE tag. Therefore, semantic attributes such as country abbreviations, country subdivision and dependent area abbreviations (e.g., US states), and geo-coordinates are used to help establish such a mapping. LINK and PATH tags express relations between places, such as inclusion relations and trajectories of various kinds. Information in the tag along with the tagged location string should be sufficient to uniquely determine the mapping, when such a mapping is possible. This also means that redundant information is not included in the tag. To the extent possible, SpatialML leverages ISO and other standards towards the goal of making the scheme compatible with existing and future corpora. The SpatialML guidelines are compatible with existing guidelines for spatial annotation and existing corpora within the ACE research program. *Data* This corpus consists of a 298-document subset of broadcast material from the ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus (LDC2006T06) that has been tagged by a native Mandarin speaker according to version 2.3 of the SpatialML annotation guidelines, which are included in the documentation for this release. * *  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

It consists of Chinese word n-grams and their observed frequency counts generated from over 800 million tokens of text. The length of the n-grams ranges from unigrams (single words) to 5-grams. This data should be useful for statistical language modeling (e.g., segmentation, machine translation) as well as for other uses. Included with this publication is a simple segmenter written in Perl using the same algorithm used to generate the data. *Data Collection* N-gram counts were generated from approximately 883 billion word tokens of text from publicly accessible web pages. This data set contains only n-grams that appeared at least 40 times in the processed sentences. Less frequent n-grams were discarded. While the aim was to identify and collect only Chinese language pages, some text from other languages is incidentally included in the final data. Data collection took place in March 2008; no text that was created on or after April 1, 2008 was used to develop this corpus. *Preprocessing* The input character encoding of documents was automatically detected, and all text was converted to UTF-8. The data was tokenized by an automatic tool, and all continuous Chinese character sequences were processed by the segmenter.

TIMIT contains wideband speech recordings (i.e., sampled at 16 kHz) of 630 speakers in American English from eight major dialectic regions, each reading ten phonetically rich sentences. The TIMIT speech corpus was completed in 1993, being intended for acoustic-phonetic studies as well as for development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In the meantime, five TIMIT derivatives have been developed: FFMTIMIT, NTIMIT, CTIMIT, HTIMIT, and STC-TIMIT. The FFMTIMIT (LDC96S32) corpus (Free-Field Microphone TIMIT) consists of the original TIMIT database, being recorded by a free-field microphone. NTIMIT (LDC93S2) (Network TIMIT) serves as a telephone bandwidth adjunct to TIMIT, containing its speech files transmitted over a telephone handset and the NYNEX telephone network, subject to a large variety of channel conditions. For the cellular bandwidth speech corpus CTIMIT (LDC96S30), the original TIMIT recordings were passed through cellular telephone circuits. The HTIMIT (LDC98S67) corpus (Handset TIMIT) offers a TIMIT subset of 192 male and 192 female speakers through different telephone handsets for the study of telephone transducer effects on speech. For the single-channel telephone corpus STC-TIMIT (LDC2008S03), the TIMIT recordings were sent through a real and, in contrast to NTIMIT, single telephone channel. While some of these derivative TIMIT corpora consist of wideband speech, others are telephony corpora representing narrowband speech, i.e., sampled at 8 kHz and containing frequency components from about 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz. Until now, no real-world wideband telephony speech corpus has been publicly available. Due to upcoming wideband speech codecs, such as G.722, G.722.1, G.722.2 (i.e., Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband, AMR-WB), and G.711.1, wideband telephony speech transmission is already feasible nowadays, even in an increasing number of mobile networks. Hence, a wideband telephone bandwidth adjunct to TIMIT is desirable for a wide range of scientific investigations, as well as development and evaluation of systems, e.g., Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems. WTIMIT 1.0 (Wideband Mobile TIMIT) contains the recordings of the original TIMIT speech files after transmission over a real 3G AMR-WB mobile network. WTIMIT 1.0 is organized according to the original TIMIT corpus. The training subset consists of 4620 speech files, while the test subset contains 1680 speech files. The speech format of the WTIMIT corpus is raw (i.e., no header information) and specified as follows: * 16 kHz sampling rate * 16 bit, 1-channel linear PCM sampling format * little-endian byte order * signed *Data* Data preparation was conducted by converting the original TIMIT speech files into raw data (i.e., dropping the first 1024 bytes of header information) and concatenating them to 11 signal chunks of at most 30 minutes duration. In order to allow precise de-concatenation after transmission, and in order to be able to examine codec influence and channel distortion, each signal chunk is preceded by a 4 s calibration tone. It comprises 2 s of a 1 kHz sine wave followed by another 2 s of a linear sweep from 0 to 8 kHz. After having stored the prepared speech chunks on a laptop PC, they are ready for transmission over T-Mobile's AMR-WB-capable 3G mobile network in The Hague, The Netherlands. At the sending end, the speech chunks were played back by a laptop PC. Via an IEEE 1394 link (FireWire), the data was transmitted digitally to an external DAC (digital-to-analog converter) of type RME Fireface 400. The analog signal was then fed electrically into the microphone input of the transmitting Nokia 6220 mobile phone. For this purpose, an audio quality test cable for Nokia mobile phones was used. Prior to the actual transmission, the output attenuation of the DAC was adjusted such as to prevent analog saturation at the input circuit of the phone while ensuring optimal dynamic range. Furthermore, a call to the phone at the receiving end, a second mobile phone of type Nokia 6220, was established for each speech chunk separately. Using the field test monitoring software of the phones, we confirmed that they were situated in different network cells at all times during transmission; moreover, we verified that the proper speech codec, the widely used AMR-WB at a constant data rate of 12.65 kbit/s, was being employed. Note that this bitrate is by far the most widely used one. Furthermore, the internal microphone equalization of the transmitting mobile phone was switched off. At the receiving end, the analog headphone output of the receiving mobile phone was connected electrically to an ADC (analog-to-digital converter) of type RME Fireface 400. The analog input gain of the latter device was adjusted once initially to exploit the dynamic range of the ADC. Sampling was performed at a rate of 48 kHz, the native sampling rate of the ADC, and with 16 bit precision. The digital speech signals were transferred to a laptop PC again via an IEEE 1394 link and recorded onto a hard drive. The transmitted speech chunks were decimated from 48 kHz to 16 kHz sampling rate using a high-quality lowpass filter. Finally, they were de-concatenated by maximizing the cross-correlation between them and the original speech files. We followed the de-concatenation methodology of STC-TIMIT, as described in STC-TIMIT: Generation of a Single-channel Telephone Corpus, in order to assure a precise sample alignment to the TIMIT speech files. Hence, utterances in WTIMIT 1.0 can be considered to be time-aligned with an average precision of 0.0625 ms (one sample) with those of TIMIT. Basically, TIMIT's original label files (*.TXT, *.WRD, *.PHN) are valid for WTIMIT as well. However, misalignments of about 10 to 20 ms were found to be frequently produced by the channel mainly during speech pauses. Parts of the affected speech files are therefore slightly misaligned against the original label information. These channel effects may be related to the packet switching domain in the UMTS Core Network. Depending on the traffic load in the network, packets are buffered and queued, which results in a variable packet delay (jitter).

It consists of just over 120 hours of English conversational telephone speech used as training data and test data in the 2003 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE), along with evaluation metadata and test set answer keys. 2003 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation is part of an ongoing series of yearly evaluations conducted by NIST. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities. They are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluation was designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported, and to be accessible to those wishing to participate. This speaker recognition evaluation focused on the task of 1-speaker and 2-speaker detection, in the context of conversational telephone speech. The evaluation was designed to foster research progress, with the goals of: * Exploring promising new ideas in speaker recognition. * Developing advanced technology incorporating these ideas. * Measuring the performance of this technology. The original evaluation consisted of three parts: 1-speaker detection "limited data", 2-speaker detection "limited data", and 1-speaker detection "extended data". This corpus contains training and test data and supporting metadata (including answer keys) for only the 1-speaker "limited data" and 2-speaker "limited data" components of the original evaluation. The 1-speaker "extended data" component of the original evaluation (not included in this corpus) provided metadata only, to be used in conjunction with data from Switchboard-2 Phase II (LDC99S79) and Switchboard-2 Phase III Audio (LDC2002S06). The metadata (resources and answer keys) for the 1-speaker "extended data" component of the original 2003 SRE evaluation are available from the NIST Speech Group website for the 2003 Speaker Recognition Evaluation. See the original evaluation plan, included with the documentation for this corpus, for more detailed information. *Data* The data in this corpus is a 120-hour subset of data first made available to the public as Switchboard Cellular Part 2 Audio (LDC2004S07), reorganized (as described below) specifically for use in the 2003 NIST SRE. For details on data collection methodology, see the documentation for the above corpus. In the 1-speaker "limited data" component, concatenated turns of a single side of a conversation were presented. In the 2-speaker "limited data" component, two sides of conversation were summed together, and both the model speaker and that speaker's conversation partner were represented in the resulting audio file. For the 1-speaker "limited data" component, 2 minutes of concatenated turns from a single conversation were used for training, and 15-45 seconds of concatenated turns from a 1-minute excerpt of conversation were used for testing. For the 2-speaker "limited data" component, three whole conversations per participant (minus some introductory comments) were used for training, and 1-minute conversation excerpts were used for testing. In the two-speaker detection task, the evaluation participant was required to separate the speech of the two speakers and then decide (correctly) which side is the model speaker. To make this challenge feasible, the training conversations were chosen so that all speakers other than the model speaker were represented in only one conversation. Thus the model speaker, who is represented in all three conversations, is the only speaker to be represented in more than one conversation.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aConversationvDatabases. 0aTelephone callsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzUnited StatesvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aNIST Multimodal Information Group403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010S0305302nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041002300134041003800157042000700195245005900202264007300261336003800334336002600372337002600398338003200424500001500456500004500471506005100516520401200567546009704579650002504676655002004701700003804721856014904759856006804908m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2010    pau        u        eng d  a15856354808 aLDC2010T108 aISLRN: 907-893-472-321-40 aengachiaarabeng07aengacmnaarbaarabeng2iso639-3  adc00aNIST 2002 Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2010]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2010T10  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010T101 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aNIST 2002 Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation is a package containing source data, reference translations, and scoring software used in the NIST 2002 OpenMT evaluation. It is designed to help evaluate the effectiveness of machine translation systems. The package was compiled and scoring software was developed by researchers at NIST, making use of newswire source data and reference translations collected and developed by LDC. The objective of the NIST OpenMT evaluation series is to support research in, and help advance the state of the art of, machine translation (MT) technologies -- technologies that translate text between human languages. Input may include all forms of text. The goal is for the output to be an adequate and fluent translation of the original. The MT evaluation series started in 2001 as part of the DARPA TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction) program. Beginning with the 2006 evaluation, the evaluations have been driven and coordinated by NIST as NIST OpenMT. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities in MT. The OpenMT evaluations are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of automatic translation between human languages. To this end, they are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, and to be fully supported. The 2002 task was to evaluate translation from Chinese to English and from Arabic to English. Additional information about these evaluations may be found at the NIST Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation web site. *Scoring Tools* This evaluation kit includes a single perl script (mteval-v09.pl) that may be used to produce a translation quality score for one (or more) MT systems. The script works by comparing the system output translation with a set of (expert) reference translations of the same source text. Comparison is based on finding sequences of words in the reference translations that match word sequences in the system output translation. More information on the evaluation algorithm may be obtained from the paper detailing the algorithm: BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation (Papineni et al, 2002). *Data* The Chinese-language source text included in this corpus is a reorganization of data that was initially released to the public as Multiple-Translation Chinese (MTC) Part 2 (LDC2003T17). The Chinese-language reference translations are a reorganized subset of data from the same MTC corpus. The Arabic-language data (source text and reference translations) is a reorganized subset of data that was initially released to the public as Multiple-Translation Arabic (MTA) Part 1 (LDC2003T18). All source data for this corpus is newswire text. Chinese source text was drawn in March and April 2002 from Xinhua News Agency and in March 2002 from Zaobao News Service (sources indicated in docids). Arabic source text was drawn from the Xinhua News Agency's Arabic newswire feed (October 2001, in the docid range: artb_500 - artb_565) and Agence France-Presse (Feb. 1998 - Oct. 1999, in the docid range: artb_001 - artb_069). Arabic Agence France-Presse source text was also released as part of Arabic Newswire Part 1 (LDC2001T55). For details on the methodology of the source data collection and production of reference translations, see the documentation for the above-mentioned corpora. For each language, the test set consists of two files, a source and a reference file. Each reference file contains four independent translations of the data set. The evaluation year, source language, test set (which, by default, is "evalset"), version of the data, and source vs. reference file (with the latter being indicated by "-ref") are reflected in the file name. DARPA TIDES MT and NIST OpenMT evaluations used SGML-formatted test data until 2008 and XML-formatted test data thereafter. The files in this package are provided in both formats. * *  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Standard Arabic, and Arabic.

It is designed to help evaluate the effectiveness of machine translation systems. The package was compiled and scoring software was developed by researchers at NIST, making use of newswire source data and reference translations collected and developed by LDC. The objective of the NIST OpenMT evaluation series is to support research in, and help advance the state of the art of, machine translation (MT) technologies -- technologies that translate text between human languages. Input may include all forms of text. The goal is for the output to be an adequate and fluent translation of the original. The MT evaluation series started in 2001 as part of the DARPA TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction) program. Beginning with the 2006 evaluation, the evaluations have been driven and coordinated by NIST as NIST OpenMT. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities in MT. The OpenMT evaluations are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of automatic translation between human languages. To this end, they are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, and to be fully supported. The 2003 task was to evaluate translation from Chinese to English and from Arabic to English. Additional information about these evaluations may be found at the NIST Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation web site. *Scoring Tools* This evaluation kit includes a single perl script (mteval-v09c.pl) that may be used to produce a translation quality score for one (or more) MT systems. The script works by comparing the system output translation with a set of (expert) reference translations of the same source text. Comparison is based on finding sequences of words in the reference translations that match word sequences in the system output translation. More information on the evaluation algorithm may be obtained from the paper detailing the algorithm: BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation (Papineni et al, 2002). The included scoring script was released with the original evaluation, intended for use with SGML-formatted data files, and is provided to ensure compatibility of user scoring results with results from the original evaluation. An updated scoring software package (mteval-v13a-20091001.tar.gz), with XML support, additional options and bug fixes, documentation, and example translations, may be downloaded from the NIST Multimodal Information Group Tools website. *Data* The Chinese-language and Arabic-language source text included in this corpus is a reorganization of data that was initially released to the public respectively as Multiple-Translation Chinese (MTC) Part 4 (LDC2006T04) and Multiple-Translation Arabic (MTA) Part 2 (LDC2005T05). The reference translations are a reorganized subset of data from these same Multiple-Translation corpora. All source data for this corpus is newswire text collected in January and February of 2003 from Agence France-Presse, and Xinhua News Agency.

The reference translations included in this corpus have not previously been publicly available. Some of the source text in this corpus has been publicly released as part of other LDC publications, including Arabic Gigaword Second Edition, LDC2006T02 (Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua)); Chinese Gigaword Second Edition, LDC2005T14 (Xinhua, and Zaobao News Agency); Chinese Gigaword Third Edition, LDC2007T38 (AFP); and Hong Kong Parallel Text, LDC2004T08 (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region).

TREC Video Retrieval Evaluation (TRECVID) is sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to promote progress in content-based retrieval from digital video via open, metrics-based evaluation. The keyframes in this release were extracted for use in the NIST TRECVID 2004 Evaluation. TRECVID is a laboratory-style evaluation that attempts to model real world situations or significant component tasks involved in such situations. In 2004 there were four main tasks with associated tests: * shot boundary determination * story segmentation * high-level feature extraction * search (interactive and manual) For a detailed description of the TRECVID Evaluation Tasks, please refer to the NIST TRECVID 2004 Evaluation Description. *Data * The source data includes approximately 70 hours of English language broadcast programming collected by LDC in 1998 from ABC ("World News Tonight") and CNN ("CNN Headline News"). Shots are fundamental units of video, useful for higher-level processing. To create the master list of shots, the video was segmented. The results of this pass are called subshots. Because the master shot reference is designed for use in manual assessment, a second pass over the segmentation was made to create the master shots of at least 2 seconds in length. These master shots are the ones used in submitting results for the feature and search tasks in the evaluation. In the second pass, starting at the beginning of each file, the subshots were aggregated, if necessary, until the current shot was at least 2 seconds in duration, at which point the aggregation began anew with the next subshot. The keyframes were selected by going to the middle frame of the shot boundary, then parsing left and right of that frame to locate the nearest I-Frame. This then became the keyframe and was extracted. Keyframes have been provided at both the subshot (NRKF) and master shot (RKF) levels. In a small number of cases (all of them subshots) there was no I-Frame within the subshot boundaries. When this occurred, the middle frame was selected. There is one anomaly: at the end of the first video in the test collection, a subshot occurs outside a master shot.) The emphasis in the common shot boundary reference is on the shots, not the transitions. The shots are contiguous. There are no gaps between them. They do not overlap. The media time format is based on the Gregorian day time (ISO 8601) norm. Fractions are defined by counting pre-specified fractions of a second.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aContent-based image retrieval. 0aTelevision broadcasting of newsvDatabases.7 aVideo recordings2lcgft10aOver, Paul10aQuenot, Georges10aWalker, Kevin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010V0105321nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245006600182264007300248336003800321336002600359337002600385338003200411500001500443500004500458506005100503520382900554520005104383546006904434650002504503650003804528655002004566700002204586700001704608700001904625700001904644700001404663700001704677856014904694856006804843m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2010    pau        u        ara d  a15856355538 aLDC2010L018 aISLRN: 898-935-705-624-60 aarabeng07aarbaarabeng2iso639-3  adc00aLDC Standard Arabic Morphological Analyzer (SAMA) Version 3.1  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2010]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2010L01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010L011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe LDC Standard Arabic Morphological Analyzer (SAMA) Version 3.1 was developed by researchers at LDC. SAMA 3.1 is based on, and updates, Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA) 2.0 (LDC2004L02), which was developed by Tim Buckwalter. Since this is the first public release of SAMA, it has been numbered continuously to reflect the continuity between this release and previous BAMA releases. SAMA 3.1 is a software tool for the morphological analysis of Standard Arabic. SAMA 3.1 considers each Arabic word token in all possible prefix-stem-suffix segmentations, and lists all known/possible annotation solutions, with assignment of all diacritic marks, morpheme boundaries (separating clitics and inflectional morphemes from stems), and all Part-of-Speech (POS) labels and glosses for each morpheme segment. The generated output may then be reviewed by users, and the most appropriate annotation selected from among several choices. The software layer of SAMA 3.1 relies on a data layer that consists primarily of three Arabic-English lexicon files: prefixes (1328 entries), suffixes (945 entries), and stems (79318 entries representing 40654 lemmas). The lexicons are supplemented by three morphological compatibility tables used for controlling prefix-stem combinations (2497 entries), stem-suffix combinations (1632 entries), and prefix-suffix combinations (1180 entries). *Differences since BAMA 2.0* The input format, output format, and data layer of SAMA 3.1 were designed to be backward compatible with BAMA. Incremental changes to the data layer in SAMA have resulted in: * increased lexicon coverage in the dictionary files * important changes and additions to the inventory of POS tags * more possible solutions generated for numerous word forms Data-layer changes are summarized in more detail in the table_updates*.txt documentation files included in the corpus documentation. The software implementation has been updated to allow more input/output options, installation and configuration options, and smoother incorporation in other Perl tools/services. The structure of the dictionary and morphotactic tables has remained the same (the tables provided with SAMA 3.1 differ from the BAMA 2.0 tables only in size and content, not in format). Logical separation between the software layer and data layer allows the new software tools to be used with previous versions of the tables (instructions are provided with software documentation). The basic logic that implements the segmentation and analysis look-up for Arabic words is essentially unchanged since BAMA 2.0. The perldoc documentation for the SAMA.pm Perl module gives a full account of the tokenization logic. The data layer is now accessed through Berkeley DB, with result-caching enabled by default, leading to improved performance. Various utility scripts have also been added to the software package to facilitate more flexible interaction with tools and data. UTF-8 is now the default input/output and internal character encoding, with automatic conversion of different input encodings (cp1256, iso-8859-6, and Buckwalter transliteration are also accepted). With this change, the use of UTF-8 as input is now fully supported, eliminating a range of problems that would result from having to convert to cp1256 for analysis. Full details about input/output options are provided in the SAMA.pm documentation. Further details on changes in software options and implementation may be found in the perldoc software tool documentation, and in the Changes*.txt documentation files. *Dependencies* There are two dependencies for installing and using SAMA 3.1: the DB_File.pm module (available from CPAN), and Encode::Buckwalter (included with the SAMA 3.1 distribution). The DB_File module in turn requires that the Berkeley DB libraries be present.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic and Arabic.

TREC Video Retrieval Evaluation (TRECVID) is sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to promote progress in content-based retrieval from digital video via open, metrics-based evaluation. The keyframes in this release were extracted for use in the NIST TRECVID 2006 Evaluation. TRECVID is a laboratory-style evaluation that attempts to model real world situations or significant component tasks involved in such situations. In 2006 TRECVID completed a 2-year cycle on English, Arabic, and Chinese news video. The evalaution consisted of three system tasks and associated tests: * shot boundary determination * high-level feature extraction * search (interactive, manually-assisted, and/or fully automatic) The 2006 evaluation also included a rushes exploitation exploratory task, but the material associated with that task is not included in this release. For a detailed description of the TRECVID Evaluation Tasks, please refer to the NIST TRECVID 2006 Evaluation Description. *Data * The video stills that compose this corpus are drawn from approximately 158.6 hours of English, Arabic, and Chinese language broadcast programming data collected by LDC from NBC ("NBC Nightly News"), CNN ("Live From..", "Anderson Cooper 360"), MSNBC ("MSNBC News live"), New Tang Dynsaty TV ("Economic Frontier", "Focus Interactive"), Phoenix TV ("Good Morning China"), Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. ("Naharkum Saiid", "News on LBC"), Alhurra TV ("Alhurra News") and China Central TV ("CCTV_News"). Shots are fundamental units of video, useful for higher-level processing. To create the master list of shots, the video was segmented. The results of this pass are called subshots. Because the master shot reference is designed for use in manual assessment, a second pass over the segmentation was made to create the master shots of at least 2 seconds in length. These master shots are the ones to be used in submitting results for the feature and search tasks. In the second pass, starting at the beginning of each file, the subshots were aggregated, if necessary, until the currrent shot was at least 2 seconds in duration, at which point the aggregation began anew with the next subshot. The keyframes were selected by going to the middle frame of the shot boundary, then parsing left and right of that frame to locate the nearest I-Frame. This then became the keyframe and was extracted. Keyframes have been provided at both the subshot (NRKF) and master shot (RKF) levels. In a small number of cases (all of them subshots) there was no I-Frame within the subshot boundaries. When this occurred, the middle frame was selected. The emphasis in the common shot boundary reference is on the shots, not the transitions. The shots are contiguous. There are no gaps between them. They do not overlap. The media time format is based on the Gregorian day time (ISO 8601) norm. Fractions are defined by counting pre-specified fractions of a second. In our case, the frame rate will likely be 29.97. One fraction of a second is thus specified as "PT1001N30000F". The video id has the format of "XXX" and shot id "shotXXX_YYY". The "XXX" is the sequence number of video onto which the video file name is mapped this will be listed in the "collection.xml" file. The "YYY" is the sequence number of the shot. Keyframes are identified as by a suffix "_RKF" for the main keyframe (one per shot) or "_NKRF" for additional keyframes derived from subshots that were merged so that shots have a minimum duration of 2 seconds.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and Chinese.

Voice recording field notes were made by Shermin de Silva and Ashoka Ranjeewa, of the Uda Walawe Elephant Research Project. The collection and annotation of the recordings was conducted and overseen by Shermin de Silva, through the University of Pennsylvania Department of Biology, and Institute for Research in Cognitive Science. The recordings primarily feature adult female, and juvenile elephants. Existing knowledge of acoustic communication in elephants is based mostly on African species (Loxodonta africana and Loxodonta cyclotis). There has been comparatively less study of communication in Asian elephants, primarily becaUse the habitat in which Asian elephants typically live makes them more difficult to study than African forest elephants. For other current elephant vocalization research, see ElephantVoices and the Cornell Lab of Ornithologys Elephant Listening Project. This corpus is intended to enable researchers in acoustic communication to evaluate acoustic features and repertoire diversity of the recorded population. Of particular interest is whether there may be regional dialects that differ among Asian elephant populations in the wild and in captivity. A second interest is in whether structural commonalities exist between this and other species that shed light on underlying social and ecological factors shaping communication systems. *Methods* *Study site and subjects* Uda Walawe National Park (UWNP), Sri Lanka, is located at latitude 630°14.0646N, longitude 80°5428.1268E, and an average altitude of 118 m above sea level. It occupies 308 km2 and contains tall grassland, dense scrub, riparian forest, secondary forest, rivers and seasonal streams. It also contains several natural and man-made water sources and reservoirs with seasonal floodplains. There are two monsoons per calendar year, separated by dry seasons of variable length. Over 300 adult females have been individually identified in UWNP using characteristics of the ears, tail, and other natural markings (Moss, 1996). *Data collection* Data were collected from May, 2006 to December, 2007. Observations were performed by vehicle during park hours from 0600 to 1830 h. Most recordings of vocalizations were made using an Earthworks QTC50 microphone shock-mounted inside a Rycote Zeppelin windshield, via a Fostex FR-2 field recorder (24-bit sample size, sampling rate 48 kHz) connected to a 12 V lead acid battery. Recordings were initiated at the start of a call with a 10-s pre-record buffer so that the entire call was captured and loss of rare vocalizations minimized. This was made possible with the pre-record feature of the Fostex, which records continuously, but only saves the file with a 10-second lead once the record button is depressed. In order to minimize loss of low-frequency or potentially inaudible calls, recording was continued for at least three minutes following the end of vocalization events. During the first two months, hour-long recording sessions were also carried out opportunistically while in close proximity to a group. However, spectrograms showed that few vocalizations were captured therefore, this was discontinued. *Anomalies* Some audio files have 1 channel (field recording) and some have 2 channels (field recordings and field notes). Certain files were recorded at 22050 Hz sample rate: * asian_elephant_voc_d1/data/20070209/B13h00m34s09feb2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d1/data/20070209/B13h10m04s09feb2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d2/data/20070405/B14h56m48s05apr2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d2/data/20070409/B14h35m11s09apr2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d2/data/20070409/B14h38m34s09apr2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d2/data/20070409/B14h39m27s09apr2007y.flac Certain files were recorded at 16 bits per sample: * asian_elephant_voc_d1/data/20070209/B13h00m34s09feb2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d1/data/20070209/B13h10m04s09feb2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d2/data/20070405/B14h56m48s05apr2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d2/data/20070409/B14h35m11s09apr2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d2/data/20070409/B14h38m34s09apr2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d2/data/20070409/B14h39m27s09apr2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d3/data/20070507/B08h37m21s07may2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d4/data/20070822/B08h44m02s22aug2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d4/data/20070822/B08h48m02s22aug2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d4/data/20071015/B12h25m22s15oct2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d4/data/20071015/B12h59m51s15oct2007y.flac * asian_elephant_voc_d5/data/20071024/B16h12m29s24oct2007y.flac One file contains audio extracted from a video recording at 16-bit, 32 kHz. This file may overlap with other audio recordings, but was used to aid annotation because of the density of vocalizations and the number of vocalizing individuals: * asian_elephant_voc_d1/data_from_video/20070724/20070724_g01_vocs.flac *Audio data annotation* Certain audio files were manually annotated, to the extent possible, with call type (see below for a list of categories), caller id, and miscellaneous notes. Annotations were made using the Praat TextGrid Editor, which allows spectral analysis and annotation of audio files with overlapping events. Annotations were based on written and audio-recorded field notes, and in some cases video recordings. Miscellaneous notes are free-form, and include such information as distance from source, caller identity certainty, and accompanying behavior. Audio files that are included without a corresponding Praat TextGrid annotation file have not yet been annotated. *Acoustic features* There are three main categories of vocalizations: those that show clear fundamental frequencies (periodic), those that do not (a-periodic), and those that show periodic and a-periodic regions as at least two distinct segments. Calls were identified as belonging to one of 14 categories: Call Type Abbreviation Growl GRW Squeak SQK Longroar-rumble LRM Longroar LRR Rumble RUM Bark-rumble BRM Trumpet TMP Roar-rumble RRM Roar ROR Bark BRK Squeal SQL Croak-rumble CRM1 Chirp-rumble CRM2 Musth chirp-rumble MCR *Audio compression (FLAC)* All audio wav files in this corpus have been compressed using FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec). Becuase FLAC is a lossless compression algorithm, the conversion of the included FLAC files into wav files will result in files that are sample-for-sample identical to the original wav file recordings. Many standard audio tools (including Praat TextGrid Editor) will transparently decompress FLAC files, so that they may be played, processed, and examined as if they were uncompressed audio. Should you wish to explicitly decompress FLAC files (by converting them into wav files), there are many free audio tools capable of performing this conversion. Some such tools, available for all major operating systems, may be found at http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html The data in this corpus were used by the corpus author as the foundation of a paper, Acoustic communication in the Asian elephant, Elephas maximus maximus (S. de Silva Behaviour, Volume 147, Number 7, 2010, pp. 825-852).

It is designed to help evaluate the effectiveness of machine translation systems. The package was compiled and scoring software was developed by researchers at NIST, making use of newswire source data and reference translations collected and developed by LDC. The objective of the NIST OpenMT evaluation series is to support research in, and help advance the state of the art of, machine translation (MT) technologies -- technologies that translate text between human languages. Input may include all forms of text. The goal is for the output to be an adequate and fluent translation of the original. The MT evaluation series started in 2001 as part of the DARPA TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction) program. Beginning with the 2006 evaluation, the evaluations have been driven and coordinated by NIST as NIST OpenMT. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities in MT. The OpenMT evaluations are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of automatic translation between human languages. To this end, they are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, and to be fully supported. The 2005 task was to evaluate translation from Chinese to English and from Arabic to English. Additional information about these evaluations may be found at the NIST Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation web site. *Scoring Tools* This evaluation kit includes a single Perl script (mteval-v11b.pl) that may be used to produce a translation quality score for one (or more) MT systems. The script works by comparing the system output translation with a set of (expert) reference translations of the same source text. Comparison is based on finding sequences of words in the reference translations that match word sequences in the system output translation. More information on the evaluation algorithm may be obtained from the paper detailing the algorithm: BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation (Papineni et al, 2002). The included scoring script was released with the original evaluation, intended for use with SGML-formatted data files, and is provided to ensure compatibility of user scoring results with results from the original evaluation. An updated scoring software package (mteval-v13a-20091001.tar.gz), with XML support, additional options and bug fixes, documentation, and example translations, may be downloaded from the NIST Multimodal Information Group Tools website. *Data* This corpus consists of 100 Arabic newswire documents, 100 Chinese newswire documents, and a corresponding set of four separate human expert reference translations. Source text for both languages was collected from Agence France-Presse and Xinhua News Agency in December 2004 and January 2005. The reference translations included in this corpus have not previously been publicly available. Arabic source text from December 2004 has been available in LDC's Arabic Gigaword releases beginning with the Second Edition (LDC2006T02), and from January 2005 beginning with the Third Edition (LDC2007T40). Chinese source text from Xinhua December 2004 has been available in LDC's Chinese Gigaword releases beginning with the Second Edition (LDC2005T14), and from Xinhua January 2005 and AFP beginning with the Third Edition (LDC2007T38). For each language, the test set consists of two files: a source and a reference file. Each reference file contains four independent translations of the data set. The evaluation year, source language, test set (which, by default, is "evalset"), version of the data, and source vs. reference file (with the latter being indicated by "-ref") are reflected in the file name.

Historically, most linguistic resources were not generally available to interested researchers but were restricted to single laboratories or to a limited number of users. Inspired by the success of selected, readily available and well-known data sets, such as the Brown University text corpus, LDC was founded in 1992 to provide a new mechanism for large-scale corpus development and sharing of resources. With the support of its members, LDC is able to provide critical services to the language research community. These services include: maintaining the data archives, producing and distributing data via media (DVD-ROM or CD-ROM) or web downloads, negotiating intellectual property agreements with data providers and maintaining relations with other like-minded groups around the world. Resources available from LDC (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu) include speech, text and video data and lexicons in multiple languages, as well as software tools to facilitate the use of corpus materials. For a complete view of LDCs publications, a searchable catalog is available at http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/. *Data * The Asian Spoken Language Sampler provides a variety of speech and transcript samples from various corpora and is designed to illustrate the variety and breadth of the speech-related resources available from LDCs Catalog. Further information about each data set can be obtained by clicking the links in the table below. The sample files provided in this release have been modified in various ways relative to the original data as published by LDC: * most excerpts are truncated to be much shorter than the original files, excerpt duration is typically one minute and thirty seconds * signal amplitude has been adjusted where necessary to normalize playback volume * some corpora are published in compressed form, but all samples here are uncompressed * LDC frequently uses NIST SPHERE file format for audio data, but the audio files in this sampler have been converted to MS-WAV/audio (RIFF) file format for compatibility with typical browser audio utilities. 2005 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation The goal of the NIST Language Recognition Evaluation is to establish the baseline of current performance capability for language recognition of conversational telephone speech and to lay the groundwork for further research efforts in the field. 2007 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation Test Set The most significant differences between previous NIST evaluations and the 2007 task were the increased number of languages and dialects, the greater emph asis on a basic detection task for evaluation and the variety of evaluation conditions.

It is a re-annotation of a portion of the MUC7 corpus (Linguistic Data Consortium, LDC2001T02), which consists of New York Times news stories annotated for use in the Message Understanding Conference 7 (MUC7) evaluation. The series of MUC evaluations in the 1990s focused on emerging information extraction technologies. Further information about NIST's MUC7 evaluation can be found MUC project website. MUC7_T consists of 100 articles from the MUC7 corpus training set reannotated for named entities (persons, locations and organizations) with a time stamp indicating the time measured for the linguistic decision making process. The corpus was developed for two principal purposes: for use in evaluations of selective sampling strategies, such as Active Learning; and to create predictive models for annotation costs. The annotation was performed by two advanced students of linguistics with good English language skills who followed the the original guidelines of the MUC7 named entity task (which can be found in the online documentation for the MUC7 corpus). *Data * The data is stored in XML format. There is an element anno_example for each annotation example that has the original MUC7 document as text context. The MUC7 document was tokenized using the Stanford Tokenizer3 with white spaces marking token boundaries. The tokenizer is part of the Stanford Parser package which can be obtained from The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group. The following attributes are used for the element anno_example: Attribute Explanation anno_time The time it took to annotate the annotation unit of this annotation example (time in milliseconds). anno_unit_tokens All tokens of the annotation unit. anno_unit_offset Offsets for the tokens of the annotation unit relative to all tokens in the annotation example. anno_unit_labels Labels for the tokens of the annotation unit (these labels are taken from MUC7). doc_id ID of the document of the annotation example. sent_id ID of the sentence of the annotation example. anno_unit_id ID of the unit of the annotation example. muc7_org_filename The name of the original MUC7 document from which this annotation example is taken. *Dirctory Structure * The directory structure of the corpus is as follows: data: This subdirectory contains the MUC7_T data; the data for annotator A and B are in separate folders. For each annotator, there is a version of MUC7_T with CNP-level and with sentence-level annotations. docs: This subdirectory contains detailed documentation as well as publications describing applications of MUC7_T. There is also a small JavaDoc for the Java tools (see the tools subdirectory below). dtd: This subdirectory contains the Document Type Definition (DTD) for the data files. tools: This subdirectory contains a small Java API which allows users to read the MUC7_T XML data so that each annotation example is represented by a Java object. The API incudes the source code and a jar package. The source code has been tested with Java 1.5 and Java 1.6.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aInformation retrievalvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aTomanek, Katrin10aHahn, Udo403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010T1503738nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245005100177264007300228336003800301336002600339337002600365338003200391500001500423500004500438506005100483520233200534520005102866546005002917650005002967650004903017655002003066700001703086700002303103700002103126856014903147856006803296m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2010    pau        u        ben d  a15856356188 aLDC2010T168 aISLRN: 651-762-041-881-00 abenbeng07abenbeng2iso639-3  adc00aIndian Language Part-of-Speech Tagset: Bengali  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2010]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2010T16  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010T161 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aIndian Language Part-of-Speech Tagset: Bengali, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2010T16 and isbn 1-58563-561-8, is a corpus developed by Microsoft Research (MSR) India to support the task of Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS) and other data-driven linguistic research on Indian Languages in general. It is created as a part of the Indian Language Part-of-Speech Tagset (IL-POST) project, a collaborative effort among linguists and computer scientists from MSR India, AU-KBC (Anna Universtiy, Chennai), Delhi University, IIT Bombay, Jawaharlal Nehru University (Delhi) and Tamil University (Tamilnadu). The goal of the IL-POST project is to provide a common tagset framework for Indian Languages that offers flexibility, cross-linguistic compatibility and resuability across those languages. It supports a three-level hierarchy of Categories, Types and Attributes. The corpus mainly consists therefore of two different levels of information for each lexical token: (a) lexical Category and Types, and (b) set morphological attributes and their associated values in the context. Bengali (also referred to as Bangla) is a member of the Eastern Indo-Aryan language group. It is native to the region of Bengal which consists of Bangladesh, the Indian state of West Bengal, and parts of the Indian states of Tripura and Assam. It is spoken by more than 210 million people as a first or a second language with around 100 million speakers in Bangladesh, about 85 million speakers in India, and others in immigrant communities in the United Kingdom, USA and the Middle East. *Data* This corpus contains 7168 sentences (102933 words) of manually annotated text from modern standard Bengali sources including blogs, Wikipedia, Multikulti and a portion of the EMILLE/CIIL corpus . The annotated data is structured into two folders, Bangla1 (3684 sentences, 51091 words) and Bangla2 (3484 sentences, 51842 words), which represent the two stages in which the data was annotated. All annotated data is provided in both xml and text files. Each data file contains between 3,000-5,000 words. The XML file contains metadata about the material, such as language, encoding and data size. *Annotation Procedure* The Annotation Guidelines for Bangla included in this release contain a detailed description of the annotation methodology.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Bengali.

It is designed to help evaluate the effectiveness of machine translation systems. The package was compiled and scoring software was developed by researchers at NIST, making use of broadcast, newswire and web newsgroup source data and reference translationns collected and developed by LDC. The objective of the NIST Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) evaluation series is to support research in, and help advance the state of the art of, machine translation (MT) technologies -- technologies that translate text between human languages. Input may include all forms of text. The goal is for the output to be an adequate and fluent translation of the original. The MT evaluation series started in 2001 as part of the DARPA TIDES (Translingual Information Dectection, Extraction) program. Beginning with the 2006 evaluation, the evaluations have been driven and coordinated by NIST as NIST OpenMT. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities in MT. The OpenMT evaluations are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of automatic translation between human languages. To this end, they are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues and to be fully supported. The 2006 task was to evaluate translation from Arabic to English and from Chinese to English. Additional information about these evaluatoins may be found at the NIST Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation web site. *Scoring Tools * This evaluation kit includes a single Perl script (mteval-v11b.pl) that may be used to produce a translation quality score for one (or more) MT systems. The script works by comparing the system output translation with a set of (expert) reference translations of the same source text. Comparison is based on finding sequences of words in the reference translations that match word sequences in the system output translation. More information on the evaluation algorithm may be obtained from the paper detailing the algorithm: BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation (Papineni et al, 2002). The included scoring script was released with the original evaluation, intended for use with SGML-formatted data files, and is provided to ensure compatibility of user scoring results with results from the original evaluation. An updated scoring software package (mteval-v13a-20091001.tar.gz), with XML support, additional options and bug fixes, documentation, and example translations, may be downloaded from the NIST Multimodal Information Group Tools website. *Data * This release contains of 357 documents with corresponding sets of four separate human expert reference translations The source data is comprised of Arabic and Chinese newswire documents, human transcriptions of broadcast news and broadcast conversation programs and web newsgroup documents collected by LDC in 2006. The newswire and broadcast material are from Agence France-Presse (Arabic, Chinese), Xinhua News Agency (Arabic, Chinese), Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. (Arabic), Dubai TV (Arabic), China Central TV (Chinese) and New Tang Dynasty Television (Chinese). The web text was collected from Google andYahoo newsgroups. For each language, the test set consists of two files: a source and a reference file. Each file contains four independent translations of the data set. The evaluation year, source language, test set (which, by default, is evalset), version of the data, and source vs. reference file (with the latter being indicated by -ref) are reflected in the file name. A reference file contains four independent reference translations unless noted otherwise in the accompanying README.txt DARPA TIDES and NIST OpenMT evaluations used SGML-formatted test data until 2008 and XML-formatted test data thereafter.

This release includes all of the content of Korean Newswire LDC2000T45 (June 1994-March 2000) as well as newly-collected data. *New in the Second Edition * The second edition contains all data collected by LDC from April 2000 through December 2009. All material, including that from the first release, has been converted to UTF-8 (except for more recent data already in UTF-8 format) and processed in LDCs gigaword format. The gigaword format classifies newswire content into three types: story, multi and other where story refers to an article containing information pertaining to a particular event on a day multi refers to an article that contains more than one story relating to different topics and other refers to articles containing lists, tables or numerical data, such as sports scores. A word break error in the original release and in data collected from January 2002 through February 2005 has been corrected in the second edition with the result that all Korean text should display correctly. The error involved a line break in the middle of a word with the result that an affected word appeared in segments in two lines. This problem was resolved using word histograms and a few common rules based on heuristics from the data and has yielded a 90% - 95% word break correction rate. Further information about the word break correction procedure is available in Word_Break_Correction_Procedure.txt. The following table shows for each gigaword classification, the number of documents in the classification (# DOCS), the number of space-separated word tokens in the text (K-WORDS) and the uncompressed file size in kilobytes (TextKB): # DOCS K-WORDS TextKB story 217052 37546 371722 multi 31 21 239 other 7318 1034 8375 *Data * The directory structure of the corpus is as follows: . |-common_files |---docs |---dtd |-kor_nw_p1v2 |---data data: This directory contains the corpus files. Each file contains data collected during the course of a month. For example, the filename kpa_kor_199406 contains data collected in June 1994. Each document in a file has a fixed sgml structure governed by a dtd. The SGML tagging is as follows: Consult the dtd for more information regarding the sgml structure of a single article. Not all articles have information in all the tag fields. The dtd mandates that every article must have a DOC tag and a BODY tag. The HEADLINE, DATELINE and P tags are optional. Within the units, tagging is kept to a minimum, typically consisting only of tags to mark paragraph boundaries. The unique KPA_KOR_yyyymmdd.nnnn string in the DOC tag : is intepreted in the manner described below. yyyy = Year mm = Month dd = Day nnnn = Sequence NumberFor all articles that share the same yyyymmdd docid string, the nnnn substring ensures that the docid is unique in the corpus. docs: Contains corpus documentation. dtd: Contains the dtd for the corpus.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Korean.

It contains the English evaluation data prepared for the 2004 Time Expression Recognition and Normalization (TERN) Evaluation, sponsored by the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program, specifically, English broadcast news and newswire data collected by LDC. The training data for this evaluation can be found in ACE Time Normalization (TERN) 2004 English Training Data v 1.0 LDC2005T07. The purpose of the TERN evaluation is to advance the state of the art in the automatic recognition and normalization of natural language temporal expressions. In most language contexts such expressions are indexical. For example, with "Monday," "last week," or "three months starting October 1," one must know the narrative reference time in order to pinpoint the time interval being conveyed by the expression. In addition, for data exchange purposes, it is essential that the identified interval be rendered according to an established standard, i.e., normalized. Accurate identification and normalization of temporal expressions are in turn essential for the temporal reasoning being demanded by advanced NLP applications such as question answering, information extraction and summarization. *Data* The data in this release is English broadcast transcripts and newswire material from TDT4 Multilingual Text and Annotations LDC2005T16. The annotation specifications for this corpus were developed under DARPA's Translingual Information Detection Extraction and Summarization (TIDES) program, with support from ACE. All files have been doubly-annotated by two separate annotators and then reconciled, using the TIDES 2003 Standard for the Annotation of Temporal Expressions (included in this release).

The TIMIT corpus of read speech is designed to provide speech data for acoustic-phonetic studies and for the development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems. TIMIT contains broadband recordings of 630 speakers of eight major dialects of American English, each reading ten phonetically rich sentences. The TIMIT corpus includes time-aligned orthographic, phonetic and word transcriptions as well as a 16-bit, 16kHz speech waveform file for each utterance. Corpus design was a joint effort among the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), SRI International (SRI) and Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI). The speech was recorded at TI, transcribed at MIT and verified and prepared for CD-ROM production by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The TIMIT corpus transcriptions have been hand verified. Test and training subsets, balanced for phonetic and dialectal coverage, are specified.

It is designed to help evaluate the effectiveness of machine translation systems. The package was compiled and scoring software was developed by researchers at NIST, making use of broadcast, newswire and web data and reference translations collected and developed by LDC. The objective of the NIST Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) evaluation series is to support research in, and help advance the state of the art of, machine translation (MT) technologies -- technologies that translate text between human languages. Input may include all forms of text. The goal is for the output to be an adequate and fluent translation of the original. The MT evaluation series started in 2001 as part of the DARPA TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction) program. Beginning with the 2006 evaluation, the evaluations have been driven and coordinated by NIST as NIST OpenMT. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities in MT. The OpenMT evaluations are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of automatic translation between human languages. To this end, they are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues and to be fully supported. The 2008 task was to evaluate translation from Arabic to English, Chinese to English, English to Chinese (newswire only) and Urdu to English. Selected human reference translations and system translations for the NIST MT08 test sets are contained in NIST Open Machine Translation 2008 Evaluation (MT08) Selected Reference and System Translations LDC2010T01. Additional information about these evaluations may be found at the NIST Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation web site. *Scoring Tools* This evaluation kit includes a single Perl script (mteval-v11b.pl) that may be used to produce a translation quality score for one (or more) MT systems. The script works by comparing the system output translation with a set of (expert) reference translations of the same source text. Comparison is based on finding sequences of words in the reference translations that match word sequences in the system output translation. More information on the evaluation algorithm may be obtained from the paper detailing the algorithm: BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation (Papineni et al, 2002). The included scoring script was released with the original evaluation, intended for use with SGML-formatted data files, and is provided to ensure compatibility of user scoring results with results from the original evaluation. An updated scoring software package (mteval-v13a-20091001.tar.gz), with XML support, additional options and bug fixes, documentation, and example translations, may be downloaded from the NIST Multimodal Information Group Tools website. *Data* This release contains 494 documents with corresponding sets of four separate human expert reference translations. The source data is comprised of Arabic, Chinese, English and Urdu newswire, broadcast and weblog and newsgroup data collected by LDC in 2007. The newswire and broadcast material are from Asharq Al-Awsat (Arabic), Agence France-Presse (Arabic, Chinese, English), Al-Ahram (Arabic), Al Hayat (Arabic), Assabah (Arabic), An Nahar (Arabic), Al-Quds Al-Arabi (Arabic), Xinhua News Agency (Arabic, Chinese, English), Central News Service (Chinese), Guangming Daily (Chinese), People's Daily (Chinese), People's Liberation Army Daily (Chinese), British Broadcasting Corporation (Urdu), Daily Jang (Urdu), Pakistan News Service (Urdu), Voice of America (Urdu), Associated Press (English), New York Times (English) and Los Angeles Times/Washington Post Newswire Service (English). For each language, the test set consists of two files: a source and a reference file. Each file contains four independent translations of the data set. The evaluation year, source language, test set (which, by default, is "evalset"), version of the data, and source vs. reference file (with the latter being indicated by "-ref") are reflected in the file name. A reference file contains four independent reference translations unless noted otherwise in the accompanying README.txt. DARPA TIDES MT and NIST OpenMT evaluations used SGML-formatted test data until 2008 and XML-formatted test data thereafter.

It is created as a part of the Indian Language Part-of-Speech Tagset (IL-POST) project, a collaborative effort among linguists and computer scientists from MSR India, AU-KBC (Anna University, Chennai), Delhi University, IIT Bombay, Jawaharlal Nehru University (Delhi) and Tamil University (Tamilnadu). The goal of the IL-POST project is to provide a common tagset framework for Indian Languages that offers flexibility, cross-linguistic compatibility and reusability across those languages. It supports a three-level hierarchy of Categories, Types and Attributes. The corpus mainly consists therefore of two different levels of information for each lexical token: (a) lexical Category and Types, and (b) set morphological attributes and their associated values in the context. Hindi is the official language of India and a member of the Indo-Aryan language group. It is spoken mainly in the northern states of Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar as well as in much of central India and in communities in Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, Europe and North America. Hindi is the first or second language of more than 500 million people. *Data * This corpus contains 4859 sentences (98,450 words) of manually annotated Hindi text randomly collected from the Microsoft Hindi Research Corpus, sourced from the publisher WebDunia. All annotated data is provided in both xml and text files. The xml files are contained in the "XML_files" folder and the text files in the "text_files" folder. Each data file contains between 900-5,000 words.

MASC I consists of approximately 80,000 words of contemporary spoken and written American English annotated for a variety of linguistic phenomena. The MASC project is sponsored by the National Science Foundation and was established to address, to the extent possible, many of the obstacles to the creation of large-scale, robust, multiply-annotated corpora of English covering a wide range of genres of written and spoken language data. Researchers from Vassar College, Columbia University and the International Computer Science Institute, University of California at Berkeley are the principal participants the WordNet project provides consulting. The source texts in MASC I are drawn from the open portion of the American National Corpus (ANC) Second Release LDC2005T35, which includes written texts and spoken transcripts of American English from a broad range of genres produced since 1990 and from the Language Understanding Annotation Corpus LDC2009T09, (LU Corpus), a collection of various genres including broadcast, newswire, email and telephone speech annotated for committed belief, event and entity coreference, dialog acts and temporal relations. All of the words of data in MASC I have validated annotations for token, part of speech, sentence boundary, noun chunks, verb chunks, named entities and Penn Treebank syntax. Full-text FrameNet annotations are available for seventeen texts and WordNet word sense annotations are available for 1000 occurrences of each of fifty-three words. Annotations of all or portions of the sub-corpus for a wide variety of other linguistic phenomena have been contributed by other projects. Software and services available from the ANC project website enable transduction of MASC into a wide variety of physical formats. *Data * The MASC directory contains two folders: masc-1.0.3 and masc_wordsense. masc-1.0.3 contains the actual MASC corpus and consists of two folders, spoken and written. The spoken folder contains data and annotations for spoken material, and the written folder contains the same for written texts. The files in each of the respective folders have naming conventions that describe the contents of the file. masc_wordsense contains the MASC sentence samples with word sense annotations using WordNet sense numbers as the annotation values.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aIde, Nancy10aSuderman, Keith10aBaker, Collin10aPassonneau, Rebecca10aFellbaum, Christiane403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010T2203465nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245008800141264007300229336003800302336002600340337002600366338003200392500001500424500004500439506005100484520202100535520005102556546004202607650005002649650004202699655002002741700002002761700001902781700001802800700003602818700002002854856014902874856006803023m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2011    pau        u        eng d  a15856357238 aLDC2011T018 aISLRN: 365-198-419-802-6  adc00aSemEval-2010 Task 1 OntoNotes English: Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2011]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2011T01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aSemEval-2010 Task 1 OntoNotes English: Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2011T01 and isbn 1-58563-572-3, is a subset of OntoNotes Release 2.0 LDC2008T04 used in SemEval-2010 Task 1, Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages. OntoNotes Release 2.0 consists of roughly 500,000 words of English broadcast and newswire data annotated with structural information (syntax and predicate argument structure) and shallow semantics (word sense linked to an ontology and coreference). This SemEval-2010 Task 1 release contains approximately 120,000 words extracted from the OntoNotes corpus and formatted for the SemEval task. SemEval (Semantic Evaluation) is an ongoing series of evaluations of computational semantic analysis systems. The goal of SemEval-2010 Task 1 was to evaluate and compare automatic coreference resolution systems for six languages (Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian and Spanish) in four evaluation settings using four metrics. Further information about Task 1 can be found on the task description website. The task organizers included researchers from Universitat de Barcelona (Spain), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Spain), University of Essex (United Kingdom), Universita di Trento (Italy), Hogeschool Gent (Netherlands), University of Tübingen (Germany) and Stanford University (USA). *Data* The data is divided into three sets: the development set (*/data/en.devel.txt) which contains 39 documents, 741 sentences and 17,044 tokens; the training set (*/data/en.train.txt) which contains 229 documents, 3,648 sentences and 79,060 tokens; and the test set (*/data/en.test.txt) which contains 85 documents, 1,141 sentences and 24,206 tokens. The complete material for training systems is the sum of the development and training sets. Details of the SemEval task formatting applied to the data can be found in the documentation file, en.info.txt. *Scorer* The official scorer is available from the the task download page.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aRecasens, Marta10aMarquez, Lluis10aSapena, Emili10aMartí Antonín, María Antonia10aTaulé, Mariona403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T0104373nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245005300141264007300194336003800267336002600305337002600331338003200357500001500389500004500404506005100449520307200500546004203572650005003614650004203664655002003706700002103726700002003747700001903767700002003786856014903806856006803955m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2011    pau        u        eng d  a15856357318 aLDC2011T028 aISLRN: 912-956-774-503-2  adc00aACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations Version 2  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2011]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2011T02  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T021 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations Version 2, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2011T02 and isbn 1-58563-573-1, was developed by researchers at The MITRE Corporation and applies SpatialML tags to the English newswire and broadcast training data annotated for entities, relations and events in ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus LDC2006T06. This second version eliminates a number of annotation inconsistencies and errors identified in ACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations LDC2008T03. In addition, the SpatialML annotation schema has been updated from version 2.0 to version 3.0.1 the revised annotation guidelines are included in this release. The ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) program focused on developing automatic content extraction technology to support automatic processing of human language in text form., specifically, entities, values, temporal expressions, relations and events. SpatialML is a mark-up language for representing spatial expressions in natural language documents. It is intended to emulate earlier progress on time expression such as TIMEX2, TimeML, and the 2005 ACE guidelines. SpatialML includes syntax for marking up PLACEs mentioned in text and for linking them to data from gazetteers and other databases. LINKs are used to express relations between places, and RLINKs to capture trajectories for relative locations. To the extent possible, SpatialML leverages ISO and other standards with the goal of making the scheme compatible with existing and future corpora. SpatialML goes beyond these schemes, however, in terms of providing a richer markup for natural language that includes semantic features and relationships that allow mapping to existing resources such as gazetteers. Such markup can be useful for disambiguation, integration with mapping services and spatial reasoning. *Data * This corpus contains 210065 total words and 17821 unique words. Counts of unique words can be found in doc/ldc_wordcount.csv which includes all words that are not part of XML markup (e.g., without tag names, attribute names or values). Unique words are counted by comparing case insensitive transformations with preceding and trailing punctuation stripped off. Words consisting solely of punctuation are discarded. The principal change in the annotation schema is that PATH has been generalized to RLINK for relative link. At the top level, there is now a version attribute on the root SpatialML tag to capture which version of SpatialML was used. A number of smaller changes have been made to the annotation specification these are listed in Section 2 of the updated guidelines. The files are provided in both in-line xml format and aif format. The gaz-deref files contain multiple gazetteer references when they exist for a single location these different gazrefs sometimes correspond to slightly different latlongs. The sgm.dtd validated files do not contain document structure tags (such as , ) that would prevent them from being validated with the SpatialML DTD. These files total 22624650 bytes uncompressed.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aDoran, Christine10aMani, Inderjeet10aClancy, Seamus10aHitzeman, Janet403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T0204724nmm a22005053i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090041002300119041003800142042000700180245002600187264007300213336003800286336002600324337002600350338003200376500001500408500004500423506005100468520286600519520005103385546008903436650005003525650005003575650004903625650004203674655002003716700002203736700001903758700003103777700001703808700002003825700001903845700001703864700001603881700001803897700002403915700002603939700001903965700001703984856014904001856006804150m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2011    pau        u        eng d8 aLDC2011T038 aISLRN: 272-858-321-100-40 aengachiaarabeng07aengacmnaaraazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aOntoNotes Release 4.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2011]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2011T03  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T031 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aOntoNotes Release 4.0, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2011T03 and isbn 1-58563-574-X, was developed as part of the OntoNotes project, a collaborative effort between BBN Technologies, the University of Colorado, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern Californias Information Sciences Institute. The goal of the project is to annotate a large corpus comprising various genres of text (news, conversational telephone speech, weblogs, usenet newsgroups, broadcast, talk shows) in three languages (English, Chinese, and Arabic) with structural information (syntax and predicate argument structure) and shallow semantics (word sense linked to an ontology and coreference). OntoNotes Release 4.0 is supported by the Defense Advance Research Project Agency, GALE Program Contract No. HR0011-06-C-0022. OntoNotes Release 4.0 contains the content of earlier releases -- OntoNotes Release 1.0 LDC2007T21, OntoNotes Release 2.0 LDC2008T04 and OntoNotes Release 3.0 LDC2009T24 -- and adds newswire, broadcast news, broadcast conversation and web data in English and Chinese and newswire data in Arabic. This cumulative publication consists of 2.4 million words as follows: 300k words of Arabic newswire 250k words of Chinese newswire, 250k words of Chinese broadcast news, 150k words of Chinese broadcast conversation and 150k words of Chinese web text and 600k words of English newswire, 200k word of English broadcast news, 200k words of English broadcast conversation and 300k words of English web text. The OntoNotes project builds on two time-tested resources, following the Penn Treebank for syntax and the Penn PropBank for predicate-argument structure. Its semantic representation will include word sense disambiguation for nouns and verbs, with each word sense connected to an ontology, and coreference. The current goals call for annotation of over a million words each of English and Chinese, and half a million words of Arabic over five years. *Data* Documents describing the annotation guidelines and the routines for deriving various views of the data from the database are included in the documentation directory of this release. The annotation is provided both in separate text files for each annotation layer (Treebank, PropBank, word sense, etc.) and in the form of an integrated relational database (ontonotes-v4.0.sql.gz) with a Python API to provide convenient cross-layer access. *Tools* This release includes OntoNotes DB Tool v0.999 beta, the tool used to assemble the database from the original annotation files. It can be found in the directory ontonotes-db-tool-v0.999b. This tool can be used to derive various views of the data from the database, and it provides an API that can implement new queries or views. Licensing information for the OntoNotes DB Tool package is included in its source directory.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and Chinese.

It is created as a part of the Indian Language Part-of-Speech Tagset (IL-POST) project, a collaborative effort among linguists and computer scientists from MSR India, AU-KBC (Anna University, Chennai), Delhi University, IIT Bombay, Jawaharlal Nehru University (Delhi) and Tamil University (Tamilnadu). The goal of the IL-POST project is to provide a common tagset framework for Indian Languages that offers flexibility, cross-linguistic compatibility and resuability across those languages. It supports a three-level hierarchy of Categories, Types and Attributes. The corpus mainly consists therefore of two different levels of information for each lexical token: (a) lexical Category and Types, and (b) set morphological attributes and their associated values in the context. Sanskrit is the classical language of Indian and the oldest documented language of the Indo-European language family. It is also the liturgical language of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism and one of the twenty-two official languages of India. The name Sanskrit means refined, consecrated and sanctified. *Data * This corpus contains 3,703 sentences (57,218 words) of manually annotated Sanskrit text selected from the Panchatrantra stories, a collection of animal fables in verse and prose dating from the third century BCE. All annotated data is provided in both xml and text files. The xml files are contained in the XML_files folder and the text files in the text_files folder.

The package was compiled by researchers at NIST, making use of Arabic and Chinese broadcast, newswire and web data and reference translations collected and developed by LDC for Phase 2 and Phase 2.5 of the DARPA GALE program. NIST MetricsMaTr is a series of research challenge events for machine translation (MT) metrology, promoting the development of innovative MT metrics that correlate highly with human assessments of MT quality. Participants submit their metrics to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). NIST runs those metrics on certain held-back test data for which it has human assessments measuring quality and then calculates correlations between the automatic metric scores and the human assessments. Specifically, the goals of MetricsMATR are: to inform other MT technology evaluation campaigns and conferences with regard to improved metrology to establish an infrastructure that encourages the development of innovative metrics to build a diverse community that will bring new perspectives to MT metrology research and to provide a forum for MT metrology discussion and for establishing future directions of MT metrology. The first MetricsMaTr challenge was held in 2008 the development data from the 2008 program is available from LDC, 2008 NIST Metrics for Machine Translation (MetricsMATR08) Development Data LDC2009T05. The MetricsMaTr10 evaluation plan is included in this release. *Data* This release contains 149 documents with corresponding reference translations (Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English), system translations and human assessments. The human assessments include the following: Adequacy7 (a 7-point scale for judging the meaning of a system translation with respect to the reference translation) Adequacy Yes/No (whether the given system segment meant essentially the same as the reference translation) Preference (the judges preference between two candidate translations when compared to a human reference translation) and HTER (Human Targeted Error Rate, human edits to a system translation to have the same meaning as a reference translation).  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and Chinese.

The lattices were generated using the IBM Attila speech recognition toolkit and were derived from transcripts of approximately 400 hours of English broadcast news recordings. They are intended to be used for training and decoding with Microsofts segmental CRF toolkit for speech recogntion, SCARF. The goal of the JHU 2010 workshop was to advance the state-of-the-art in core speech recognition by developing new kinds of features for use in a Segmental Conditional Random Field (SCRF). The SCRF approach generalizes Condtional Random Fields to operate at the segment level, rather than at the traditional frame level. Every segment is labeled directly with a word. Features are then extracted which each measure some form of consistency between the underlying audio and the word hypothesis for a segment. These are combined in a log-linear model (lattice) to produce the posterior possibility of a word sequence given the audio. *Data * Broadcast News Lattices consists of training and test material, the source data for which was taken from various corpora distributed by LDC. Training Data The training lattices total 152251 and were derived from the following data sets: 1996 English Broadcast News Speech LDC97S44 1996 English Broadcast News Transcripts (HUB4) LDC97T22 (104 hours) 1997 English Broadcast News Speech (HUB4) LDC98S71 1997 English Broadcast News Transcripts (HUB4) LDC98T28 (97 hours) TDTD4 Multilingual Broadcast News Speech Corpus LDC2005S11 TDT4 Multilingual Text and Annotations LDC2005T16 (300 hours) The lattices can be related to the original audio files via the file train.db.gz which lists for each segment a tag-name, segment number, the original audio file, channel (always 0), start time, and end time (in seconds). A sample line is as follows: 19960510_NPR_ATC#Ailene_Leblanc 0001 19960510_NPR_ATC.sph 0 76.767 89.404 | This sample line corresponds to the release lattice labeled: 19960510_NPR_ATC#Ailene_Leblanc@0001.dc The file train.Bdc contains denominator lattices. The file train.Bnc has the numerator lattices containing the subset of paths consistent with the training transcriptions. The file train.Btr consists of the transcriptions. The file train.Bbase contains the baseline (one-best) word detections from the Attila system. The lattices were generated from an acoustic model that included LDA+MLLT, VTLN, fMLLR based SAT training, fMMI and mMMI discriminative training, and MLLR. The lattices are annotated with a field indicating the results of a second confirmatory decoding made with an independent speech recognizer. When there was a correspondence between a lattice link and the 1-best secondary output, the link was annotated with +1. Silence links are denominated with 0 and all others with -1. Correspondence was computed by finding the midpoint of a lattice link and comparing the link label with that of the word in the secondary decoding at that position. Thus, there are some cases where the same word shifted slightly in time receives a different confirmation score. Test Data The test lattices are derived from the English broadcast news material in 2003 NIST Rich Transcription Evaluation Data LDC2007S10. Bbase and Bdc files are provided, along with the db file rt03.db.gz to link the segments to times in the original waveform. Scoring scripts may be obtained from the NIST Rich Transcription website. *SCARF Toolkit* The SCARF toolkit is available for download from the SCARF website. *Related Publications* A full description of the lattice generation process can be found in Zweig et al., Speech Recognition with Segmental Conditional Random Fields: Final Report from the 2010 JHU Summer Workshop, MSR Technical Report MSR-TR-2010-173.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aBroadcast journalismvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aZweig, Geoffrey10aKarakos, Damianos10aNguyen, Patrick403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T0604218nmm a22004213i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245008600141264007300227336003800300336005000338337002600388338003200414500001500446500004500461506005100506520264000557520005103197546004203248650003503290650003003325655002803355700002303383700002003406700002003426700003103446700002203477700001903499700001703518700002403535700002003559856014903579856006803728m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2011    pau        u        eng d  a15856357908 aLDC2011V038 aISLRN: 330-650-936-529-4  adc00aNIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program - Meeting Data Test Set Part 1  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2011]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atwo-dimensional moving imagebtdi2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2011V03  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011V031 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aNIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program - Meeting Data Test Set Part 1, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2011V03 and isbn 1-58563-579-0, was developed by researchers at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida (USF), Tampa, Florida and the Multimodal Information Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

It consists of 392 hours of conversational telephone speech in English, Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Spanish and associated English transcripts used as training data in the NIST-sponsored 2005 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). The ongoing series of SRE yearly evaluations conducted by NIST are intended to be of interest to researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To that end the evaluations are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported and to be accessible to those wishing to participate. The task of the 2005 SRE evaluation was speaker detection, that is, to determine whether a specified speaker is speaking during a given segment of conversational speech. The task was divided into 20 distinct and separate tests involving one of five training conditions and one of four test conditions. Further information about the task conditions is contained in the The NIST Year 2005 Speaker Recognition Evaluation Plan. *Data * The speech data consists of conversational telephone speech with multi-channel data collected simultaneously from a number of auxiliary microphones. The files are organized into two segments: 10 second two-channel excerpts (continuous segments from single conversations that are estimated to contain approximately 10 seconds of actual speech in the channel of interest) and 5 minute two-channel conversations. The speech files are stored as 8-bit u-law speech signals in separate SPHERE files. In addition to the standard header fields, the SPHERE header for each file contains some auxiliary information that includes the language of the conversation and whether the data was recorded over a telephone line. English language word transcripts in .cmt format were produced using an automatic speech recognition system (ASR)with error rates in the range of 15-30%.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Spanish, Russian, English, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic.

It consists of English broadcast news and newswire data originally annotated for the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) program to which the Edinburgh Regularized ACE (reACE) mark-up has been applied. The Edinburgh relation extraction (RE) task aims to identify useful information in text (e.g., PersonW works for OrganisationX, GeneY encodes ProteinZ) and to recode it in a format such as a relational database or RDF triple store (a database for the storage and retreival of Resource Description Framework (RDF) metadata) that can be more effectively used for querying and automated reasoning. A number of resources have been developed for training and evaluation of automatic systems for RE in different domains. However, comparative evaluation is impeded by the fact that these corpora use different markup formats and different notions of what constitutes a relation. reACE solves this problem by converting data to a common document type using token standoff and including detailed linguistic markup while maintaining all information in the original annotation. The subsequent reannotation process normalises the two data sets so that they comply with a notion of relation that is intuitive, simple and informed by the semantic web. The data in this corpus consists of newswire and broadcast news material from ACE 2004 Multilingual Training Corpus LDC 2005T09 and ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus LDC2006T06. This material has been standardised for evaluation of multi-type RE across domains. Complete documentation for this corpus is available at the publication providers web site Datasets for Generic Relation Extraction. *Data* Annotation includes (1) a refactored version of the original data to a common XML document type (2) linguistic information from LT-TTT (a system for tokenizing text and adding markup) and MINIPAR (an English parser) and (3) a normalised version of the original RE markup that complies with a shared notion of what constitutes a relation across domains. The data sources represented in the corpus were collected by LDC in 2000 and 2003 and consist of the following: ABC, Agence France Presse, Associated Press, Cable News Network, MSNBC/NBC, New York Times, Public Radio International, Voice of America and Xinhua News Agency.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aBroadcast journalismvDatabases. 0aContent analysis (Communication)vDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aHachey, Benjamin10aGrover, Claire10aTobin, Richard403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T0804645nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041002300134041003800157042000700195245005200202264007300254336003800327336003300365337002600398338003200424500001500456500004500471506005100516520294900567520005103516546009703567650003703664650002903701650003203730650004903762650004903811650004703860650004503907655002803952700003803980856014904018856006804167m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2011    pau        u        eng d  a15856358398 aLDC2011S028 aISLRN: 560-424-742-579-60 aengachiaarabeng07aengacmnaarbaarabeng2iso639-3  adc00a2006 NIST Spoken Term Detection Development Set  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2011]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2011S02  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011S021 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  a2006 NIST Spoken Term Detection Development Set, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2011S02 and isbn 1-58563-583-9, was compiled by researchers at NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and contains approximately eighteen hours of Arabic, Chinese and English broadcast news, English conversational telephone speech and English meeting room speech used in NISTs 2006 Spoken Term Detection (STD) evaluation. The STD initiative is designed to facilitate research and development of technology for retrieving information from archives of speech data with the goals of exploring promising new ideas in spoken term detection, developing advanced technology incorporating these ideas, measuring the performance of this technology and establishing a community for the exchange of research results and technical insights. The 2006 STD task was to find all of the occurrences of a specified term (a sequence of one or more words) in a given corpus of speech data. The evaluation was intended to develop technology for rapidly searching very large quantities of audio data. Although the evaluation used modest amounts of data, it was structured to simulate the very large data situation and to make it possible to extrapolate the speed measurements to much larger data sets. Therefore, systems were implemented in two phases: indexing and searching. In the indexing phase, the system processes the speech data without knowledge of the terms. In the searching phase, the system uses the terms, the index, and optionally the audio to detect term occurrences. *Data* The development corpus consists of three data genres: broadcast news (BNews), conversational telephone speech (CTS) and conference room meetings (CONFMTG). The broadcast news material was collected in 2001 by LDCs broadcast collection system from the following sources: ABC (English), China Broadcasting System (Chinese), China Central TV (Chinese), China National Radio (Chinese), China Television System (Chinese), CNN (English), MSNBC/NBC (English), Nile TV (Arabic), Public Radio International (English) and Voice of America (Arabic, Chinese, English). The CTS data was taken from the Switchboard data sets (e.g., Switchboard-2 Phase 1 LDC98S75, Switchboard-2 Phase 2 LDC99S79) and the Fisher corpora (e.g., Fisher English Training Speech Part 1 LDC2004S13), also collected by LDC. The conference room meeting material consists of goal-oriented, small group roundtable meetings and was collected in 2001, 2004 and 2005 by NIST, the International Computer Science Institute (Berkely, California), Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA) and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Blacksburg, VA) as part of the AMI corpus project. Each BNews recording is a 1-channel, pcm-encoded, 16Khz, SPHERE formatted file. CTS recordings are 2-channel, u-law encoded, 8 Khz, SPHERE formatted files. The CONFMTG files contain a single recorded channel.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Standard Arabic, and Arabic.

It contains approximately thirteen hours of meeting room video data collected in 2001 and 2002 at NISTs Meeting Data Collection Laboratory and used in the VACE (Video Analysis and Content Extraction) 2005 evaluation. The VACE program was established to develop novel algorithms for automatic video content extraction, multi-modal fusion, and event understanding. During VACE Phases I and II, the program made significant progress in the automated detection and tracking of moving objects including faces, hands, people, vehicles and text in four primary video domains: broadcast news, meetings, street surveillance, and unmanned aerial vehicle motion imagery. Initial results were also obtained on automatic analysis of human activities and understanding of video sequences. Three performance evaluations were conducted under the auspices of the VACE program between 2004 and 2007. The 2005 evaluation was administered by USF in collaboration with NIST and guided by an advisory forum including the evaluation participants. LDC has previously released NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Training Set Part 1 LDC2011V01, NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Training Set Part 2 LDC2011V02 and NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Test Set Part 1 LDC2011V03. *Data* NISTs Meeting Data Collection Laboratory is designed to collect corpora to support research, development and evaluation in meeting recognition technologies. It is equipped to look and sound like a conventional meeting space. The data collection facility includes five Sony EV1-D30 video cameras, four of which have stationary views of a center conference table (one view from each surrounding wall) with a fixed focus and viewing angle, and an additional floating camera which is used to focus on particular participants, whiteboard or conference table depending on the meeting forum. The data is captured in a NIST-internal file format. The video data was extracted from the NIST format and encoded using the MPEG-2 standard in NTSC format. Further information concerning the video data parameters can found in the documentation included with this corpus. Note: due to a last moment update, the file lists on the published media are inaccurate.

It consists of 525 hours of conversational telephone speech in English, Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Spanish and associated English transcripts used as test data in the NIST-sponsored 2005 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). The ongoing series of SRE yearly evaluations conducted by NIST are intended to be of interest to researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To that end the evaluations are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported and accessible. The task of the 2005 SRE evaluation was speaker detection, that is, to determine whether a specified speaker is speaking during a given segment of conversational speech. The task was divided into 20 distinct and separate tests involving one of five training conditions and one of four test conditions. Further information about the task conditions is contained in the The NIST Year 2005 Speaker Recognition Evaluation Plan. The training data for the 2005 evaluation is available in NIST 2005 Speaker Recognition Evaluation Training Data LDC2011S01. *Data * The speech data consists of conversational telephone speech with multi-channel data collected by LDC simultaneously from a number of auxiliary microphones. The files are organized into two segments: 10 second two-channel excerpts (continuous segments from single conversations that are estimated to contain approximately 10 seconds of actual speech in the channel of interest) and 5 minute two-channel conversations. The data are stored as 8-bit u-law speech signals in NIST SPHERE format. In addition to the standard header fields, the SPHERE header for each file contains some auxiliary information that includes the language of the conversation and whether the data was recorded over a telephone line. English language word transcripts in .cmt format were produced using an automatic speech recognition system (ASR) with error rates in the range of 15-30%.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Spanish, Russian, English, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic.

It contains 950 hours of multilingual telephone speech and English interview speech along with transcripts and other materials used as training data in the 2008 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). SRE is part of an ongoing series of evaluations conducted by NIST. These evaluations are an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities. They are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluation is designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported, and to be accessible to those wishing to participate. The 2008 evaluation was distinguished from prior evaluations, in particular those in 2005 and 2006, by including not only conversational telephone speech data but also conversational speech data of comparable duration recorded over a microphone channel involving an interview scenario. Additional documentation is available at the NIST web site for the 2008 SRE and within the 2008 SRE Evaluation Plan. *Data* The speech data in this release was collected in 2007 by LDC at its Human Subjects Data Collection Laboratories in Philadelphia and by the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at the University of California, Berkeley. This collection was part of the Mixer 5 project, which was designed to support the development of robust speaker recognition technology by providing carefully collected and audited speech from a large pool of speakers recorded simultaneously across numerous microphones and in different communicative situations and/or in multiple languages. Mixer participants were native English speakers and bilingual English speakers. The telephone speech in this corpus is predominately English, but also includes the above languages. All interview segments are in English. Telephone speech represents approximately 523 hours of the data, and microphone speech represents the other 427 hours. The telephone speech segments include summed-channel excerpts in the range of 5 minutes from longer original conversations. The interview material includes single channel conversation interview segments of at least 8 minutes from a longer interview session. As in prior evaluations, intervals of silence were not removed. English language transcripts in .cfm format were produced using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. There are approximately six files distributed as part of SRE08 where each file is a 1024 byte header with no audio. However, these files were not included in the trials or keys distributed in the SRE08 aggregate corpus.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Yue Chinese, Wu Chinese, Vietnamese, Uzbek, Urdu, Tigrinya, Thai, Tagalog, Spanish, Russian, Panjabi, Min Nan Chinese, Lao, Korean, Central Khmer, Georgian, Japanese, Italian, Hindi, Persian, English, Mandarin Chinese, Bengali, Egyptian Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, Northern Khmer, Dari, Iranian Persian, Chinese, and Arabic.

It contains approximately twenty hours of meeting room video data collected in 2005 and 2006 and annotated for the VACE (Video Analysis and Content Extraction) 2006 face and person tracking tasks. The VACE program was established to develop novel algorithms for automatic video content extraction, multi-modal fusion, and event understanding. During VACE Phases I and II, the program made significant progress in the automated detection and tracking of moving objects including faces, hands, people, vehicles and text in four primary video domains: broadcast news, meetings, street surveillance, and unmanned aerial vehicle motion imagery. Initial results were also obtained on automatic analysis of human activities and understanding of video sequences. Three performance evaluations were conducted under the auspices of the VACE program between 2004 and 2007. In 2006, the VACE program and the European Unions Computers in the Human Interaction Loop (CHIL) collaborated to hold the Classification of Events, Activities and Relationships (CLEAR) Evaluation. This was an international effort to evaluate systems designed to analyse people, their identities, activities, interactions and relationships in human-human interaction scenarios, as well as related scenarios. The VACE program contributed the evaluation infrastructure (e.g., data., scoring, tools) for a specific set of tasks, and the CHIL consortium, coordinated by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, contributed a separate set of evaluation infrastructure. To the extent possible, the VACE and CHIL programs harmonized their evaluation protocols and metrics. LDC has previously released: * NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Training Set Part 1 LDC2011V01 * NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Training Set Part 2 LDC2011V02 * NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Test Set Part 1 LDC2011V03 * NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Test Set Part 2 LDC2011V04 * 2006 NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Test Set Part 1 LDC2011V05 *Data* The meeting room data used for the 2006 test set was collected by the following sites in 2005 and 2006: Carnegie Mellon University (USA), University of Edinburgh (Scotland), IDIAP Research Institute (Switzerland), NIST (USA), Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (Netherlands) and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (USA).

This third edition updates French Gigaword Second Edition (LDC2009T28) and adds material collected from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010. The two distinct international sources of French newswire in this edition, and the time spans of collection covered for each, are as follows: * Agence France-Presse(afp_fre) May 1994 - Dec. 2010 * Associated Press French Service (apw_fre) Nov. 1994 - Dec. 2010 The seven-letter codes in parentheses include the three-character source name abbreviations and the three-character language code (fre) separated by an underscore (_) character. The three-letter language code conforms to the ISO 639-2/B standard. *Data* Each data file name consists of the 7-letter prefix plus another underscore character, followed by a 6-digit date (representing the year and month during which the file contents were generated by the respective news source), followed by a .gz file extension, indicating that the file contents have been compressed using the GNU gzip compression utility (RFC 1952). So, each file contains all the usable data received by LDC for the given month from the given news source. All text data are presented in SGML form, using a very simple, minimal markup structure all text consists of printable ASCII, white space, and printable code points in the Latin1 Supplement character table, as defined by the Unicode Standard (ISO 10646) for the accented characters used in French. The Supplement/accented characters are presented in UTF-8 encoding. The file dtd/gigaword_f.dtd in the dtd directory provides the formal Document Type Declaration for parsing the SGML content. The corpus has been fully validated by a standard SGML parser utility (nsgmls), using this DTD file. The SGML structure for this release represents some notable differences relative to the markup strategy used in early (pre-Gigaword) LDC publications of newswire data these are intended to facilitate bulk processing of the present corpus. The major differences are: * Early corpora usually organized the data as one file per day, or limited the average file size to one megabyte (MB). Typical compressed file sizes in the current corpus range from about 0.1 MB to about 10 MB this equates to a range of about 0.5 to 30 MB per file when the data are uncompressed. In general, these files are not intended for use with interactive text editors or word processing software (though many such programs are likely to work reasonably well with these files). Rather, its expected that the files will be used as input to programs that are geared to dealing with data in such quantities, for filtering, conditioning, indexing, statistical summary, etc. * Early corpora tended to use different markup outlines (different tag sets) depending on the data source the data source structural properties were generally preserved to the extent possible (even though many elements of the delivered structure may have been meaningless for research use). The present corpus uses only the information structure that is common to all sources and serves a clear function: headline, dateline, and core news content (usually containing paragraphs). The dateline is a brief string typically found at the beginning of the first paragraph in each news story, giving the location the report is coming from, and sometimes the news service and/or date since this content is not part of the initial sentence, we separate it from the first paragraph (this was not done prior to the Gigaword corpora). For all of the documents in this corpus, we have applied a rudimentary (and approximate) categorization of DOC units into four distinct types. The classification is indicated by the type=string attribute that is included in each opening DOC tag. The four types are: * story : This is by far the most frequent type, and it represents the most typical newswire item: a coherent report on a particular topic or event, consisting of paragraphs and full sentences. * multi : This type of DOC contains a series of unrelated blurbs, each of which briefly describes a particular topic or event this is typically applied to DOCs that contain summaries of todays news, news briefs in ... (some general area like finance or sports), and so on. * advis : (short for advisory) These are DOCs which the news service addresses to news editors -- they are not intended for publication to the end users (the populations who read the news). * other : This represents DOCs that clearly do not fall into any of the above types -- in general, items of this type are intended for broad circulation (they are not advisories), they may be topically coherent (unlike multi type DOCS), and they typically do not contain paragraphs or sentences (they are not really stories) these are things like lists of sports scores, stock prices, temperatures around the world, and so on. The overall totals for each source are summarized below. Note that the Totl-MB numbers show the amount of data when the files are uncompressed (i.e. approximately 15 gigabytes, total) the Gzip-MB column shows totals for compressed file sizes, the K-wrds numbers are simply the number of white space-separated tokens (of all types) after all SGML tags are eliminated.

It contains approximately fifteen hours of meeting room video data collected in 2005 and 2006and annotated for the VACE (Video Analysis and Content Extraction) 2006 face and person tracking tasks. The VACE program was established to develop novel algorithms for automatic video content extraction, multi-modal fusion, and event understanding. During VACE Phases I and II, the program made significant progress in the automated detection and tracking of moving objects including faces, hands, people, vehicles and text in four primary video domains: broadcast news, meetings, street surveillance, and unmanned aerial vehicle motion imagery. Initial results were also obtained on automatic analysis of human activities and understanding of video sequences. Three performance evaluations were conducted under the auspices of the VACE program between 2004 and 2007. In 2006, the VACE program and the European Unions Computers in the Human Interaction Loop (CHIL) collaborated to hold the CLassification of Events, Activities and Relationships (CLEAR) Evaluation. This was an international effort to evaluate systems designed to analyze people, their identities, activities, interactions and relationships in human-human interaction scenarios, as well as related scenarios. The VACE program contributed the evaluation infrastructure (e.g., data., scoring, tools) for a specific set of tasks, and the CHIL consortium, coordinated by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, contributed a separate set of evaluation infrastructure. To the extent possible, the VACE and CHIL programs harmonized their evaluation protocols and metrics. LDC has previously released NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Training Set Part 1 LDC2011V01 NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Training Set Part 2 LDC2011V02 NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Test Set Part 1 LDC2011V03 and NIST/USF Evaluation Resources for the VACE Program -- Meeting Data Test Set Part 2 LDC2011V04. *Data* The meeting room data used for the 2006 test set was collected by the following sites in 2005 and 2006: Carnegie Mellon University (USA), University of Edinburgh (Scotland), IDIAP Research Institute (Switzerland), NIST (USA), Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (Netherlands) and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (USA). Each site had its own independent camera setup, illuminations, viewpoints, people and topics. Most of the datasets included High-Definition (HD) recordings, but those were subsequently formatted to MPEG-2 for the evaluation. *Tools* The VACE evaluation tools have been integrated into NISTs downloadable Framework for Detection Evaluation (F4DE) Toolkit. The toolkit contains small example files for each of the task/object/domain scoring combinations.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aContent-based image retrievalvDatabases. 0aDigital videovDatabases.7 aVideo recordings2lcgft10aKasturi, Rangachar10aGoldgof, Dmitry10aManohar, Vasant10aSoundararajan, Padmanabhan10aGarofolo, John S.10aBowers, Rachel10aRose, Travis10aFiscus, Jonathan G.10aMichel, Martial403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011V0503849nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245002300177264007300200336003800273336002600311337002600337338003200363500001500395500004500410506005100455520257900506520005103085546005003136650003303186655002003219700002603239700001703265856014903282856006803431m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2012    pau        u        spa d  a15856360458 aLDC2012T018 aISLRN: 347-741-147-064-50 aspabeng07aspabeng2iso639-3  adc00aModeS TimeBank 1.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2012]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2012T01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aModeS TimeBank 1.0 was developed by researchers at Technical University of Madrid and Barcelona Media and is a corpus of Modern Spanish (17th and 18th centuries) annotated with temporal and event information according to TimeML mark-up and annotated with spatial information following the SpatialML scheme. TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2005) is a specification language for annotating eventualities and time expressions in natural language as well as the temporal relations among them, thus facilitating the task of extraction, representation and exchange of temporal information. SpatialML (Mani et al., 2008) is a specification language for annotating and normalizing spatial expressions by means of geographic coordinates. LDC has released the following corpora incorporating TimeML or SpatialML annotation: TimeBank 1.2 LDC2006T08, FactBank 1.0 LDC2009T23, ACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations Version 2 LDC2011T02 and ACE 2005 Mandarin SpatialML Annotations LDC2010T09. *Data* ModeS TimeBank 1.0 contains 102 documents reporting a sea-crossing cruise by a ship called La Princesa, which took place from December 1768 to April 1769. There exist copious logbooks from that period that not only provide information about shipping routes, but also contain valuable data concerning information flows, commercial agents and social networks. The original corpus manuscript is preserved in the Archivo General de Indias (General Archive of the Indies) and is available online at the Portal de Archivos Espa?oles. This corpus was created within the framework of the DynCoopNet project (Dynamic Compatibility of Cooperation-Based Self-Organizing Networks in the First Global Age) which is focused on the study of trade network cooperation during the 15th-19th centuries and incorporates into its work maps, charts, databases and natural language documents. All text is encoded in UTF-8. The data in ModeS TimeBank 1.0 has been tokenized, POS-tagged, and annotated with space, time and event information according to the TimeML and SpatialML specification schemes. More specifically, the entities annotated in the corpus are the following: * Events: (tag EVENT, from TimeML). These include finite and non-finite verbal constructions, nominalizations, nouns, adjectives and prepositional phrases. * Temporal expressions (tag TIMEX3, from TimeML). These includeg expressions of dates, times, durations and frequencies, both precise and vague. * Spatial expressions (tag PLACE, from SpatialML). These are used for proper and common nouns, adjectives, adverbs or spatial coordinates.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Spanish.

It contains 942 hours of multilingual telephone speech and English interview speech along with transcripts and other materials used as test data in the 2008 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). NIST SRE is part of an ongoing series of evaluations conducted by NIST. These evaluations are an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities. They are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluation is designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported, and to be accessible to those wishing to participate. The 2008 evaluation was distinguished from prior evaluations, in particular those in 2005 and 2006, by including not only conversational telephone speech data but also conversational speech data of comparable duration recorded over a microphone channel involving an interview scenario. LDC previously released the 2008 NIST SRE Training Set in two parts as LDC2011S05 and LDC2011S07. Additional documentation is available at the NIST web site for the 2008 SRE and within the 2008 SRE Evaluation Plan. *Data* The speech data in this release was collected in 2007 by LDC at its Human Subjects Collection facility in Philadelphia and by the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at the University of California, Berkeley. This collection was part of the Mixer 5 project, which was designed to support the development of robust speaker recognition technology by providing carefully collected and audited speech from a large pool of speakers recorded simultaneously across numerous microphones and in different communicative situations and/or in multiple languages. Mixer participants were native English and bilingual English speakers. The telephone speech in this corpus is predominantly English, but also includes the above languages. All interview segments are in English. Telephone speech represents approximately 368 hours of the data, whereas microphone speech represents the other 574 hours. The telephone speech segments include two-channel excerpts of approximately 10 seconds and 5 minutes. There are also summed-channel excerpts in the range of 5 minutes. The microphone excerpts are either 3 or 8 minutes in length. As in prior evaluations, intervals of silence were not removed. There are approximately six files distributed as part of SRE08 where each file is a 1024 byte header with no audio. However, these files were not included in the trials or keys distributed in the SRE08 aggregate corpus. English language transcripts in .cfm format were produced using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Yue Chinese, Wu Chinese, Vietnamese, Uzbek, Urdu, Thai, Tagalog, Tamil, Russian, Panjabi, Min Nan Chinese, Lao, Korean, Japanese, Italian, Hindi, Persian, Mandarin Chinese, Bengali, Egyptian Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, Dari, Iranian Persian, English, Chinese, and Arabic.

Arabic Gigaword Fifth Edition includes all of the content of the fourth edition of Arabic Gigaword (LDC2009T30) plus new data covering the period from January 2009 through December 2010. Nine distinct sources of Arabic newswire are represented here: * Asharq Al-Awsat (aaw_arb) * Agence France Presse (afp_arb) * Al-Ahram (ahr_arb) * Assabah (asb_arb) * Al Hayat (hyt_arb) * An Nahar (nhr_arb) * Al-Quds Al-Arabi (qds_arb) * Ummah Press (umh_arb) * Xinhua News Agency (xin_arb) The seven-character codes shown above represent both the directory names where the data files are found, and the 7-letter prefix that appears at the beginning of every file name. The 7-letter codes consist of the three-character source name IDs and the three-character language code (arb) separated by an underscore (_) character. The three-character language code conforms to the ISO 639-3 standard. In addition to adding new data, the following updates were made: * Repeated documents in Asharq Al-Awsat data from 2008 were removed. * Document formatting and docid duplication problems were corrected in Agence France Presse (AFP) data. * Significant duplication of content in 2007-2008 An Nahar data was detected, and the duplicated documents were removed. More details about these changes can be found in the included readme file. *Data* All text data are presented in SGML form, using a very simple, minimal markup structure. For every opening tag (DOC, HEADLINE, DATELINE, TEXT, P), there is a corresponding closing tag -- always. The attribute values in the DOC tag are always presented within double-quotes the id= attribute of DOC consists of the 7-letter source abbreviation (in CAPS), an underscore character, an 8-digit date string representing the date of the story (YYYYMMDD), a period, and a 4-digit sequence number starting at 0001 for each date (e.g. XIN_ARB_200101.0001) in this way, every DOC in the corpus is uniquely identifiable by the id string. For this release, all sources have received a uniform treatment in terms of quality control, and we have applied a rudimentary (and _approximate_) categorization of DOC units into four distinct types. The classification is indicated by the type=string attribute that is included in each opening DOC tag. The four types are: * story: This is by far the most frequent type, and it represents the most typical newswire item: a coherent report on a particular topic or event, consisting of paragraphs and full sentences. * multi: This type of DOC contains a series of unrelated blurbs, each of which briefly describes a particular topic or event this is typically applied to DOCs that contain summaries of todays news, news briefs in ... (some general area like finance or sports), and so on. * other: This represents DOCs that clearly do not fall into any of the above types -- in general, items of this type are intended for broad circulation (they are not advisories), they may be topically coherent (unlike multi type DOCs), and they typically do not contain paragraphs or sentences (they arent really stories) these are things like lists of sports scores, stock prices, temperatures around the world, and so on. Other Gigaword corpora (e.g., in English and Chinese) have a fourth category, advis (for advisory), which applies to DOCs that contain text intended solely for news service editors, not the news-reading public. The task of determining patterns for assigning non-story type labels was carried out by a native speaker of Arabic, and the advis category was determined to be inapplicable to the data. Note that the markup was applied algorithmically, using logic that was based on less-than-complete knowledge of the data. For the most part, the HEADLINE, DATELINE and TEXT tags have their intended content but due to the inherent variability (and the inevitable source errors) in the data, users may find occasional mishaps where the headline and/or dateline were not successfully identified (hence show up within TEXT), or where an initial sentence or paragraph has been mistakenly tagged as the headline or dateline.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic and Arabic.

Spanish Gigaword Third Edition includes all of the content of the second edition (LDC2009T21) and adds data collected from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010. The three distinct international sources of Spanish newswire in this edition, and the time spans of collection covered for each, are as follows: * Agence France-Presse, Spanish (afp_spa) May 1994 - Dec 2010 * Associated Press, Spanish (apw_spa) Nov 1993 - Dec 2010 * Xinhua News Agency, Spanish (xin_spa) Sep 2001 - Dec 2010 The seven-letter codes in the parentheses above include the three-character source name abbreviations and the three-character language code (spa) separated by an underscore (_) character. The three-letter language code conforms to LDCs internal convention based on the ISO 639-3 standard. *Data* All text data are presented in SGML/XML form, using a very simple, minimal markup structure all text consists of printable ASCII, whitespace, and printable code points in the Latin1 Supplement character table, as defined by both ISO-8859-1 and the Unicode Standard (ISO 10646) for the accented characters used in Spanish. The Supplement/accented characters are rendered using UTF-8 encoding.

It contains 595 hours of conversational telephone speech in English, Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Russian, Thai and Urdu and associated English transcripts used as training data in the NIST-sponsored 2006 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). The ongoing series of SRE yearly evaluations conducted by NIST are intended to be of interest to researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluations are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported and to be accessible to those wishing to participate. The task of the 2006 SRE evaluation was speaker detection, that is, to determine whether a specified speaker is speaking during a given segment of conversational telephone speech. The task was divided into 15 distinct and separate tests involving one of five training conditions and one of four test conditions. Further information about the test conditions and additional documentation is available at the NIST web site for the 2006 SRE and within the 2006 SRE Evaluation Plan. *Data* The speech data in this release was collected by LDC as part of the Mixer project, in particular Mixer Phases 1, 2 and 3. The Mixer project supports the development of robust speaker recognition technology by providing carefully collected and audited speech from a large pool of speakers recorded simultaneously across numerous microphones and in different communicative situations and/or in multiple languages. The data is mostly English speech, but includes some speech in Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Russian, Thai and Urdu. The telephone speech segments are multi-channel data collected simultaneously from a number of auxiliary microphones. The files are organized into three types: two-channel excerpts of approximately 10 seconds, two-channel conversations of approximately 5 minutes and summed-channel conversations also of approximately 5 minutes. The speech files are stored as 8-bit u-law speech signals in separate SPHERE files. In addition to the standard header fields, the SPHERE header for each file contains some auxiliary information that includes the language of the conversation and whether the data was recorded over a telephone line. English language transcripts in .ctm format were produced using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Yue Chinese, Urdu, Thai, Russian, Korean, Hindi, English, Mandarin Chinese, Bengali, Standard Arabic, Chinese, and Arabic.

It is a comprehensive archive of newswire text data that has been acquired from Chinese news sources by LDC at the University of Pennsylvania. Chinese Gigaword Fifth Edition includes all of the content of the fourth edition of Chinese Gigaword (LDC2009T27) plus new data covering the period from January 2009 through December 2010. Eight distinct sources of Chinese newswire are represented here: * Agence France Presse(afp_cmn) * Central News Agency, Taiwan(cna_cmn) * Central News Service(cns_cmn) * Guangming Daily(gmw_cmn) * Peoples Daily(pda_cmn) * Peoples Liberation Army Daily(pla_cmn) * Xinhua News Agency(xin_cmn) * Zaobao Newspaper(zbn_cmn) The seven-letter codes in the parentheses above are used for the directory names and data files for each source and are also used (in ALL_CAPS) as part of the unique DOC id string assigned to each news article. Articles covering the period from January 2009 through December 2010 have been added to the Agence France Presse, Central News Agency (CNA), Central News Service, Guangming Daily, Peoples Liberation Army Daily and Xinhua News Agency data sets. The data from Peoples Daily covers the period from late June 2009 through December 2010. No new data from Zaobao has been added. Additionally, Zaobao and CNA data included in previous releases were found to contain non-normalized full-width characters. Those files have been normalized to correct that issue. *Data* Each data file name consists of the 7-letter prefix (e.g., xin_cmn) and an underscore character (_) followed by a 6-digit date (representing the year and month during which the file contents were originally published by the respective news source), followed by a .gz file extension, indicating that the file contents have been compressed using the GNU gzip compression utility (RFC 1952). So, each file contains all the usable data received by LDC for the given month from the given news source. All text data are presented in SGML form, using a very simple, minimal markup structure. The file gigaword_c.dtd in the docs directory provides the formal Document Type Declaration for parsing the SGML content. The corpus has been fully validated by a standard SGML parser utility (nsgmls), using this DTD file. For this release, all sources have received a uniform treatment in terms of quality control, and we have applied a rudimentary (and _approximate_) categorization of DOC units into four distinct types. The classification is indicated by the type=string attribute that is included in each opening DOC tag. The four types are: * story: This is by far the most frequent type, and it represents the most typical newswire item: a coherent report on a particular topic or event, consisting of paragraphs and full sentences. * multi: This type of DOC contains a series of unrelated blurbs, each of which briefly describes a particular topic or event this is typically applied to DOCs that contain summaries of todays news, news briefs in ... (some general area like finance or sports), and so on. * advis : (short for advisory) These are DOCs which the news service addresses to news editors -- they are not intended for publication to the end users (the populations who read the news). We also find a lot of formulaic, repetitive content in DOCs of this type (contact phone numbers, etc). * other: This represents DOCs that clearly do not fall into any of the above types -- in general, items of this type are intended for broad circulation (they are not advisories), they may be topically coherent (unlike multi type DOCs), and they typically do not contain paragraphs or sentences (they arent really stories) these are things like lists of sports scores, stock prices, temperatures around the world, and so on.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

Specifically, the corpus consists of 770 hours of English microphone speech along with transcripts and other materials used as supplemental data in the 2008 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE) and in a follow-up evaluation to SRE08. NIST SRE is part of an ongoing series of evaluations conducted by NIST. These evaluations are an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities. They are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluation is designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported, and to be accessible to those wishing to participate. The 2008 evaluation was distinguished from prior evaluations, in particular those in 2005 and 2006, by including not only conversational telephone speech data but also conversational speech data of comparable duration recorded over a microphone channel involving an interview scenario.The follow-up evaluation focused on speaker detection in the context of conversational interview type speech and was designed to measure the performance of SRE08 systems in previously unexposed test segment channel conditions. LDC previously released the main 2008 NIST SRE Evaluation in three parts as 2008 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Training Set Part 1 LDC2011S05, 2008 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Training Set Part 2 LDC2011S07 and 2008 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Test Set LDC2011S08. Additional documentation is available at the NIST web site for the 2008 SRE and within the 2008 SRE Evaluation Plan and the Plan for Follow-up Evaluation to SRE08. *Data* The speech data in this release was collected in 2007 by LDC at its Human Subjects Data Collection Laboratories in Philadelphia and by the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at the University of California, Berkeley. This collection was part of the Mixer 5 project, which was designed to support the development of robust speaker recognition technology by providing carefully collected and audited speech from a large pool of speakers recorded simultaneously across numerous microphones and in different communicative situations and/or in multiple languages. Mixer participants were native English and bilingual English speakers. The microphone speech in this corpus is in English and consists of approximately 3 minute and 30 minute interview excerpts.. This supplemental data is split into four different parts which provide: * new training data distributed to 2008 SRE participants * additional data distributed to participants in the 2008 SRE follow-up evaluation * interviewer channel files for the 2008 SRE main test (released after the evaluations) * supplemental training data (released after the evaluations) English language transcripts in .cfm format were produced using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and are included for some, but not all, speech data.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aNIST Multimodal Information Group403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011S1106884nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245004600141264007300187336003800260336003300298337002600331338003200357500001500389500004500404506005100449520531500500520005105815546004205866650005705908650005105965650007406016655002806090700001906118700001806137700002506155700001706180700001806197700002506215700001706240856014906257856006806406m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2012    pau        u        eng d  a15856360378 aLDC2012S028 aISLRN: 239-915-065-794-5  adc00aTORGO Database of Dysarthric Articulation  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2012]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2012S02  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012S021 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aTORGO Database of Dysarthric Articulation was developed by the University of Toronto's departments of Computer Science and Speech Language Pathology in collaboration with the Holland-Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital in Toronto, Canada. It contains approximately 23 hours of English speech data, accompanying transcripts and documentation from 8 speakers (5 males, 3 females) with cerebral palsy (CP) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and from 7 speakers (4 males, 3 females) from a non-dysarthric control group. CP and ALS are examples of dysarthria which is caused by disruptions in the neuro-motor interface that distort motor commands to the vocal articulators, resulting in atypical and relatively unintelligible speech in most cases. The TORGO database is primarily a resource for developing advanced automatic speaker recognition (ASR) models suited to the needs of people with dysarthria, but it is also applicable to non-dysarthric speech. The inability of modern ASR to effectively understand dysarthric speech is a problem since the more general physical disabilities often associated with the condition can make other forms of computer input, such as computer keyboards or touch screens, difficult to use. *Data* The data consists of aligned acoustics and measured 3D articulatory features from the speakers carried out using the 3D AG500 electro-magnetic articulograph (EMA) system (Carstens Medizinelektronik GmbH, Lenglern, Germany) with fully-automated calibration. This system allows for 3D recordings of articulatory movements inside and outside the vocal tract, thus providing a detailed window on the nature and direction of speech-related activity. The data was collected between 2008 and 2010 in Toronto, Canada. All subjects read text consisting of non-words, short words and restricted sentences from a 19-inch LCD screen. The restricted sentences included 162 sentences from the sentence intelligibility section of Assessment of intelligibility of dysarthric speech (Yorkston & Beukelman, 1981) and 460 sentences derived from the TIMIT database. The unrestricted sentences were elicited by asking participants to spontaneously describe 30 images in interesting situations taken randomly from Webber Photo Cards - Story Starters (Webber, 2005), designed to prompt students to tell or write a story. Data is organized by speaker and by the session in which each speaker recorded data. Each speaker was assigned a code and given their own file directory. The code for female speakers begins with F, and the code for male speakers begins with M. If the speaker was a member of the control group, the letter C follows the gender code. The last two digits of the code indicate the order in which that subject was recruited. For example, speaker FC02 was the second female speaker without dysarthria recruited. Note that some speakers were intentionally left out of the data, and thus, there are gaps in the numbering. Each speakers directory contains Session directories which encapsulate data recorded in the respective visit and occasionally, a Notes directory which can include Frenchay assessments (test for the measurement, description and diagnosis of dysarthria), notes about sessions (e.g., sensor errors), and other relevant notes. Each Session directory can, but does not necessarily, contain the following content: * alignment.txt: This is a text file containing the sample offsets between audio files recorded simultaneously by the array microphone and the head-worn microphone. * amps: These directories contain raw *.amp and *.ini files produced by the AG500 articulograph. * phn_*: These directories contain phonemic transcriptions of audio data. Each file is plain text with a *.PHN file extensions and a filename referring to the utterance number. These files were generated using the free Wavesurfer tool. * pos: These directories contain the head-corrected positions, velocities, and orientations of sensor coils for each utterance, as generated by the AG500 articulograph. * prompts: These directories contain orthographic transcriptions. * rawpos: These directories are equivalent to the pos directories except that their articulographic content is not head-normalized to a constant upright position. * wav_*: These directories contain the acoustics. Each file is a RIFF (little-endian) WAVE audio file (Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, mono 16000 Hz). * wavall: These directories contains a stereo recording in which one channel contains the recorded acoustics and the other channel contains the analog peaks associated with the sweep signal, which is used by the AG500 hardware for synchronization. Additionally, sessions recorded with the AG500 articulograph are marked with the file EMA, and those recorded with the video-based system are marked with the file VIDEO. Files with a date form as the filename and a txt extension (e.g. april232008cal2.txt, jan28cal3.txt) are the measured responses from calibration. The *.log and *.calset files contain descriptions of the calibration process, but not the final result of calibration. See the readme file and the AG500 Wiki for more complete descriptions of the possible subfolders and of the AG500 specific files. Also, see session_contents.tsv for a tab separated table of each sessions subfolders and metadata files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzCanadavDatabases. 0aCerebral palsiedzCanadaxLanguagevDatabases. 0aAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisxPatientszCanadaxLanguagevDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aRudzicz, Frank10aHirst, Graeme10avan Lieshout, Pascal10aPenn, Gerald10aShein, Fraser10aNamasivayam, Aravind10aWolff, Talya403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012S0204442nmm a22004213i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245003900141264007300180336003800253336003300291337002600324338003200350500001500382500004500397506005100442520282200493520005103315546004203366650006403408650006603472650005703538655002803595700003303623700002003656700002303676700001803699700001803717700003003735700001703765700002103782856014903803856006803952m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2012    pau        u        eng d  a15856360538 aLDC2012S038 aISLRN: 167-450-243-260-2  adc00aDigital Archive of Southern Speech  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2012]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2012S03  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012S031 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aDigital Archive of Southern Speech (DASS) was developed by the University of Georgia. It is a subset of the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States (LAGS), which is in turn part of the Linguistic Atlas Project (LAP). DASS contains approximately 370 hours of English speech data from 30 female speakers and 34 male speakers in .wav format and in .mp3 format, along with associated metadata about the speakers and the recordings and maps in .jpeg format relating to the recording locations. LAP consists of a set of survey research projects about the words and pronunciation of everyday American English, the largest project of its kind in the United States. Interviews with thousands of native speakers across the country have been carried out since 1929. LAGS surveyed the everyday speech of Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas in a series of 914 audio-taped interviews conducted from 1968-1983. Interviews average approximately six hours in length the systematic LAGS tape archive amounts to 5500 hours of sound recordings. DASS is a collection of 64 interviews from LAGS selected to cover a range of speech across the region and to represent multiple education levels and ethnic backgrounds. This release is distributed on an external hard drive and contains instructions for using the media and navigating to the LICHEN program. Digital Archive of Southern Speech - NLP Version (LDC2016S05), an alternate version suitable for natural language processing and human language technology applications is also available. *Data* The DASS speakers average age is 61 years there are 30 women and 34 men from the Gulf States region represented in this release. The interviews cover common topics such as family, the weather, household articles and activities, agriculture and social connections. The interviews were originally recorded in the field on reel-to-reel audio tape. A digital version of every reel of tape was then made, one .wav file per reel, usually about one hour of sound. Each interview thus consists of a set of 3 to 13 reels, or roughly 3 to 13 interview hours. Personally identifying or sensitive information in the files was replaced with a tone to protect the privacy and to assure ethical treatment of speakers. Each .wav file is split into multiple .mp3 files based on the topic of conversation and labeled thusly. Included spreadsheets provide information about the speakers, the labels used for topics and the sound files. Also included in this release is a version of the LICHEN software developed at the University of Oulu, Finland. LICHEN allows users to browse and search through the audio data in a more advanced fashion using a graphical interface. Further information and instructions for LICHEN can be found within the docs folder of this release.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzUnited StatesvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishzSouthern StatesvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagezUnited StatesxDiscourse analysis.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aKretzschmar, William A., Jr.10aBounds, Paulina10aHettel, Jacqueline10aCoats, Steven10aPederson, Lee10aOpas-Hänninen, Lisa Lena10aJuuso, Ilkka10aSeppänen, Tapio403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012S0304428nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041003300147042000700180245003300187264007300220336003800293336003300331337002600364338003200390500001500422500004500437506005100482520303300533520005103566546009303617650003103710650004003741655002803781700002203809700001803831856014903849856006803998m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2012    pau        u        dra d  a15856360618 aLDC2012S048 aISLRN: 841-757-472-203-80 adrabeng07amkbamjtakmjbeng2iso639-3  adc00aMalto Speech and Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2012]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2012S04  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012S041 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aMalto Speech and Transcripts was developed by Masato Kobayashi, Associate Professor in Linguistics at the University of Tokyo (Japan), and Bablu Tirkey, research scholar at the Tribal and Regional Languages Department, Ranchi University (India). It contains approximately 8 hours of Malto speech data collected between 2005 and 2009 from 27 speakers (22 males, 5 females). Also included are accompanying transcripts, English translations and glosses for 6 hours of the collection. Speakers were asked to talk about themselves, their lives, rituals and folklore elicitation interviews were then conducted. The goal of the work was to present the current state and dialectal variation of Malto. Malto is a Dravidian language spoken in northeastern India (principally the states of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal) and Bangladesh by people called the Pahariyas. Indian census data places the number of Malto speakers in a range of between 100,000-200,000 total speakers. Most Malto speakers live in the three northeastern districts of Jharkhand, i.e, Sahebganj, Godda and Pakur the fieldwork that resulted in this corpus was conducted in those districts. Of the Pahariyas in that area, three subtribes, the Sawriya Pahariyas, the Mal Pahariyas and the Kumarbhag Pahariyas, primarily speak Malto. (Kobayashi 3) Pahariya villages or hamlets are located on hilly tracts and in the lowlands are often separated by non-Parahiya villages. As a result, Malto varies from village to village. It may be more accurate to consider Malto a continuum of dialects rather than a unitary language. The three major dialects -- Sawriya Pahariya, Mal Pahariya, and Kumarbhag Pahariya -- correspond to the principal sub-tribal communities. (Kobayashi 14) For further reading on Malto, consult Texts and Grammar of Malto (2012) by Masato Kobayashi published by Kotoba Books, Vizianagaram, India and sold by the book distributors: Mary Martin Booksellers, 123 Third Street, Tatabad, Coimbatore 641012, India. They can be contacted at info@marymartin.com or at books.kotoba@gmail.com. *Data* The transcribed data accounts for 6 hours of the collection and contains 21 speakers (17 male, 4 female). The untranscribed data accounts for 2 hours of the collection and contains 10 speakers (9 male, 1 female). Four of the male speakers are present in both groups. All audio is presented in .wav format. Each audio file name includes a subject number, village name, speaker name and the topic discussed. The transcripts and glossary are UTF-8 text files. Because of ambiguities that occur when writing Malto in Devenagari script, the transcripts were developed using Roman script with symbols adapted from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) but are not considered to be phonetic transcripts. Consult readme.txt and untran_speaker.txt for further information about the corpus, its collection and the speakers. The transcription and glosses are split into three text files consult the readme to determine which audio files are covered by each transcript.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mal Paharia, Sauria Paharia, and Kumarbhag Paharia.

It consists of 599 distinct newswire stories from the Lebanese publication An Nahar translated from Arabic to English and annotated for part-of-speech and syntactic structure. This corpus is part of an ongoing effort at LDC to produce parallel Arabic and English treebanks. The files in this release are parallel with those in Arabic Treebank: Part 3 - v3.2 (LDC2010T08). Other parallel releases are (1) Arabic Treebank: Part 1 v 2.0 (LDC2003T06) (Agence France Presse newswire) and Arabic Treebank: Part 1 - 10K-word English Translation (LDC2003T07) and (2) Arabic Treebank: Part 1 v 3.0 (POS with full vocalization + syntactic analysis) (LDC2005T02) (Agence France Presse newswire) and its translated English counterpart English-Arabic Treebank v 1.0 (LDC2006T10). The guidelines followed for both part-of-speech and syntactic annotation are Penn Treebank II style, with changes in the tokenization of hyphenated words, part-of-speech and tree changes necessitated by those tokenization changes and revisions to the syntactic annotation to comply with the updated annotation guidelines (including the Treebank-PropBank merge or Treebank IIa and treebank c changes). *Data* The data consists of 461,489 tokens in 599 individual files. The news stories in this release were published in An Nahar in 2002. The English sources files (translated from the Arabic) were automatically tokenized, part-of-speech tagged and parsed the tokens, tags and parses were manually corrected. The quality control process consisted of a series of specific searches for over 100 types of potential inconsistency and parse or annotation error. Any errors found in those searches were manually corrected. The steps occurred in the following order: * Automatic tokenization * Human correction * Automatic pre-tag and pre-parse * Human annotation * QC correction * Automatic scripts for treebank c revisions Annotations are in the following two formats: * Penn Style Trees * Bracketed tree files following the basic form (NODE (TAG token)). Each sentence is surrounded by a pair of empty parentheses. * AG xml * TreeEditor .xml stand-off annotation files. These files contain the POS and Treebank annotation and reference the source files by character offset. DTD files for the AG xml files were moved from their original location indicated in the readme to be more consistence with LDC publications. *Sponsorship* This work was sponsored in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

While most of those who gave testimony were Jewish survivors, the Foundation also interviewed homosexual survivors, Jehovah Witness survivors, liberators and liberation witnesses, political prisoners, rescuers and aid providers, Roma and Sinti (Gypsy) survivors, survivors of eugenics policies, and war crimes trials participants. Within several years, the Foundations Visual History Archive held nearly 52,000 video testimonies in 32 languages representing 56 countries. It is the largest archive of its kind in the world. In 2006, the Foundation became part of the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and was renamed as the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education. The goal of the MALACH project was to develop methods for improved access to large multinational spoken archives. The focus was advancing the state of the art of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and information retrieval. The characteristics of the USC-SFI collection -- unconstrained, natural speech filled with disfluencies, heavy accents, age-related coarticulations, un-cued speaker and language switching and emotional speech -- were considered well-suited for that task. The work centered on five languages: English, Czech, Russian, Polish and Slovak. USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts English was developed for the English speech recognition experiments. *Data* The speech data in this release was collected beginning in 1994 under a wide variety of conditions ranging from quiet to noisy (e.g., airplane overflights, wind noise, background conversations and highway noise). Original interviews were recorded on Sony Beta SP tapes, then digitized into a 3 MB/s MPEG-1 stream with 128 kb/s (44 kHz) stereo audio. The sound files in this release are compressed in MP3 format at a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz. Approximately 25,000 of all USC-SFI collected interviews are in English and average approximately 2.5 hours each. The 784 interviews included in this release are each a 30 minute section of the corresponding larger interview. Due to the way the original interviews were arranged on the tapes, some interviews are clipped and have a duration of less than 30 minutes. Certain interviews include speech from family members in addition to that of the subject and the interviewer. Accordingly, the corpus contains speech from more than 784 speakers, who are more or less equally distributed between males and females. The interviews also include accented speech over a wide range (e.g., Hungarian, Italian, Yiddish, German and Polish). This release includes transcripts in .trs format of the first 15 minutes of each interview. The transcripts were created using Transcriber 1.5.1 and later modified.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aHolocaust, Jewish (1939-1945)vPersonal narrativesvDatabases. 0aHolocaust survivorsvDatabases. 0aSpeech perceptionvDatabases. 0aSociolinguistics. 0aOral communicationxArchival resources.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aRamabhadran, Bhuvana10aGustman, Samuel10aByrne, William10aHajič, Jan10aOard, Douglas10aOlsson, J.

It contains approximately 60 hours of English broadcast news video data collected by LDC in 1998 and annotated for the 2005 VACE (Video Analysis and Content Extraction) tasks. The tasks covered by the broadcast news domain were human face (FDT) tracking, text strings (TDT) (glyphs rendered within the video image for the text object detection and tracking task) and word level text strings (TDT_Word_Level) (videotext OCR task). The VACE program was established to develop novel algorithms for automatic video content extraction, multi-modal fusion, and event understanding. During VACE Phases I and II, the program made significant progress in the automated detection and tracking of moving objects including faces, hands, people, vehicles and text in four primary video domains: broadcast news, meetings, street surveillance, and unmanned aerial vehicle motion imagery. Initial results were also obtained on automatic analysis of human activities and understanding of video sequences. Three performance evaluations were conducted under the auspices of the VACE program between 2004 and 2007. The 2005 evaluation was administered by USF in collaboration with NIST and guided by an advisory forum including the evaluation participants.

CNN HDL is a 24-hour/day cable-TV broadcast which presents top news stories continuously throughout the day. ABC-WNT is a daily 30-minute news broadcast that typically covers about a dozen different news items. Each daily ABC-WNT broadcast and up to four 30-minute sections of CNN-HDL were recorded each day. The CNN segments were drawn from that portion of the daily schedule that happened to include closed captioning. The broadcasts were captured directly from a cable TV connection. The signal first went to a VCR which was programmed to record the broadcast on VHS tape. These were later recorded in MPEG-2 (29.97 fps at 720 x 480p) for use in the VACE program. The MPEG-2 versions are contained in this release. *Tools* The VACE evaluation tools have been integrated into NISTs downloadable Framework for Detection Evaluation (F4DE) Toolkit. The toolkit contains small example files for each of the task/object/domain scoring combinations.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aHuman face recognition (Computer science)vDatabases. 0aContent-based image retrievalvDatabases. 0aDigital videovDatabases.7 aVideo recordings2lcgft10aKasturi, Rangachar10aGoldgof, Dmitry10aManohar, Vasant10aSoundararajan, Padmanabhan10aGarofolo, John S.10aBowers, Rachel10aRose, Travis10aFiscus, Jonathan G.10aMichel, Martial403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012V0104754nmm a22003853i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090041002800119041003800147042000700185245003400192264007300226336003800299336002600337337002600363338003200389500001500421500004500436506005100481520331800532520005103850546007803901655002003979700001603999700003604015700001904051700001804070700002104088700002104109700002104130856014904151856006804300m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2012    pau        u        spa d8 aLDC2012T038 aISLRN: 817-755-702-726-10 aspaageraczeacatbeng07aspaadeuacesacatbeng2iso639-3  adc00a2009 CoNLL Shared Task Part 1  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2012]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2012T03  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T031 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  a2009 CoNLL Shared Task Part 1, LDC Catalog Number LDC2012T03 and ISBN 1-58563-610-X, contains the Catalan, Czech, German and Spanish trial corpora, training corpora, development and test data for the 2009 CoNLL (Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning) Shared Task Evaluation. The 2009 Shared Task developed syntactic dependency annotations, including the semantic dependencies model roles of both verbal and nominal predicates. The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) is accompanied every year by a shared task intended to promote natural language processing applications and evaluate them in a standard setting. The 2004 and 2005 CoNLL shared tasks were dedicated to semantic role labeling (SRL) in a monolingual setting (English). In 2006 and 2007, the shared tasks were devoted to the parsing of syntactic dependencies and used corpora from up to thirteen languages. In 2008, the shared task focused on English and employed a unified dependency-based formalism and merged the task of syntactic dependency parsing and the task of identifying semantic arguments and labeling them with semantic roles that data has been released by LDC as 2008 CoNLL Shared Task Data. The 2009 task extended the 2008 task to several languages (English plus Catalan, Chinese, Czech, German, Japanese and Spanish). Among the new features were comparison of time and space complexity based on participants input, and learning curve comparison for languages with large datasets. The 2009 shared task was divided into two subtasks: * parsing syntactic dependencies * identification of arguments and assignment of semantic roles for each predicate 2009 CoNLL Shared Task Part 2 (LDC2012T04) contains the English and Chinese task data and is also available through LDC.

Along with other corpora, the parallel text in this release comprised machine translation training data for Phase 2 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. This corpus contains Modern Standard Arabic source text and corresponding English translations selected from broadcast conversation (BC) data collected by LDC between 2004 and 2007 and transcribed by LDC or under its direction. LDC has released the following GALE Phase 1 & 2 Arabic Parallel Text data sets: * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 1 (LDC2007T24) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 2 (LDC2008T09) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Blog Parallel Text (LDC2008T02) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 1 (LDC2009T03) * GALE Phase 1 Arabic Newsgroup Parallel Text - Part 2 (LDC2009T09) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 1 (LDC2012T06) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 2 (LDC2012T14) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Newswire Parallel Text (LDC2012T17) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Text (LDC2012T18) * GALE Phase 2 Arabic Web Parallel Text (LDC2013T01) *Data* GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 1 includes 36 source-translation document pairs, comprising 169,109 words of Arabic source text and its English translation. Data is drawn from thirteen distinct Arabic programs broadcast between 2004 and 2007 from the following sources: Al Alam News Channel, a broadcaster located in Iran Aljazeera, a regional broadcast programmer based in Doha, Qatar Dubai TV, located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates Oman TV, a national broadcaster located in the Sultanate of Oman and Radio Sawa, a U.S, government-funded regional broadcaster. Broadcast conversation programming is generally more interactive than traditional news broadcasts and includes talk shows, interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions. The programs in this release focus on current events topics. The files in this release were transcribed by LDC staff and/or transcription vendors under contract to LDC in accordance with Quick Rich Transcription guidelines developed by LDC. Transcribers indicated sentence boundaries in addition to transcribing the text. Data was manually selected for translation according to several criteria, including linguistic features, transcription features and topic features. The transcribed and segmented files were then reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDCs Arabic to English translation guidelines which are included with this release. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited text files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment. Each field in the TDF file is described in TDF_format.txt. All data are encoded in UTF8.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English and Standard Arabic.

This is part of a larger corpus of Turkish broadcast news data collected and transcribed with the goal to facilitate research in Turkish automatic speech recognition and its applications, such as speech retrieval. The VOA material was collected between December 2006 and June 2009 using a PC and TV/radio card setup. The data collected during the period 2006-2008 was recorded from analog FM radio the 2009 broadcasts were recorded from digitial satellite transmissions. A quick manual segmentation and transcription approach was followed. Speech recognition and retrieval experiments using the larger corpus can be found in the following journal article: Ebru Arisoy, Dogan Can, Siddika Parlak, Hasim Sak, and Murat Saraclar, Turkish Broadcast News Speech and Transcripts Transcription and Retrieval, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 17(5):874-883, July 2009. For more information please visit http://busim.ee.boun.edu.tr/~speech or contact the principal investigator, Murat Saraçlar. *Data* The data was recrded at 32 kHz and resampled at 16 kHz. After screening for recording quality, the files were segmented, transcribed, and verified. The segmentation occurred in two steps, an initial automatic segmentation followed by manual correction and annotation which included information such as background conditions and speaker boundaries. The transcription guidelines were adapted from the LDC HUB4 and quick transcription guidelines. An English version of the adapted guidelines is provided with the data here. The manual segmentations and transcripts were created by native Turkish speakers at Bo?aziçi University using Transcriber. The transcriptions are provided in the ISO-8859-9 (Latin5) character set.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Turkish.

It is a corpus of Czech-English parallel resources translated, aligned and manually annotated for dependency structure, semantic labeling, argument structure, ellipsis and anaphora resolution. This release updates Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 1.0 (LDC2004T25) by adding English newswire texts so that it now contains over two million words in close to 100,000 sentences. *Data* The principal new material in PCEDT 2.0 is the inclusion of the entire Wall Street Journal data from Treebank-3 (LDC99T42). Not included from PCEDT 1.0 are the Readers Digest material, the Czech monolingual corpus, and the English-Czech dictionary. Each section is enhanced with a comprehensive manual linguistic annotation in the Prague Dependency Treebank style (LDC2006T01, Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0). The main features of this annotation style are: * dependency structure of the content words and coordinating and similar structures (function words are attached as their attribute values) * semantic labeling of content words and types of coordinating structures * argument structure, including an argument structure (valency) lexicon for both languages * ellipsis and anaphora resolution This annotation style is called tectogrammatical annotation, and it constitutes the tectogrammatical layer in the corpus.

Filtered automatically from large Arabic text corpora harvested from the web by LDC. The LDC corpora consisted largely of weblog and online user groups and amounted to around 350 million Arabic words. Documents that contained a large percentage of non-Arabic or Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) words were eliminated. A list of dialect words was manually selected by culling through the Levantine Fisher (LDC2005S07, LDC2005T03, LDC2007S02 and LDC2007T04) and Egyptian CALLHOME speech corpora (LDC97S45, LDC2002S37, LDC97T19 and LDC2002T38) distributed by LDC. That list was then used to retain documents that contained a certain number of matches. The resulting subset of the web corpora contained around four million words. Documents were automatically segmented into passages using formatting information from the raw data. 2. Manually harvested by Sakhr Software from Arabic dialect web sites. Dialect classification and sentence segmentation, as needed, and translation into English were performed by BBN through Amazons Mechanical Turk. Arabic annotators from Mechanical Turk classified filtered passages as being either MSA or one of four regional dialects: Egyptian, Levantine, Gulf/Iraqi or Maghrebi. An additional General dialect option was allowed for ambiguous passages. The classification was applied to whole passages rather than individual sentences. Only the passages labeled Levantine and Egyptian were further processed. The segmented Levantine and Egyptian sentences were then translated. Annotators were instructed to translate completely and accurately and to transliterate Arabic names. They were also provided with examples. All segments of a passage were presented in the same translation task to provide context.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Egyptian Arabic, North Levantine Arabic, and South Levantine Arabic.

TimeML (Pusteyovsky, et al., 2005) is a schema for annotationg eventualities and time expressions in natural language as well as the temporal relations among them, thus facilitating the task of extraction, representation and exchange of temporal information. Catalan Timebank 1.0 is annotated in three levels, marking events, time expressions and event metadata. The TimeML annotation scheme was tailored for the specifics of the Catalan language. Temporal relations in Catalan present distinctions of verbal mood (e.g., indicative, subjunctive, conditional, etc.) and grammatical aspect (e.g., imperfective) which are absent in English. Catalan TimeBank 1.0 joins the family of TimeBank annotated corpora which includes languages such as English, Spanish, Italian, French, Korean and Chinese. Through their common layer of annotation, these corpora provide resoures useful for multilingual temporal extraction and processing, such as multilingual text entailment, opinion mining or question answering. LDC has released the following corpora incorporating TimeBank annotation: TimeBank 1.2 LDC2006T08, FactBank 1.0 LDC2009T23 and ModeS TimeBank 1.0 LDC2012T01. *Data* Catalan TimeBank 1.0 contains stand-off annotations for 210 documents with over 75,800 tokens (including punctuation marks) and 68,000 tokens (excluding punctuation). The source documents are from the EFE news agency, the ACN Catalan news agency2 and the Catalan version of the El Períodico newspaper, and span the period from January to December 2000. The AnCora corpus is the largest multilayer annotated corpus of Spanish and Catalan. AnCora contains 400,000 words in Spanish and 275,000 words in Catalan. The AnCora documents are annotated on many linguistic levels including stucture, syntax, dependencies, semantics and pragmatics.That information is not included in this release, but it can be mapped to the present annotations. The data contained in the AnCora corpus has been used in several international natural language processing evaluations such as CoNLL-2006, CoNLL-2007 and SemEval-2007. The corpus is freely available from the Centre de Llenguatge i Computació (CLiC).  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Catalan.

This corpus is intended as a tool for the quantitative study of nickname usage in the United States such as in demographic and sociological studies. It has multiple potential human language technology applications as well, including entity extraction, coreference resolution, people search, language modeling and machine translation. *Data* The American English Nickname Collection contains 331,237 distinct mappings encompassing millions of names. The data was collected and processed through a record linkage pipeline. The steps in the pipeline were (1) data cleaning, (2) blocking, (3) pair-wise linkage and (4) clustering. In the cleaning step, material was categorized, processed to remove junk and spam records and normalized to an approximately common representation. The blocking process utitlized an algorithm to group records by shared properties for determining which record pairs should be examined by the pairwise linker as potential duplicates. The linkage step assigned a score to record pairs using a supervised pairwise-based machine learning model. The clustering step combined record pairs into connected components and further partitioned each connected component to remove inconsistent pairwise links. The result is that input records were partitioned into disjoint sets called profiles, where each profile corresponded to a single person. The material is presented in the form of a comma delimited text file. Each line contains a first name, a nickname or alias, its conditional probability and its frequency. The conditional probability for each nickname is derived from the base data using an algorithim which calculates both the probability for which any alias refers to a given name and a threshold below which the mapping is most likely an error. This threshold eliminates typographic errors and other noise from the data.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aNicknameszUnited StatesvDatabases. 0aNames, EnglishzUnited StatesvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aCarvalho, Vitor R.10aKiran, Yigit10aBorthwick, Andrew403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T1103619nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245002500177264007300202336003800275336002600313337002600339338003200365500001500397500004500412506005100457520233700508546005002845650005002895650004202945655002002987700001703007700002803024856014903052856006803201m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2012    pau        u        spa d  a15856362078 aLDC2012T128 aISLRN: 422-097-648-917-50 aspabeng07aspabeng2iso639-3  adc00aSpanish TimeBank 1.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2012]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2012T12  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T121 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aSpanish TimeBank 1.0 was developed by researchers at Barcelona Media and consists of Spanish texts in the AnCora corpus annotated with temporal and event information according to the TimeML specification language. TimeML (Pusteyovsky, et al., 2005) is a schema for annotating eventualities and time expressions in natural language as well as the temporal relations among them, thus facilitating the task of extraction, representation and exchange of temporal information. Spanish Timebank 1.0 is annotated in three levels, marking events, time expressions and event metadata. The TimeML annotation scheme was tailored for the specifics of the Spanish language. Temporal relations in Spanish present distinctions of verbal mood (e.g., indicative, subjunctive, conditional, etc.) and grammatical aspect (e.g., imperfective) which are absent in English. Spanish TimeBank 1.0 joins the family of TimeBank annotated corpora which includes languages such as English, Italian, French, Korean and Chinese. Through their common layer of annotation, these corpora provide resources useful for multilingual temporal extraction and processing, such as multilingual text entailment, opinion mining or question answering. Spanish Timebank 1.0 is the Spanish language complement to Catalan Timebank 1.0 LDC2012T10. LDC has released other corpora incorporating TimeBank annotation: TimeBank 1.2 LDC2006T08, FactBank 1.0 LDC2009T23 and ModeS TimeBank 1.0 LDC2012T01. *Data* Spanish TimeBank 1.0 contains stand-off annotations for 210 documents with over 75,800 tokens (including punctuation marks) and 68,000 tokens (excluding punctuation). The source documents are news stories and fiction from the AnCora corpus. The AnCora corpus is the largest multilayer annotated corpus of Spanish and Catalan.

It consists of over 250,000 words of English weblogs, newsgroups, email, reviews and question-answers manually annotated for syntactic structure and is designed to allow language technology researchers to develop and evaluate the robustness of parsing methods in those web domains. *Data* This release contains 254,830 word-level tokens and 16,624 sentence-level tokens of webtext in 1174 files annotated for sentence- and word-level tokenization, part-of-speech, and syntactic structure. The data is roughly evenly divided across five genres: weblogs, newsgroups, email, reviews, and question-answers. The files were manually annotated following the sentence-level tokenization guidelines for web text and the word-level tokenization guidelines developed for English treebanks in the DARPA GALE project. Only text from the subject line and message body of posts, articles, messages and question-answers were collected and annotated. Weblogs are interactive web sites that display content as discrete entries or posts and allow viewers to comment on entries and engage in discussions. They are typically managed by individuals and use informal or colloquial language. The weblog data in this release was collected by LDC and covers the period 2003-2006. Newsgroups are repositories of online discussions pertaining to a topic or interest area. They consist of threads that in turn contain articles with comments and discussion from group users. The newsgroup data in this release was collected by LDC and covers the period 2003-2006. Email are messages sent to discrete individuals or well defined groups via the TCP-IP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The email messages in this corpus are a subset of emails sent by Enron Corporation employees during the period 1999-2002. Specifically, those messages are contained in the Enronsent Corpus, a collection of 96,107 email messages from the sent folders of Enron email users which were processed to remove any content not generated by human users. The reviews in this corpus were gleaned from online reviews of businesses and services on various Google web sites written by individuals. This information was provided to LDC by Google in 2011 the dates of individual reviews are not available. Question-answers are posts from Yahoo!s community-driven question-answering web site, Yahoo! Answers, where individuals submit and answer questions which may be on any topic. This data was collected in 2011; the dates of individual question-answers were not collected.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aBies, Ann10aMott, Justin10aWarner, Colin10aKulick, Seth403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T1304521nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041002800152042000700180245006800187264007300255336003800328336002600366337002600392338003200418500001500450500004500465506005100510520314000561546007003701650004703771655002003818700002103838700001603859700001603875700001503891700002403906856014903930856006804079m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2012    pau        u        eng d  a15856362238 aLDC2012T148 aISLRN: 458-291-139-032-60 aengaarabeng07aengaarbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 2  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2012]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2012T14  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T141 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 2 was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).

Data is drawn from eight distinct Arabic programs broadcast between 2004 and 2007 from Aljazeera, a regional broadcast programmer based in Doha, Qatar and Nile TV, an Egyptian broadcaster. Broadcast conversation programming is generally more interactive than traditional news broadcasts and includes talk shows, interviews, call-in programs and roundtables. The programs in this release focus on current events topics. The files in this release were transcribed by LDC staff and/or transcription vendors under contract to LDC in accordance with the Quick Rich Transcription guidelines developed by LDC. Transcribers indicated sentence boundaries in addition to transcribing the text. Data was manually selected for translation according to several criteria, including linguistic features, transcription features and topic features. The transcribed and segmented files were then reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDC's Arabic to English translation guidelines. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment. Each field in the TDF file is described in TDF_format.text. All data are encoded in UTF-8. *Sponsorship* This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation. *Data* This release consists of Chinese source newswire and web data (newsgroup, weblog) collected by LDC in 2008. The distribution by genre, words, character tokens and segments appears below: Language Genre Files Words CharTokens Segments Chinese nw 193 53279 79919 2016 Chinese wb 87 46766 70149 2357 Total 280 100045 150068 4373 Note that all token counts are based on the Chinese data only. One token is equivalent to one character and one word is equivalent to 1.5 characters. The Chinese word alignment tasks consisted of the following components: * Identifying, aligning, and tagging 8 different types of links * Identifying, attaching, and tagging local-level unmatched words * Identifying and tagging sentence/discourse-level unmatched words * Identifying and tagging all instances of Chinese 的 (DE) except when they were a part of a semantic link.

This corpus was designed to address the challenges of speech recognition in meetings, which often occur in rooms with non-ideal acoustic conditions and significant background noise, and may contain large sections of overlapping speech. Using headset microphones represents one approach, but meeting participants may be reluctant to wear them. Microphone arrays are another option. MCWSJ supports research in large vocabulary tasks using microphone arrays. The news sentences read by speakers are taken from WSJCAM0 Cambridge Read News, a corpus originally developed for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition experiments, which in turn was based on CSR-1 (WSJ0) Complete, made available by LDC to support large vocabulary continuous speech recognition initiatives. *Data* Speakers reading news text from prompts were recorded using a headset microphone, a lapel microphone and an eight-channel microphone array. In the single speaker scenario, participants read from six fixed positions. Fixed positions were assigned for the entire recording in the overlapping scenario. For the moving scenario, participants moved from one position to the next while reading. Fifteen speakers were recorded for the single scenario, nine pairs for the overlapping scenario and nine individuals for the moving scenario. Each read approximately 90 sentences. The audio data are presented as single channel 16kHz flac compressed wav files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aLincoln, Mike10aZwyssig, Erich10aMcCowan, Iain403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014S0304127nmm a22004333i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245003200177264007300209336003800282336002600320337002600346338003200372500001500404500004500419506005100464520256200515520005103077546004903128650005403177650004203231650004703273650002503320655002003345700001503365700001703380700002003397700001903417700002403436700001603460856014903476856006803625m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2012    pau        u        ara d  a15856362318 aLDC2012T158 aISLRN: 810-747-680-852-60 aarabeng07aarabeng2iso639-3  adc00aMADCAT Phase 1 Training Set  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2012]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2012T15  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T151 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aMADCAT (Multilingual Automatic Document Classification Analysis and Translation) Phase 1 Training Set contains all training data created by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) to support Phase 1 of the DARPA MADCAT Program. The material in this release consists of handwritten Arabic documents, scanned at high resolution and annotated for the physical coordinates of each line and token. Digital transcripts and English translations of each document are also provided, with the various content and annotation layers integrated in a single MADCAT XML output. The goal of the MADCAT program is to automatically convert foreign text images into English transcripts. MADCAT Phase 1 data was collected by LDC from Arabic source documents in three genres: newswire, weblog and newsgroup text. Arabic speaking scribes copied documents by hand, following specific instructions on writing style (fast, normal, careful), writing implement (pen, pencil) and paper (lined, unlined). Prior to assignment, source documents were processed to optimize their appearance for the handwriting task, which resulted in some original source documents being broken into multiple pages for handwriting. Each resulting handwritten page was assigned to up to five independent scribes, using different writing conditions. The handwritten, transcribed documents were checked for quality and completeness, then each page was scanned at a high resolution (600 dpi, greyscale) to create a digital version of the handwritten document. The scanned images were then annotated to indicate the physical coordinates of each line and token. Explicit reading order was also labeled, along with any errors produced by the scribes when copying the text. The final step was to produce a unified data format that takes multiple data streams and generates a single xml output file which contains all required information. The resulting xml file has these distinct components: a text layer that consists of the source text, tokenization and sentence segmentation an image layer that consist of bounding boxes a scribe demographic layer that consists of scribe ID and partition (train/test) and a document metadata layer. LDC has also released: * MADCAT Phase 2 Training Set (LDC2013T09) * MADCAT Phase 3 Training Set (LDC2013T15) * MADCAT Chinese Pilot Training Set (LDC2014T13) *Data* This release includes 9,693 annotation files in MADCAT XML format (.madcat.xml) along with their corresponding scanned image files in TIFF format.

It is the second publication in an ongoing LDC project to to build an electronic dictionary of three Mandekan languages: Mawukakan, Maninkakan and Bambara. These are Eastern Manding languages in the Mande Group of the Niger-Congo language family. LDC released a Mawukakan Lexicon (LDC2005L01) in 2005 and a Bamanankan Lexicon (LDC2016L01) in 2016. There are approximately 3.5 million Maninkakan speakers in West Africa, mostly in Guinea and Mali, and also in Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast. The word Maninkakan is composed of three lexemes: (1) Mande or Manden, the name of the territory occupied by the people who speak the language, (2) the suffix -ka which when added derives the name of the inhabitant of Mande or Manden, and (3) kan, which means language. Thus Maninkakan is the language of the people who live in Mande/Manden. Mandekan, Mandenkan, Maninka and Malinke are all used to refer to the language of the inhabitants of the Mande/Manden. Meghan Glenn served as an editor for the French and English parts of this Lexicon. More information about the work of LDC in the languages of West Africa and the challenges those languages present for language resource development can be found here. *Data* Maninkakan is written using Latin script, Arabic script and the NKo alphabet. This lexicon is presented using a Latin-based transcription system because the Latin alphabet is familiar to the majority of Mandekan language speakers and because it is expected to facilitate the work of researchers interested in this resource. The dictionary is provided in two formats, Toolbox and XML. Toolbox is a version of the widely used SIL Shoebox program adapted to display Unicode. Toolbox can be downloaded for free from this link, http://www-01.sil.org/computIng/catalog/show_software.asp?id=79. The Toolbox files are provided in two fonts, Arial and Doulous SIL. The Arial files should display using the Arial font which is standard on most operating systems. Doulous SIL, available as a free download, is a robust font that should display all characters without issue. Users should launch Toolbox using the *.prj files in the Arial or Doulous_SIL folders. The lexicon is presented in Unicode Normalization Form D, canonical decomposition. This means that all glyphs are divided into as many parts as possible. See the following link for more information on Unicode normalization forms. The XML formatted lexicon was generated by Toolbox and a DTD is included.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in French, English, and Eastern Maninkakan.

The source broadcast conversation recordings feature interviews, call-in programs and round table discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran, Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai, Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar, Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan, Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station, Nile TV, a broadcast programmer based in Egypt, Oman TV, a national broadcaster located in the Sultanate of Oman, Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 752,747 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/tools/XTrans/downloads/. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDCs quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-)verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation. GALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging Training Part 1 -- Newswire and Web (LDC2012T16) is also available through LDC. *Data* This release consists of Chinese source newswire collected by LDC in 2008. The distribution by genre, words, character tokens and segments appears below: Language Genre Files Words CharTokens Segments Chinese nw 1982 112720 169080 4239 Note that all token counts are based on the Chinese data only. One token is equivalent to one character and one word is equivalent to 1.5 characters. The Chinese word alignment tasks consisted of the following components: * Identifying, aligning, and tagging 8 different types of links * Identifying, attaching, and tagging local-level unmatched words * Identifying and tagging sentence/discourse-level unmatched words * Identifying and tagging all instances of Chinese 的 (DE) except when they were a part of a semantic link The file names indicate the source provider, the story date and the language.

This release contains source data, reference translations and scoring software used in the NIST 2012 OpenMT evaluation, specifically, for the Chinese-to-English language pair track. The package was compiled and scoring software was developed at NIST, making use of Chinese newswire and web data and reference translations collected and developed by LDC. The objective of the OpenMT evaluation series is to support research in, and help advance the state of the art of, machine translation (MT) technologies -- technologies that translate text between human languages. Input may include all forms of text. The goal is for the output to be an adequate and fluent translation of the original. The MT evaluation series started in 2001 as part of the DARPA TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction) program. Beginning with the 2006 evaluation, the evaluations have been driven and coordinated by NIST as NIST OpenMT. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities in MT. The Open MT evaluations are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of automatic translation between human languages. To this end, they are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues and to be fully supported. The 2012 task was to evaluate five language pairs: Arabic-to-English, Chinese-to-English, Dari-to-English, Farsi-to-English and Korean-to-English. This release consists of the material used in the Chinese-to-English language pair track. For more general information about the NIST OpenMT evaluations, please refer to the NIST OpenMT website. This evaluation kit includes a single Perl script (mteval-v13a.pl) that may be used to produce a translation quality score for one (or more) MT systems. The script works by comparing the system output translation with a set of (expert) reference translations of the same source text. Comparison is based on finding sequences of words in the reference translations that match word sequences in the system output translation. *Data* This release contains 222 documents with corresponding source and reference files, the latter of which contains four independent human reference translations of the source data. The source data is comprised of Chinese newswire and web data collected by LDC in 2011. A portion of the web data concerned the topic of food and was treated as a restricted domain. The table below displays statistics by source, genre, documents, segments and source tokens.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2013T04). Broadcast audio for the DARPA GALE program was collected at the LDC Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Republic of China (Chinese) Medianet, Tunis, Tunisia (Arabic) and MTC, Rabat, Morocco (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. The LDC local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC desgined a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. Medianet collected Arabic programming from across the Gulf region using its internal system and LDCs portable broadcast collection platform installed in 2008. The portable platform deployed at the Medianet Tunisian collection facility collected multiple streams of regional Arabic programming from various sources. MTC collected Arabic programming using its internal collection system. *Data* The broadcast conversation recordings in this release feature interviews, call-in programs and round table discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran, Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai, Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar, Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan, Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station, Nile TV, a broadcast programmer based in Egypt, Oman TV, a national broadcaster located in the Sultanate of Oman, Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. A table showing the number of programs and hours recorded from each source is contained in the readme file. This release contains 143 audio files presented in Waveform Audio File format (.wav), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Arabic speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings, as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded, and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about program genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

It adds automatically-generated syntactic and discourse structure annotation to English Gigaword Fifth Edition (LDC2011T07) and also contains an API and tools for reading the dataset's XML files. The goal of the annotation is to provide a standardized corpus for knowledge extraction and distributional semantics which enables broader involvement in large-scale knowledge-acquisition efforts by researchers. *Data* Annotated English Gigaword contains the nearly ten million documents (over four billion words) of the original English Gigaword Fifth Edition from seven news sources: * Agence France-Presse, English Service (afp_eng) * Associated Press Worldstream, English Service (apw_eng) * Central News Agency of Taiwan, English Service (cna_eng) * Los Angeles Times/Washington Post Newswire Service (ltw_eng) * Washington Post/Bloomberg Newswire Service (wpb_eng) * New York Times Newswire Service (nyt_eng) * Xinhua News Agency, English Service (xin_eng) The following layers of annotation were added: * Tokenized and segmented sentences * Treebank-style constituent parse trees * Syntactic dependency trees * Named entities * In-document coreference chains The annotation was performed in a three-step process: (1) the data was preprocessed and sentences selected for annotation (sentences with more than 100 tokens were excluded) (2) syntactic parses were derived and (3) the parsed output was post-processed to derive syntactic dependencies, named entities and coreference chains. Over 183 million sentences were parsed. The data is stored in a form similar to the gigaword SGML format with XML annotations containing the additional markup. The included API provides object representations for the contents of the XML files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagevDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aNapoles, Courtney10aGormley, Matthew R.10aVan Durme, Benjamin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T2103339nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041003300152042000700185245007500192264007300267336003800340336002600378337002600404338003200430500001500462500004500477506005100522520198600573520005102559546008102610655002002691700001702711700002002728700002402748856014902772856006802921m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2012    pau        u        eng d  a15856363208 aLDC2012T248 aISLRN: 369-177-595-916-80 aengachibeng07aengacmnazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging Training Part 3 -- Web  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2012]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2012T24  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T241 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging Training Part 3 -- Web was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and contains 154,541 tokens of word aligned Chinese and English parallel text enriched with linguistic tags. This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation. GALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging Training Part 1 -- Newswire and Web (LDC2012T16) and GALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging Training Part 2 -- Newswire (LDC2012T20) are also available through LDC. *Data* This release consists of Chinese source web data (newsgroup, weblog) collected by LDC in 2008 and 2009. The distribution by words, character tokens and segments appears below: Language Files Words CharTokens Segments Chinese 1249 103027 154541 4842 Note that all token counts are based on the Chinese data only. One token is equivalent to one character and one word is equivalent to 1.5 characters. The Chinese word alignment tasks consisted of the following components: * Identifying, aligning, and tagging 8 different types of links * Identifying, attaching, and tagging local-level unmatched words * Identifying and tagging sentence/discourse-level unmatched words * Identifying and tagging all instances of Chinese 的 (DE) except when they were a part of a semantic link.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, and Chinese.

It consists of United Nations (UN) parliamentary documents from 1993 through 2007 in the official languages of the UN: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. There are 673,670 raw text documents and 520,283 word alignment documents. UN parliamentary documents are available from the UN Official Document System (UN ODS) at http://ods.un.org/. UN ODS, in its main UNDOC database, contains the full text of all types of UN parliamentary documents. It has complete coverage datng from 1993 and variable coverage before that. Documents exist in one or more of the official languages of the UN: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. UN ODS also contains a large number of German documents, marked with the language other, but these are not included in this dataset. For more information, see the UN ODS documentation at http://documents.un.org/help_E.htm. For more details of the UN bibliographic systems, see http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/unbisref_manual/. LDC has released parallel UN parliamentary documents in English, French and Spanish spanning the period 1988-1993, UN Parallel Text (Complete) (LDC94T4A). *Data* The data is presented as raw text and word-aligned text. The raw text is very close to what was extracted from the original word processing documents in UN ODS (e.g., Word, WordPerfect, PDF), converted to UTF-8 encoding. The word-aligned text was normalized, tokenized, aligned at the sentence-level, further broken into sub-sentential chunk-pairs, and then aligned at the word. The sentence, chunk, and word alignment operations were performed separately for each individual language pair. The files are presented in tar files and compressed using the bzip2 compression utility. The bzip2 utility is standard in most Linux releases. For Windows users, there are a variety of decompression software options. 7-Zip will decompress tar and bzip2 formats.

This material was collected by LDC in 2009 and 2010 as part of the Mixer project, specifically phase 6, the focus of which was on native American English speakers local to the Philadelphia area. The speech data in this release was collected by LDC at its Human Subjects Collection facilities in Philadelphia. The telephone collection protocol was similar to other LDC telephone studies (e.g., Switchboard-2 Phase III Audio - LDC2002S06): recruited speakers were connected through a robot operator to carry on casual conversations lasting up to 10 minutes, usually about a daily topic announced by the robot operator at the start of the call. The raw digital audio content for each call side was captured as a separate channel, and each full conversation was presented as a 2-channel interleaved audio file, with 8000 samples/second and u-law sample encoding. Each speaker was asked to complete 15 calls. The multi-microphone portion of the collection utilized 14 distinct microphones installed identically in two mutli-channel audio recording rooms at LDC. Each session was guided by collection staff using prompting and recording software to conduct the following activities: (1) repeat questions (less than one minute), (2) informal conversation (typically 15 minutes), (3) transcript reading (approximately 15 minutes) and (4) telephone call (generally 10 minutes). Speakers recorded up to three 45-minute sessions on distinct days. The 14 channels were recorded synchronously into separate single-channel files, using 16-bit PCM sample encoding at 16000 samples/second. Certain demographic information about the speakers was collected, including date of birth, level of education, native language, other language capability, place of birth, place of residence and occupation. The recordings in this corpus were used in NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE) test sets for 2010 and 2012. Researchers interested in applying those benchmark test sets should consult the respective NIST Evaluation Plans for guidelines on allowable training data for those tests. *Data* The collection contains 4,410 recordings made via the public telephone network and 1,425 sessions of multiple microphone recordings in office-room settings. The telephone recordings are presented as 8-KHz 2-channel NIST SPHERE files, and the microphone recordings are 16-KHz 1-channel flac/ms-wav files. All audio files names indicate the date and time when the recording began, along with other identifying information, as follows: Telephone: {yyyymmdd}_{hrmnsc}_{callid}.sph Microphone: {yyyymmdd}_{hrmnsc}_{room}_{subjid}_CH{nn}.flac * yyyymmdd is the year, month and date of recording. * hrmnsc is the hour, minute and second when recording began * callid is a unique, incremental number assigned to each call * room is either LDC or HRM, indicating which office was used * subjid is a numeric identifier assigned to the speaker When the flac files are uncompressed, they become ms-wav/RIFF files (flac compression does not presently support SPHERE file format). The telephone audio is presented in SPHERE format because (a) this is consistent with other telephone audio releases from LDC, and (b) flac does not support ulaw sample encoding. The current release of the open-source SoX utility is able to handle both formats as input. Other utilities are available for both flac and SPHERE formats.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagevDatabases. 0aTelephone callszUnited StatesvDatabases. 0aSpeech perceptionvDatabases.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aBrandschain, Linda10aGraff, David10aWalker, Kevin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013S0303645nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090041001300119041002800132042000700160245006000167264007300227336003800300336002600338337002600364338003200390500001500422500004500437506005100482520221700533520005102750546007102801650004902872650003402921655002002955700001802975700001802993700002403011700001903035856014903054856006803203m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2013    pau        u        chi d8 aLDC2013T088 aISLRN: 839-419-404-977-70 achibeng07acmnazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2013]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2013T08  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T081 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Transcripts was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and contains transcriptions of approximately 120 hours of Chinese broadcast conversation speech collected in 2006 and 2007 by LDC and Hong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, during Phase 2 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. Corresponding audio data is released as GALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Speech (LDC2013S04). The source broadcast conversation recordings feature interviews, call-in programs and round table discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Anhui TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Anhui Province, China Central TV (CCTV), a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China, Hubei TV, a regional broadcaster in Mainland China, Hubei Province, and Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station. *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 1,523,373 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed the quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) developed by LDC, both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-)verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Transcripts (LDC2013T08). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at the Philadelphia, PA USA facilities of LDC and at three remote collection sites: HKUST (Chinese) Medianet, Tunis, Tunisia (Arabic) and MTC, Rabat, Morocco (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. The LDC local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. HKUST collected Chinese broadcast programming using its internal recording system and a portable broadcast collection platform designed by LDC and installed at HKUST in 2006. *Data* The broadcast conversation recordings in this release feature interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Anhui TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Anhui Province, China Central TV (CCTV), a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China, Hubei TV, a regional broadcaster in Mainland China, Hubei Province, and Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station. A table showing the number of programs and hours recorded from each source is contained in the readme file. This release contains 202 audio files presented in Waveform Audio File format (.wav), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Chinese speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: (1) as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings, (2) as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded and (3) as a guide for data selection by retaining information about the genre, data type and topic of a program.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

The data in this release consists of handwritten Arabic documents, scanned at high resolution and annotated for the physical coordinates of each line and token. Digital transcripts and English translations of each document are also provided, with the various content and annotation layers integrated in a single MADCAT XML output. The goal of the MADCAT program is to automatically convert foreign text images into English transcripts. MADCAT Phase 2 data was collected from Arabic source documents in three genres: newswire, weblog and newsgroup text. Arabic speaking scribes copied documents by hand, following specific instructions on writing style (fast, normal, careful), writing implement (pen, pencil) and paper (lined, unlined). Prior to assignment, source documents were processed to optimize their appearance for the handwriting task, which resulted in some original source documents being broken into multiple pages for handwriting. Each resulting handwritten page was assigned to up to five independent scribes, using different writing conditions. The handwritten, transcribed documents were checked for quality and completeness, then each page was scanned at a high resolution (600 dpi, greyscale) to create a digital version of the handwritten document. The scanned images were then annotated to indicate the physical coordinates of each line and token. Explicit reading order was also labeled, along with any errors produced by the scribes when copying the text. The final step was to produce a unified data format that takes multiple data streams and generates a single MADCAT XML output file with all required information. The resulting madcat.xml file has these distinct components: (1) a text layer that consists of the source text, tokenization and sentence segmentation, (2) an image layer that consist of bounding boxes, (3) a scribe demographic layer that consists of scribe ID and partition (train/test) and (4) a document metadata layer. LDC has also released: * MADCAT Phase 1 Training Set (LDC2012T15) * MADCAT Phase 3 Training Set (LDC2013T15) * MADCAT Chinese Pilot Training Set (LDC2014T13) *Data* This release includes 27,814 annotation files in both GEDI XML and MADCAT XML formats (gedi.xml and madcat.xml) along with their corresponding scanned image files in TIFF format. The annotation results in GEDI XML output files include ground truth annotations and source transcripts.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Parallel aligned treebanks are treebanks annotated with morphological and syntactic structures aligned at the sentence level and the sub-sentence level. Such data sets are useful for natural language processing and related fields, including automatic word alignment system training and evaluation, transfer-rule extraction, word sense disambiguation, translation lexicon extraction and cultural heritage and cross-linguistic studies. With respect to machine translation system development, parallel aligned treebanks may improve system performance with enhanced syntactic parsers, better rules and knowledge about language pairs and reduced word error rate. In this release, the source Arabic data was translated into English. Arabic and English treebank annotations were performed independently. The parallel texts were then word aligned. The material in this corpus corresponds to the Arabic treebanked data appearing in Arabic Treebank: Part 3 v 3.2 (LDC2010T08) (ATB) and to the English treebanked data in English Translation Treebank: An-Nahar Newswire (LDC2012T02). *Data* The source data consists of Arabic newswire from the Lebanese publication An Nahar collected by LDC in 2002. All data is encoded as UTF-8. A count of files, words, tokens and segments is below. Language Files Words Tokens Segments Arabic 364 182,351 267,520 7,711 Note: Word count is based on the untokenized Arabic source and token count is based on the ATB-tokenized Arabic source. The purpose of the GALE word alignment task was to find correspondences between words, phrases or groups of words in a set of parallel texts. Arabic-English word alignment annotation consisted of the following tasks: * Identifying different types of links: translated (correct or incorrect) and not translated (correct or incorrect) * Identifying sentence segments not suitable for annotation, e.g., blank segments, incorrectly-segmented segments, segments with foreign languages * Tagging unmatched words attached to other words or phrases This release contains four types of files - raw, tokenized, treebank, and wa. The raw format contains the original Arabic and English sentences without any annotation. The tokenized format is the treebank tokenized version of the raw data.

The goal was to record new telephone conversations among subjects who had participated in one or more previous LDC telephone collections, from Switchboard-1 (1991) through the Mixer studies (2006). A total of 172 subjects were enrolled in the Greybeard collection, all of whom had participated in one of the following: * Switchboard-1 (LDC97S62) 1991-1992: 2 subjects * Switchboard-2 (LDC98S75, LDC99S79, LDC2002S06) 1996-1997: 16 subjects * Mixer 1 and 2 2003-2005: 103 subjects * Mixer 3 2006: 51 subjects Most Greybeard participants completed 12 calls. Some subjects completed up to 24 calls. Calls were made or received via an automatic operator system at LDC which connected two participants and announced a topic for discussion. *Data* This releases consists of 4680 calls -- the complete set of calls recorded during the Greybeard collection (1098 calls) as well as all calls from the legacy collections that involved the Greybeard speakers. The audio from each call was captured digitally by the operator system and stored in a separate file as raw mu-law sample data. As the recordings were uploaded daily from the robot operator to network disk storage, automated processes reformatted the audio into a 2-channel SPHERE-format file for each conversation and queued the recordings for manual audit to verify speaker identification and to check other aspects of the recording. Auditors provided impressionistic judgments on overall audio quality, presence of background noise and cross-channel echo and any other technical difficulty with the call, in addition to confirming the speaker-ID on each channel. These auditor decisions are provided in the call_info tables, described in more detail in the included documentation. For this release, each 2-channel recording was converted from SPHERE to MS-WAV file format and compressed using FLAC. All audio files are 2-channel, 8 KHz, 16-bit PCM sample data, in FLAC-compressed form (http://flac.sourceforge.net). When uncompressed, they have MS-WAV/RIFF headers.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognition.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aBrandschain, Linda10aGraff, David403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013S0503602nmm a22003973i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041003300152042000700185245006900192264007300261336003800334336002600372337002600398338003200424500001500456500004500471506005100516520208400567520005102651546008102702650004902783650004302832655002002875700002102895700001602916700001602932700001502948700002402963856014902987856006803136m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2013    pau        u        eng d  a15856364608 aLDC2013T118 aISLRN: 932-371-960-415-70 aengachibeng07aengacmnazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 1  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2013]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2013T11  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T111 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Parallel Text Part 1 was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).

The MASC project was established to address, to the extent possible, many of the obstacles to the creation of large-scale, robust, multiply-annotated corpora of English covering a wide range of genres of written and spoken language data. The project provides appropriate data and annotations to serve as the base for a community-wide annotation effort, together with an infrastructure that enables the incorporation of contributed annotations into a single, usable format that can then be analyzed as it is or transduced to any of a variety of other formats. The aim is to offset some of the high costs of producing high quality linguistic annotations via a distribution of effort and to solve some of the usability problems for annotations produced at different sites by harmonizing their representation formats. It also provides data from a much wider variety of genres than are often present in existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and all of the data in the corpus are drawn from current American English so as to be most useful for natural language processing applications used in the web-based environment. Further information about the pojrect is available at the MASC website. The source texts were drawn from the open portion of the American National Corpus Second Release, which includes written texts and spoken transcripts of American English from a broad range of genres produced since 1990 and from the Language Understanding Annotation Corpus, a collection of various genres inlcuding broadcast, newswire, email, and telephone speech annotated for committed belief, event and entity coreference, dialog acts and temporal relations. MASC Third Release includes the the contents of MASC First Release (LDC2010T22) (82,000 words) which is also available from LDC. There is no second release. *Data* All data in this release was annotated for logical structure (paragraph, headings, etc.), token and sentence boundaries, part of speech and lemma, shallow parse (noun and verb chunks) and named entities (person, organization, location and date). Portions of the corpus were also annotated for FrameNet frames (40k full text), Penn Treebank syntax (82k) and opinion (50k). All annotations were either manually produced or hand-validated and represented in ISO-GrAF standoff format. The original texts were derived from original electronic versions in a wide variety of formats, including but not limited to Quark Express, XML, Microsoft Word, Portable Document Format (PDF), HTML, and plain text. Transduction procedures varied depending on the original format. As little correction or other editorial modification as possible was applied to the text. Corrections to the text were either made in standoff documents containing the corrected version or were reflected in values of segmentation, token, sentence, or other segmental unit, and/or part of speech annotation. The data are segmented into minimal regions spanning the primary data. Minimal regions are identified as the smallest unit any of the tokenizations applied to data references. Token annotations reference these regions as appropriate. Sentences reference regions in primary data.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English. 0aEnglish languagezUnited StatesvDatabases.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aIde, Nancy10aSuderman, Keith10aBaker, Collin10aPassonneau, Rebecca10aFellbaum, Christiane403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T1208005nmm a22002773i 4500006001900000007001500019008003800034020001500072024001500087024002900102042000700131245004900138264007300187336003800260336003300298337002600331338003200357500001500389500004500404506005100449520695100500655002807451700003107479856014907510856006807659m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2013    pau        u         d  a15856365338 aLDC2013S068 aISLRN: 081-702-893-346-9  adc00aLDC Spoken Language Sampler - Second Release  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2013]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2013S06  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013S061 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aLDC (Linguistic Data Consortium) Spoken Language Sampler - Second Release contains samples from 20 different corpora published by LDC between 1996 and 2013. LDC distributes a wide and growing assortment of resources for researchers, engineers and educators whose work is concerned with human languages. Historically, most linguistic resources were not generally available to interested researchers but were restricted to single laboratories or to a limited number of users. Inspired by the success of selected readily-available and well-known data sets, such as the Brown University text corpus, LDC was founded in 1992 to provide a new mechanism for large-scale corpus development and sharing of resources. With the support of its members, LDC is able to provide critical services to the language research community. These services include: maintaining the data archives, producing and distributing data via media or web downloads, negotiating intellectual property agreements with potential information providers and maintaining relations with other like-minded groups around the world. Resources available from LDC include speech, text, video data and lexicons in multiple languages, as well as software tools to facilitate the use of corpus materials. For a complete view of LDC's publications, browse the Catalog. This sampler is available as a free download. *Data* The LDC Spoken Language Sampler - Second Release provides speech and transcript samples and is designed to illustrate the variety and breadth of the resources available from the LDC Catalog. The sound files included in this release are excerpts that have been modified in various ways relative to the original data as published by LDC: * Most excerpts are truncated to be much shorter than the original files, typically between 1.5 and 2 minutes. * Signal amplitude has been adjusted where necessary to normalize playback volume. * Some corpora are published in compressed form, but all samples here are uncompressed. * Some text files are presented as images to ensure foreign character sets display properly. * In some publications, NIST SPHERE file format is used for audio data, but the audio files in this sampler are MS-WAV/audio (RIFF) file format for compatibility with typical browser audio utilities. FLAC files have been expanded into their wav form as well. The link for the catalog number takes you to the catalog entry.

The data in this release consists of handwritten Arabic documents, scanned at high resolution and annotated for the physical coordinates of each line and token. Digital transcripts and English translations of each document are also provided, with the various content and annotation layers integrated in a single MADCAT XML output. The goal of the MADCAT program is to automatically convert foreign text images into English transcripts. MADCAT Phase 3 data was collected from Arabic source documents in three genres: newswire, weblog and newsgroup text. Arabic speaking scribes copied documents by hand, following specific instructions on writing style (fast, normal, careful), writing implement (pen, pencil) and paper (lined, unlined). Prior to assignment, source documents were processed to optimize their appearance for the handwriting task, which resulted in some original source documents being broken into multiple pages for handwriting. Each resulting handwritten page was assigned to up to five independent scribes, using different writing conditions. The handwritten, transcribed documents were next checked for quality and completeness, then each page was scanned at a high resolution (600 dpi, greyscale) to create a digital version of the handwritten document. The scanned images were then annotated to indicate the physical coordinates of each line and token. Explicit reading order was also labeled, along with any errors produced by the scribes when copying the text. The final step was to produce a unified data format that takes multiple data streams and generates a single MADCAT XML output file which contains all required information. The resulting madcat.xml file contains distinct components: a text layer that consists of the source text, tokenization and sentence segmentation, an image layer that consists of bounding boxes, a scribe demographic layer that consists of scribe ID and partition (train/test) and a document metadata layer. LDC has also released: * MADCAT Phase 1 Training Set (LDC2012T15) * MADCAT Phase 2 Training Set (LDC2013T09) * MADCAT Chinese Pilot Training Set (LDC2014T13) *Data* This release includes 4,540 annotation files in both GEDI XML and MADCAT XML formats (gedi.xml and madcat.xml) along with their corresponding scanned image files in TIFF format. The annotation results in GEDI XML files include ground truth annotations and source transcripts.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Transcripts Part 2 (LDC2013T17). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDCs Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Republic of China (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC's local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. Medianet collected Arabic programming from across the Gulf region using its internal system and LDC's portable broadcast collection platform installed in 2008. The portable platform deployed at the Medianet Tunisian collection facility collected multiple streams of regional Arabic programming from various sources. MTC collected Arabic programming using its internal collection system. LDC has also released GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Speech Part 1 (LDC2013S02) and GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2013T04). *Data* The broadcast conversation recordings in this release feature interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai; Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station; Oman TV, a national broadcaster located in the Sultanate of Oman; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. A table showing the number of programs and hours recorded from each source is contained in the readme file. This release contains 141 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Arabic speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program's genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/tools/XTrans/downloads/. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDCs quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-)verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.

It is comprised of one text file containing 750 English sentence pairs translated from the Arabic and Chinese newswire and web data sources. The goal of the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task was to create a unified framework for the evaluation of semantic textual similarity modules and to characterize their impact on natural language processing (NLP) applications. STS measures the degree of semantic equivalence. The STS task was proposed as an attempt at creating a unified framework that allows for an extrinsic evaluation of multiple semantic components that otherwise have historically tended to be evaluated independently and without characterization of impact on NLP applications. More information is available at the STS 2013 Shared Task homepage. *Data* The source data is Arabic and Chinese newswire and web data collected by LDC that was translated and used in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program and in several NIST Open Machine Translation evaluations. Of the 750 sentence pairs, 150 pairs are from the GALE Phase 5 collection and 600 pairs are from NIST 2008-2012 Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Progress Test Sets (LDC2013T07). The data was built to identify semantic textual similarity between two short text passages. The corpus is comprised of two tab delimited sentences per line. The first sentence is a translation and the second sentence is a post-edited translation. Post-editing is a process to improve machine translation with a minimum of manual labor. The gold standard similarity values and other STS datasets can be obtained from the STS homepage, linked above.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aAgirre, Eneko10aCer, Daniel10aDiab, Mona10aGonzalez-Agirre, Aitor10aGuo, Weiwei403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T1803502nmm a22003853i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245005200182264007300234336003800307336002600345337002600371338003200397500001500429500004500444506005100489520205500540520005102595546007102646650004902717650003402766655002002800700001802820700001802838700002402856700001902880856014902899856006803048m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2013    pau        u        chi d  a15856365768 aLDC2013T208 aISLRN: 097-396-657-690-10 achibeng07acmnazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast News Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2013]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2013T20  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T201 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast News Transcripts was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and contains transcriptions of approximately 110 hours of Chinese broadcast news speech collected in 2006 and 2007 by LDC and Hong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, during Phase 2 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2013T20). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at the Philadelphia, PA USA facilities of LDC and at three remote collection sites: HKUST (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. The LDC local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. HKUST collected Chinese broadcast programming using its internal recording system and a portable broadcast collection platform designed by LDC and installed at HKUST in 2006. *Data* The broadcast recordings in this release feature news programs focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Anhui TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Anhui Province; China Central TV (CCTV), a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; and Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station. This release contains 248 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Chinese speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about program genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

The goal of the project was to annotate a large corpus comprising various genres of text (news, conversational telephone speech, weblogs, usenet newsgroups, broadcast, talk shows) in three languages (English, Chinese, and Arabic) with structural information (syntax and predicate argument structure) and shallow semantics (word sense linked to an ontology and coreference). OntoNotes Release 5.0 contains the content of earlier releases -- OntoNotes Release 1.0 LDC2007T21, OntoNotes Release 2.0 LDC2008T04, OntoNotes Release 3.0 LDC2009T24 and OntoNotes Release 4.0 LDC2011T03 -- and adds source data from and/or additional annotations for, newswire (News), broadcast news (BN), broadcast conversation (BC), telephone conversation (Tele) and web data (Web) in English and Chinese and newswire data in Arabic. Also contained is English pivot text (Old Testament and New Testament text). This cumulative publication consists of 2.9 million words with counts shown in the table below. Arabic English Chinese News 300k 625k 250k BN n/a 200k 250k BC n/a 200k 150k Web n/a 300k 150k Tele n/a 120k 100k Pivot n/a n/a 300 The OntoNotes project built on two time-tested resources, following the Penn Treebank for syntax and the Penn PropBank for predicate-argument structure. Its semantic representation includes word sense disambiguation for nouns and verbs, with some word senses connected to an ontology, and coreference. *Data* Documents describing the annotation guidelines and the routines for deriving various views of the data from the database are included in the documentation directory of this release. The annotation is provided both in separate text files for each annotation layer (Treebank, PropBank, word sense, etc.) and in the form of an integrated relational database (ontonotes-v5.0.sql.gz) with a Python API to provide convenient cross-layer access. It is a known issue that this release contains some non-validating XML files. The included tools, however, use a non-validating XML parser to parse the .xml files and load the appropriate values. *Tools* This release includes OntoNotes DB Tool v0.999 beta, the tool used to assemble the database from the original annotation files. It can be found in the directory tools/ontonotes-db-tool-v0.999b. This tool can be used to derive various views of the data from the database, and it provides an API that can implement new queries or views. Licensing information for the OntoNotes DB Tool package is included in its source directory.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and Chinese.

The calls were recorded in 1995 and 1996 as part of the CALLFRIEND collection, a project designed primarily to support research in automatic language identification. One hundred native Farsi speakers living in the continental United States made a single telephone call, lasting up to 30 minutes, to a family member or friend living in the United States. Corresponding speech data is available as CALLFRIEND Farsi Second Edition Speech (LDC2014S01). *Data* Transcripts are presented in three formats: romanized transcripts (*asc.txt), Arabic-script transcripts (*ntv.txt) and both romanized and Arabic forms in a simple XML format (*.xml). For the *.txt files, the four main fields on each line (start-offset, end-offset, speaker-label, transcript-text) are separated by tabs. Each file begins with a single comment line containing the file_id string. This is followed immediately by the list of time-stamped segments, in order according to their start-offset values, with no blank lines. The XML form of the transcripts contains both Arabicized and romanized forms for Farsi words.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Iranian Persian.

One hundred native Farsi speakers living in the continental United States each made a single telephone call, lasting up to 30 minutes, to a family member or friend living in the United States. This release represents all calls from the collection. LDC released recordings from 60 calls without transcripts in 1996 as CALLFRIEND Farsi (LDC96S50) after 20 of those calls were used as evaluation data in the first NIST Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE). Seven of these original 60 calls were deemed unsuitable for transcription and, thus 53 of the original CF Farsi files are included along with 47 new files. Corresponding transcripts are available in CALLFRIEND Farsi Second Edition Speech Transcripts (LDC2014T01). *Data* All recordings involved domestic calls routed through the automated telephone collection platform at LDC and were stored as 2-channel (4-wire), 8-KHz mu-law samples taken directly from the public telephone network via a T-1 circuit. Each audio file is a FLAC-compressed MS-WAV (RIFF) format audio file containing 2-channel, 8-KHz, 16-bit PCM sample data.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Parallel aligned treebanks are treebanks annotated with morphological and syntactic structures aligned at the sentence level and the sub-sentence level. Such data sets are useful for natural language processing and related fields, including automatic word alignment system training and evaluation, transfer-rule extraction, word sense disambiguation, translation lexicon extraction and cultural heritage and cross-linguistic studies. With respect to machine translation system development, parallel aligned treebanks may improve system performance with enhanced syntactic parsers, better rules and knowledge about language pairs and reduced word error rate. The source Arabic data was translated into English. Arabic and English treebank annotations were performed independently. The parallel texts were then word aligned. The material in this corpus corresponds to a portion of the Arabic treebanked data in Arabic Treebank - Broadcast News v1.0 (LDC2012T07). LDC previously released GALE Arabic-English Parallel Aligned Treebank -- Broadcast News Part 1 (LDC2013T14). *Data* The source data consists of Arabic broadcast news programming collected by LDC in 2007 and 2008 from Al Arabiya, Abu Dhabi TV, Al Baghdadya TV, Al Fayha, Alhurra, Al Iraqiyah, Aljazeera, Al Ordiniyah, Al Sharqiya, Dubai TV, Oman TV, Radio Sawa and Saudi TV. All data is encoded as UTF-8. A count of files, words, tokens and segments is below. Language</TD> Files Words Tokens Segments Arabic 31 110,690 141,058 7,102 Note: Word count is based on the untokenized Arabic source. Token count is based on the ATB-tokenized Arabic source. The purpose of the GALE word alignment task was to find correspondences between words, phrases or groups of words in a set of parallel texts. Arabic-English word alignment annotation consisted of the following tasks: * Identifying different types of links: translated (correct or incorrect) and not translated (correct or incorrect) * Identifying sentence segments not suitable for annotation, e.g., blank segments, incorrectly-segmented segments, segments with foreign languages * Tagging unmatched words attached to other words or phrases This release contains four types of files - raw, tokenized, treebank, and wa. The raw format contains the original Arabic and English sentences without any annotation.

This release contains the evaluation sets (source data and human reference translations), DTD, scoring software, and evaluation plan for the OpenMT 2012 test for Arabic, Chinese, Dari, Farsi, and Korean to English on a parallel data set. The set is based on a subset of the Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English progress tests from the OpenMT 2008, 2009 and 2012 evaluations with new source data created by humans based on the English reference translation. The package was compiled, and scoring software was developed, at NIST, making use of newswire and web data and reference translations developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center. The objective of the OpenMT evaluation series is to support research in, and help advance the state of the art of, machine translation (MT) technologies -- technologies that translate text between human languages. Input may include all forms of text. The goal is for the output to be an adequate and fluent translation of the original. The MT evaluation series started in 2001 as part of the DARPA TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction) program. Beginning with the 2006 evaluation, the evaluations have been driven and coordinated by NIST as NIST OpenMT. These evaluations provide an important contribution to the direction of research efforts and the calibration of technical capabilities in MT. The Open MT evaluations are intended to be of interest to all researchers working on the general problem of automatic translation between human languages. To this end, they are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues and to be fully supported. The 2012 task included the evaluation of five language pairs: Arabic-to-English, Chinese-to-English, Dari-to-English, Farsi-to-English and Korean-to-English in two source data styles. For general information about the NIST OpenMT evaluations, refer to the NIST OpenMT website. This evaluation kit includes a single Perl script (mteval-v13a.pl) that may be used to produce a translation quality score for one (or more) MT systems. The script works by comparing the system output translation with a set of (expert) reference translations of the same source text. Comparison is based on finding sequences of words in the reference translations that match word sequences in the system output translation. LDC has also released the following related corpora: NIST 2012 Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Evaluation (LDC2013T03) (material from the Chinese-to-English pair track including restricted domain data) and NIST 2008-2012 Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) Progress Test Sets (LDC2013T07) (Arabic, Chinese and English test data). *Data* This release consists of 20 files, four for each of the five languages, presented in XML with an included DTD. The four files are source and reference data from the same source data in the following two styles: * English-true: an English-oriented translation this requires that the text read well and not use any idiomatic expressions in the foreign language to convey meaning, unless absolutely necessary. * Foreign-true: a translation as close as possible to the foreign language, as if the text had originated in that language.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Dari, Korean, Persian, English, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, Iranian Persian, and Chinese.

The utterances include read and spontaneous speech. The recordings were conducted in varied environments representing quiet and noisy settings. *Data* The corpus was designed principally for speaker recognition research. However, other possible applications include first language recognition, mobile effect, multichannel effect, and use of different type of microphones. The speech sources are word lists, sentence lists, paragraphs and question and answer sessions. Read speech text includes the following: * Sets of sentences devised to cover allophones of each phoneme, phonetic balance, and differentiation of accents. * Word lists developed to minimize missing phonemes and to represent nasals fricatives, commonly used words, and numbers. * Two paragraphs selected because they included all letters of the alphabet and were easy to read. Spontaneous speech was captured through question and answer sessions where speakers answer questions displayed on screen. The questions were on general topics such as the weather and food and included the speaker name or number. The speakers were Saudis and non-Saudis. Among the non-Saudi participants were Arabs and non-Arabs. All female speakers were either Saudis or non-Saudi Arabs. Male speakers included non-Arabs from the Indian subcontinent, Africa, South East Asia and East Europe. Non-Arab participants were required to be able to read Arabic at an acceptable level. Most of the Non-Arab speakers were from the fourth level in the Arabic Linguistics Institute at King Saud University. The non-Saudi participants represented 28 nationalities and were chosen from clusters of areas or countries. Each speaker was recorded in three different environments: in a soundproof room , in an office and in a cafeteria. The recordings were collected via different microphones and a mobile phone and averaged between 16-19 minutes. The recordings were done in three sessions with a time-gap of an approximately 6 weeks. The data was verified for missing recordings, problems with the recording system or errors in the recording process. All files are presented as two channel 48 kHz 16-bit FLAC compressed PCM wav files. Note that sizes and file names in the documentation are for the uncompressed wav files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Arabic.

Along with other corpora, the parallel text in this release comprised training data for Phase 2 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. This corpus contains Chinese source text and corresponding English translations selected from broadcast news (BN) data collected by LDC between 2005 and 2007 and transcribed by LDC or under its direction. *Data* This release includes 30 source-translation document pairs, comprising 198,350 characters of translated material. Data is drawn from 11 distinct Chinese BN programs broadcast by China Central TV, a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China, Jiangsu TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Jiangsu Province, New Tang Dynasty TV, a broadcaster based in the United States, and Phoenix TV, a Hong-Kong based satellite television station. The broadcast news recordings in this release focus principally on current events. The data was transcribed by LDC staff and/or transcription vendors under contract to LDC in accordance with Quick Rich Transcription guidelines developed by LDC. Transcribers indicated sentence boundaries in addition to transcribing the text. Data was manually selected for translation according to several criteria, including linguistic features, transcription features and topic features. The transcribed and segmented files were then reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed the Chinese to English translation guidelines developed by LDC. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation.

It provides more than 5,000 English hyponym relations in five domains including data mining, computer networks, data structures, Euclidean geometry and microbiology. All hypernym and hyponym words were taken from Wikipedia article titles. A hyponym relation is a word sense relation that is an IS-A relation. For example, dog is a hyponym of animal and binary tree is a hyponym of tree structure. Among the applications for domain-specific hyponym relations are taxonomy and ontology learning, query result organization in a faceted search and knowledge organization and automated reasoning in knowledge-rich applications. *Data* The data is presented in XML format, and each file provides hyponym relations in one domain. Within each file, the term, Wikipedia URL, hyponym relation and the names of the hyponym and hypernym words are included.

It contains approximately 229 hours of interviews from 420 interviewees along with transcripts and other documentation. Inspired by his experience making Schindlers List, Steven Spielberg established the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation in 1994 to gather video testimonies from survivors and other witnesses of the Holocaust. While most of those who gave testimony were Jewish survivors, the Foundation also interviewed homosexual survivors, Jehovahs Witness survivors, liberators and liberation witnesses, political prisoners, rescuers and aid providers, Roma and Sinti (Gypsy) survivors, survivors of eugenics policies, and war crimes trials participants. Within several years, the Visual History Archive held nearly 52,000 video testimonies in 32 languages representing 56 countries. It is the largest archive of its kind in the world. In 2006, the Foundation became part of the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and was renamed as the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education. The goal of the MALACH project was to develop methods for improved access to large multinational spoken archives. The focus was advancing the state of the art of automatic speech recognition and information retrieval. The characteristics of the USC-SFI collection -- unconstrained, natural speech filled with disfluencies, heavy accents, age-related coarticulations, un-cued speaker and language switching and emotional speech -- were considered well-suited for that task. The work centered on five languages: English, Czech, Russian, Polish and Slovak. USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts Czech was developed for the Czech speech recognition experiments. LDC has also released USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts English (LDC2012S05). *Data* The speech data in this release was collected beginning in 1994 under a wide variety of conditions ranging from quiet to noisy (e.g., airplane overflights, wind noise, background conversations and highway noise). Original interviews were recorded on Sony Beta SP tapes, then digitized into a 3 MB/s MPEG-1 stream with 128 kb/s (44 kHz) stereo audio. The sound files in this release are single channel FLAC compressed PCM WAV format at a sampling frequency of 16 kHz. Approximately 570 of all USC-SFI collected interviews are in Czech and average approximately 2.25 hours each. The interviews sessions in this release are divided into a training set (400 interviews) and a test set (20 interviews). The first fifteen minutes of the second tape from each training interview (approximately 30 total minutes of speech) were transcribed in .trs format using Transcriber 1.5.1. The test interviews were transcribed completely. Thus the corpus consists of 229 hours of speech (186 hours of training material plus 43 hours of test data) with 143 hours transcribed (100 hours of training material plus 43 hours of test data). Certain interviews include speech from family members in addition to that of the subject and the interviewer. Accordingly, the corpus contains speech from more than 420 speakers, who are more or less equally distributed between males and females.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Czech.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Parallel aligned treebanks are treebanks annotated with morphological and syntactic structures aligned at the sentence level and the sub-sentence level. Such data sets are useful for natural language processing and related fields, including automatic word alignment system training and evaluation, transfer-rule extraction, word sense disambiguation, translation lexicon extraction and cultural heritage and cross-linguistic studies. With respect to machine translation system development, parallel aligned treebanks may improve system performance with enhanced syntactic parsers, better rules and knowledge about language pairs and reduced word error rate. In this release, the source Arabic data was translated into English. Arabic and English treebank annotations were performed independently. The parallel texts were then word aligned. LDC previously released Arabic-English Parallel Aligned Treebanks as follows: * Newswire * Broadcast News Part 1 * Broadcast News Part 2 *Data* This release consists of Arabic source web data (newsgroups, weblogs) collected by LDC in 2004 and 2005. All data is encoded as UTF-8. A count of files, words, tokens and segments is below. Language Files Words Tokens Segments Arabic 162 46,710 69,766 3,178 Note: Word count is based on the untokenized Arabic source, token count is based on the ATB-tokenized Arabic source. The purpose of the GALE word alignment task was to find correspondences between words, phrases or groups of words in a set of parallel texts. Arabic-English word alignment annotation consisted of the following tasks: * Identifying different types of links: translated (correct or incorrect) and not translated (correct or incorrect) * Identifying sentence segments not suitable for annotation, e.g., blank segments, incorrectly-segmented segments, segments with foreign languages * Tagging unmatched words attached to other words or phrases This release contains four types of files - raw, tokenized, treebank, and wa. The raw format contains the original Arabic and English sentences without any annotation. The tokenized format is the treebank tokenized version of the raw data. It may contain Empty Category tokens (treebank leaves that have the POS label -NONE-). The treebank and wa files are treebank and word alignment annotations on the tokenized files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Standard Arabic, and Arabic.

HyTER is an evaluation metric based on large reference networks created by an annotation tool that allows users to develop an exponential number of correct translations for a given sentence. Reference networks can be used as a foundation for developing improved machine translation evaluation metrics and for automating the evaluation of human translation efficiency. *Data* The source material is comprised of Arabic and Chinese newswire and web data collected by LDC in 2007. Annotators created meaning-equivalent annotations under three annotation protocols. In the first protocol, foreign language native speakers built English networks starting from foreign language sentences. In the second, English native speakers built English networks from the best translation of a foreign language sentence as identified by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). In the third protocol, English native speakers built English networks starting from the best translation, but those annotators also had access to three additional, independently produced human translations. Networks created by different annotators for each sentence were combined and evaluated. This release includes the source sentences and four human reference translations produced by LDC in XML format, along with five machine translation system outputs representing a variety of system architectures and performance, and the human post-edited output of those systems also presented in XML.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and Chinese.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation.

The corpus was developed by Entropic Research Laboratory, Inc., a developer of speech recognition and speech synthesis software toolkits that was acquired by Microsoft in 1999. Participants were adult native speakers of Spanish as spoken in Central America and South America who resided in the Palo Alto, California area, had lived in the United States for at least one year and demonstrated a basic ability to understand, read and speak English. They read a total of 2200 sentences, 50 each in Spanish and English per speaker. The Spanish sentence prompts were a subset of the materials in LATINO-40 Spanish Read News, and the English sentence prompts were taken from the TIMIT database. Conversations were task-oriented, drawing on exercises similar to those used in English second language instruction and designed to engage the speakers in collaborative, problem-solving activities. *Data* Read speech was recorded on two wideband channels with a Shure SM10A head-mounted microphone in a quiet laboratory environment. The conversational speech was simultaneously recorded on four channels, two of which were used to place phone calls to each subject in two separate offices and to record the incoming speech of the two channels into separate files. The audio was originally saved under the Entropic Audio (ESPS) format using a 16kHz sampling rate and 16 bit samples. Audio files were converted to flac compressed .wav files from the ESPS format. ESPS headers were removed and are presented in this release as *.hdr files that include demographic and technical data. Transcripts were developed with the Entropic Annotator tool and are time-aligned with speaker turns. The transcription conventions were based on those used in the LDC Switchboard and CALLHOME collections. Transcript files are denoted with a .lab extension. Data files and their corresponding label files are stored in subdirectories named using a speaker-pair id and session number. The first three letters identify the speaker on channel A. The last three letters identify the speaker on channel B. Wideband audio files contain *.wb.flac in their file name, and narrow band audio files are denoted with a *.nb.flac in the file name.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Spanish and English.

The broadcast news recordings in this release focus principally on current events. The data was transcribed by LDC staff and/or transcription vendors under contract to LDC in accordance with Quick Rich Transcription guidelines developed by LDC. Transcribers indicated sentence boundaries in addition to transcribing the text. Data was manually selected for translation according to several criteria, including linguistic features, transcription features and topic features. The transcribed and segmented files were then reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDC's Chinese to English translation guidelines. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment. Each field in the TDF file is described in TDF_format.text. All data are encoded in UTF-8.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese, English, and Chinese.

It contains a sembank (semantic treebank) of over 13,000 English natural language sentences from newswire, weblogs and web discussion forums. AMR captures “who is doing what to whom” in a sentence. Each sentence is paired with a graph that represents its whole-sentence meaning in a tree-structure. AMR utilizes PropBank frames, non-core semantic roles, within-sentence coreference, named entity annotation, modality, negation, questions, quantities, and so on to represent the semantic structure of a sentence largely independent of its syntax. LDC also released Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) Annotation Release 2.0 (LDC2017T10). *Data* The source data includes discussion forums collected for the DARPA BOLT program, Wall Street Journal and translated Xinhua news texts, various newswire data from NIST OpenMT evaluations and weblog data used in the DARPA GALE program. The following table summarizes the number of training, dev, and test AMRs for each dataset in the release.

The data in this release consists of handwritten Chinese documents, scanned at high resolution and annotated for the physical coordinates of each line and token. Digital transcripts and English translations of each document are also provided, with the various content and annotation layers integrated in a single MADCAT XML output. The goal of the MADCAT program was to automatically convert foreign text images into English transcripts. MADCAT Chinese pilot data was collected from Chinese source documents in three genres: newswire, weblog and newsgroup text. Chinese speaking "scribes" copied documents by hand, following specific instructions on writing style (fast, normal, careful), writing implement (pen, pencil) and paper (lined, unlined). Prior to assignment, source documents were processed to optimize their appearance for the handwriting task, which resulted in some original source documents being broken into multiple "pages" for handwriting. Each resulting handwritten page was assigned to up to five independent scribes, using different writing conditions. The handwritten, transcribed documents were next checked for quality and completeness, then each page was scanned at a high resolution (600 dpi, greyscale) to create a digital version of the handwritten document. The scanned images were then annotated to indicate the physical coordinates of each line and token. Explicit reading order was also labeled, along with any errors produced by the scribes when copying the text. The final step was to produce a unified data format that takes multiple data streams and generates a single MADCAT XML output file which contains all required information. The resulting madcat.xml file contains distinct components: a text layer that consists of the source text, tokenization and sentence segmentation; an image layer that consist of bounding boxes; a scribe demographic layer that consists of scribe ID and partition (train/test); and a document metadata layer. LDC has also released: * MADCAT Phase 1 Training Set (LDC2012T15) * MADCAT Phase 2 Training Set (LDC2013T09) * MADCAT Phase 3 Training Set (LDC2013T15) *Data* This release includes 22,284 annotation files in both GEDI XML and MADCAT XML formats (gedi.xml and .madcat.xml) along with their corresponding scanned image files in TIFF format. The annotation results in GEDI XML files include ground truth annotations and source transcripts.

The goal of the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE) is to establish the baseline of current performance capability for language recognition of conversational telephone speech and to lay the groundwork for further research efforts in the field. NIST conducted language recognition evaluations in 1996, 2003, 2005 and 2007. The 2009 evaluation increased the number of target languages. Most of the test data originated from multilingual Voice of America (VOA) radio broadcasts assessed as being of telephone bandwidth in addition to conversational telephone speech. Further information regarding this evaluation can be found in the evaluation plan which is included in the documentation for this release. LDC released the prior LREs as: * 2003 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation (LDC2006S31) * 2005 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation (LDC2008S05) * 2007 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation Test Set (LDC2009S04) * 2007 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation Supplemental Training Set (LDC2009S05) *Data* The VOA speech data was collected by LDC in 2000 and 2001 and constitutes approximately 75% of the test set. The telephone speech was taken from LDC's Mixer 3 collection recorded between 2005 and 2007. All test speech segments are presented as a sampled data stream in standard 8-bit 8-kHz μ-law format. Each segment is stored separately in a single channel SPHERE format file. The test segments contain three nominal durations of speech: 3 seconds, 10 seconds and 30 seconds. Actual speech durations vary, but were constrained to be within the ranges of 2-4 seconds, 7-13 seconds and 23-35 seconds, respectively. Non-speech portions of each segment were included in each segment so that a segment contained a continuous sample of the source recording. Therefore, the test segments may be significantly longer than the speech duration, depending on how much non-speech was included.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Amharic, Haitian, English, French, Hindi, Spanish, Urdu, Bosnian, Croatian, Georgian, Korean, Portuguese, Turkish, Vietnamese, Yue Chinese, Dari, Persian, Hausa, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian, and Pushto.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation.

LDC also released TAC KBP Spanish Cross-lingual Entity Linking - Comprehensive Training and Evaluation Data 2012-2014 (LDC2016T26.) TAC (Text Analysis Conference) is a series of workshops organized by NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) to encourage research in natural language processing and related applications by providing a large test collection, common evaluation procedures, and a forum for researchers to share their results. TAC's KBP track (Knowledge Base Population) encourages the development of systems that can match entities mentioned in natural texts with those appearing in a knowledge base and extract novel information about entities from a document collection and add it to a new or existing knowledge base. Consult the LDC TAC-KBP project page for further information about LDC's resource development for the TAC-KBP program. *Data* The source data (Wikipedia infoboxes and articles) was taken from an October 2008 snapshot of Wikipedia. TAC KBP Reference Knowledge Base contains a set of entities, each with a canonical name and title for the Wikipedia page, an entity type, an automatically parsed version of the data from the infobox in the entity's Wikipedia article, and a stripped version of the text of the Wiki article. Each entity is assigned one of four types: PER (person), ORG (organization), GPE (geo-political entity) and UKN (unknown).

Corresponding audio data is released as GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Speech Part 1 (LDC2014S07). The broadcast recordings used for transcription feature news programs focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a television station based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Alhurra, a U.S. government-funded regional broadcaster; Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Dubai TV, a broadcast station in the United Arab Emirates; Al Iraqiyah, an Iraqi television station; Kuwait TV, a national broadcast station in Kuwait; Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station; Nile TV, a broadcast programmer based in Egypt; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 897,868 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-)verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2014T17). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong King (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. Medianet collected Arabic programming from across the Gulf region using its internal system and LDC's portable broadcast collection platform installed in 2008. The portable platform deployed at the Medianet Tunisian collection facility collected multiple streams of regional Arabic programming from various sources. MTC collected Arabic programming using its internal collection system. *Data* The broadcast recordings in this release feature news programs focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a televisions station based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Alhurra, a U.S. government-funded regional broadcaster; Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Dubai TV, a broadcast station in the United Arab Emirates; Al Iraqiyah, an Iraqi television station; Kuwait TV, a national broadcast station in Kuwait; Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station; Nile TV, a broadcast programmer based in Egypt; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. This release contains 200 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Arabic speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

The objective of the ACE program was to develop automatic content extraction technology to support automatic processing of human language in text form from a variety of sources including newswire, broadcast programming and weblogs. In the 2007 evaluation, participants were tested on system performance for the recognition of entities, values, temporal expressions, relations, and events in Chinese and English and for the recognition of entities and temporal expressions in Arabic and Spanish. LDC's work in the ACE program is described in more detail on the LDC ACE project pages. The LDC Catalog contains a series of publications from the ACE project and from researchers building on that work. Among them are: * ACE-2 Version 1.0 (LDC2003T11) * TIDES Extraction (ACE) 2003 Multilingual Training Data (LDC2004T09) * ACE Time Normalization (TERN) 2004 English Training Data v 1.0 (LDC2005T07) * ACE 2004 Multilingual Training Corpus (LDC2005T09) * ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus (LDC2006T06) * ACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations (LDC2008T03) * ACE 2005 Mandarin SpatialML Annotations (LDC2010T09) * ACE Time Normalization (TERN) 2004 English Evaluation Data V1.0 (LDC2010T18) * ACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations Version 2 (LDC2011T02) * Datasets for Generic Relation Extraction (reACE) (LDC2011T08) *Data* The Arabic data is composed of newswire (60%) published in October 2000-December 2000 and weblogs (40%) published during the period November 2004-February 2005. The Spanish data set consists entirely of newswire material from multiple sources published in January 2005-April 2005. Data selection was semi-automatic. A document pool was established for each language based on genre and epoch requirements. Humans reviewed the pool to select individual documents suitable for ACE annotation, such as documents that were representative of their genre and contained targeted ACE entity types. One annotator completed the entity and temporal expression (TIMEX2) markup in the first pass annotation. This work was reviewed in the second pass by a senior annotator. TIMEX2 values were normalized by an annotator specifically trained for that task. The table below describes the amount of data included in the current release and its annotation status. Corpus content for each language and data type is represented in the three stages of annotation: first pass annotation (1P), second pass annotation (2P) and TIMEX2 normalization and additional quality control (NORM).

In other words, for each newswire story or weblog entry, the three annotation directories each contain an identical copy of the source text (SGML .sgm file) along with distinct versions of the associated annotations (XML .ag.xml, apf.xml files and plain text .tab files). Note that in many cases, two annotation stages have produced identical output for a given source text, if no changes were made in the latter stage.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation.

It follows the lexically grounded approach of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (LDC2008T05) with adaptations based on the linguistic and statistical characteristics of Chinese text. Discourse relations are lexically anchored by discourse connectives (e.g., because, but, therefore), which are viewed as predicates that take abstract objects such as propositions, events and states as their arguments. Along with PDTB-style schemes for English, Turkish, Hindi and Czech, Chinese Discourse Treebank provides an additional perspective on how the PDTB approach can be extended for cross-lingual annotation of discourse relations. *Data* Data was selected from the newswire material in Chinese Treebank 8.0 (LDC2013T21), specifically, from Xinhua News Agency stories. There are approximately 5,500 annotation instances. Following the PDTB format, each annotation instance consists of 27 vertical bar delimited fields. The fields specify the attributes of the discourse relation as a whole, as well as the attributes of its two arguments. Not all fields are filled in this release. Filled fields are indicated by a pair of angle brackets; the remaining fields are place holders for future releases.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

Together, they make a four-way parallel text dataset representing approximately 38 hours of speech, with defined training, development, and held-out test sets. *Data* The source data are the Fisher Spanish and CALLOME Spanish corpora developed by LDC, comprising transcribed telephone conversations between (mostly native) Spanish speakers in a variety of dialects. The Fisher Spanish data set consists of 819 transcribed conversations on an assortment of provided topics primarily between strangers, resulting in approximately 160 hours of speech aligned at the utterance level, with 1.5 million tokens. The CALLHOME Spanish corpus comprises 120 transcripts of spontaneous conversations primarily between friends and family members, resulting in approximately 20 hours of speech aligned at the utterance level, with just over 200,000 words (tokens) of transcribed text. Translations were obtained by crowdsourcing using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, after which the data was split into training, development, and test sets. The CALLHOME data set defines its own data splits, organized into train, devtest, and evltest, which were retained here. For the Fisher material, four data splits were produced: a large training section and three test sets. These test sets correspond to portions of the data where four translations exist.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Spanish and English.

Reviews were collected by crowd-sourcing with Amazon Medical Turk. Each review was required to be original and was checked for plagiarism against the web. Reviews were annotated with respect to the following three dimensions: * Domain: Electronics (e.g., iPhone) or Hotels * Sentiment: Positive or Negative * Truth Value: * a) Truthful: a review about an object known by the writer reflecting the real sentiment of the writer toward the object of the review * b) Opposition: A review about an object known by the writer reflecting the opposite sentiment of the writer toward the object of the review (i.e., if the writer liked the object they were asked to write a negative review; if the writer did not like the object, they were asked to write a positive review) * c) Deceptive (i.e., fabricated): a review written about an object not known by the writer either positive or negative in sentiment; the objects reviewed were provided via a URL from the tasks in (a) and (b) *Data* Each review was judged a total of 30 times: (1) 10 times to evaluate its perceived quality (on a range from 1-5); (2) 10 times with judgments about its perceived truthfulness (e.g., truthful or somehow deceptive, a lie or a fabrication); and (3) 10 times for its perceived sentiment (i.e., star rating). The following metadata is available for each review: * time consumed by the writer to write the review * a pair review ID coupling the two reviews (positive/negative) written about the same object by the same person, either false or truthful * the ID of the writer who wrote the review * the writer's disclosure as to whether the object to be reviewed was already used and/or known to the writer * the URL identifying an instance of the object (i.e., hotel or electronic product) on the web * a flag for plagiarized reviews * a marker for reviews that may be removed from the corpus * the reasons for rejecting a review  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aSalvetti, Franco403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014T2403644nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041003300152042000700185245008100192264007300273336003800346336002600384337002600410338003200436500001500468500004500483506005100528520228500579520005102864546008102915655002002996700001703016700002003033700002403053856014903077856006803226m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2014    pau        u        chi d  a15856369678 aLDC2014T258 aISLRN: 445-017-231-229-40 achiaengbeng07acmnaengazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging -- Broadcast Training Part 2  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2014]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2014T25  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014T251 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging -- Broadcast Training Part 2 was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and contains 65,069 tokens of word aligned Chinese and English parallel text enriched with linguistic tags. This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation.

This corpus was designed to contain benchmarks for the task of open relation extraction (ORE), along with sample extractions from ORE methods and evaluation scripts for computing a method's precision and recall. ORE attempts to extract as many relations as described in a corpus without relying on relation-specific training data. The traditional approach to relation extraction requires substantial training effort for each relation of interest. That can be unpractical for massive collections such as found on the web. Open relation extraction offers an alternative by extracting unseen relations as they come. It does not require training data for any particular relation, making it suitable for applications that require a large (or even unknown) number of relations. Results published in ORE literature are often not comparable due to the lack of reusable annotations and differences in evaluation methodology. The goal of this benchmark data set is to provide annotations that are flexible and can be used to evaluate a wide range of methods. *Data* Binary and n-ary relations were extracted from the text sources. Sentences were annotated for binary relations manually and automatically. In the manual sentence annotation, two entities and a trigger (a single token indicating a relation) were identified for the relation between them, if one existed. A window of tokens allowed to be in a relation was specified; that included modifiers of the trigger and prepositions connecting triggers to their arguments. For each sentence annotated with two entities, a system must extract a string representing the relation between them. The evaluation method deemed an extraction as correct if it contained the trigger and allowed tokens only. The automatic annotator identified pairs of entities and a trigger of the relation between them; the evaluation script for that experiment deemed an extraction correct if it contained the annotated trigger. For n-ary relations, sentences were annotated with one relation trigger and all of its arguments. An extracted argument was deemed correct if it was annotated in the sentence. This release also includes extractions from the following ORE methods: ReVerb, SONEX, OLLIE, PATTY, TreeKernel, SwiRL, Lund and EXEMPLAR. Evaluation scripts are also provided for computing a method's precision and recall.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aMesquita, Filipe10aSchmidek, Jordan10aBarbosa, Denilson403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014T2705246nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245006200182264007300244336003800317336003300355337002600388338003200414500001500446500004500461506005100506520384200557520005104399546007104450655002804521700001804549700002404567700001904591700002104610700002404631856014904655856006804804m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2014    pau        u        chi d  a15856369918 aLDC2014S098 aISLRN: 248-931-036-356-40 achibeng07acmnazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Speech Part 1  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2014]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2014S09  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014S091 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Speech Part 1 was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and is comprised of approximately 126 hours of Mandarin Chinese broadcast conversation speech collected in 2007 by LDC and Hong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, during Phase 3 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2014T28). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: HKUST (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. HKUST collected Chinese broadcast programming using its internal recording system and a portable broadcast collection platform designed by LDC and installed at HKUST in 2006. *Data* The broadcast conversation recordings in this release feature interviews, call-in programs, and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Anhui TV, a regional television station in Anhui Province, China; Beijing TV, a national television station in China; China Central TV (CCTV), a Chinese national and international broadcaster; Hubei TV, a regional broadcaster in Hubei Province, China; and Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station. This release contains 217 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Chinese speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings, as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded, and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans . The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

It contains syntactic and semantic annotation for over 35,000 sentences, approximately one million words of Spanish and approximately 700,000 words of Catalan translated from the Spanish. GRIAL's work focuses on resources for applied linguistics, including lexicography, translation and natural language processing. Each sentence in SenSem Databank was labeled according to the verb sense it exemplifies, the type of complement it takes (arguments or adjuncts) and the syntactic category and function. Each argument was also labeled with a semantic role. Further information about the SenSem project can be obtained from the GRIAL website at http://grial.uab.es/sensem/corpus. *Data* The Spanish source data includes texts from news journals (30,000 sentences) and novels (5,299 sentences). Those sentences represent around 1,000 different verb meanings that correspond to the 250 most frequent Spanish verbs. Verb frequencies were retrieved from a quantitative analysis of around 13 million words. The Catalan corpus was developed by translating the news journal portion of the Spanish data set, resulting in a resource of over 700,000 sentences from which 391,267 sentences were annotated. Sentences were automatically translated and manually post-edited; some were re-annotated for sentence complements. Semantic information was the same for both languages. The Catalan sentences represent close to 1,300 different verbs. Data is presented in a single XML file per language.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Spanish and Catalan.

Corresponding audio data is released as GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Speech Part 2 (LDC2015S01). The broadcast recordings used for transcription feature news programs focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a television station based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Aljazeera , a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Dubai TV, based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Al Iraqiyah, a television network based in Iraq; Kuwait TV, a national television station based in Kuwait; Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station; Nile TV, a broadcast programmer based in Egypt; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. LDC also previously released GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2014T17). *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 920,730 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-)verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2015T01). LDC also released GALE Phase 2 Arabic Broadcast News Speech Part 1 (LDC2014S07). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong King (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. Medianet collected Arabic programming from across the Gulf region using its internal system and LDC's portable broadcast collection platform installed in 2008. The portable platform deployed at the Medianet Tunisian collection facility collected multiple streams of regional Arabic programming from various sources. MTC collected Arabic programming using its internal collection system. *Data* The broadcast recordings in this release feature news programs focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a television station based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Aljazeera , a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Dubai TV, based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Al Iraqiyah, a television network based in Iraq; Kuwait TV, a national television station based in Kuwait; Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station; Nile TV, a broadcast programmer based in Egypt; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. This release contains 204 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Arabic speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

Most of the accounts are those of Avocado employees; the remainder represent shared accounts such as "Leads", or system accounts such as "Conference Room Upper Canada". The collection consists of the processed personal folders of these accounts with metadata describing folder structure, email characteristics and contacts, among others. It is expected to be useful for social network analysis, e-discovery and related fields. *Data* The source data for the collection consisted of Personal Storage Table (PST) files for 282 accounts. A PST file is used by MS Outlook to store emails, calendar entries, contact details, and related information. Data was extracted from the PST files using libpst version 0.6.54. Three files produced no output and and are not included in the collection. Each account is referred to as a "custodian" although some of the accounts do not correspond to humans. The collection is divided into metadata and text. The metadata is represented in XML, with a single top-level XML file listing the custodians, and then one XML file per custodian listing all items extracted from that custodian's PST files. The full XML tree can be read by loading the top-level file with an XML parser that handles directives. All XML metadata files are encoded in UTF-8. The text contains the extracted text of the items in the custodians' folders, with the extracted text for each item being held in a separate file. The text files are then zipped into a zip file per custodian. *Licensing* Users are required to sign two license agreements in order to access this corpus, the Avocado Collection Organizational License Agreement and the Avocado Collection End User Agreement.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation.

The corpus was created to provide training, development and initial test sets for the Speech Activity Detection (SAD) task in the DARPA RATS (Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech) program. The goal of the RATS program was to develop human language technology systems capable of performing speech detection, language identification, speaker identification and keyword spotting on the severely degraded audio signals that are typical of various radio communication channels, especially those employing various types of handheld portable transceiver systems. To support that goal, LDC assembled a system for the transmission, reception and digital capture of audio data that allowed a single source audio signal to be distributed and recorded over eight distinct transceiver configurations simultaneously. Those configurations included three frequencies -- high, very high and ultra high -- variously combined with amplitude modulation, frequency hopping spread spectrum, narrow-band frequency modulation, single-side-band or wide-band frequency modulation. Annotations on the clear source audio signal, e.g., time boundaries for the duration of speech activity, were projected onto the corresponding eight channels recorded from the radio receivers. *Data* The source audio consists of conversational telephone speech recordings collected by LDC: (1) data collected for the RATS program from Levantine Arabic, Farsi, Pashto and Urdu speakers; and (2) material from the Fisher English (LDC2004S13, LDC2005S13), and Fisher Levantine Arabic telephone studies (LDC2007S02), as well as from CALLFRIEND Farsi (LDC2014S01). Annotation was performed in three steps. LDC's automatic speech activity detector was run against the audio data to produce a speech segmentation for each file. Manual first pass annotation was then performed as a quick correction of the automatic speech activity detection output. Finally, in a manual second pass annotation step, annotators reviewed first pass output and made adjustments to segments as needed. All audio files are presented as single-channel, 16-bit PCM, 16000 samples per second; lossless FLAC compression is used on all files; when uncompressed, the files have typical "MS-WAV" (RIFF) file headers.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in South Levantine Arabic, North Levantine Arabic, English, Persian, Pushto, and Urdu.

It is comprised of approximately 192 hours of Mandarin-English code-switching speech from 156 speakers with associated transcripts. Code-switching refers to the practice of shifting between languages or language varieties during conversation. This corpus focuses on the shift between Mandarin and English by Malaysian and Singaporean speakers. Speakers engaged in unscripted conversations and interviews. In the conversational speech segments, two speakers conversed freely with each other. The interviews consisted of questions from an interviewer and answers from an interviewee; only the interviewee's speech was recorded. Topics discussed range from hobbies, friends, and daily activities. *Data* The speakers were gender-balanced (49.7% female, 50.3% male) and between 19 and 33 years of age. Over 60% of the speakers were Singaporean; the rest were Malaysian. The speech recordings were conducted in a quiet room using several microphones and recording devices. Details about the recording conditions are contained in the documentation provided with this release. The audio files in this corpus are 16KHz, 16-bit recordings in flac compressed wav format between 20 and 120 minutes in length. Selected segments of the audio recordings were transcribed. Most of those segments contain code-switching utterances. The transcription file for each audio file is stored in UTF-8 tab-separated text file format.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and English.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Parallel aligned treebanks are treebanks annotated with morphological and syntactic structures aligned at the sentence level and the sub-sentence level. Such data sets are useful for natural language processing and related fields, including automatic word alignment system training and evaluation, transfer-rule extraction, word sense disambiguation, translation lexicon extraction and cultural heritage and cross-linguistic studies. With respect to machine translation system development, parallel aligned treebanks may improve system performance with enhanced syntactic parsers, better rules and knowledge about language pairs and reduced word error rate. The Chinese source data was translated into English. Chinese and English treebank annotations were performed independently. The parallel texts were then word aligned. The material in this release corresponds to portions of the Chinese treebanked data in Chinese Treebank 6.0 (LDC2007T36) (CTB), OntoNotes 3.0 (LDC2009T24) and OntoNotes 4.0 (LDC2011T03). *Data* This release consists of Chinese source broadcast programming (China Central TV, Phoenix TV), newswire (Xinhua News Agency) and web data collected by LDC.

The utterances were derived from 1997 Mandarin Broadcast News Speech and Transcripts (HUB4-NE) (LDC98S73 and LDC98T24, respectively). That collection consists of approximately 30 hours of Chinese broadcast news recordings from Voice of America, China Central TV and KAZN-AM, a commercial radio station based in Los Angeles, CA. The ability to use large speech corpora for research in phonetics, sociolinguistics and psychology, among other fields, depends on the availability of phonetic segmentation and transcriptions. This corpus was developed to investigate the use of phone boundary models on forced alignment in Mandarin Chinese. Using the approach of embedded tone modeling (also used for incorporating tones for automatic speech recognition), the performance on forced alignment between tone-dependent and tone-independent models was compared. *Data* Utterances were considered as the time-stamped between-pause units in the transcribed news recordings. Those with background noise, music, unidentified speakers and accented speakers were excluded. A test set was developed with 300 utterances randomly selected from six speakers (50 utterances for each speaker). The remaining 7,549 utterances formed a training set. The utterances in the test set were manually labeled and segmented into initials and finals in Pinyin, a Roman alphabet system for transcribing Chinese characters. Tones were marked on the finals, including Tone1 through Tone4, and Tone0 for the neutral tone. The Sandhi Tone3 was labeled as Tone2. The training set was automatically segmented and transcribed using the LDC forced aligner, which is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) aligner trained on the same utterances (Yuan et al. 2014). The aligner achieved 93.1% agreement (of phone boundaries) within 20 ms on the test set compared to manual segmentation. The quality of the phonetic transcription and tone labels of the training set was evaluated by checking 100 utterances randomly selected from it. The 100 utterances contained 1,252 syllables: 15 syllables had mistaken tone transcriptions; two syllables showed mistaken transcriptions of the final, and there were no syllables with transcription errors on the initial. Each utterance has three associated files: a flac compressed wav file, a word transcript file, and a phonetic boundaries and label file.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

The subglottal system is composed of the airways of the tracheobronchial tree and the surrounding tissues. It powers airflow through the larynx and vocal tract, allowing for the generation of most of the sound sources used in languages around the world. The subglottal resonances (SGRs) are the natural frequencies of the subglottal system. During speech, the subglottal system is acoustically coupled to the vocal tract via the larynx. SGRs can be measured from recordings of the vibration of the skin of the neck during phonation by an accelerometer, much like speech formants are measured through microphone recordings. SGRs have received attention in studies of speech production, perception and technology. They affect voice production, divide vowels and consonants into discrete categories, affect vowel perception and can be useful in automatic speech recognition. *Data* Speakers were recruited by Washington University's Psychology Department. The majority of the participants were Washington University students who represented a wide range of American English dialects, although most were speakers of the mid-American English dialect. The corpus consists of 35 monosyllables in a phonetically neutral carrier phrase (“I said a ____ again”), with 10 repetitions of each word by each speaker, resulting in 17,500 individual microphone (and accelerometer) waveforms. The monosyllables were comprised of 14 hVd words and 21 CVb words where C was b,d, g and V included all AE monophthongs and diphthongs. The target vowel in each utterance was hand-labeled to indicate the start, stop, and steady-state parts of the vowel. For diphthongs, the steady-state refers to the diphthong nucleus which occurs early in the vowel. The height and age of each speaker is included in the corpus metadata.

Corresponding audio data is released as GALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Speech Part 2 (LDC2015S06). Part 1 of this release is GALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2014T28). The corresponding part one audio is released as GALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Speech Part 1 (LDC2014S09). The broadcast conversation recordings feature interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Beijing TV, a national television station in Mainland China; China Central TV, a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; Hubei TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Hubei Province; Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station; and Voice of America, a U.S. government-funded broadcast programmer. *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 1,388,236 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Transcripts Part 2 (LDC2015T09). Part 1 of this release is GALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Speech Part 1 (LDC2014S09). The corresponding part one transcripts are released as GALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2014T28). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: HKUST (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. HKUST collected Chinese broadcast programming using its internal recording system and a portable broadcast collection platform designed by LDC and installed at HKUST in 2006. *Data* The broadcast conversation recordings in this release feature interviews, call-in programs, and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Beijing TV, a national television station in Mainland China; China Central TV, a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; Hubei TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Hubei Province; Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station; and Voice of America, a U.S. government-funded broadcast programmer. This release contains 209 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Chinese speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings, as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded, and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

The goal of this work was to create acoustic models for automatic speech recognition. For more information and documentation see the CIEMPIESS-UNAM Project website. LDC has also released an updated version as CIEMPIESS LIGHT (LDC2017S23). *Data* The speech recordings are from 43 one-hour FM radio programs broadcast by Radio IUS, a UNAM radio station. They are comprised of spontaneous conversations between a radio moderator and guests, principally about legal issues. Approximately 78% of the speakers were males, and 22% of the speakers were females. The audio was recorded in MP3 stereo format, using a 44.1 kHz sample rate and a bit-rate of 128 kbps or higher. Only "clean" utterances were selected from the raw data, meaning that the utterances were made by one only person with no background noises, whispers, music, foreign accents, white noise or static. The audio files were converted to 16 kHz, 16-bit PCM WAV format for this release. The recordings were transcibed using PRAAT, a tool designed for phonetics research. The transcripts are in Mexbet, a phonetic alphablet designed for Mexican Spanish based on Worldbet (Hieronymus, 1994).

RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT) is a collection of English news texts annotated for rhetorical relations under the RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) framework. In RST Signalling Corpus, information about textual signals -- such as although, because, thus -- and signals such as tense, lexical chains or punctuation were added as an annotation layer to examine how rhetorical relations are signalled in discourse. *Data* The source data consists of 385 Wall Street Journal news articles from the Penn Treebank annotated for rhetorical relations in RST Discourse Treebank. As in RST-DT, the data in this release is divided into a training set (347 articles) and a test set (38 articles). The signalling annotation in this data set was performed using the UAM CorpusTool version 2.8.12. Files are presented as UTF-8 encoded XML and plain text. The corpus is divided into three annotation sub-directories: training, test and full. All sub-directories include source, metadata, signalling annotation, and dtd files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aDas, Debopam10aTaboada, María Teresa10aMcFetridge, Paul403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2015T1005671nmm a22005293i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041005800134041006800192042000700260245004300267264007300310336003800383336002600421337002600447338003200473500001500505500004500520506005100565520352300616520005104139546013904190655002004329700003404349700003204383700003104415700004704446700002804493700002504521700003204546700002704578700003204605700003504637700003204672700002804704700002304732700005804755700002804813700002304841700002304864700003704887856014904924856006805073m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2015    pau        u        bul d  a15856371738 aLDC2015T118 aISLRN: 578-227-532-044-00 abuladanadutagerajpnaporaslvaspaasweaturbeng07abuladananldadeuajpnaporaslvaspaasweaturbeng2iso639-3  adc00a2006 CoNLL Shared Task - Ten Languages  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2015]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2015T11  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2015T111 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  a2006 CoNLL Shared Task - Ten Languages consists of dependency treebanks in ten languages used as part of the CoNLL 2006 shared task on multi-lingual dependency parsing. The languages covered in this release are: Bulgarian, Danish, Dutch, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. LDC also released the following 2006 & 2007 CoNLL Shared Task corpora: * 2007 CoNLL Shared Task - Basque, Catalan, Czech & Turkish (LDC2018T06) * 2007 CoNLL Shared Task - Greek, Hungarian & Italian (LDC2018T07) * 2007 CoNLL Shared Task - Basque, Catalan, Czech & Turkish (LDC2018T06) * 2006 CoNLL Shared Task - 2006 CoNLL Shared Task - Arabic & Czech (LDC2015T12) This corpus is cross listed and jointly released with ELRA as ELRA-W0086. The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) is accompanied every year by a shared task intended to promote natural language processing applications and evaluate them in a standard setting. In 2006, the shared task was devoted to the parsing of syntactic dependencies using corpora from up to thirteen languages. The task aimed to define and extend the then-current state of the art in dependency parsing, a technology that complemented previous tasks by producing a different kind of syntactic description of input text. More information about the 2006 shared task is available on the CoNLL-X web page. LDC has released data sets from other CoNLL shared tasks. 2008 CoNLL Shared Task Data contains the English material used in the 2008 shared task which focused on English, employed a unified dependency-based formalism and merged the tasks of syntactic dependency parsing, identifying semantic arguments and labeling them with semantic roles. 2009 CoNLL Shared Task Data Parts 1 and 2 consists of the English, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, German and Spanish resources used in the 2009 task which included a comparison of time and space complexity based on participants' input and learning curve comparison for languages with large datasets. LDC has also released the following CoNLL Shared Task data sets: * 2006 CoNLL Shared Task - Arabic & Czech (LDC2015T12) * 2008 CoNLL Shared Task Data (LDC2009T12) * 2009 CoNLL Shared Task Part 1 (LDC2012T03) * 2009 CoNLL Shared Task Part 2 (LDC2012T04) * 2015-2016 CoNLL Shared Task (LDC2017T13) *Data* The source data in the treebanks in this release consists principally of various texts (e.g., textbooks, news, literature) annotated in dependency format. In general, dependency grammar is based on the idea that the verb is the center of the clause structure and that other units in the sentence are connected to the verb as directed links or dependencies. This is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element in the sentence there is one node in the sentence structure that corresponds to that element. In constituency or phrase structure grammars, on the other hand, clauses are divided into noun phrases and verb phrases and in each sentence, one or more nodes may correspond to one element. The Penn Treebank (LDC99T42) is an example of a constituency or phrase structure approach. All of the data sets in this release are dependency treebanks. The individual data sets are: * BulTreeBank (Bulgarian) * The Danish Dependency Treebank (Danish) * The Alpino Treebank (Dutch) * The TIGER Corpus (German) * Treebank Tuba-J/S (Japanese) * Floresta Sinta(c)tica (Portuguese) * Slovene Dependency Treebank, SDT V0.1 (Slovene) * Cast3LB (Spanish) * Talbanken05 (Swedish) * METU-Sabanci Turkish Treebank (Turkish)  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Bulgarian, Danish, Dutch, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.

Along with other corpora, the parallel text in this release comprised training data for Phase 4 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. This corpus contains Chinese source sentences and corresponding English translations selected from broadcast conversation data collected by LDC in 2008 and transcribed and translated by LDC or under its direction. *Data* GALE Phase 4 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Parallel Sentences includes 109 source-translation document pairs, comprising 63,829 tokens of Chinese source text and its English translation. Data is drawn from 17 distinct Chinese programs broadcast in 2008 from Beijing TV, a national television station in Mainland China; China Central TV, a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; Hubei TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Hubei Province; and Voice of America, a U.S. government-funded broadcast programmer. Broadcast conversation programming is more interactive than traditional news broadcasts and includes talk shows, interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions. The programs in this release focus on current events topics. The data was transcribed by LDC staff and/or transcription vendors under contract to LDC in accordance with the Quick Rich Transcription guidelines developed by LDC. Transcribers indicated sentence boundaries in addition to transcribing the text. Sentences were selected for translation in two steps. First, files were chosen using sentence selection scripts provided by GALE program participants SRI International and IBM. The output was then manually reviewed by LDC staff to eliminate problematic sentences. Selected files were reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDC's Chinese to English translation guidelines and were provided with the full source documents containing the target sentences for their reference. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment. Each field in the TDF file is described in TDF_format.txt. All data are encoded in UTF-8. *Acknowledgement* This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

Participants were Stony Brook University students who identified themselves as native English speakers. This corpus was elicited using a navigation task in which one person directed another to walk to 18 unique destinations on Stony Brook University’s West campus. The direction-giver remained inside the lab and gave directions on a landline telephone to the pedestrian who used a mobile phone. As they visited each location, the pedestrians took a picture of each of the 18 destinations using the mobile phone. Pairs conversed spontaneously as they completed the task. The pedestrians' locations were tracked using their cell phones' GPS systems. The pedestrians did not have any maps or pictures of the target destinations and therefore relied on the direction-giver's verbal directions and descriptions to locate and photograph the target destinations. *Data* The conversations were recorded by means of a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) conferencing service. Due to the nature of the task, the recordings contain occasional background noise. Each digital audio file was transcribed with time stamps. Most of the recordings were first transcribed by a transcription company and then edited and checked by a trained graduate student. All other transcripts were transcribed by trained students at Stony Brook University. The corpus material also includes the visual materials (pictures and maps) used to elicit the dialogues, data about the speakers' relationship, spatial abilities and memory performance, and other information. All audio is presented as 8000Hz, 16-bit flac compressed wav. Note the data was converted from wav, so some documentation may still indicate wav.

Along with other corpora, the parallel text in this release comprised training data for Phase 4 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. This corpus contains Chinese source sentences and corresponding English translations selected from broadcast news data collected by LDC in 2008 and transcribed and translated by LDC or under its direction. *Data* GALE Phase 4 Chinese Broadcast News Parallel Sentences includes 40 source-translation document pairs, comprising 156,429 tokens of Chinese source text and its English translation. Data is drawn from eight distinct Chinese programs broadcast in 2008 from China Central TV, a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; and Voice of America, a U.S. government-funded broadcast programmer. The programs in this release feature news programs on current events topics. The data was transcribed by LDC staff and/or transcription vendors under contract to LDC in accordance with the Quick Rich Transcription guidelines developed by LDC. Transcribers indicated sentence boundaries in addition to transcribing the text. Sentences were selected for translation in two steps. First, files were chosen using sentence selection scripts provided by GALE program participants SRI International and IBM. The output was then manually reviewed by LDC staff to eliminate problematic sentences. Selected files were reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDC's Chinese to English translation guidelines and were provided with the full source documents containing the target sentences for their reference. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment. Each field in the TDF file is described in TDF_format.txt. All data are encoded in UTF-8. *Acknowledgement* This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

LDC distributes a wide and growing assortment of resources for researchers, engineers and educators whose work is concerned with human languages. Historically, most linguistic resources were not generally available to interested researchers but were restricted to single laboratories or to a limited number of users. Inspired by the success of selected readily-available and well-known data sets, such as the Brown University text corpus, LDC was founded in 1992 to provide a new mechanism for large-scale corpus development and resource sharing. With the support of its members, LDC provides critical services to the language research community that include: maintaining the LDC data archives, producing and distributing data via media or web download, negotiating intellectual property agreements with potential information providers and maintaining relations with other like-minded groups around the world. Resources available from LDC include speech, text, video data and lexicons in multiple languages, as well as software tools to facilitate the use of corpus materials. For a complete view of LDC's publications, browse the Catalog. The sampler is available as a free download. *Data* The LDC Spoken Language Sampler - Third Release provides speech and transcript samples and is designed to illustrate the variety and breadth of the speech-related resources available from the LDC Catalog. The sound files included in this release are excerpts that have been modified in various ways relative to the original data as published by LDC: * Most excerpts are truncated to be much shorter than the original files, typically between 1.5 and 2 minutes. * Signal amplitude has been adjusted where necessary to normalize playback volume. * Some corpora are published in compressed form, but all samples here are uncompressed. * Some text files are presented as images to ensure foreign character sets display properly. * In some publications, NIST SPHERE file format is used for audio data, but the audio files in this sampler are MS-WAV/audio (RIFF) file format for compatibility with typical browser audio utilities. FLAC files have been expanded into their wav form as well. The link for the catalog number takes you to the catalog entry.

The corpus includes 282,732 words in 1,585 materials, produced by 942 students from 67 nationalities studying at pre-university and university levels. The average length of an essay is 178 words. *Data* Two tasks were used to collect the written data, and participants had the choice to do one or both of them. In each of those tasks, learners were asked to write a narrative about a vacation trip and a discussion about the participant's study interest. Those choosing the first task generated a 40 minute timed essay without the use of any language reference materials. In the second task, participants completed the writing as a take-home assignment over two days and were permitted to use language reference materials. The audio recordings were developed by allowing students a limited amount of time to talk about the topics above without using language reference materials. The original handwritten essays were transcribed into an electronic text format. The corpus data consists of three types: (1) handwritten sheets scanned in PDF format; (2) audio recordings in MP3 format; and (3) textual unicode data in plain text and XML formats (including the transcribed audio and transcripts of the handwritten essays). The audio files are either 44100Hz 2-channel or 16000Hz 1-channel mp3 files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 3 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2015T16). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong King (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. Medianet collected Arabic programming from across the Gulf region using its internal system and LDC's portable broadcast collection platform installed in 2008. The portable platform deployed at the Medianet Tunisian collection facility collected multiple streams of regional Arabic programming from various sources. MTC collected Arabic programming using its internal collection system. *Data* The broadcast conversation recordings in this release feature interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a television station based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai; Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Dubai TV, a broadcast station in the United Arab Emirates; Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station; Oman TV, a national broadcaster located in the Sultanate of Oman; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. This release contains 149 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Arabic speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

Corresponding audio data is released as GALE Phase 3 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Speech Part 1 (LDC2015S11). The broadcast conversation recordings for transcription feature interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a television station based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai; Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Dubai TV, a broadcast station in the United Arab Emirates; Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station; Oman TV, a national broadcaster located in the Sultanate of Oman; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 733,233 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

This publication contains the complete set of Spanish development and test data to support the 2007 Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) technology evaluation, namely, newswire data annotated for entities and temporal expressions. The objective of the ACE program was to develop automatic content extraction technology to support automatic processing of human language in text form from a variety of sources including newswire, broadcast programming and weblogs. In the 2007 evaluation, participants were tested on system performance for the recognition of entities, values, temporal expressions, relations, and events in Chinese and English and for the recognition of entities and temporal expressions in Arabic and Spanish. LDC's work in the ACE program is described in more detail on the LDC ACE project pages. LDC has also released ACE 2007 Multilingual Training Corpus (LDC2014T18) which contains the Arabic and Spanish training data used in the 2007 evaluation. *Data* The data consists of newswire material published in May 2005 from the following sources: Agence France Press, The Associated Press and Xinhua News Agency. All files were annotated by two human annotators working independently. Discrepancies between the two annotations were adjudicated by a senior team member resulting in a gold standard file. There are three annotation directories for each newswire story that contain an identical copy of the source text in SGML format and two associated annotated versions in XML format and tab delimited format. All text is UTF-8 encoded.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Spanish.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Some approaches to statistical machine translation include the incorporation of linguistic knowledge in word aligned text as a means to improve automatic word alignment and machine translation quality. This is accomplished with two annotation schemes: alignment and tagging. Alignment identifies minimum translation units and translation relations by using minimum-match and attachment annotation approaches. A set of word tags and alignment link tags are designed in the tagging scheme to describe these translation units and relations. Tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language-specific features to the alignment annotation.

It consists of over 14,000 freely written, German sentences from more than 1,700 school children in grades one through eight. The data collection was conducted in 2011-2013 at elementary and secondary schools in and around Karlsruhe, Germany. Students were asked to write as verbose a text as possible. Those in grades one to four were read two stories and were then asked to write their own stories. Students in grades five through eight were instructed to write on a specific theme, such as "Imagine the world in 20 years. What has changed?" The goal of the collection was to use the data to develop a spelling error classification system. *Data* Annotators converted the handwritten text into digital form with all errors committed by the writers; they also created an orthographically correct version of every sentence. Metadata about the text was gathered, including the circumstances under which it was collected, information about the student writer and background about spelling lessons in the particular class. In a second step, the students' spelling errors were annotated into general groupings: grapheme level, syllable level, morphology and syntax. The files were anonymized in a third step. This release also contains metadata regarding the writers’ language biography, teaching methodology, age, gender and school year. The average age of the participants was 11 years, and the gender distribution was nearly equal.

It revises and enhances a subset of Articulation Index (AIC) (LDC2005S22), a corpus of persons speaking English syllables. Changes include the addition of forced alignment to sound files, time alignment of syllable utterances and format conversions. AIC consists of 20 American English speakers (12 males, 8 females) pronouncing syllables, some of which form actual words, but most of which are nonsense syllables. All possible Consonant-Vowel (CV) and Vowel-Consonant (VC) combinations were recorded for each speaker twice, once in isolation and once within a carrier-sentence, for a total of 25768 recorded syllables. *Data* Articulation Index LSCP alters AIC in the following ways. * Time-alignments for the onset and offset of each word and syllable were generated through forced-alignment with a standard HMM-GMM (Hidden Markov Model-Gaussian Mixture Model) ASR system. * The time-alignments for the beginning and end of the syllables (whether in isolation or within a carrier sentence) were manually adjusted. The time-alignments for the other words in carrier sentences were not manually adjusted. * The recordings of isolated syllables were cut according to the manual time-alignments to remove the silent portions at the beginning and end, and the time-alignments were altered to correspond to the cut recordings. * The file naming scheme was slightly altered for compatibility with the Kaldi speech recognition toolkit. * AIC contains a wide-band (16 KHz, 16-bit PCM) and a narrow-band (8 KHz, 8 bit u-law) version of the recordings distributed in sphere format. The LSCP version contains the wide-band version only distributed as wave files. This release does not include certain AIC triphone recordings (CVC, CCV or VCC). Audio data is presented as 16kHz 16-bit flac compressed .wav files. The flac compression was added for distribution, and documentation may refer to the files as .wav files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aSchatz, Thomas10aCao, Xuan-Nga10aKolesnikova, Anna10aBergvelt, Tomas10aWright, Jonathan10aDupoux, Emmanuel403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2015S1202649nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090041001300119041002300132042000700155245003500162264007300197336003800270336003300308336002600341337002600367338003200393500001500425500004500440506005100485520119000536520005101726546004901777655002001826655002001846700002201866700001701888700002501905700002301930700002801953700002101981700002002002856014902022856006802171m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2015    pau        u        ara d8 aLDC2015T238 aISLRN: 866-063-772-506-20 aarabeng07aarabeng2iso639-3  adc00aKHATT: Handwritten Arabic Text  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2015]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2015T23  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2015T231 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aKHATT: Handwritten Arabic Text was developed by King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Technical University of Dortmund and Braunschweig University of Technology.

Along with other corpora, the parallel text in this release comprised training data for Phase 4 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. This corpus contains Chinese source sentences and corresponding English translations selected from newswire data collected by LDC in 2008 and translated by LDC or under its direction. *Data* GALE Phase 4 Chinese Newswire Parallel Sentences includes 627 source-translation document pairs, comprising 90,434 tokens of Chinese source text and its English translation. Data is drawn from six distinct Chinese newswire sources. Sentences were selected for translation in two steps. First, files were chosen using sentence selection scripts provided by GALE program participants SRI International and IBM. The output was then manually reviewed by LDC staff to eliminate problematic sentences. Selected files were reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDC's Chinese to English translation guidelines and were provided with the full source documents containing the target sentences for their reference. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment. Each field in the TDF file is described in TDF_format.txt. All data are encoded in UTF-8. *Acknowledgement* This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

Corresponding audio data is released as GALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast News Speech (LDC2015S13). The broadcast news recordings for transcription feature news broadcasts focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Anhui TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Anhui Province; China Central TV (CCTV), a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station; and Voice of America (VOA), a U.S. government-funded broadcast programmer. *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 1,933,695 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 3 Chinese Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2015T25). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: HKUST (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. HKUST collected Chinese broadcast programming using its internal recording system and a portable broadcast collection platform designed by LDC and installed at HKUST in 2006. *Data* The broadcast news recordings in this release feature news broadcasts focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Anhui TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Anhui Province; China Central TV (CCTV), a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station; and Voice of America (VOA), a U.S. government-funded broadcast programmer. This release contains 279 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Chinese speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

It consists of 996 texts written over three months by 88 German school children age seven through eleven years. The data in this corpus was collected by an elementary school in Baden Württemberg, Germany and digitized at the Cooperative State University during the second half of the 2014/2015 school year. Three second and third grade classrooms participated in the collection. Texts were written within regular class settings. The students were presented with a picture and were asked to write a story, to describe the picture or if unable to write a text, to list what they saw in the picture. The pictures were designed to enhance the output with respect to important spelling error categories, namely, the marking of short vowels with a silent consonant letter and the correct spelling of the long vowel. The children were allowed at least 15 minutes to write the texts. This exercise was repeated weekly for 12 weeks. LDC has also released H2, E2, ERK1 Children's Writing (LDC2018T05). *Data* Most of the participants were multilingual. Out of 85 children for whom metadata is available, 57 students were multilingual speakers and 28 students were monolingual German speakers. The following metadata is included for each text in the database: school week of collection; school type (always elementary school); age; gender; grade/classroom; language spoken at home; and school materials used for German (Jojo). In all, 996 texts representing 62,764 tokens were collected. The texts were digitized in two forms: (1) the original text, including all errors (achieved), and (2) the intended (target) text, where all spelling errors were removed. Annotations were added to both the achieved text and the target text to distinguish words that should not be analyzed for spelling errors, such as names or foreign words. For sentence-level analysis, syntax errors were annotated by marking substitutions, deletions and insertions at the word level.

It is part of the NewSoMe (News and Social Media) set of corpora presenting opinion annotations across several genres and covering multiple languages. NewSoMe is the result of an effort to build a unifying annotation framework for analyzing opinion in different genres, ranging from controlled text, such as news reports, to diverse types of user-generated content that includes blogs, product reviews and microblogs. LDC has also released NewSoMe Corpus of Opinion in News Reports (LDC2015T17). *Data* The source data in this corpus was obtained by means of the Google Blog Search API. Spanish blogs were taken from wordpress.com and blogspot.com blogs. The English data was extracted from those same two domains and from asiawrites.org. This release consists of 108 English documents and 191 Spanish documents. The annotation was carried out manually through the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower with seven annotations per layer that were aggregated for this data set. The layers annotated were topic, segment, cue, subjectivity, polarity and intensity. Data is presented as UTF-8 either as plain text or in CSV files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English and Spanish.

The ongoing Penn Arabic Treebank Project (PATB) supports research in Arabic-language natural language processing and human language technology development. The methodology and work leading to the release of this publication are described in detail in the documentation accompanying this corpus. Generally, the PATB consists of two distinct phases: (a) part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which divides the text into lexical tokens and gives relevant information about each token such as lexical category, inflectional features, and a gloss (referred to as POS for convenience, although it includes morphological and gloss information not traditionally included with part-of-speech annotation), and (b) Arabic treebanking, which characterizes the constituent structures of word sequences, provides categories for each non-terminal node, and identifies null elements, co-reference, traces and so on. *Data* This release contains 243,117 source tokens before clitics were split, and 308,996 tree tokens after clitics were separated for treebank annotation. The source material is weblogs collected by LDC from various sources. The data are released as plain-text, tdf and xml files in UTF-8.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Arabic and Standard Arabic.

Along with other corpora, the parallel text in this release comprised training data for Phase 4 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. This corpus contains Chinese source sentences and corresponding English translations selected from newsgroup and weblog data collected by LDC and translated by LDC or under its direction. *Data* GALE Phase 4 Chinese Weblog Parallel Sentences includes 231 source-translation document pairs, comprising 92,501 tokens of Chinese source text and its English translation. Sentences were selected for translation in two steps. First, files were chosen using sentence selection scripts provided by GALE program participants SRI International and IBM. The output was then manually reviewed by LDC staff to eliminate problematic sentences. Selected files were reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDC's Chinese to English translation guidelines and were provided with the full source documents containing the target sentences for their reference. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment. Each field in the TDF file is described in TDF_format.txt. All data are encoded in UTF-8. *Acknowledgement* This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0003.

The DARPA BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) program developed machine translation and information retrieval for less formal genres, focusing particularly on user-generated content. LDC supported the BOLT program by collecting informal data sources -- discussion forums, text messaging and chat -- in Chinese, Egyptian Arabic and English. The material in this release represents the unannotated Chinese source data in the discussion forum genre. The data was subseqently translated and annotated for various tasks in the BOLT program including word alignment, treebanking, propbanking and co-reference. *Data* Collection was seeded based on the results of manual data scouting by native speaker annotators. Scouts were instructed to seek content in Mandarin Chinese that was original, interactive and informal. Upon locating an appropriate thread, scouts submitted the URL and some simple judgments about it to a database, via a web browser plug-in. When multiple threads from a forum were submitted, the entire forum was automatically harvested and added to the collection. The scale of the collection precluded manual review of all data. Only a small portion of the threads included in this release were manually reviewed, and it is expected that there may be some offensive or otherwise undesired content as well as some threads that contain a large amount of non-Chinese content. Language identification was performed on all threads in this corpus (using CLD2), and threads for which the results indicated a high probability of largely non-Chinese content are listed in cmn_suspect_LID.txt in the docs directory of this package. The corpus is comprised of HTML and XML files. The HTML files are a raw HTML file downloaded from the discussion thread. If the thread spanned multiple URLs, it was stored as a concatenation of the downloaded HTML files. The XML files were converted from the raw HTML. *Acknowledgement* This material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. HR0011-11-C-0145.

Corresponding audio data is released as GALE Phase 3 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Speech Part 2 (LDC2016S01). The broadcast conversation recordings feature interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a television station based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai; Al Baghdadya, an Iraqi broadcast programmer based in Egypt; Al Fayha, an Iraqi television channel; Al Hiwar, a regional broadcast station based in the United Kingdom; Alhurra, a U.S. government-funded regional broadcaster; Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Bahrain TV, a television station in the Kingdom of Bahrain; Dubai TV, a broadcast station in the United Arab Emirates; Kuwait TV, a national broadcast station in Kuwait; Oman TV, a national broadcaster located in the Sultanate of Oman; Qatar TV, a broadcast programmer in Qatar; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; Syria TV, the national television station in Syria; and Tunisian National TV, a national television station in Tunisia. *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 845,791 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC tool, XTrans, which supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 3 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Transcripts Part 2 (LDC2016T06). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong King (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. Medianet collected Arabic programming from across the Gulf region using its internal system and LDC's portable broadcast collection platform installed in 2008. The portable platform deployed at the Medianet Tunisian collection facility collected multiple streams of regional Arabic programming from various sources. MTC collected Arabic programming using its internal collection system. *Data* The broadcast conversation recordings in this release feature interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a television station based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai; Al Baghdadya, an Iraqi broadcast programmer based in Egypt; Al Fayha, an Iraqi television channel; Al Hiwar, a regional broadcast station based in the United Kingdom; Alhurra, a U.S. government-funded regional broadcaster; Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Bahrain TV, a television station in the Kingdom of Bahrain; Dubai TV, a broadcast station in the United Arab Emirates; Kuwait TV, a national broadcast station in Kuwait; Oman TV, a national broadcaster located in the Sultanate of Oman ; Qatar TV, a broadcast programmer in Qatar; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; Syria TV, the national television station in Syria; and Tunisian National TV, a national television station in Tunisia. This release contains 142 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Arabic speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

It contains approximately 215 hours of Cantonese conversational and scripted telephone speech collected in 2011 along with corresponding transcripts. The Babel program focuses on underserved languages and seeks to develop speech recognition technology that can be rapidly applied to any human language to support keyword search performance over large amounts of recorded speech. *Data* The Cantonese speech in this release represents that spoken in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, and within those provinces, among five dialect groups. The gender distribution among speakers is approximately even; speakers' ages range from 16 years to 67 years. Calls were made using different telephones (e.g., mobile, landline) from a variety of environments including the street, a home or office, a public place, and inside a vehicle. All audio data is presented as 8kHz 8-bit a-law encoded audio in sphere format. Transcripts are available in two versions: simplified Chinese characters and a romanization scheme based on the Yale system, both encoded in UTF-8. Further information about transcription methodology is contained in the documentation accompanying this release. Evaluation data is available from NIST in support of OpenKWS.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Yue Chinese.

Among the goals of the DEFT program is to develop technologies that can perform various NLP tasks on data in a variety of genres, both formal and informal. LDC provided source data and annotations for DEFT system development. DEFT Narrative Text consists of "proxy reports" (and "multi-proxy reports") in English. (Multi-)proxy reports are intended to mimic the format and other features of some types of government analyst reports using content from newswire articles. The corresponding English newswire source documents are also included in the release. *Data* LDC staff manually selected the source newswire from English Gigaword Fifth Edition (LDC2011T07). Articles were selected for topics of potential interest to the intelligence community based on general guidance from DEFT project sponsors. The newswire source documents are XML files following the Gigaword corpus format.

SemEval is an ongoing series of evaluations of computational semantic analysis systems intended to explore the nature of meaning in language. It evolved from the Senseval word sense disambiguation series to include semantic analysis tasks outside of word sense disambiguation. *Data* SDP 2014 & 2015: Broad Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing is based on English, Chinese and Czech data from the following resources: Treebank-2 LDC95T17, Proposition Bank I LDC2004T14, NomBank v 1.0 LDC2008T23 and CCGBank LDC2005T13 (English); Chinese Treebank (e.g., Chinese Treebank 8.0 LDC2013T21) (Chinese); and Prague Dependency Treebank (e.g., Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0, LDC2006T01) (Czech). The results are presented as graphs in three target representations: MRS-Derived Semantic Dependencies (DM), Enju Predicate–Argument Structures (PAS), and Prague Semantic Dependencies (PSD). As a fourth, additional target representation CCGbank was converted to semantic dependency graphs (in the subdirectory ‘ccd’). These graphs are aligned with the graphs released in connection with SDP 2015 for English. The data is divided into three main directories: * ‘2014/’ — the data, tools, and system results from Task 8 at SemEval 2014 * ‘2015/’ — the data, tools, and system results from Task 18 at SemEval 2015 * ‘ccd/’ — the new set of semantic dependency graphs derived from CCGbank In the 2014 and 2015 sub-directories, the file layout preserves the original conventions used for data distribution to SemEval participants, so as to make it easy to replicate published results. Each sub-directory (including the new ‘ccd/’) provides its own file ‘README.txt’ with additional instructions.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English, Chinese, and Czech.

This data set was created in collaboration with NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) as part of the HAVIC (the Heterogeneous Audio Visual Internet Collection) project, the goal of which is to advance multimodal event detection and related technologies. LDC has developed a large, heterogeneous, annotated multimodal corpus for HAVIC that has been used in the NIST-sponsored MED (Multimedia Event Detection) task for several years. HAVIC Pilot Transcription supported an experiment to produce a verbatim transcript (quick and rich transcription) based on audio extracted from user-generated videos. It contains the pilot transcripts for selected MED 2011 video files as well as the associated videos. *Data* NIST designated the videos to be transcribed. Annotators generated the transcripts using XTrans, which supports manual transcription across multiple channels, languages and platforms. HAVIC transcription guidelines are included in the documentation for this release. Each file was transcribed by a single annotator with no corpus-wide second pass. File samples from each annotator were checked for various errors, including missing transcription, improper mark-up, poor segmentation and missing/added words. All transcription files are in .tdf format, a plain-text, flat-table format with 13 tab-delimited fields. All video files are in .mp4 format (h264), with varying bit-rates and levels of audio fidelity and video resolution.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aVideo recordings2lcgft7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aTracey, Jennifer10aStrassel, Stephanie10aMorris, Amanda10aLi, Xuansong10aAntonishek, Brian10aFiscus, Jonathan G.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2016V0103595nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245006000182264007300242336003800315336002600353337002600379338003200405500001500437500004500452506005100497520224700548520005102795546007102846655002002917700001802937700001802955700002402973700001902997856014903016856006803165m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2016    pau        u        chi d  a15856375488 aLDC2016T128 aISLRN: 358-076-735-024-10 achibeng07acmnazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 4 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2016]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2016T12  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2016T121 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 4 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Transcripts was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and contains transcriptions of approximately 172 hours of Chinese broadcast conversation speech collected in 2008 by LDC and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, during Phase 4 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. Corresponding audio data is released as GALE Phase 4 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Speech (LDC2016S03). The broadcast conversation recordings feature interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Beijing TV, a national television station in Mainland China; China Central TV (CCTV), a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; Hubei TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Hubei Province; Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station ; and Voice of America (VOA), a U.S. government-funded broadcast programmer. *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 2,259,952 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 4 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Transcripts (LDC2016T12). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: HKUST (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. HKUST collected Chinese broadcast programming using its internal recording system and a portable broadcast collection platform designed by LDC and installed at HKUST in 2006. *Data* The broadcast conversation recordings in this release feature interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Beijing TV, a national television station in Mainland China; China Central TV (CCTV), a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; Hubei TV, a regional television station in Mainland China, Hubei Province; Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station ; and Voice of America (VOA), a U.S. government-funded broadcast programmer. This release contains 236 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Chinese speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

The Chinese Treebank project began at the University of Pennsylvania in 1998, continued at the University of Colorado and then moved to Brandeis University. The project's goal is to provide a large, part-of-speech tagged and fully bracketed Chinese language corpus. The first delivery, Chinese Treebank 1.0, contained 100,000 syntactically annotated words from Xinhua News Agency newswire. It was later corrected and released in 2001 as Chinese Treebank 2.0 (LDC2001T11) and consisted of approximately 100,000 words. LDC released Chinese Treebank 4.0 (LDC2004T05), an updated version containing roughly 400,000 words, in 2004. A year later, LDC published the 500,000 word Chinese Treebank 5.0 (LDC2005T01). Chinese Treebank 6.0 (LDC2007T36), released in 2007, consisted of 780,000 words. Chinese Treebank 7.0 (LDC2010T08), released in 2010, added new annotated newswire data, broadcast material and web text to the approximate total of one million words. Chinese Treebank 8.0 (LDC2013T21) included new annotated data from newswire, magazine articles and government documents. Chinese Treebank 9.0 adds more annotated web data and two new genres - chat messages and transcribed conversational telephone speech. *Data* There are 3,726 text files in this release, containing 132,076 sentences, 2,084,387 words, 3,247,331 characters (hanzi or foreign). The data is provided in the UTF-8 encoding, and the annotation has Penn Treebank-style labeled brackets. Details of the annotation standard can be found in the enclosed segmentation, POS-tagging and bracketing guidelines. The data is provided in four different formats: raw text, word segmented, POS-tagged, and syntactically bracketed formats.

Along with other corpora, the parallel text in this release comprised training data for Phase 4 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. This corpus contains Modern Standard Arabic source text and corresponding English translations, selected from newsgroup and weblog data collected by LDC and translated by LDC or under its direction. *Data* GALE Phase 4 Arabic Weblog Parallel Sentences includes 1,067 source-translation document pairs, comprising 68,346 words (Arabic source) of translated data. Data is drawn from various Arabic newsgroup and weblog sources. Sentences were selected for translation in two steps. First, files were chosen using sentence selection scripts provided by GALE program participants SRI International and IBM. The output was then manually reviewed by LDC staff to eliminate problematic sentences. Selected files were reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDC's Arabic to English translation guidelines and were provided with the full source documents containing the target sentences for their reference. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment. Each field in the TDF file is described in TDF_format.txt.

Along with other corpora, the parallel text in this release comprised training data for Phases 3 and 4 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. This corpus contains Chinese source text and corresponding English translations selected from broadcast news data collected by LDC between 2006 and 2008 and transcribed and translated by LDC or under its direction. *Data* GALE Phase 3 and 4 Chinese Broadcast News Parallel Text includes 76 source-translation document pairs, comprising 614,608 tokens of Chinese source text and its English translation. Data is drawn from 16 distinct Chinese programs broadcast between 2006 and 2008 by China Central TV (CCTV), a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China and Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station. The programs in this release feature news programs on current events topics. The files in this release were transcribed by LDC staff and/or transcription vendors under contract to LDC in accordance with the Quick Rich Transcription guidelines developed by LDC. Transcribers indicated sentence boundaries in addition to transcribing the text. Data was manually selected for translation according to several criteria, including linguistic features, transcription features and topic features. The transcribed and segmented files were then reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDC's Chinese to English translation guidelines. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment. Each field in the TDF file is described in TDF_format.txt.

This corpus was created to examine communication accommodation, specifically, the ways in which an individual's linguistic style, or how an individual communicates, is affected by social power and personality. The data was collected in two studies. In the first study, 40 participants had a series of paired five minute face-to-face conversations playing either a high, low or neutral power role. The same procedure was followed in the second study except that participants discussed business ideas via instant messaging. *Data* The face-to-face conversations were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. There are 139 transcripts of conversations between high and low power individuals and 63 transcripts of conversations between neutral power individuals. The instant messaging program automatically saved the transcripts of the messaging conversations; the transcripts were then retrieved and formatted for analysis. There are 85 transcripts of conversations between high and low power individuals and 101 transcripts of conversations between neutral power individuals. The transcripts were anonymized. Gender and age metadata are available where provided. All transcripts are presented as UTF-8 plain text files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aMuir, Kate10aJoinson, Adam10aCotterill, Rachel10aDewdney, Nigel403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2016T1603744nmm a22003853i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245005300141264007300194336003800267336003300305337002600338338003200364500001500396500004500411506005100456520233300507520005102840546004202891655002802933700003302961700002002994700002303014700001803037700001803055700003003073700001703103700002103120856014903141856006803290m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2016    pau        u        eng d  a15856376108 aLDC2016S058 aISLRN: 920-059-271-034-1  adc00aDigital Archive of Southern Speech - NLP Version  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2016]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2016S05  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2016S051 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aDigital Archive of Southern Speech - NLP Version (DASS-NLP) was developed by LDC as an alternate version of Digital Archive of Southern Speech (DASS) (LDC2012S03) suitable for natural language processing and human language technology applications. Specifically, the original audio files have been converted to 16kHz 16-bit flac compressed wav and file names have been normalized to facilitate automatic processing. DASS was developed by the University of Georgia. It is a subset of the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States (LAGS), which is in turn part of the Linguist Atlas Project (LAP). DASS-NLP contains approximately 366 hours of English speech data from 30 female speakers and 34 male speakers in flac compressed wav format, along with associated metadata about the speakers and the recordings and maps in .jpeg format relating to the recording locations. LAP consists of a set of survey research projects about the words and pronunciation of everyday American English, the largest project of its kind in the United States. Interviews with thousands of native speakers across the country have been carried out since 1929. LAGS surveyed the everyday speech of Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas in a series of 914 audio-taped interviews conducted from 1968-1983. Interviews average approximately six hours in length; the systematic LAGS tape archive amounts to 5500 hours of sound recordings. DASS is a collection of 64 interviews from LAGS selected to cover a range of speech across the region and to represent multiple education levels and ethnic backgrounds. *Data* The DASS-NLP speakers' average age is 61 years; there are 30 women and 34 men from the Gulf States region represented in this release. The interviews cover common topics such as family, the weather, household articles and activities, agriculture and social connections. The interviews were originally recorded in the field on reel-to-reel audio tape. A digital version of every reel of tape was then made, one .wav file per reel, usually about one hour of sound. Each interview thus consists of a set of 3 to 13 reels, or roughly 3 to 13 interview hours. Personally identifying or sensitive information in the files was replaced with a tone to protect the privacy and to assure ethical treatment of speakers.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aKretzschmar, William A., Jr.10aBounds, Paulina10aHettel, Jacqueline10aCoats, Steven10aPederson, Lee10aOpas-Hänninen, Lisa Lena10aJuuso, Ilkka10aSeppänen, Tapio403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2016S0503170nmm a22005413i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245006100177264007300238336003800311336003300349336002600382337002600408338003200434500001500466500004500481506005100526520134100577520005101918546005101969655002802020655002002048700001602068700001602084700001902100700002402119700002102143700002502164700001702189700001902206700001702225700003902242700001702281700001902298700001902317700001502336700001902351700002502370700001602395856014902411856006802560m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2016    pau        u        asm d  a15856376298 aLDC2016S068 aISLRN: 108-288-201-055-70 aasmbeng07aasmbeng2iso639-3  adc00aIARPA Babel Assamese Language Pack IARPA-babel102b-v0.5a  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2016]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2016S06  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2016S061 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aIARPA Babel Assamese Language Pack IARPA-babel102b-v0.5a was developed by Appen for the IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) Babel program.

Corresponding audio data is released as GALE Phase 3 Arabic Broadcast News Speech Part 1 (LDC2016S07). The broadcast news recordings for transcription feature news broadcasts focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a television station based in Abu Dhabi, Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai; Al Iraqiyah, an Iraqi television station; Aljazeera , a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Dubai TV, a broadcast station in the United Arab Emirates; Kuwait TV, a national broadcast station in Kuwait; Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station; Nile TV, a broadcast programmer based in Egypt, Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 741,689 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC tool, XTrans, which supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 3 Arabic Broadcast News Transcripts Part 1 (LDC2016T17). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong King (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. Medianet collected Arabic programming from across the Gulf region using its internal system and LDC's portable broadcast collection platform installed in 2008. The portable platform deployed at the Medianet Tunisian collection facility collected multiple streams of regional Arabic programming from various sources. MTC collected Arabic programming using its internal collection system. *Data* The broadcast news recordings in this release feature news broadcasts focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a television station based in Abu Dhabi, Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai; Al Iraqiyah, an Iraqi television station; Aljazeera , a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Dubai TV, a broadcast station in the United Arab Emirates; Kuwait TV, a national broadcast station in Kuwait; Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station; Nile TV, a broadcast programmer based in Egypt, Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. This release contains 175 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Arabic speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

LDC's ATB series follows the constituency or phrase structure approach to treebank development in which clauses are divided into noun phrases and verb phrases and in each sentence, one or more nodes may correspond to one element. Dependency grammar, on the other hand, is based on the idea that the verb is the center of the clause structure and that other units in the sentence are connected to the verb as directed links or dependencies. This is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element in the sentence there is one node in the sentence structure that corresponds to that element. ARL Arabic Dependency Treebank was generated using constituency-to-dependency software written at ARL. *Data* The source data in this release consists of Arabic newswire and broadcast programming collected by LDC from various news and broadcast providers. The files are in an 11-column tab-separated format with one or more blank lines between sentences. All files are UTF-8 encoded.

The DARPA BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) program developed machine translation and information retrieval for less formal genres, focusing particularly on user-generated content. LDC supported the BOLT program by collecting informal data sources -- discussion forums, text messaging and chat -- in Chinese, Egyptian Arabic and English. The collected data was translated and annotated for various tasks including word alignment, treebanking, propbanking and co-reference. *Data* This release consists of Chinese source discussion forum threads harvested from the Internet by LDC using a combination of manual and automatic processes. The source data is released as BOLT Chinese Discussion Forums (LDC2016T05). The BOLT word alignment task was built on treebank annotation. Specifically, LDC automatically extracted Chinese source tokens, including empty categories/traces, from word-segmented files provided by the BOLT Chinese Treebank annotation team at Brandeis University. The word-segmented tokens were then used to automatically generate ctb (Chinese Treebank) alignment and were also tokenized for character alignment by inserting white spaces to separate characters. The data profile broken down by character tokens, ctb tokens and segments appears below: Language Genre Files Words CharTokens CTBTokens Segments Chinese forum 570 448,094 672,140 442,520 20,819 *Acknowledgement* This material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. HR0011-11-C-0145.

Along with other corpora, the parallel text in this release comprised training data for Phase 4 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. This corpus contains Modern Standard Arabic source sentences and corresponding English translations selected from broadcast news data collected by LDC in 2007 and 2008 and transcribed and translated by LDC or under its direction. *Data* GALE Phase 4 Arabic Broadcast News Parallel Sentences includes 106 source-translation document pairs, comprising 114,251 words (Arabic source) of translated data. Data is drawn from 24 distinct Arabic programs featuring news broadcasts. The data was transcribed by LDC staff and/or transcription vendors under contract to LDC in accordance with the Quick Rich Transcription guidelines developed by LDC. Transcribers indicated sentence boundaries in addition to transcribing the text. Sentences were selected for translation in two steps. First, files were chosen using sentence selection scripts provided by GALE program participants SRI International and IBM. The output was then manually reviewed by LDC staff to eliminate problematic sentences. Selected files were reformatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDC's Arabic to English translation guidelines and were provided with the full source documents containing the target sentences for their reference. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. Source data and translations are distributed in TDF format. TDF files are tab-delimited files containing one segment of text along with meta information about that segment. Each field in the TDF file is described in TDF_format.txt.

It consists of coreference, bridging and event-event relations (temporal, causal, subevent and reporting relations) annotations over 95 English newswire, discussion forum and narrative text documents, covering all events, times and non-eventive entities within each document. RED annotation is intended to join different annotation layers and to provide a rich representation of event phenomena. *Data* Documents were annotated twice -- in a markable pass and in an event annotation phase. In the markable pass, events, entities, TIMEX3 and section elements were annotated across the entire document and features were marked on each markable element. Event relations and event coreference were then annotated over the adjudicated markables. Further information about the annotation process is contained in the guidelines accompanying this release. Annotation and source documents are divided into three partitions: (1) 20 newswire summarization documents, (2) 20 discussion forum documents and newswire annotations used in the original RED pilot annotations, and (3) 55 documents annotated by a range of DEFT (Deep Exploration and Filtering of Test) annotation formats.

The data were collected primarily to support research and technology evaluation in automatic language identification, and portions of these telephone calls were used in the NIST 2011 Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE). LRE 2011 focused on language pair discrimination for 24 languages/dialects, some of which could be considered mutually intelligible or closely related. LDC has released the following as part of the Multi-Language Conversational Telephone Speech 2011 series: * Turkish (LDC2017S09) * South Asian (LDC2017S14) * Central Asian (LDC2018S03) *Data* Participants were recruited by native speakers who contacted acquaintances in their social network. Those native speakers made one call, up to 15 minutes, to each acquaintance. The data was collected using LDC's telephone collection infrastructure, comprised of three computer telephony systems. Human auditors labeled calls for callee gender, dialect type and noise. Demographic information about the participants was not collected. All audio data are presented in FLAC-compressed MS-WAV (RIFF) file format (*.flac); when uncompressed, each file is 2 channels, recorded at 8000 samples/second with samples stored as 16-bit signed integers, representing a lossless conversion from the original mu-law sample data as captured digitally from the public telephone network. The following table summarizes the total number of calls, total number of hours of recorded audio, and the total size of compressed data: group lng #calls #hours #MB slavic pol 124 28.3 1457 slavic rus 71 13.1 577 slavic ukr 89 19.0 932 slavic Totals 284 60.4 2966  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian.

It includes queries and gold standard entity type information, Knowledge Base links, and equivalence class clusters for NIL entities along with the source documents for the queries, specifically, English and Spanish newswire, discussion forum and web data. The corresponding knowledge base is available as TAC KBP Reference Knowledge Base (LDC2014T16). Text Analysis Conference (TAC) is a series of workshops organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). TAC was developed to encourage research in natural language processing and related applications by providing a large test collection, common evaluation procedures, and a forum for researchers to share their results. Through its various evaluations, the Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track of TAC encourages the development of systems that can match entities mentioned in natural texts with those appearing in a knowledge base and extract novel information about entities from a document collection and add it to a new or existing knowledge base. Spanish cross-lingual entity linking was first conducted as part of the 2012 TAC KBP evaluations. The track was an extension of the monolingual English Entity Linking track (EL) whose goal was to measure systems' ability to determine whether an entity, specified by a query, had a matching node in a reference knowledge base (KB) and, if so, to create a link between the two. If there was no matching node for a query entity in the KB, EL systems were required to cluster the mention together with others referencing the same entity. More information about the TAC KBP Entity Linking task and other TAC KBP evaluations can be found on the NIST TAC website. *Data* All source documents were originally released as XML but have been converted to text files for this release. This change was made primarily because the documents were used as text files during data development but also because some fail XML parsing. *Acknowledgement* This material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory and Defense Advance Research Projects Agency under agreement number FA8750-13-2-0045.

It is the third publication in an LDC project to build an electronic dictionary of three Mandekan languages: Mawukakan, Maninkakan and Bamanankan. These are Eastern Manding languages in the Mande Group of the Niger-Congo language family. LDC released a Mawukakan Lexicon (LDC2005L01) in 2005 and a Maninkakan Lexicon (LDC2013L01) in 2013. There are approximately 15 million Bamanankan speakers (four million in Mali, and ten million in the West African region who speak Bamanankan as a second language.) The number of speakers of the different Mandekan dialects is approximately 30 to 40 million, mainly in Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Gambia. Bamanankan is the most studied among the Mandekan languages, due to the fact that it is spoken as a first or second language by at least 80% of the population of Mali and widely as a second or third language in most of West Africa. More information about LDC's work in the languages of West Africa and the challenges those languages present for language resource development can be found here. *Data* This lexicon is presented using a Latin-based transcription system because the Latin alphabet is familiar to the majority of Mandekan language speakers and it is expected to facilitate the work of researchers interested in this resource. The dictionary is provided in two formats, Toolbox and XML. Toolbox is a version of the widely used SIL Shoebox program adapted to display Unicode. Toolbox can be downloaded for free from this link. The Toolbox files are provided in two fonts, Arial and Doulos SIL. The Arial files should display using the Arial font which is standard on most operating systems. Doulos SIL, available as a free download, is a robust font that should display all characters without issue. Users should launch Toolbox using the *.prj files in the Arial or Doulos_SIL folders. The lexicon is presented in Unicode Normalization Form D, canonical decomposition. This means that all glyphs are divided into as many parts as possible. See the following link for more information on Unicode normalization forms. The XML formatted lexicon was generated by Toolbox and a DTD is included. *Acknowledgement* Meghan Glenn served as an editor for the French and English parts of this Lexicon.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Bambara, English, and French.

The data is derived from OntoNotes Release 5.0 (LDC2013T19). Compound function words are a type of multiword expression (MWE). MWEs are groups of tokens that can be treated as a single semantic or syntactic unit. Doing so facilitates natural language processing tasks such as constituency and dependency parsing. Version 2.0 is available from LDC as MWE-Aware English Dependency Corpus 2.0 (LDC2017T16) *Data* MWE-Aware English Dependency Corpus was derived from the Wall Street Journal portion of OntoNotes Release 5.0. MWEs were identified in OntoNotes' phrase structure trees and each MWE was established as a single subtree. Those phrase structure subtrees were then converted to a dependency structure (the Stanford dependencies) in CoNLL format. The data is split into 1,728 phrase structure trees as *.parse files and a single 14-column tab separated dependency as a *.conll file. Both file types are encoded as UTF-8.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aKato, Akihiko10aShindo, Hiroyuki10aMatsumoto, Yuji403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T0101812nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245005500182264007300237336003800310336002600348337002600374338003200400500001500432500004500447506005100492520057100543520005101114546006901165655002001234700001501254856014901269856006801418m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        ara d  a15856378318 aLDC2017L018 aISLRN: 445-866-322-325-60 aarabeng07aaraaarbbeng2iso639-3  adc00aArabic Speech Recognition Pronunciation Dictionary  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017L01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017L011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aArabic Speech Recognition Pronunciation Dictionary was developed by the Qatar Computing Research Institute.

The briefs were created in a law school writing class at two law schools in the US Midwest during the 2011-12 academic year. Students who agreed to participate in this study uploaded their briefs to an online survey instrument and answered questions regarding their age, gender, level of education, most recent writing course and method of learning English. The study's purpose was to apply natural language processing approaches to determine any differences in the briefs' language attributable to the students' self-reported genders. *Data* The writings are the year-end memoranda of law to a court required in the two legal writing classes. All students were writing in the same genre and in many instances, on the same hypothetical legal case. The samples were imported into the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) and annotated by two human coders who identified large text segments specific to the legal genre in which the students wrote, such as text headings, citations, block quotes and footnotes. Writing samples are presented as MS Word documents and annotations and survey responses are presented in XML format. The data has been anonymized to remove names and other identifying information about the student participants.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aLarson, Brian N.403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T0301922nmm a22003373i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090041001800119041002800137042000700165245006200172264007300234336003800307336002600345337002600371338003200397500001500429500004500444506005100489520064800540520005101188546006201239655002001301700001901321700001201340700001501352856014901367856006801516m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2016    pau        u        eng d8 aLDC2016T228 aISLRN: 280-113-850-942-80 aengachibeng07aengazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aChinese-English Parallel Sentences Extracted from Patents  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2016]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2016T22  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2016T221 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aChinese-English Parallel Sentences Extracted from Patents was developed by Chilin (HK) Limited and contains 500,000 sentence pairs of Chinese-English parallel text.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 3 Arabic Broadcast News Transcripts Part 2 (LDC2017T04). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. Medianet collected Arabic programming from across the Gulf region using its internal system and LDC's portable broadcast collection platform installed in 2008. The portable platform deployed at the Medianet Tunisian collection facility collected multiple streams of regional Arabic programming from various sources. MTC collected Arabic programming using its internal collection system. *Data* The recordings in this release feature news broadcasts focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, United Arab Emirates; Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai; Al Iraqiyah, an Iraqi television station; Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al-Manar TV, a broadcast programmer located in Lebanon; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Al Sharqiya, an Iraqi television station; Dubai TV, a broadcast station in the United Arab Emirates; Kuwait TV, a national broadcast station in Kuwait; Nile TV, a broadcast programmer based in Egypt; Oman TV, a national broadcaster located in the Sultanate of Oman; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; and Syria TV, the national television station in Syria. This release contains 175 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Arabic speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic.

The transcripts were created with the LDC tool, XTrans, which supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript.

Only the audio has been modified; the original arrangement of the TIMIT corpus is still as described by the TIMIT documentation. *Data* The additive noise are white, pink, blue, red, violet and babble noise with noise levels varying in 5 dB (decibel) steps and ranges from 5 to 50 dB. The color of noise refers to the power spectrum of a noise signal. Sound waves have two characteristics: frequency, which describes how fast the waveform vibrates per second; and amplitude, the size of the waveform. Colored noises are named in an analogy to the colors of light. For instance, white noise contains all audible frequencies just as white light contains all frequencies in the visible range. Non-white colored noises have more energy concentrated at the high or low end of the sound spectrum. White, pink and blue noise are officially defined in the federal telecommunications standard. The white, pink, blue, red and violet noise types added to the TIMIT data in this release were generated artificially using MATLAB. For the babble noise, a random segment of recorded babble speech was selected and scaled relative to the power of the original TIMIT audio signal. All audio files are presented as single channel 16kHz 16-flac.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aAbdulaziz, Azhar10aKepuska, Veton403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S0403131nmm a22005413i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245006000182264007300242336003800315336003300353336002600386337002600412338003200438500001500470500004500485506005100530520127300581520005101854546008401905655002801989655002002017700001902037700001602056700002002072700001902092700002402111700001702135700001902152700002102171700002002192700003002212700001902242700001702261700001902278700001502297700001902312700002502331700001602356856014902372856006802521m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        swa d  a15856379048 aLDC2017S058 aISLRN: 874-256-867-958-70 aswabeng07aswhaswabeng2iso639-3  adc00aIARPA Babel Swahili Language Pack IARPA-babel202b-v1.0d  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017S05  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S051 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aIARPA Babel Swahili Language Pack IARPA-babel202b-v1.0d was developed by Appen for the IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) Babel program.

The BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) program developed machine translation and information retrieval for less formal genres, focusing particularly on user-generated content. LDC supported the BOLT program by collecting informal data sources -- discussion forums, text messaging and chat -- in Chinese, Egyptian Arabic and English. The collected data was translated and annotated for various tasks including word alignment, treebanking, propbanking and co-reference. *Data* The source data in this release consists of discussion forum threads harvested from the Internet by LDC using a combination of manual and automatic processes. The full source data collection is released as BOLT Chinese Discussion Forums (LDC2016T05). Word-aligned and tagged data is released as BOLT Chinese-English Word Alignment and Tagging - Discussion Forum Training (LDC2016T19). Data was manually selected for translation according to several criteria, including linguistic features and topic features. The files were then segmented into sentence units, formatted into a human-readable translation format and assigned to translation vendors. Translators followed LDC's BOLT translation guidelines. Bilingual LDC staff performed quality control procedures on the completed translations. All data are presented as UTF-8.

This material was used as training data in the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Parallel aligned treebanks are treebanks annotated with morphological and syntactic structures aligned at the sentence level and the sub-sentence level. Such data sets are useful for natural language processing and related fields, including automatic word alignment system training and evaluation, transfer-rule extraction, word sense disambiguation, translation lexicon extraction and cultural heritage and cross-linguistic studies. With respect to machine translation system development, parallel aligned treebanks may improve system performance with enhanced syntactic parsers, better rules and knowledge about language pairs and reduced word error rate. The English source data was translated into Chinese. Chinese and English treebank annotations were performed independently. The parallel texts were then word aligned. The material in this release corresponds to portions of the treebanked data in OntoNotes 3.0 (LDC2009T24) and OntoNotes 4.0 (LDC2011T03). *Data* This release consists of English source broadcast programming (CNN, NBC/MSNBC) and web data collected by LDC in 2005 and 2006.

It contains 2,255 hours of American English telephone speech and speech recorded over a microphone channel involving an interview scenario used as test data in the NIST-sponsored 2010 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). The ongoing series of SRE yearly evaluations conducted by NIST are intended to be of interest to researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker recognition. To this end the evaluations are designed to be simple, to focus on core technology issues, to be fully supported and to be accessible to those wishing to participate. The 2010 evaluation was similar to the 2008 evaluation by including in the training and test conditions for the core test not only conversational telephone speech (CTS) recorded over ordinary telephone channels, but also CTS and conversational interview speech recorded over a room microphone channel. Unlike prior evaluations, some of the conversational telephone style speech was collected in a manner to produce particularly high, or particularly low, vocal effort on the part of the speaker of interest. *Data* The speech recordings in this release were collected in 2009 and 2010 by LDC at its Human Subjects Collection facility in Philadelphia. This collection was part of the Mixer 6 project, which was designed to support the development of robust speaker recognition technology by providing carefully collected and audited speech from a large pool of speakers recorded simultaneously across numerous microphones. The telephone speech segments include two-channel excerpts of approximately 10 seconds and 5 minutes. There are also summed-channel excerpts in the range of 5 minutes. The microphone excerpts are 3-15 minutes in duration. As in prior evaluations, intervals of silence were not removed. The data included in this release is 8 bit ulaw with a sample rate of 8000. In addition to evaluation data, this package also consists of answer keys, trial and train files, development data and evaluation documentation.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aGreenberg, Craig10aMartin, Alvin10aGraff, David10aBrandschain, Linda10aWalker, Kevin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S0602778nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245001600141264007300157336003800230336003300268337002600301338003200327500001500359500004500374506005100419520148500470520005101955546004202006655002802048700002202076700001602098700002102114700002202135700002102157700002102178856014902199856006802348m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        eng d  a15856379638 aLDC2017S078 aISLRN: 134-467-387-379-1  adc00aCHiME2 Grid  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017S07  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S071 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aCHiME2 Grid was developed as part of The 2nd CHiME Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge and contains approximately 120 hours of English speech from a noisy living room environment. The CHiME Challenges focus on distant-microphone automatic speech recognition (ASR) in real-world environments. CHiME2 Grid reflects the small vocabulary track of the CHiME2 Challenge. The target utterances were taken from the Grid corpus and consist of 34 speakers reading simple 6-word sequences. LDC also released CHiME2 WSJ0 (LDC2017S10) and CHiME3 (LDC2017S24). *Data* Data is divided into training, development and test sets. All data is provided as 16 bit WAV files sampled at 16 kHz. The noisy utterances are provided both in isolated form and in embedded form. The latter either involve five seconds of background noise before and after the utterance (in the training set) or they are mixed in continuous five minute noise background recordings (in the development and test sets). Seven hours of noise background not part of the training set are also included. The data is accompanied by one annotation file per speaker that includes additional technical information. Also included is a baseline Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based speech recogniser and a scoring tool designed for the 2nd CHiME Challenge to allow users to obtain keyword recognition scores from formatted result files, perform recognition and score the challenge data, and estimate parameters of speaker dependent HMMs.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aVincent, Emmanuel10aBarker, Jon10aWatanabe, Shinji10aLe Roux, Jonathan10aNesta, Francesco10aMatassoni, Marco403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S0703494nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245005400182264007300236336003800309336002600347337002600373338003200399500001500431500004500446506005100491520212700542520005102669546006902720655002002789700001602809700001502825700002402840700001802864700002102882856014902903856006803052m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        ara d  a15856379718 aLDC2017T078 aISLRN: 573-046-449-233-00 aarabeng07aarzaarabeng2iso639-3  adc00aBOLT Egyptian Arabic SMS/Chat and Transliteration  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017T07  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T071 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aBOLT Egyptian Arabic SMS/Chat and Transliteration was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and consists of naturally-occurring Short Message Service (SMS) and Chat (CHT) data collected through data donations and live collection involving native speakers of Egyptian Arabic. The corpus contains 5,691 conversations totaling 1,029,248 words across 262,026 messages. Messages were natively written in either Arabic orthography or romanized Arabizi. A total of 1,856 Arabizi conversations (287,022 words) were transliterated from the original romanized Arabizi script into standard Arabic orthography. The BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) program developed machine translation and information retrieval for less formal genres, focusing particularly on user-generated content. LDC supported the BOLT program by collecting informal data sources -- discussion forums, text messaging and chat -- in Chinese, Egyptian Arabic and English. The collected data was translated and annotated for various tasks including word alignment, treebanking, propbanking and co-reference. *Data* The data in this release was collected using two methods: new collection via LDC's collection platform, and donation of SMS or chat archives from BOLT collection participants. All data collected were reviewed manually to exclude any messages/conversations that were not in the target language or that had sensitive content, such as personal identifying information (PII). A portion of the source conversations containing Arabizi tokens were automatically transliterated into Arabic script. Once the Arabizi source was transliterated into Arabic script automatically, LDC annotators reviewed, corrected and normalized the transliteration according to "Conventional Orthography for Dialectal Arabic" (CODA). All data is presented in XML. *Acknowledgement* This material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. HR0011-11-C-0145.

GWAPs for creating language resources are growing. In general, they employ non-monetary incentives, such as entertainment, to motivate participation and can be successful for large-scale persistent annotation efforts. *Data* The documents in the corpus are taken from Wikipedia articles and from narrative text in Project Gutenberg. Wikipedia articles and annotation files are presented as XML and Project Gutenberg source files are presented as plain text. All text is encoded as UTF-8. Annotations are comprised of a gold standard version created by multiple experts, as well as a set created by a large non-expert crowd (via the Phase Detectives game). The data was annotated according to a prevalent linguistically-oriented approach for anaphora used in several tasks, including OntoNotes Release 5.0 (LDC2013T19), SemEval-2010 Task 1 Ontonotes English: Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages (LDC2011T01) and The ARRAU Corpus of Anaphoric Information (LDC2013T22).  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aChamberlain, Jon10aPoesio, Massimo10aKruschwitz, Udo403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T0802504nmm a22003493i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041002800152042000700180245002700187264007300214336003800287336002600325337002600351338003200377500001500409500004500424506005100469520122600520520005101746546006201797655002001859700001901879700002101898700001801919856014901937856006802086m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        eng d  a15856380058 aLDC2017T098 aISLRN: 173-931-115-382-50 aengaspabeng07aengaspabeng2iso639-3  adc00aThe EventStatus Corpus  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017T09  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T091 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aThe EventStatus Corpus was developed by researchers at Texas A&M University, Stanford University and The University of Utah. It consists of approximately 3,000 English and 1,500 Spanish news articles about civil unrest events annotated with temporal tags. This corpus was designed to support the study of the temporal and aspectual properties of major events, that is, whether an event has already happened, is currently happening or may happen in the future. Since it focuses on a single domain (civil unrest events), it may be appropriate for tasks such as event extraction and temporal question answering. *Data* The relevant news articles were sourced from English Gigaword Fifth Edition (LDC2017T09) and Spanish Gigaword Third Edition (LDC2011T12). The civil unrest events include protests, demonstrations, marches and strikes. The data was annotated as PAST, ON-GOING or FUTURE and within each of those categories, as PLANNED, ALERT or POSSIBLE. In addition to the annotated articles, file lists used in experiments for tuning and test are included. 10-fold cross-validations were performed, and the specific 10-fold splits of the test are included as well.

The data were collected primarily to support research and technology evaluation in automatic language identification, and portions of these telephone calls were used in the NIST 2011 Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE). LRE 2011 focused on language pair discrimination for 24 languages/dialects, some of which could be considered mutually intelligible or closely related. LDC has released the following as part of the Multi-Language Conversational Telephone Speech 2011 series: * Slavic Group (LDC2016S11) * South Asian (LDC2017S14) * Central Asian (LDC2018S03) *Data* Participants were recruited by native speakers who contacted acquaintances in their social network. Those native speakers made one call, up to 15 minutes, to each acquaintance. The data was collected using LDC's telephone collection infrastructure, comprised of three computer telephony systems. Human auditors labeled calls for callee gender, dialect type and noise. Demographic information about the participants was not collected. All audio data are presented in FLAC-compressed MS-WAV (RIFF) file format (*.flac); when uncompressed, each file is 2 channels, recorded at 8000 samples/second with samples stored as 16-bit signed integers, representing a lossless conversion from the original mu-law sample data as captured digitally from the public telephone network.

In the field of speech production theory, data such as contained in this release may be used to study the relationship between vocal folds vibration and resulting voice quality. *Data* None of the subjects had a history of a voice disorder. There was no native language requirement for recruiting subjects; participants were native speakers of various languages, including English, Mandarin Chinese, Taiwanese Mandarin, Cantonese and German. Audio data is presented as 16kHz 16-bit flac and video is in avi format at 5 fps (frames per second).  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in English and Chinese.

The CHiME Challenges focus on distant-microphone automatic speech recognition (ASR) in real-world environments. CHiME2 WSJ0 reflects the medium vocabulary track of the CHiME2 Challenge. The target utterances were taken from CSR-I (WSJ0) Complete (LDC93S6A), specifically, the 5,000 word subset of read speech from Wall Street Journal news text. LDC also released CHiME2 Grid (LDC2017S07) and CHiME3 (LDC2017S24). *Data* Data is divided into training, development and test sets. All data is provided as 16 bit WAV files sampled at 16 kHz. The noisy utterances are in isolated form and in embedded form. The latter involves five seconds of background noise before and after the utterance. Seven hours of noise background not part of the training set are also included. Also included are baseline scoring, decoding and retraining tools based on Cambridge University' s tool, HTK (the Hidden Markov Toolkit) and related recipes. These tools include three baseline speaker-independent recognition systems trained on clean, reverberated and noisy data, respectively, and a number of scripts.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft10aVincent, Emmanuel10aBarker, Jon10aWatanabe, Shinji10aLe Roux, Jonathan10aNesta, Francesco10aMatassoni, Marco403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S1003775nmm a22004213i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245006500141264007300206336003800279336002600317337002600343338003200369500001500401500004500416506005100461520229600512520005102808546004202859655002002901700001802921700002002939700002102959700001902980700002202999700001903021700001903040700001803059700001903077700001803096700002203114856014903136856006803285m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        eng d  a15856380218 aLDC2017T108 aISLRN: 335-339-972-504-9  adc00aAbstract Meaning Representation (AMR) Annotation Release 2.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017T10  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T101 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aAbstract Meaning Representation (AMR) Annotation Release 2.0 was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), SDL/Language Weaver, Inc., the University of Colorado's Computational Language and Educational Research group and the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California. It contains a sembank (semantic treebank) of over 39,260 English natural language sentences from broadcast conversations, newswire, weblogs and web discussion forums. AMR captures “who is doing what to whom” in a sentence. Each sentence is paired with a graph that represents its whole-sentence meaning in a tree-structure. AMR utilizes PropBank frames, non-core semantic roles, within-sentence coreference, named entity annotation, modality, negation, questions, quantities, and so on to represent the semantic structure of a sentence largely independent of its syntax. LDC also released Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) Annotation Release 1.0 (LDC2014T12). *Data* The source data includes discussion forums collected for the DARPA BOLT and DEFT programs, transcripts and English translations of Mandarin Chinese broadcast news programming from China Central TV, Wall Street Journal text, translated Xinhua news texts, various newswire data from NIST OpenMT evaluations and weblog data used in the DARPA GALE program. The following table summarizes the number of training, dev, and test AMRs for each dataset in the release.

This release consists of approximately 2.5 hours of semantically annotated English dialogue data that includes speech and transcripts. The goal of the Metalogue project was to develop a dialogue system with flexible dialogue management to enable the system's behavior in setting goals, choosing strategies and monitoring various processes. Participants were involved in a multi-issue bargaining scenario in which a representative of a city council and a representative of small business owners negotiated the implementation of new anti-smoking regulations. The negotiation involved four issues, each with four or five options. Participants received a preference profile for each scenario and negotiated for an agreement with the highest value based on their preference information. Negotiators were not allowed to accept an agreement with a negative value or to share their preference profiles with other participants. *Data* Six unique subjects (undergraduates between 19 and 25 years of age) participated in the collection. The dialogue speech was captured with two headset microphones and saved in 16kHz, 16-bit mono linear PCM FLAC format. Speech signal files are of two types: full dialogue session; and segmented speech signal, cut per speaker and roughly per turn. Transcripts were produced semi-automatically, using an automatic speech recognizer followed by manual correction. Seven types of annotation were performed manually using the Anvil tool: dialogue act annotations; discourse structure acts; contact management acts; task management dialogue acts; negotiation moves; rhetorical relations; and disfluencies in speech production. More information about the annotation process is included in the documentation. All text is presented in UTF-8 as either plain text or XML.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aPetukhova, Volha10aMalchanau, Andrei10aOualil, Youssef10aKlakow, Dietrich10aStevens, Christopher10ade Weerd, Harmen10aTaatgen, Niels403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S1102139nmm a22003733i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245001600182264007300198336003800271336003300309336002600342337002600368338003200394500001500426500004500441506005100486520077000537520005101307546006901358655002801427655002001455700002201475700002701497700002401524856014901548856006801697m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        ara d  a15856380488 aLDC2017S128 aISLRN: 012-801-947-534-70 aarabeng07aarbaarabeng2iso639-3  adc00aKSUEmotions  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017S12  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S121 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aKSUEmotions was developed by King Saud University (KSU) and contains approximately five hours of emotional Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) speech from 23 subjects.

The DARPA BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) program developed machine translation and information retrieval for less formal genres, focusing particularly on user-generated content. LDC supported the BOLT program by collecting informal data sources -- discussion forums, text messaging and chat -- in Chinese, Egyptian Arabic and English. The collected data was translated and annotated for various tasks including word alignment, treebanking, propbanking and co-reference. The material in this release represents the unannotated English source data in the discussion forum genre. *Data* Collection was seeded based on the results of manual data scouting by native speaker annotators. Scouts were instructed to seek content in English that was original, interactive and informal. Upon locating an appropriate thread, scouts submitted the URL and some simple judgments about it to a database, via a web browser plug-in. When multiple threads from a forum were submitted, the entire forum was automatically harvested and added to the collection. The scale of the collection precluded manual review of all data. Only a small portion of the threads included in this release were manually reviewed, and it is expected that there may be some offensive or otherwise undesired content as well as some threads that contain a large amount of non-English content. Language identification was performed on all threads in this corpus (using CLD2), and threads for which the results indicate a high probability of largely non-English content are listed in eng_suspect_LID.txt in the docs directory of this package. The corpus is comprised of zipped HTML and XML files. The HTML files are a raw HTML file downloaded from the discussion thread.

The data were collected primarily to support research and technology evaluation in automatic language identification, and portions of these telephone calls were used in the NIST 2011 Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE). LRE 2011 focused on language pair discrimination for 24 languages/dialects, some of which could be considered mutually intelligible or closely related. LDC has also released the following as part of the Multi-Language Conversational Telephone Speech 2011 series: * Slavic Group (LDC2016S11) * Turkish (LDC2017S09) * Central Asian (LDC2018S03) *Data* Participants were recruited by native speakers who contacted acquaintances in their social network. Those native speakers made one call, up to 15 minutes, to each acquaintance. The data was collected using LDC's telephone collection infrastructure, comprised of three computer telephony systems. Human auditors labeled calls for callee gender, dialect type and noise. Demographic information about the participants was not collected. All audio data are presented in FLAC-compressed MS-WAV (RIFF) file format (*.flac); when uncompressed, each file is 2 channels, recorded at 8000 samples/second with samples stored as 16-bit signed integers, representing a lossless conversion from the original mu-law sample data as captured digitally from the public telephone network.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 4 Arabic Broadcast Conversation Transcripts (LDC2017T12). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. Medianet collected Arabic programming from across the Gulf region using its internal system and LDC's portable broadcast collection platform installed in 2008. The portable platform deployed at the Medianet Tunisian collection facility collected multiple streams of regional Arabic programming from various sources. MTC collected Arabic programming using its internal collection system. *Data* The broadcast conversation recordings in this release feature interviews, call-in programs and roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Al Alam News Channel, based in Iran; Al Fayhaa, an Iraqi television channel; Al Hiwar, a regional broadcast station based in the United Kingdom; Alnurra, a U.S. government-funded regional broadcaster; Aljazeera, a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Dubai TV, a broadcast station in the United Arab Emirates; Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a Lebanese television station; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; Syria TV, the national television station in Syria; and Tunisian National TV, a national television station in Tunisia. This release contains 83 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Arabic speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Arabic and Standard Arabic.

The transcripts were created with the LDC tool XTrans, which supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription. Files with QRTR in the filename indicate QRTR transcription.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Arabic and Standard Arabic.

LDC distributes a wide and growing assortment of resources for researchers, engineers and educators whose work is concerned with human languages. Historically, most linguistic resources were not generally available to interested researchers but were restricted to single laboratories or to a limited number of users. Inspired by the success of selected readily-available and well-known data sets, such as the Brown University text corpus, LDC was founded in 1992 to provide a new mechanism for large-scale corpus development and resource sharing. With the support of its members, LDC provides critical services to the language research community that include: maintaining the LDC data archives, producing and distributing data via media or web download, negotiating intellectual property agreements with potential information providers and maintaining relations with other like-minded groups around the world. Resources available from LDC include speech, text, video data and lexicons in multiple languages, as well as software tools to facilitate the use of corpus materials. For a complete view of LDC's publications, browse the Catalog. The sampler is available as a free download. *Data* The LDC Spoken Language Sampler - Fourth Release provides speech and transcript samples and is designed to illustrate the variety and breadth of the speech-related resources available from the LDC Catalog. The sound files included in this release are excerpts that have been modified in various ways relative to the original data as published by LDC: * Most excerpts are truncated to be much shorter than the original files, typically between 1.5 and 2 minutes. * Signal amplitude has been adjusted where necessary to normalize playback volume. * Some corpora are published in compressed form, but all samples here are uncompressed. * Some text files are presented as images to ensure foreign character sets display properly. * In some publications, NIST SPHERE file format is used for audio data, but the audio files in this sampler are MS-WAV/audio (RIFF) file format for compatibility with typical browser audio utilities. FLAC files have been expanded into their wav form as well. The link for the catalog number takes you to the catalog entry, and the link for the title takes you to further documentation for that corpus. LDC2017S06 2010 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Test Set 2010 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Test Set was developed by LDC and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). It contains 2,255 hours of American English telephone speech and interview speech recorded over a microphone channel used as test data in the NIST-sponsored 2010 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). LDC2015S10 Arabic Learner Corpus Arabic Learner Corpus was developed at the University of Leeds and consists of written essays and spoken recordings by Arabic learners collected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and 2013. The corpus includes 282,732 words in 1,585 materials, produced by 942 students from 67 nationalities studying at pre-university and university levels. The average length of an essay is 178 words. LDC2015S12 Articulation Index LSCP Articulation Index LSCP was developed by researchers at Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique (LSCP), Ecole Normale Supérieure. It revises and enhances a subset of Articulation Index (AIC) (LDC2005S22), a corpus of persons speaking English syllables. Changes include the addition of forced alignment to sound files, time alignment of syllable utterances and format conversions. LDC2014S01 CALLFRIEND Farsi Second Edition Speech CALLFRIEND Farsi Second Edition Speech was developed by LDC and consists of approximately 42 hours of telephone conversation (100 recordings) among native Farsi speakers. The CALLFRIEND project supported the development of language identification technology. Each CALLFRIEND corpus consists of unscripted telephone conversations lasting between 5-30 minutes. LDC2016S04 CHM150 CHM150 (Corpus Hecho en México 150) was developed by the Speech Processing Laboratory of the Faculty of Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and consists of approximately 1.63 hours of Mexican Spanish speech, associated transcripts, and speaker metadata. The goal of this work was to support spoken term detection and forensic speaker identification. LDC2007S18 CSLU: Kids` Speech Version 1.1 CSLU: Kids' Speech Version 1.1 is a collection of spontaneous and prompted speech from 1100 children between Kindergarten and Grade 10 in the Forest Grove School District in Oregon. Approximately 100 children at each grade level read around 60 items from a total list of 319 phonetically-balanced but simple words, sentences or digit strings. Each utterance of spontaneous speech begins with a recitation of the alphabet and contains a monologue of about one minute in length. This release consists of 1017 files containing approximately 8-10 minutes of speech per speaker. Corresponding word-level transcriptions are also included. LDC2016S12 IARPA Babel Georgian Language Pack IARPA-babel404b-v1.0a IARPA Babel Georgian Language Pack IARPA-babel404b-v1.0a was developed by Appen for the IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) Babel program.

It contains approximately 16 hours of speech with corresponding transcripts from interviews of Flint residents conducted between 2012 and 2015. The corpus was designed to provide high-quality recordings for acoustic analysis and to examine narrative structure and discursive construction of individual and collective identity in urban spaces. *Data* This release is comprised of 21 interviews by undergraduate and graduate students for civic engagement projects in linguistics courses and by a graduate student research assistant. Participants (11 female, 10 male) were born between 1935 and 1991 and represented a range of ages, genders, and ethnicities. Of the interviewees, 11 were Black/African American, 8 were White/Caucasian, and 2 were biracial/mixed ethnic heritage. Interviews took place in various locations in Flint, including university and community spaces and a church meeting room. Questions focused on recollections of important community events, remembrances about the community, the interviewee's relationship to the auto industry and the city's physical transformation, among other topics. Sessions were recorded using Marantz PMD661 portable SD recorders with accompanying Audio-Technica AT831B lavalier condenser microphones. The original recordings were uncompressed (PCM-16) sound files stored in WAV format recorded at a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz. These files were then converted to FLAC format. Transcripts are plain text and UTF-8. Metadata (where provided by participants) includes information on gender, ethnicity, year of birth, level of education, field of employment, average income, length of time living in Flint and its surrounding areas, as well as interviewer age, gender, and ethnicity. In addition, original interview durations, edited interview durations, interview year, and transcript word counts are also provided in the metadata file.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aBritt, Erica403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S1703031nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041003300152042000700185245003200192264007300224336003800297336002600335337002600361338003200387500001500419500004500434506005100479520156100530520005102091546008102142655002002223700001702243700002402260700002002284700002702304700001902331700001602350700001902366700001902385856014902404856006802553m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        eng d  a15856381298 aLDC2017T138 aISLRN: 228-559-981-287-10 aengachibeng07aengazhoacmnbeng2iso639-3  adc00a2015-2016 CoNLL Shared Task  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017T13  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T131 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  a2015-2016 CoNLL Shared Task, LDC Catalog Number LDC2017T13 and ISBN 1-58563-812-9, contains the Chinese and English training, development and test data for the 2015 and 2016 CoNLL (Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning) Shared Task Evaluation which focused on shallow discourse parsing. The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) is accompanied every year by a shared task intended to promote natural language processing applications and evaluate them in a standard setting. Shallow discourse parsing is the task of parsing a piece of text into a set of discourse relations between two adjacent or non-adjacent discourse units. This task is called shallow discourse parsing because the relations in a text are not connected to one another to form a connected structure in the form of a tree or graph. LDC has also released the following CoNLL Shared Task data sets: * 2006 CoNLL Shared Task - Ten Languages (LDC2015T11) * 2006 CoNLL Shared Task - Arabic & Czech (LDC2015T12) * 2008 CoNLL Shared Task Data (LDC2009T12) * 2009 CoNLL Shared Task Part 1 (LDC2012T03) * 2009 CoNLL Shared Task Part 2 (LDC2012T04) *Data* This release consists of the tokenized, tagged, and parsed tags in English and Chinese.

Participants were asked to speak at three different levels of effort (low, normal and high) in four different styles (interview, conversation, reading and oration) to study the question of how intrinsic variations -- associated with the speaker rather than the recording environment -- affect text-independent speaker verification. *Data* Participants were native speakers of North American English who were members of local Toastmasters clubs and had experience in public speaking. This release includes demographic information for 30 speakers (15 male, 15 female), including gender, birth year, height, education level, years in Toastmasters, and a self-evaluation of speaking skills. Not all effort levels were applicable for each speaking style and so were not collected. Interviews and phone conversations were not recorded at high effort and oration was not recorded at low or normal effort levels.

It consists of approximately 2,000 texts written over four months by 173 German school children age six through eleven years. The data in this corpus was collected by elementary schools in Baden Württemberg, Germany and digitized at the Cooperative State University during the 2016/2017 school year. Three second, third, and fourth grade classrooms participated in the collection. Texts were written within regular class settings. The students were presented with a picture and were asked to write a story, to describe the picture or if unable to write a text, to list what they saw in the picture. The pictures were designed to enhance the output with respect to important spelling error categories, namely, the marking of short vowels with a silent consonant letter and the correct spelling of the long vowel <ie>. The children were allowed at least 15 minutes to write the texts. This exercise was repeated weekly for nine or sixteen weeks depending on the program. LDC has also released H1 Children's Writing (LDC2016T01). *Data* There were 173 total participants. 100 students were multilingual, and further metadata is available for 166 of the 173 children. The following is included for each text in the database: school week of collection; school type; age; gender; grade/classroom; language spoken at home; and school materials used. In all, 2,117 texts representing 118,621 tokens were collected. The texts were digitized in two forms: (1) the original text, including all errors (achieved), and (2) the intended (target) text, where all spelling errors were removed. Annotations were added to both the achieved text and the target text to distinguish words that should not be analyzed for spelling errors, such as names or foreign words. For sentence-level analysis, syntax errors were annotated by marking substitutions, deletions and insertions at the word level.

The corpus was created to provide training, development and initial test sets for the keyword spotting (KWS) task in the DARPA RATS (Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech) program. The goal of the RATS program was to develop human language technology systems capable of performing speech detection, language identification, speaker identification and keyword spotting on the severely degraded audio signals that are typical of various radio communication channels, especially those employing various types of handheld portable transceiver systems. To support that goal, LDC assembled a system for the transmission, reception and digital capture of audio data that allowed a single source audio signal to be distributed and recorded over eight distinct transceiver configurations simultaneously. Those configurations included three frequencies -- high, very high and ultra high -- variously combined with amplitude modulation, frequency hopping spread spectrum, narrow-band frequency modulation, single-side-band or wide-band frequency modulation. Annotations on the clear source audio signal, e.g., time boundaries for the duration of speech activity, were projected onto the corresponding eight channels recorded from the radio receivers. *Data* The source audio consists of conversational telephone speech recordings collected by LDC: (1) data collected for the RATS program from Levantine Arabic and Farsi speakers; and (2) material from Levantine Arabic QT Training Data Set 5, Speech (LDC2006S29) and CALLFRIEND Farsi Second Edition Speech (LDC2014S01). Annotation was performed in two steps. Transcripts of calls were either produced or already available from the source corpora. For the CALLFRIEND Farsi calls, transcripts were updated by native Farsi speakers. Potential target keywords were selected from the transcripts on the basis of overall word frequencies to fall within a given range of target-word likelihood per hour of speech. The selected words were then reviewed by native speakers to confirm that each selection was a regular word or multi-word expression of more than three syllables. All audio files are presented as single-channel, 16-bit PCM, 16000 samples per second; lossless FLAC compression is used on all files; when uncompressed, the files have typical "MS-WAV" (RIFF) file headers. The data is divided for use as training, initial development set, and initial evaluation set (note that the initial evaluation only used Levantine Arabic data).  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in South Levantine Arabic, North Levantine Arabic, and Persian.

The goal of Propbank (or proposition bank) annotation is to develop annotations with information about basic semantic propositions. English Web Treebank Propbank provides semantic role annotation and predicate sense disambiguation for roughly 50,000 predicates, corresponding to all verbs, all adjectives in equational clauses and all nouns considered to be predicative. Mark-up is in the "unified" propbank annotation format, which combines representations in nouns, verbs and adjectives. *Data* The source data consists of weblogs, newsgroups, email, reviews and questions-answers. Human annotators followed the guidelines included with this release. Annotated propositions were automatically validated to ensure that (1) pointers to the tree nodes were valid, (2) Propbank labels were valid, and (3) Propbank annotation was consistent with the associated frameset. Additionally, XML frame files were validated against the included dtd and were checked for frame internal consistency (e.g. misspelling, extraneous characters, general correctness). Data is presented in UTF-8 XML files.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aO'Gorman, Tim10aConger, Katherine10aPalmer, Martha403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T1502521nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105042000700134245004400141264007300185336003800258336002600296337002600322338003200348500001500380500004500395506005100440520131500491520005101806546004201857655002001899700001801919700002101937700002001958856014901978856006802127m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        eng d  a15856381968 aLDC2017T168 aISLRN: 386-404-178-211-6  adc00aMWE-Aware English Dependency Corpus 2.0  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017T16  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T161 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aMWE-Aware English Dependency Corpus Version 2.0 was developed by the Nara Institute of Science and Technology Computational Linguistics Laboratory and consists of English compound function words annotated in dependency format. The data is derived from OntoNotes Release 5.0 (LDC2013T19). Compound functions words are a type of multiword expression (MWE). MWEs are groups of tokens that can be treated as a single semantic or syntactic unit. Doing so facilitates natural language processing tasks such as constituency and dependency parsing. Version 2.0 adds annotations of named entities (persons, locations, organizations) into dependency trees that are aware of compound function words. Version 1.0 is available from LDC as MWE-Aware English Dependency Corpus (LDC2017T01). *Data* MWE-Aware English Dependency Corpus Version 2.0 was derived from the Wall Street Journal portion of OntoNotes Release 5.0. MWEs were identified in OntoNotes' phrase structure trees and each MWE was established as a single subtree. Those phrase structure subtrees were then converted to a dependency structure (the Stanford dependencies) in CoNLL format. The data is split into 1,728 phrase structure trees as *.parse files and a single 14-column tab separated dependency as a *.conll file. Both file types are encoded as UTF-8.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aKato, Akihiko10aShindo, Hiroyuki10aMatsumoto, Yuji403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T1602507nmm a22003253i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034024001500075024002900090042000700119245004900126264007300175336003800248336003300286336002600319337002600345338003200371500001500403500004500418506005100463520124100514520005101755546004201806655002801848655002001876700003101896700003701927856014901964856006802113m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        eng d8 aLDC2017S218 aISLRN: 025-809-032-700-5  adc00aASpIRE Development and Development Test Sets  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017S21  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S211 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aASpIRE Development and Development Test Sets was developed for the Automatic Speech recognition In Reverberant Environments (ASpIRE) Challenge sponsored by IARPA (the Intelligent Advanced Research Projects Activity).

It includes queries and gold standard entity type information, Knowledge Base links, and equivalence class clusters for NIL entities along with the source documents for the queries, specifically, English and Chinese newswire, discussion forum and web data. The corresponding knowledge base is available as TAC KBP Reference Knowledge Base (LDC2014T16). Text Analysis Conference (TAC) is a series of workshops organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). TAC was developed to encourage research in natural language processing and related applications by providing a large test collection, common evaluation procedures, and a forum for researchers to share their results. Through its various evaluations, the Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track of TAC encourages the development of systems that can match entities mentioned in natural texts with those appearing in a knowledge base and extract novel information about entities from a document collection and add it to a new or existing knowledge base. Chinese Cross-lingual Entity Linking was first conducted as part of the 2011 TAC KBP evaluations. The track was an extension of the monolingual English Entity Linking track (EL) whose goal is to measure systems' ability to determine whether an entity, specified by a query, has a matching node in a reference knowledge base (KB) and, if so, to create a link between the two. If there is no matching node for a query entity in the KB, EL systems are required to cluster the mention together with others referencing the same entity. More information about the TAC KBP Entity Linking task and other TAC KBP evaluations can be found on the NIST TAC website. *Data* All source documents were originally released as XML but have been converted to text files for this release.

The goal of this work was to create acoustic models for automatic speech recognition. For more information and documentation see the CIEMPIESS-UNAM Project website. CIEMPIESS Light is an updated version of CIEMPIESS, released by LDC as LDC2015S07. This "light" version contains speech and transcripts presented in a revised directory structure that allows for use with the Kaldi toolkit. *Data* The speech recordings were collected from Podcast UNAM, a program created by Radio-IUS, and Mirador Universitario, a TV program broadcast by UNAM. They are comprised of spontaneous conversations in Mexican Spanish between a moderator and guests. Approximately 75% of the speakers were male, and 25% of the speakers were female. The audio was recorded in MP3 stereo format, using a 44.1 kHz sample rate and bit-rate of 128 kbps or higher. Only "clean" utterances were selected from the raw data, meaning that the utterances were made by only one person with no background noises, whispers, music, foreign accents, white noise or static. The audio files were converted to 16 kHz, 16-bit PCM flac format for this release. Transcripts are presented as UTF-8 encoded plain text. *Acknowledgements* The authors would like to thank Alejandro V.

The CHiME Challenges focus on distant-microphone automatic speech recognition (ASR) in real-world environments. See the CHIME3 home page for more information. The task in CHiME3 was similar to the medium vocabulary track of the CHiME2 Challenge in that the target utterances were taken from CSR-I (WSJ0) Complete (LDC93S6A), specifically, the 5,000 word subset of read speech from Wall Street Journal news text. CHiME3 involved two types of data: speech data recorded in very noisy environments (on a bus, in a cafe, pedestrian area, and street junction) and noisy utterances generated by artificially mixing clean speech data with noisy backgrounds. LDC has also released two CHiME2 corpora -- CHiME2 Grid (LDC2017S07) and CHiME2 WSJ0 (LDC2017S10). *Data* Data is divided into training, development and test sets. All data is provided as 16 bit WAV files sampled at 16 kHz. The audio data consists of the background noises, enhanced speech data using the baseline speech enhancement technique, unsegmented noisy speech data, and segmented noisy speech data. Annotation files are based on JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. Transcripts are plain text in either DOT or TRN format. Also included are three software tools for acoustic simulation, speech enhancement, and ASR.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aBarker, Jon10aMarxer, Ricard10aVincent, Emmanuel10aWatanabe, Shinji403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017S2403381nmm a22003613i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002800147042000700175245005200182264007300234336003800307336002600345337002600371338003200397500001500429500004500444506005100489520204100540520005102581546007102632655002002703700001802723700001802741700002402759700001902783856014902802856006802951m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2017    pau        u        chi d  a15856382428 aLDC2017T188 aISLRN: 752-222-758-626-20 achibeng07acmnazhobeng2iso639-3  adc00aGALE Phase 4 Chinese Broadcast News Transcripts  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2017]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2017T18  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T181 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aGALE Phase 4 Chinese Broadcast News Transcripts was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and contains transcriptions of approximately 134 hours of Chinese broadcast news speech collected in 2008 by LDC and Hong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, during Phase 4 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Program. Corresponding audio data is released as GALE Phase 4 Chinese Broadcast News Speech (LDC2017S25). The broadcast news recordings feature news broadcasts focusing principally on current events from the following sources: China Central TV (CCTV), a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station; and Voice of America (VOA), a U.S. government-funded broadcast programmer. *Data* The transcript files are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (TDF) with UTF-8 encoding, and the transcribed data totals 1,696,879 tokens. The transcripts were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool, XTrans, a multi-platform, multilingual, multi-channel transcription tool that supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript. Files with QTR as part of the filename were developed using QTR transcription.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 4 Chinese Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2017T18). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: HKUST (Chinese), Medianet (Tunis, Tunisia) (Arabic), and MTC (Rabat, Morocco) (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. HKUST collected Chinese broadcast programming using its internal recording system and a portable broadcast collection platform designed by LDC and installed at HKUST in 2006. *Data* The broadcast news recordings in this release feature news broadcasts focusing principally on current events from the following sources: China Central TV (CCTV), a national and international broadcaster in Mainland China; Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station; and Voice of America (VOA), a U.S. government-funded broadcast programmer. This release contains 256 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Chinese speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese and Chinese.

The languages covered in this release are: Basque, Catalan, Czech and Turkish. LDC also released the following 2006 & 2007 CoNLL Shared Task corpora: * 2007 CoNLL Shared Task - Greek, Hungarian & Italian (LDC2018T07) * 2007 CoNLL Shared Task - Arabic & English (LDC2018T08) * 2006 CoNLL Shared Task - Ten Languages (LDC2015T11) * 2006 CoNLL Shared Task - 2006 CoNLL Shared Task - Arabic & Czech (LDC2015T12) This corpus is cross listed and jointly released with ELRA as ELRA-W0121. The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) is accompanied every year by a shared task intended to promote natural language processing applications and evaluate them in a standard setting. In 2006 and 2007, the shared tasks were devoted to the parsing of syntactic dependencies using corpora from up to thirteen languages. The task aimed to define and extend the then-current state of the art in dependency parsing, a technology that complemented previous tasks by producing a different kind of syntactic description of input text. The 2007 shared task added a domain adaptation track for English in addition to the multilingual track. More information about the 2007 shared task is available at the CoNLL Previous Tasks web site. LDC has released data sets from other CoNLL shared tasks. 2008 CoNLL Shared Task Data (LDC2009T12) contains the English material used in the 2008 shared task which focused on English, employed a unified dependency-based formalism and merged the tasks of syntactic dependency parsing, identifying semantic arguments and labeling them with semantic roles. 2009 CoNLL Shared Task Data Parts 1 and 2 (LDC2012T03 and LDC2012T04) consists of the English, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, German and Spanish resources used in the 2009 task which included a comparison of time and space complexity based on participants' input and learning curve comparison for languages with large datasets. 2015-2016 CoNLL Shared Task (LDC2017T13) contains Chinese and English resources used in the 2015 and 2016 shared tasks on dependency parsing. *Data* The source data in the treebanks in this release consists principally of various texts (e.g., textbooks, news, literature) annotated in dependency format. In general, dependency grammar is based on the idea that the verb is the center of the clause structure and that other units in the sentence are connected to the verb as directed links or dependencies. This is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element in the sentence there is one node in the sentence structure that corresponds to that element. In constituency or phrase structure grammars, on the other hand, clauses are divided into noun phrases and verb phrases and in each sentence, one or more nodes may correspond to one element. The Penn Treebank (LDC99T42) is an example of a constituency or phrase structure approach. All of the data sets in this release are dependency treebanks.

It is comprised of approximately 85 hours of real and simulated read speech by six native American English speakers. The target utterances were taken from CSR-I (WSJ0) Complete (LDC93S6A), specifically, the 5,000 word subset of read speech from Wall Street Journal news text. This release contains signals of different characteristics in terms of noise and reverberation making it suitable for various multi-microphone signal processing and distant speech recognition tasks. The corpus can be coupled with related Kaldi baselines and tools that are available here. *Data* Speech was collected in a real apartment setting with typical domestic background noise and inter/intra-room reverberation effects. A total of 32 microphones were placed in the living-room (26 microphones) and in the kitchen (6 microphones). The original recordings were made at a sampling frequency of 48 kHz. However, for the sake of compactness, the released signals in this publication are in wav format with 16 kHz sampling frequency and 16 bit resolution. Annotations for each acoustic sequence are included in xml format, such as microphone positions, speaker id, speaker gender and speaker position. Additional metadata about the speakers and images of the apartment setting are also provided. Consult the documentation accompanying this release for more information about the collection.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aSound recordings2lcgft7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aRavanelli, Mirco10aCristoforetti, Luca10aOmologo, Maurizio403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2018S0102816nmm a22004093i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001300134041002300147042000700170245002600177264007300203336003800276336002600314337002600340338003200366500001500398500004500413506005100458520139600509520005101905546005001956655002002006700002002026700003602046700001402082700001602096700002202112700001602134700002402150700001502174856014902189856006802338m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2018    pau        u        spa d  a15856383238 aLDC2018T018 aISLRN: 752-423-916-829-40 aspabeng07aspabeng2iso639-3  adc00aDEFT Spanish Treebank  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2018]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2018T01  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2018T011 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aDEFT Spanish Treebank was developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and the Language and Computation Center (CLiC), University of Barcelona. It contains treebank annotation of international Spanish newswire text and Latin American Spanish discussion forum data created for the DARPA Deep Exploration and Filtering of Text (DEFT) program. DEFT aimed to improve state-of-the-art capabilities in automated deep natural language processing with a particular focus on technologies dealing with inference, casual relationships and anomaly detection across several languages. DEFT Spanish Treebank supported the program's goal of deep natural language understanding. *Data* Newswire source files were selected from Spanish Gigaword Third Edition (LDC2011T12) and were manually sentence-segmented for DEFT. Discussion forum source files were selected from Spanish discussion forum source data collected by LDC, consisting of continuous multi-posts of 100-1000 words. This release contains 114 files (54,394 tokens) of newswire data and 60 files (55,307 tokens) of discussion forum data all of which were annotated with constituents and syntactic functions. The annotation guidelines for DEFT Spanish Treebank are included in the documentation accompanying this release. Source documents are presented as plain text files with one sentence unit per line.

It contains approximately 200 hours of Tok Pisin conversational and scripted telephone speech collected in 2013 along with corresponding transcripts. The Babel program focuses on underserved languages and seeks to develop speech recognition technology that can be rapidly applied to any human language to support keyword search performance over large amounts of recorded speech. *Data* The Tok Pisin speech in this release represents that spoken in the Papuan dialect region of Papua New Guinea. The gender distribution among speakers is approximately equal; speakers' ages range from 16 years to 65 years. Calls were made using different telephones (e.g., mobile, landline) from a variety of environments including the street, a home or office, a public place, and inside a vehicle. Audio data is presented as 8kHz 8-bit a-law encoded audio in sphere format and 48kHz 24-bit PCM encoded audio in wav format. Transcripts are encoded in UTF-8. Further information about transcription methodology is contained in the documentation accompanying this release.

The data were collected primarily to support research and technology evaluation in automatic language identification, and portions of these telephone calls were used in the NIST 2011 Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE). LRE 2011 focused on language pair discrimination for 24 languages/dialects, some of which could be considered mutually intelligible or closely related. LDC has also released the following as part of the Multi-Language Conversational Telephone Speech 2011 series: * Slavic Group (LDC2016S11) * Turkish (LDC2017S09) * South Asian (LDC2017S14) *Data* Participants were recruited by native speakers who contacted acquaintances in their social network. Those native speakers made one call, up to 15 minutes, to each acquaintance. The data was collected using LDC's telephone collection infrastructure, comprised of three computer telephony systems. Human auditors labeled calls for callee gender, dialect type and noise. Demographic information about the participants was not collected. All audio data are presented in FLAC-compressed MS-WAV (RIFF) file format (*.flac); when uncompressed, each file is 2 channels, recorded at 8000 samples/second with samples stored as 16-bit signed integers, representing a lossless conversion from the original mu-law sample data as captured digitally from the public telephone network. The following table summarizes the total number of calls, total number of hours of recorded audio, and the total size of compressed data: group lng #calls #hours #MB c_asian fas 100 19.7 900 c_asian prs 17 3.2 175 c_asian pus 79 14.5 709 c_asian Totals 196 37.4 1784  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Dari, Persian, and Pushto.

Text Analysis Conference (TAC) is a series of workshops organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). TAC was developed to encourage research in natural language processing and related applications by providing a large test collection, common evaluation procedures, and a forum for researchers to share their results. Through its various evaluations, the Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track of TAC encourages the development of systems that can match entities mentioned in natural texts with those appearing in a knowledge base and extract novel information about entities from a document collection and add it to a new or existing knowledge base. *Data* The source data consists of newswire, broadcast material, and web text collected by LDC. Documents are released as a collection of zip files for overall compactness, and ease and efficiency of use. When unpacked the documents are all UTF-8 text files with a basic markup structure. Also provided are a series of lists and tables to aid in specific zip file to doc mappings and the recreation of specific test sets.

Another 80,000 words are also translated from English into Amharic. The LORELEI (Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents) Program is concerned with building Human Language Technology for low resource languages in the context of emergent situations like natural disasters or disease outbreaks. Linguistic resources for LORELEI include Representative Language Packs and Incident Language Packs for over two dozen low resource languages, comprising data, annotations, basic natural language processing tools, lexicons and grammatical resources. Representative languages are selected to provide broad typological coverage, while incident languages are selected to evaluate system performance on a language whose identity is disclosed at the start of the evaluation. *Data* Data was collected in the following genres: discussion forums, news, reference, social network and weblog. Both monolingual text collection and parallel text creation involved a combination of manual and automatic methods, which are detailed in the included documentation. All harvested content was initially converted from its original HTML form into a relatively uniform XML format. XML data is presented in two formats: a "homogenized" XML format that preserves the minimum set of tags needed to represent the structure of the relevant text as seen by the human web-page reader and a fully segmented and tokenized version of the text.

The DARPA BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) program developed machine translation and information retrieval for less formal genres, focusing particularly on user-generated content. LDC supported the BOLT program by collecting informal data sources -- discussion forums, text messaging and chat -- in Chinese, Egyptian Arabic and English. The collected data was translated and annotated for various tasks including word alignment, treebanking, propbanking and co-reference. The material in this release represents the unannotated Arabic source data in the discussion forum genre. *Data* Collection was seeded based on the results of manual data scouting by native speaker annotators. Scouts were instructed to seek content in Egyptian Arabic that was original, interactive and informal. Upon locating an appropriate thread, scouts submitted the URL and some simple judgments about it to a database, via a web browser plug-in. When multiple threads from a forum were submitted, the entire forum was automatically harvested and added to the collection. The scale of the collection precluded manual review of all data. Only a small portion of the threads included in this release were manually reviewed, and it is expected that there may be some offensive or otherwise undesired content as well as some threads that contain a large amount of non-Arabic content. Language identification was performed on all threads in this corpus (using CLD2), and threads for which the results indicate a high probability of largely non-Arabic content are listed in arz_suspect_LID.txt in the docs directory of this package. It should also be noted that many threads may contain a mixture of Egyptian and other varieties of Arabic, even among the threads that are primarily Arabic. The corpus is comprised of zipped HTML and XML files. The HTML files are a raw HTML file downloaded from the discussion thread. If the thread spanned multiple URLs, it was stored as a concatenation of the downloaded HTML files. The XML files were converted from the raw HTML. *Acknowledgement* This material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. HR0011-11-C-0145.

It adds multiple kinds and instances of automatically-generated syntactic, semantic and coreference annotations to The New York Times Annotated Corpus (LDC2008T19). Concrete is a schema for representing structured, hierarchical and overlapping linguistic annotations. This release provides multiple tool outputs producing the same annotation types as different annotation theories under a shared tokenization. *Data* Concretely Annotated New York Times contains all of the 1.8 million articles in The New York Times Annotated Corpus. Those articles were written and published by the New York Times between January 1, 1987 and June 19, 2007; the 2008 corpus also includes metadata provided by the New York Times Newsroom, the New York Times Indexing Service and the online production staff at nytimes.com. The following layers of annotation were added by processing the articles under the Concrete schema: * Segmented sentences and Penn Treebank-style tokenized words * Treebank-style constituent parse trees * Four different syntactic dependency trees * Named entities * Part of speech tags * Lemmas * In-document entity coreference chains * Three different frame semantic parses See analytics.pdf for the list of tools used to create those annotations. The data is stored in a binary form called Concrete, which is based on Apache Thrift. Concrete can be read and written in many common programming languages, such as Java, Python, Javascript and C++. Concrete also includes a number of utilities to access and view the data in human-readable forms. The original NITF (News Industry Text Format) document structure in The New York Times Annotated Corpus was preserved in this Concrete version.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent and documentation in English.7 aExcerpts2lcgft10aFerraro, Francis10aThomas, Max10aWolfe, Travis10aGormley, Matthew R.10aHarman, Craig10aVan Durme, Benjamin403University of Alberta Access (Request Form)uhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VsEYOWoubQww-01W7IV2qDaAr4ctBJUhrJvfyN0GwoMuFQ/viewform423Dataset documentationuhttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2018T1202560nmm a22003373i 4500006001900000007001500019008004100034020001500075024001500090024002900105041001800134041003300152042000700185245005000192264007300242336003800315336002600353337002600379338003200405500001500437500004500452506005100497520126800548520005101816546007801867655002001945700003101965700000901996856014902005856006802154m     o  u        cu ||||||u||||      s2018    pau        u        ara d  a15856384128 aLDC2018T138 aISLRN: 582-339-053-329-90 aaraafrebeng07aaraaarbafrabeng2iso639-3  adc00aTRAD Arabic-French Parallel Text -- Newsgroup  a[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]: bLinguistic Data Consortium, c[2018]  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aunspecifiedbzu2rdacarrier  aLDC2018T13  ahttps://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2018T131 aAvailable to University of Alberta users only.  aTRAD Arabic-French Parallel Text -- Newsgroup was developed by ELDA as part of the PEA-TRAD project.

The PEA-TRAD project (Translation as a Support for Document Analysis) was supported by the French Ministry of Defense (DGA). Its purpose was to develop speech-to-speech translation technology for multiple languages (e.g., Arabic, Chinese, Pashto) from a variety of domains. ELDA developed several corpora for this effort. LDC has also released TRAD Chinese-French Parallel Text -- Blog (LDC2018T02). *Data* This release consists of 398 segments (translations units) from 17 documents. The source data is Arabic newsgroup text collected and translated into English by the Linguistic Data Consortium for the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Information about the ELDA translation team, translation guidelines and validation results is contained in the documentation accompanying this release. The Arabic source file contains 10,706 words and the French reference translation contains 15,843 words.

Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 4 Arabic Broadcast News Transcripts (LDC2018T14). Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities and at three remote collection sites: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Chinese), Medianet (Arabic) and MTC (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the life of the program. LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers and recorders is dynamic and modular. All signal routing is performed under computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio Collection Version 3.0 included in this release. LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on luggage. Medianet collected Arabic programming from across the Gulf region using its internal system and LDC's portable broadcast collection platform installed in 2008. The portable platform deployed at the Medianet Tunisian collection facility collected multiple streams of regional Arabic programming from various sources. MTC collected Arabic programming using its internal collection system. *Data* The recordings in this release feature news broadcasts focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Abu Dhabi TV, a television station based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Al Arabiya, a news television station based in Dubai; Al Baghdadya , an Iraqi broadcast programmer; Alhurra, a U.S. government-funded regional broadcaster; Al Iraqiyah, an Iraqi television station; Aljazeera , a regional broadcaster located in Doha, Qatar; Al Ordiniyah, a national broadcast station in Jordan; Kuwait TV, a national broadcast station based in Kuwait; Radio Sawa, a U.S. government-funded regional broadcaster; Saudi TV, a national television station based in Saudi Arabia; Syria TV, the national television station in Syria; and Yemen TV, a television station based in Yemen. This release contains 51 audio files presented in FLAC-compressed Waveform Audio File format (.flac), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native Arabic speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s genre, data type and topic.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Standard Arabic and Arabic.

The transcripts were created with the LDC tool XTrans, which supports manual transcription and annotation of audio recordings. XTrans is available from the following link, https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/language-resources/tools/xtrans/downloads. The files in this corpus were transcribed by LDC staff and/or by transcription vendors under contract to LDC. Transcribers followed LDC's quick transcription guidelines (QTR) and quick rich transcription specification (QRTR) both of which are included in the documentation with this release. QTR transcription consists of quick (near-) verbatim, time-aligned transcripts plus speaker identification with minimal additional mark-up. It does not include sentence unit annotation. QRTR annotation adds structural information such as topic boundaries and manual sentence unit annotation to the core components of a quick transcript.

It consists of approximately 204 hours of conversational telephone speech and broadcast audio collected by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) in the following 24 languages and dialects: Arabic (Iraqi), Arabic (Levantine), Arabic (Maghrebi), Arabic (Standard), Bengali, Czech, Dari, English (American), English (Indian), Farsi, Hindi, Lao, Mandarin, Punjabi, Pashto, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Urdu. The goal of the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE) is to establish the baseline of current performance capability for language recognition of conversational telephone speech and to lay the groundwork for further research efforts in the field. NIST conducted language recognition evaluations in 1996, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009. The 2011 evaluation emphasized the language pair condition and involved both conversational telephone speech (CTS) and broadcast narrow-band speech (BNBS). Further information regarding this evaluation can be found in the evaluation plan which is also included in the documentation for this release. LDC released the prior LREs as: * 2003 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation (LDC2006S31) * 2005 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation (LDC2008S05) * 2007 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation Test Set (LDC2009S04) * 2007 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation Supplemental Training Set (LDC2009S05) * 2009 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation Test Set (LDC2014S06) *Data* This release includes training data for nine language varieties that had not been represented in prior LRE cycles -- Arabic (Iraqi), Arabic (Levantine), Arabic (Maghrebi), Arabic (Standard), Czech, Lao, Punjabi, Polish and Slovak -- contained in 893 audited segments of roughly 30 seconds duration and in 400 full-length CTS recordings. The evaluation test set comprises a total of 29,511 audio files, all manually audited at LDC for language and divided equally into three different test conditions according to the nominal amount of speech content per segment. Data was collected by LDC between 2009 and 2011. The CTS data was obtained using a "claque" collection model in which speakers (claques) called friends or relatives in their social network for a 10-minute conversation in the claque's native language, such that each call would involve a unique callee. Participants were free to speak on topics of their own choosing. All calls were routed through a telephone collection system at LDC which stored the raw mu-law sample stream into separate audio files for each call side. Auditing and selection were applied to the callee side of every call and to the caller (claque) side in at most one call made by each claque. Contiguous regions containing between 25 and 35 seconds of speech were identified by signal analysis and extracted for manual audit. In some cases, shorter segments were also selected for audit. Broadcast audio was recorded via capture of satellite-receiver MPEG streams or analog audio receivers digitizing at 16 KHz. Platforms for data capture were located at LDC and in Tunisia and India. Recordings were analyzed to extract contiguous segments of narrow-band speech of at least 33 seconds duration; longer segments were trimmed to a maximum length of 35 seconds for audit. All audited segments for training and test are presented as 8-KHz, 16-bit PCM, single-channel audio files with NIST SPHERE headers. The full-length CTS data is the same, except that it consists of two channels.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mesopotamian Arabic, South Levantine Arabic, North Levantine Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, Bengali, Czech, Dari, English, Persian, Hindi, Lao, Mandarin Chinese, Panjabi, Pushto, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, and Standard Arabic.

The corpus contains 14,877 conversations totaling 3,005,810 words across 497,543 messages. The BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) program developed machine translation and information retrieval for less formal genres, focusing particularly on user-generated content. LDC supported the BOLT program by collecting informal data sources -- discussion forums, text messaging and chat -- in Chinese, Egyptian Arabic and English. The collected data was translated and annotated for various tasks including word alignment, treebanking, propbanking and co-reference. *Data* The data in this release was collected using two methods: new collection via LDC's collection platform, and donation of SMS or chat archives from BOLT collection participants. All data collected were reviewed manually to exclude any messages/conversations that were not in the target language or that had sensitive content, such as personal identifying information (PII).

It includes queries and gold standard entity type information, Knowledge Base links, and equivalence class clusters for NIL entities. Also included are the source documents for the queries, specifically, English newswire, discussion forum and web data. The corresponding knowledge base is available as TAC KBP Reference Knowledge Base (LDC2014T16). Also included in this package are the results of an Entity Linking IAA (Inter-Annotator Agreement) study conducted in 2010. Text Analysis Conference (TAC) is a series of workshops organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). TAC was developed to encourage research in natural language processing and related applications by providing a large test collection, common evaluation procedures, and a forum for researchers to share their results. Through its various evaluations, the Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track of TAC encourages the development of systems that can match entities mentioned in natural texts with those appearing in a knowledge base and extract novel information about entities from a document collection and add it to a new or existing knowledge base. English Entity Linking was first conducted as part of the 2009 TAC KBP evaluations. Its goal is to measure systems' ability to determine whether an entity, specified by a query, has a matching node in a reference knowledge base (KB) and, if so, to create a link between the two. If there is no matching node for a query entity in the KB, EL systems are required to cluster the mention together with others referencing the same entity. More information about the TAC KBP Entity Linking task and other TAC KBP evaluations can be found on the NIST TAC website. *Data* All source documents were originally released as XML but have been converted to text files for this release.

The data were collected primarily to support research and technology evaluation in automatic language identification, and portions of these telephone calls were used in the NIST 2011 Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE). LRE 2011 focused on language pair discrimination for 24 languages/dialects, some of which could be considered mutually intelligible or closely related. LDC has also released the following as part of the Multi-Language Conversational Telephone Speech 2011 series: * Slavic Group (LDC2016S11) * Turkish (LDC2017S09) * South Asian (LDC2017S14) * Central Asian (LDC2018S03) *Data* Participants were recruited by native speakers who contacted acquaintances in their social network. Those native speakers made one call, up to 15 minutes, to each acquaintance. The data was collected using LDC's telephone collection infrastructure, comprised of three computer telephony systems. Human auditors labeled calls for callee gender, dialect type and noise. Demographic information about the participants was not collected. All audio data are presented in FLAC-compressed MS-WAV (RIFF) file format (*.flac); when uncompressed, each file is 2 channels, recorded at 8000 samples/second with samples stored as 16-bit signed integers, representing a lossless conversion from the original mu-law sample data as captured digitally from the public telephone network.

Participants could speak with a person of their choice on any topic; most called family members and friends. All calls originated in North America. The recorded conversations last up to 30 minutes. The data was recorded as 8kHz u-law SPH encoded stereo files, with one end of the phone call on each channel. In this release, files were converted to WAV format, and information from the original SPH headers is described in the documentation. SPH files are not included in this second edition. The audio files were originally split into train, dev and test folders of 20 recordings each, but they are combined in this release. Completed calls passed through two human audits. The first audit was conducted to verify that the target language was spoken by the participants and to check the quality of the recordings. The second audit was conducted by a native speaker familiar with Mainland and Taiwanese Mandarin dialects to classify the conversations under one of the two categories.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in Mandarin Chinese.

The corpus was created to provide training, development and initial test sets for the Language Identification (LID) task in the DARPA RATS (Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech) program. The goal of the RATS program was to develop human language technology systems capable of performing speech detection, language identification, speaker identification and keyword spotting on the severely degraded audio signals that are typical of various radio communication channels, especially those employing various types of handheld portable transceiver systems. To support that goal, LDC assembled a system for the transmission, reception and digital capture of audio data that allowed a single source audio signal to be distributed and recorded over eight distinct transceiver configurations simultaneously. Those configurations included three frequencies -- high, very high and ultra high -- variously combined with amplitude modulation, frequency hopping spread spectrum, narrow-band frequency modulation, single-side-band or wide-band frequency modulation. Annotations on the clear source audio signal, e.g., time boundaries for the duration of speech activity, were projected onto the corresponding eight channels recorded from the radio receivers. *Data* The source audio consists of conversational telephone speech recordings from: (1) conversational telephone speech (CTS) recordings, taken either from previous LDC CTS corpora, or from CTS data collected specifically for the RATS program from Levantine Arabic, Pashto, Urdu, Farsi and Dari native speakers; and (2) portions of VOA broadcast news recordings, taken from data used in the 2009 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation. The 2009 LRE Test Set is available from LDC as LDC2014S06. CTS recordings were audited by annotators who listened to short segments and determined whether the audio was in the target language. Annotations on the audio files include start time, end time, speech activity detection (SAD) label, SAD provenance, language ID and LID provenance. All audio files are presented as single-channel, 16-bit PCM, 16000 samples per second; lossless FLAC compression is used on all files; when uncompressed, the files have typical "MS-WAV" (RIFF) file headers. The data is divided for use as training, initial development set, and initial evaluation set.  aData samples are available on the LDC website.  aContent in South Levantine Arabic, North Levantine Arabic, Persian, Dari, Pushto, and Urdu.

It contains French translations of a subset of approximately 30,000 Chinese characters from GALE Phase 1 Chinese Broadcast News Parallel Text - Part 3 (LDC2008T18). The PEA-TRAD project (Translation as a Support for Document Analysis) was supported by the French Ministry of Defense (DGA). Its purpose was to develop speech-to-speech translation technology for multiple languages (e.g., Arabic, Chinese, Pashto) from a variety of domains. ELDA developed several corpora for this effort. *Data* This release consists of 977 segments (translation units) from 139 documents. The source data is Chinese broadcast news collected and translated into English by LDC for the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program. Information about the ELDA translation team, translation guidelines and validation results is contained in the documentation accompanying this release. The Chinese source file contains 33,571 characters and the French reference translation contains 22,424 words.

The corpus contains 18,429 conversations totaling 3,674,802 words across 375,967 messages. The BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) program developed machine translation and information retrieval for less formal genres, focusing particularly on user-generated content. LDC supported the BOLT program by collecting informal data sources -- discussion forums, text messaging and chat -- in Chinese, Egyptian Arabic and English. The collected data was translated and annotated for various tasks including word alignment, treebanking, propbanking and co-reference. *Data* The data in this release was collected using two methods: new collection via LDC's collection platform and donation of SMS or chat archives from BOLT collection participants. All data collected were reviewed manually to exclude any messages/conversations that were not in the target language or that had sensitive content, such as personal identifying information (PII). All data is presented in UTF-8 XML. *Acknowledgement* This material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. HR0011-11-C-0145.
