This data set consists of 18 text files containing transcripts prepared by the LDC for Voice of America satellite radio news broadcasts in Korean. The broadcasts were recorded by the LDC at transmission time during a two week period between January 21, 2000 and February 7, 2000. Please see file.tbl for the directory structure of this publication, as well as a complete list of files. Nine of the broadcasts are 30 minutes long, and the other nine are 60 minutes long. The file names indicate the date (YYYYMMDD), and the begin and end times (HHMM EST) of the original transmission. The character encoding is Unicode UTF-8, and the file contents are structured using SGML. The markup strategy used here was defined by NIST specifically for use in transcripts of broadcast news speech. The "docs" directory provides a working DTD file, a complete description (in the form of a PostScript file) of the document structure, tags and attributes, and a simple text file listing the 18 data file names in the corpus. The transcripts have been manually time aligned at the phrasal level and annotated to identify boundaries between news stories and speaker turns; speaker names and gender are given where identifiable. These annotations are all provided via the SGML tags and their attributes. A strong effort has been made to identify all unique speakers across the transcripts. However, there may be cases where an individual speaker has not been recognized and has been given a unique, anonymous identification. The audio files for these transcripts are available as a separate corpus from the LDC: Korean Broadcast News Speech, LDC2006S42."--index.html.  aSystem requirements: CD-ROM drive, web browser, other requirements not specified.  aKorean and English.  a48 0aKorean languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aNatural language processing (Computer science) 0aBroadcast journalismzKoreavDatabases.1 aStrassel, Stephanie.1 aMartey, Nii.1 aGraff, David Andrew,d1962-2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.2 aVoice of America (Organization)0 aKorean broadcast news speech. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006T14.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006T14  1OLAC2korean  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006T14wLCc1i3790481-1001lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu11/10/200603593cmm  2200481 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350016001290400028001450410018001730500021001910900036002122450101002482460045003492600061003943000034004553360038004893370026005274900030005535000018005835000043006015201536006445380190021805460032023705960007024026500053024096500066024626500064025286500062025926500023026546500034026777000018027117100032027297100040027618300031028018560136028329900033029689990110030013801927OCoLC20061121120300.0co nga|m||||||060627s2006    pau        m        eng d  a1585633445  a(Sirsi) i9781585633449  aocm70189493  aIWAbengcIWAdRCEdAEU1 aengbdutager  aZ667.5b.N4 2006  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006S13bAEU00aN4 NATO native and non-native speechh[electronic resource] /c[Author, John Grieco ... et al.].3 aN four NATO native and non-native speech  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c2006.  a1 DVD-ROM :bsd. ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006S13  a"LDC2006S13."  aTitle from index.html file on DVD-ROM.  a"This file contains documentation on the N4 NATO Native and Non-Native Speech Corpus, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2006S13 and isbn 1-58563-344-5. The N4 NATO Native and Non-Native Speech corpus was developed by the NATO research group on Speech and Language Technology in order to provide a military oriented database for multilingual and non-native speech processing studies. Speech data was recorded in the Naval transmission training centers of four countries(Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Canada). The material consists of native and non-native speakers speakers using NATO English procedure between ships and reading from a text, "The North Wind and the Sun" in both English and the speaker's native language. Speech technology is covering an increasing number of languages, and systems are becoming more robust with regard to speech variablity such as speaking style and accents. However, for real applications especially in a multilingual and multinational context, further robustness to regional and even non-native accents is necessary. Among numerous corpora available for speech research few have specifically addressed this issue. The NATO Speech and Language Technology group decided to create a corpus geared towards the study of non-native accents. The group chose naval communications as the common task because it naturally includes a great deal of non-native speech and because there were training facilities where data could be collected in several countries."--index.html.  aSystem requirements: DVD-ROM drive; web browser; software to open files in the Microsoft Word format; software to play files in the NIST Sphere format; other requirements not specified.  aEnglish, Dutch, and German.  a48 0aCross-language information retrievalvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishxData processingvDatabases. 0aGerman languagexSpoken GermanxData processingvDatabases. 0aDutch languagexSpoken DutchxData processingvDatabases. 0aSpeech perception. 0aAutomatic speech recognition.1 aGrieco, John.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.2 aNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006S13.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC web-site:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006S13  1OLAC2Dutch2English2German  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006S13wLCc1i0162021715733lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu11/21/200602730cmm  2200421 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140080041000310200015000720350027000870350016001140400023001300500021001530900036001742450153002102460030003632500011003932600063004043000026004673360038004933370026005314900030005575000018005875201101006055960007017066500049017136500028017627000018017907000020018087000019018287100052018477100082018997100032019818300031020138560136020449900018021809990110021983801932OCoLC20061121122511.0060614s2006    pau        u        eng d  a1585633844  a(Sirsi) i9781585633845  aocm70109805  aAZUbengcAZUdAEU  aPL139b.M53 2006  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006S33bAEU00aMiddle East Technical University Turkish microphone speechh[electronic resource] /c[authors, Ozgul Salor, Tolga Ciloglu, Bryan Pellom]...[et al.].30aTurkish microphone speech  av.1.0.  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2006.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006S33  a"LDC2006S33."  a"The corpus has been collected at the Middle East Technical University (METU) as part of a collaborative work between the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering of the Middle East Technical University in Turkey and the Center for Spoken Language Research (CSLR) of the University of Colorado at Boulder, USA.

This corpus was developed as part of`"Trawl" (Automatic Voice Identification System in Telephone Channel). The purpose of the project was to develop software for automatic identification of speakers based on voice samples acquired through telephone channels. The training of the system was performed with the telephone speech corpus RuSTeN. The RuSTeN (Russian through Switched Telephone Network) database was recorded between March 2001 and February 2003 by Speech Technology Center using the "Forget-me-not" professional telephone recording and archiving software package developed by STC. Please see file.tbl for the directory structure of this publication, as well as a complete list of files. Please go to data for a listing of data files. The files were recorded with sample frequency 11025 Hz, 1-channel, 16-bit linear. Each of the speakers made at least 5 calls from different locations and/or telephone sets. Most of the calls were made from home or office environment with uncontrolled noise level. Besides, one call per speaker was made from a public telephone (with either street or metro station noise in the background). The recordings are spontaneous (sometimes guided by the near-end speaker) conversations between the caller and the speech database collector on various subjects (the weather, the caller's biography, hobbies etc.) and include approximately 150 seconds of the far-end and at least 5 seconds of the near-end speaker. Besides, each time the caller was asked to utter the usual digits set (0-9) and the words "yes" and "no". The time interval between 2 successive sessions is at least 2 days. The database contains 125 speakers (far-end), 58 male and 67 female. Each far-end speaker is represented by at least 5 speech files. The sound files are in the wav-format. The speech filenames contain the following information: FFF (far-end speaker number), SS (session number)."--index.html.  aSystem requirements: DVD-ROM drive, web browser, software to play .wav files, other requirements not specified.  aSound files in Russian, instructional documents in English.  a48 0aRussian languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aSpeech perceptionxData processingvDatabases. 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases. 0aNatural language processing (Computer science)1 aRaev, Anrey.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006S34.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006S34  1OLAC2russian  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006S34wLCc1i0162023052150lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu11/23/200601527cmm  2200385 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350016001290400023001450500023001680900036001912450042002272460023002692500017002922600061003093000026003703360038003963370026004344900030004605000027004905000017005175200144005345960007006786500047006857100082007327100032008148300031008468560136008779900018010139990110010313803243OCoLC20061123111820.0co cg|||||||||060928s2006    pau        m        eng d  a1585633941  a(Sirsi) i9781585633944  aocm71797279  aCVUbengcCVUdAEU  aCS2309b.N353 2006  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006S39bAEU00aNamesh[electronic resource] /cCSLU.3 aNames, release 1.3  aRelease 1.3.  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c2006.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006S39  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2006S39"  aA corpus containing 24245 files of name utterances, both first and last names, from several thousand different speakers over the telephone.  a48 0aNames, PersonalxPronunciationvDatabases.2 aCenter for Spoken Language Understanding (Oregon Health & Science University)2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006S39.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC web-site:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006S39  1OLAC2english  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006S39wLCc1i0162018496099lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu11/23/200602216cmm  2200433 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350016001290400028001450500024001730900036001972450109002332600063003423000026004053360038004313370026004694900030004955000037005255000018005625000589005805380039011695960007012086300033012156500049012486500052012976500043013497000026013927000018014187000020014367100032014568300031014888560136015199900017016559990110016723803246OCoLC20061123111954.0co ngu|m||||||060424s2006    pau        u        eng d  a1585633747  a(Sirsi) i9781585633746  aocm67534855  aRCEbengcRCEdRCEdAEU  aPL908.5b.K675 2006  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006T03bAEU00aKorean propbankh[electronic resource] /c[Authors, Martha Palmer, Shijong Ryu, Jinyoung Choi...et al.].  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2006.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006T03  aTitle from index.html on CD-ROM.  a"LDC2006T03".  a"Korean Propbank Annotations is a semantic annotation of the Korean English Treebank Annotations and Korean Treebank version 2.0.

This publication contains the complete set of English, Arabic and Chinese training data for the 2005 Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) technology evaluation. The corpus consists of data of various types annotated for entities, relations and events was created by Linguistic Data Consortium with support from the ACE Program, with additional assistance from LDC. This data was previously distributed as an e-corpus (LDC2005E18) to participants in the 2005 ACE evaluation. The objective of the ACE program is to develop automatic content extraction technology to support automatic processing of human language in text form. In November 2005, sites were evaluated on system performance in five primary areas: the recognition of entities, values, temporal expressions, relations, and events. Entity, relation and event mention detection were also offered as diagnostic tasks. All tasks with the exception of event tasks were performed for three languages, English, Chinese and Arabic. Events tasks were evaluated in English and Chinese only. The current publication comprises the official training data for these evaluation tasks. A complete description of the ACE 2005 Evaluation can be found on the ACE Program website maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). For more information about linguistic resources for the ACE Program, including annotation guidelines, task definitions, free annotation tools and other documentation, please visit LDC's ACE website."--index.html  aSystem requirements: DVD-ROM player.  a48 0aContent analysis (Communication)xData processing. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aArabic languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aChinese languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.1 aWalker, Christopher.1 aStrassel, Stephanie.1 aMedero, Julie.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006T06.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC web-site:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006T06  1OLAC2arabic2chinese2english  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006T06wLCc1i0162023052184lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu11/23/200601698cmm  2200385 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350016001290400023001450500021001680900036001892450059002252460020002842600061003043000027003653360038003923370026004304900030004565000018004865200331005045960007008356500029008426500040008716500049009117100026009607100032009868300031010188560136010499900017011859990110012023803254OCoLC20061123115337.0co cg|||||||||060202s2006    pau        m        ara d  a1585633712  a(Sirsi) i9781585633715  aocm63258551  aAZUbengcAZUdAEU  aD856b.A822 2006  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006T02bAEU00aArabic gigaword second editionh[electronic resource].30aArabic gigaword  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c2006.  a1 DVD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006T02  a"LDC2006T02."  aComprehensive archive in 423 files of newswire text from the Agence France-presse, Al Hayat News Agency, Al Nahar News Agency, Xinhua News Agency and Ummah Press.

The Speaker Recognition corpus (formerly known as Speaker Verification), consists of telephone speech from 91 participants. Each participant has recorded speech in twelve sessions over a two-year period answering questions like "what is your eye color" or respond to prompts like "describe a typical day in your life." Most of the utterances in the release of the corpus have corresponding non-time-aligned word level transcriptions. In most of the CSLU data collections, each participant calls a toll free telephone number and answers a few question. CSLU records the speech, transcribes it, then packages it as a released corpus. The Speaker Recognition data collection was quite a bit more complicated. The goal of the data collection was to collect speech from each participant over a two year period. Each participant called call the data collection system twelve times over the two-year period and say the same utterances each time. Some of the recording sessions were only a few days apart and others several weeks apart. Participant followed the following calling schedule. During the first month, they called twice in a week. No calls were made in the second and third months. In the fourth month they made one call. No calls were made in the fifth and sixth months. This pattern repeated three more times for a total of twelve calls per participant. In order to balance the workload required to remind participants to call and to avoid large data collection bursts on the system, the participants were divided into twelve groups. Each group began the two-year schedule on subsequent months. The first group started in September, 1996. The second group started in October, 1996.

The NIST Language Recognition evaluation (LRE) is to establish the baseline of current performance capability for language recognition of conversational telephone speech and to lay the groundwork for further research efforts in the field. The series had its first evaluation in 1996. The 2003 NIST Language Recognition evaluation (LRE-03) is part of this ongoing series of evaluations of language recognition technology. The task to be evaluated is the detection of a given target language. Given a test segment of speech, a target language will be assigned as a test hypothesis, and the task is to determine whether this test hypothesis is true or false. Further information regarding this evaluation may be found on the 2003 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation website and the NIST 2003 evaluation plan."--index.html.  aSystem requirements: DVD-ROM drive; web browser; software to play files in the SPHERE format.  aCanadian French, Egyptian Arabic, English, Farsi, German, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Spanish, Tamil, Vietnamese.  a48 0aAutomatic speech recognitionvDatabases. 0aNatural language processing (Computer science)1 aMartin, Alvin.1 aPryzbocki, Mark.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.2 aNational Institute of Standards and Technology (U.S.) 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006S31.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006S31  1OLAC2french2arabic2english2persian2german2hindi2japanese2korean2chinese2spanish2tamil2vietnamese  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006S31wLCc1i0162023281890lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu11/30/200603520cmm  2200385 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350016001290400028001450500026001730900036001992450086002352600062003213000035003833360033004183370026004514900030004775000032005075000018005395202013005575380093025705960007026636500051026706500058027216500028027797100032028078300031028398560136028709900018030069990110030243806657OCoLC20061130113744.0co uga|a||||||060413s2006    pau        h        eng d  a1585633801  a(Sirsi) i9781585633807  aocm66462121  aRCEbengcRCEdRCEdAEU  aTK7895.S65bS635 2006  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006S30bAEU00aSpeech controlled computingh[electronic resource] /cLinguistic Data Consortium.  a[Philadelphia, Pa.]:bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2006.  a5 DVD-ROMs :bsd. ;c4 3/4 in.  aspoken wordbspw2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006S30  aTitle from index.html file.  a"LDC2006S30".  aThis file contains documentation on Speech Controlled Computing, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2006S30 and ISBN 1-58563-380-1. The Speech Controlled Computing corpus was designed to support the development of small footprint, embedded ASR applications in the domain of voice control for the home. It consists of the recordings of 125 speakers of American English from four dialect regions, three age groups and two gender groups, pronouncing isolated words. The four primary dialect regions covered by the corpus are North, South, West and Midland as defined by Williams Labov's Atlas of North American English. The three primary age groups covered by the corpus are 18-29, 30-49 and 50+. The recordings were conducted in a sound-attenuated room at LDC with the AKG C4000B studio condenser microphone. The omni-directional mode of the C4000B was used. Each speaker read a randomized word list consisting of 2100 words (100 distinct words appearing 21 times each). Speech utterances were digitized and recorded to a DAT, as well as to a hard disk drive via the Townshend DATLINK+ digital audio interface. Speech utterances were audited as they were recorded, and any utterances detected by the recorder that were not spoken clearly or correctly were re-recorded. This included extraneous clicks, coughs, sighs and breathing that may have corrupted the recorded words. Utterances that were spoken too soft or too loud were also re-recorded. The digitized utterances were automatically segmented and aligned to the word list. Then each utterance was audited and the segmentation was checked, and corrected if necessary, by an annotator using an auditing and segmenting tool developed by LDC. Finally, sound files containing individual utterances were generated using the alignment and segmentation information. The sound files for this corpus were created with 100 msec of silent time before and after each utterance. Any files that contained noticeable clipping were automatically removed.  aSystem requirements: DVD-ROM drive; software to read audio files in the wav file format.  a48 0aAutomatic speech recognitionxData processing. 0aEnglish languagexDialectszUnited StatesvDatabases. 0aLinguisticsvDatabases.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006S30.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC web-site:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006S30  1OLAC2english  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006S30wLCc1i0162023282047lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu11/30/200603256cmm  2200493 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350016001290400023001450410013001680500024001810900036002052450069002412460035003102500012003452600063003573000027004203360038004473370026004854900030005115000018005415000038005595201457005975380087020545460025021415960007021666500050021736500027022236500051022506500029023017000032023307100032023627100026023947100022024207100026024428300031024688560135024999900018026349990110026523806658OCoLC20061130113817.0co nga|m||||||061010s2006    pau        m        spa d  a1585633933  a(Sirsi) i9781585633937  aocm72463518  aRCEbengcRCEdAEU0 aspaaeng  aPC4074.5b.S63 2006  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006T12bAEU00aSpanish gigawordh[electronic resource] /c[Author, Dave Graff].3 aSpanish gigaword first edition  a1st ed.  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2006.  a1 DVD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006T12  a"LDC2006T12."  aTitle from index.html on DVD-ROM.  a"This file contains documentation on the Spanish Gigaword First Edition, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2006T12 and isbn 1-58563-393-3. The Spanish Gigaword Corpus is a comprehensive archive of newswire text data that has been acquired over several years by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) at the University of Pennsylvania. This is the first edition of the Spanish Gigaword Corpus, though some of the data included here has been released previously in other LDC corpora. The three distinct international sources of Spanish newswire in this edition, and the time spans of collection covered for each, are as follows: Agence France-Presse, Spanish Service (afp_spa) May 1994 - Dec 2005 ; Associated Press Worldstream, Spanish (apw_spa) Nov 1993 - Dec 2005 ; Xinhua News Agency, Spanish Service (xin_spa) Sep 2001 - Dec 2005. The seven-letter codes in the parentheses above include the three-character source name abbreviations and the three-character language code ("spa") separated by an underscore ("_") character. The three-letter language code conforms to LDC's new internal convention based on the new ISO 639-3 standard. The seven-letter codes are used in both the directory names where the data files are found, and in the prefix that appears at the beginning of every data file name. It is also used (in all UPPER CASE) as the initial portion of the DOC "id" strings that uniquely identify each news story."--index.html.  aSystem requirements: DVD-ROM drive; web browser; other requirements not specified.  aSpanish and English.  a48 0aSpanish languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aInformation retrieval. 0aNatural language processing (Computer science) 0aForeign newsvDatabases.1 aGraff, David Andrew,d1962-2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.2 aAgence France-presse.2 aAssociated Press.2 aXin hua tong xun she. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006T12.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006T12  1OLAC2spanish  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006T12wLCc1i0162023281916lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu11/30/200602829cmm  2200445 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350016001290400028001450410013001730430012001860500023001980900036002212450079002572600063003363000035003993360038004343370026004724900030004985000018005285000038005465201090005845380087016745460063017615960007018246500047018316500034018786500038019127000018019507100032019687100065020008300031020658560135020969900017022319990135022483806675OCoLC20061130124501.0co nga|m||||||040623s2006    pau        m        kor d  a1585633607  a(Sirsi) i9781585633609  aocm71777754  aNUIbengcNUIdRCEdAEU0 akoraeng  aa-cc---  aPL908.8b.W47 2006  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006S36bAEU00aWest Point Korean speechh[electronic resource] /c[Authors, John Morgan].  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2006.  a2 DVD-ROMs :bsd. ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006S36  a"LDC2006S36."  aTitle from index.html on DVD-ROM.  a"This file contains documentation on the West Point Korean Speech, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2006S36 and isbn 1-58563-360-7.

Approximately 2,290 files are from native informants and 1,891 are from non-native informants."  a48 0aRussian languagexSpoken RussianvDatabases.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2003S05.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003S05  1OLAC2russian  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2003S05wLCc1i0162023866419lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu4/6/200701655cmm  2200373 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140080041000310200015000720200018000870350021001050350016001260400030001420500022001720900036001942450083002302600063003133000026003763360026004023370026004284900030004545000027004845000018005115200309005295960007008386500029008456500049008747100026009237100032009498300031009818560135010129900026011479990108011733871190OCoLC20070406181130.0030819s2003    pau        d        ara d  a1585632627  a9781585632626  a(Sirsi) 52874717  aocm52874717  aAZUbengcAZUdOCLCQdAEU  aD856b.A8235 2003  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2003T07bAEU00aArabic treebank.nPart 1-10K-word,nEnglish translationh[electronic resource]  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2003.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2003T07  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2003T07."  a"The project targets the translation of a written Modern Standard Arabic corpus from the Agence France Presse (AFP) newswire archives for July 2000 (the files are dated 20000715*).

All of the interviews are conducted by William Labov or by one of his students. Labov notes that these interviews are not classic in the sense that they form part of a systematic sociolinguistic study of the speech community. What makes these interviews classic is that they represent classic solutions to the problems of achieving cross cultural contact, reducing the effect of the Observer's Paradox and approximating the vernacular of everyday life."  aDVD.  a48 0aSociolinguisticsvInterviewsvDatabases. 0aLinguisticsvInterviewsvDatabases.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2003T15.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003T15  1OLAC2English  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2003T15wLCc1i0162023824889lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu4/6/200701387cmm  2200361 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140080041000310200015000720200018000870350021001050350016001260400030001420500022001720900036001942450099002302460040003292460011003692600062003803000041004423360038004833370026005214900030005475000018005775960007005956500039006026500059006417100032007008300031007328560135007639900018008989990109009163877188OCoLC20070413153038.0031013s2003    pau        u        eng d  a1585632392  a9781585632398  a(Sirsi) 53186469  aocm53186469  aAZUbengcAZUdOCLCQdAEU  aZ699.A1bM46 2003  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2003T13bAEU00aMessage Understanding Conference (MUC) 6h[electronic resource] /cLinguistic Data Consortium.13aMessage Understanding Conference 6.13aMUC 6.  a[Philadelphia, PA.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c2003.  a1 computer optical disc ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2003T13  a"LDC2003T13."  a48 0aInformation retrievalvCongresses. 0aInformation storage and retrieval systemsvCongresses.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2003T13.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003T13  1OLAC2English  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2003T13wLCc1i0162023866369lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu4/13/200701807cmm  2200373 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140080041000310200015000720200018000870350021001050350016001260400030001420500019001720900036001912450076002272460035003032500017003382600062003553000041004173360038004583370026004964900030005225000018005525200463005705960007010336500037010406500031010777100032011088300031011408560135011719900018013069990109013243877189OCoLC20070413153116.0040415s2003    pau        u        eng d  a1585632708  a9781585632701  a(Sirsi) 54962734  aocm54962734  aAZUbengcAZUdOCLCQdAEU  aP93b.A34 2003  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2003T11bAEU00aACE-2 version 1.0h[electronic resource] /cLinguistic Data Consortium.30aAutomatic Contact Extraction 2  aVersion 1.0.  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c2003.  a1 computer optical disc ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2003T11  a"LDC2003T11."  a"This publication contains two sets of data: training and devtest.

Corresponding transcript files were created by Federal Document ClearingHouse and enhanced by the LDC to include: story boundaries, disfluency markers, and speaker and gender identification. Inkeeping with Hub-4 style transcription conventions, LDC spelled all digit strings in standard orthography. Commercial and music segments, while a part of the audio publication, were excluded from the transcripts. The timestamps mark the beginning of each speaker turn relative to the beginning of the recording and are precise to the 100th of a second. Althoughthe transcripts were created using Hub-4 conventions, the second and third pass quality checks, typically required by government sponsored evaluation projects, were skipped.  a48 0aBroadcast journalismxLanguagevDatabases. 0aEnglish languagevDatabases. 0aSpeech perceptionxData processing.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC99T36.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC99T36  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 99T36wLCc1i0162023866435lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/11/200702006cmm  2200421 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350027001200350016001470400023001630500023001860900036002092450084002452500009003292600062003383000026004003360038004263370026004644900030004905000018005205000037005385200394005755380134009695960007011036500043011106500051011536500022012047000029012267100032012558300031012878560139013189900018014579990109014753891887OCoLC20070511125845.0co ng||m||||||061016s2006    pau        m        eng d  a1585633860  a9781585633791  a(Sirsi) i9781585633869  aocm73174379  aRCEbengcRCEdAEU  aP299.S53bT56 2006  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2006T08bAEU00aTimebank 1.2h[electronic resource] /c[Authors, James Pustejovsky ... et al.].  a1.2.  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2006.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2006T08  a"LDC2006T08."  aTitle from index.html on CD-ROM.  a"This file contains documentation on version 1.2 of the Timebank corpus, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2006T08 and isbn 1-58563-379-8.

Each speech file in the corpus has a corresopnding orthographic transcription following the CSLU Labeling Conventions. In cases where a transcription did not already exist, the utterance was run through a speech recognizer to automatically obtain the transcription. The data were collected from both analog and digital phone lines. The analog data were recorded using a Gradient Technologies analog-to-digital conversion box. These files were recorded as 16-bit, 8 khz and stored in a linear format. The digital data were recorded with the CSLU T1 digital data collection system. These files were sampled at 8 khz 8-bit and stored as ulaw files. All of the data use the RIFF standard file format.

This corpus was designed with two goals: first, to serve as a tool for linguistic and prosodic feature investigation of emotional expression in Mandarin Chinese; and second, to provide a source of training and test data essential to support research in speaker recognition with affective speech. The speech database was recorded by eliciting speakers to express different emotional states in response to stimuli. The speakers read scenarios designed to elicite an emotional response such as a colleague's mistake for anger, a pleasant trip for elation, a hurry-up scene for panic and a puppy's death for sadness.

The original transcripts and the corresponding broadcast news audio are available as separate LDC publications, 1997 Mandarin Broadcast News Transcripts (HUB4-NE) (LDC98T24) and 1997 Mandarin Broadcast News Speech (HUB4-NE) (LDC98S73). The source data is comprised of 30 hours of recorded Mandarin broadcasts collected by the LDC in 1997 from Voice of America, China Central TV and KAZN-AM, a commercial radio station based in Los Angeles, CA. The original transcript segmentation is suitable for speech recognition, but does not support machine translation and machine translation evaluation. Therefore, the Mandarin side of these aligned transcripts was resegmented for this release; in all other respects, the Mandarin transcripts in this publication are identical to the original transcripts. The dataset in this release consists of 376K words of English text and 517K characters of Mandarin text. The English text was produced by translators with no access to the original audio. The translators were given specific guidelines for translation, and those are included in this distribution. A portion of the source data (6%) was translated four times in order to support experiments in translation evaluation.

It consists of cellular telephone speech and corresponding transcripts, specifically, 7,571 utterances from 515 speakers who made calls in the Portland, Oregon area using cellular telephones. Speakers called the CSLU data collection system on cellular telephones, and they were asked to repeat certain phrases and to respond to other prompts. Two prompt protocols were used: an In Vehicle Protocol for speakers calling from inside a vehicle and a Not in Vehicle Protocol for those calling from outside a vehicle. The protocols shared several questions, but each protocol contained distinct queries designed to probe the conditions of the caller's in vehicle/not in vehicle surroundings. Not every caller provided a response to each prompt.  a48 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishxData processingvDatabases. 0aTelephone callsvDatabases.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.2 aCenter for Spoken Language Understanding (Oregon Health & Science University) 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2008S01.42zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2008S01  1OLAC2English  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2008S01wLCc1i0162024726109lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu3/4/2008xDATABASE02420cmm  2200373 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350017001290400013001460900036001592450067001952460068002622600063003303000026003933360038004193370026004574900030004835000027005135000018005405201024005585960007015826500038015896500031016276500050016587100032017088300031017408560139017719900018019109990118019284072058OCoLC20061130131753.0co cg|||||||||080304s2008    pau        m        eng d  a1585634581  a(Sirsi) i9781585634583  aocn213380231  aAEUbeng  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2008T03bAEU00aACE 2005 English SpatialML annotationsh[electronic resource].3 aAutomatic Contact Extraction 2005 English SpatialML annotations  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2008.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2008T03  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2008T03."  aThe ACE (Automatic Contact Extraction) program focuses on developing automatic content extraction technology to support automatic processing of human language in text form. The kind of information recognized and extracted from text includes entities, values, temporal expressions, relations and events. SpatialML is a mark-up language for representing spatial expressions in natural language documents. SpatialML's focus is primarily on geography and culturally-relevant landmarks, rather than biology, cosmology, geology, or other regions of the spatial language domain. The goal is to allow for potentially better integration of text collections with resources such as databases that provide spatial information about a domain, including gazetteers, physical feature databases and mapping services. In ACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations, the authors applied SpatialML tags to the English training data (originally annotated for entities, relations and events) in ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus, LDC2006T06.  a48 0aContent analysis (Communication). 0aComputational linguistics. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2008T03.42zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2008T03  1OLAC2English  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2008T03wLCc1i0162024725937lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu3/4/2008xDATABASE02236cmm  2200409 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350017001290400013001460410018001590500024001770900036002012450050002372460027002872600063003143000027003773360038004043370026004424900030004685000027004985000018005255200755005435960007012986500050013056500050013556500049014057100032014547300021014868300031015078560135015389900035016739990118017084072065OCoLC20070706182817.0co ug|||||||||070705s2008    pau        m        eng d  a1585634654  a(Sirsi) i9781585634651  aocn213380233  aAEUbeng0 aengachiaara  aPE1074.5b.O56 2008  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2008T04bAEU00aOntoNotes release 2.0h[electronic resource].3 aOnto notes release 2.0  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2008.  a1 DVD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2008T04  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2008T04."  a"The OntoNotes project is a collaborative effort between BBN Technologies, the University of Colorado, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute.

Following a lexically grounded approach to annotation, the PDTB annotates relations realized explicitly by Explicit connectives drawn from syntactically well-defined classes, as well as relations between adjacent sentences when no Explicit connective appears to relate the two. Arguments of relations are annotated in each case. For Explicit connectives, arguments are unconstrained in terms of their distance from the connective and can be found anywhere in the text. Between adjacent sentences where no Explicit connective appears, four scenarios hold: (a) the sentences may be related by a discourse relation that has no realization in the second sentence, in which case a connective (called an Implicit connective) is provided to express the inferred relation; (b) the sentences may be related by a discourse relation that is realized by some "alternative" non-connective expression, in which case these alternative lexicalizations are annotated as the carriers of the relation (labelled as "AltLex"); (c) the sentences may be related not by a discourse relation, but merely by an "entity-based" coherence relation, in which case the presence of such a relation is labelled (as "EntRel"); and (d) the sentences may not be related at all, in which case they are labelled as such ("NoRel").  a48 0aDiscourse analysisvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2008T05.42zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2008T05  1OLAC2English  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2008T05wLCc1i0162024725804lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu3/4/2008xDATABASE02472cmm  2200373 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350017001290400013001460900036001592450059001952460030002542460071002842600063003553000028004183360038004463370026004844900030005105000027005405000018005675201059005855960007016446500042016516500066016937100032017598300031017918560139018229900018019619990119019794074796OCoLC20061130131753.0co cg|||||||||080304s2007    pau        m        eng d  a158563395X  a(Sirsi) i9781585633951  aocn213457316  aAEUbeng  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2007S18bAEU00aCSLU kid's speech, version 1.1h[electronic resource].30aKid's speech, version 1.13 aCenter for Spoken Language Understanding kid's speech, version 1.1  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2007.  a3 DVD-ROMs ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2007S18  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2007S18."  aCSLU: Kids' Speech Version 1.1 , Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2007S18 and isbn 1-58563-395-X, is a collection of spontaneous and prompted speech from 1100 children between Kindergarten and Grade 10 in the Forest Grove School District in Oregon. All children -- approximately 100 children at each grade level -- read approximately 60 items from a total list of 319 phonetically-balanced but simple words, sentences or digit strings. Each utterance of spontaneous speech begins with a recitation of the alphabet and contains a monologue of about one minute in duration. This release consists of 1017 files containing approximately 8-10 minutes of speech per speaker. Corresponding word-level transcriptions are also included. This corpus was developed to facilitate research about the characteristics of children's speech at different ages and to train and evaluate recognizers for use in language training and other interactive tasks involving children, including to train recognizers used in language development with deaf children.  a48 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishxData processingvDatabases.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2007S18.42zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2007S18  1OLAC2English  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2007S18wLCc1i0162024726323lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu3/10/2008xDATABASE02727cmm  2200397 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350017001290400013001460410018001590900036001772450064002132460026002772600063003033000026003663360038003923370026004304900030004565000027004865000018005135201248005315960007017796500049017866500047018356500049018826500042019317100032019738300031020058560139020369900035021759990119022104075686OCoLC20061130131753.0co cg|||||||||080304s2007    pau        m        mul d  a1585634522  a(Sirsi) i9781585634521  aocn191050593  aAEUbeng0 aengaaraachi  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2007T20bAEU00aGALE phase 1, distillation trainingh[electronic resource].30aDistillation training  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2007.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2007T20  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2007T20."  aGALE Phase 1 Distillation Training, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2007T20 and isbn 1-58563-452-2, constitutes the final release of training data created by LDC for the DARPA GALE Program Phase 1 Distillation technology evaluation. Distillation is one of three primary technology components for the DARPA GALE Program, along with Transcription and Translation. Distillation engines respond to queries from English-speaking users, delivering pertinent, consolidated information in easy-to-understand forms. The distillation engine processes English and foreign language material, both speech and text, from multiple sources and documents, removing redundancy and presenting an integrated response to the user. This release consists of 248 English, Chinese and/or Arabic queries and their responses, created by LDC annotators. Queries conform to one of ten template types. Query responses may include document and snippet relevance judgments, nuggets, nugs and supernugs. 158 of the 248 queries have been annotated for all features, while the remainder are labeled for only some features. In addition, not all queries have been exhaustively annotated for a given feature, given resource constraints during corpus development.  a48 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases. 0aArabic languagexSpoken ArabicvDatabases. 0aChinese languagexSpoken ChinesevDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2007T20.42zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2007T20  1OLAC2English2Arabic3Chinese  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2007T20wLCc1i0162024726802lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu3/11/2008xDATABASE02050cmm  2200397 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350017001290400013001460410008001590500021001670900036001882450058002242460020002822600061003023000027003633360038003903370026004284900030004545000018004845200654005025960007011566500029011636500040011926500049012327100032012817400036013138300031013498560136013809900017015169990119015334075696OCoLC20061123115337.0co cg|||||||||060202s2007    pau        m        ara d  a1585634603  a(Sirsi) i9781585634606  aocn999660336  aAEUbeng0 aara  aD856b.A822 2007  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2007T40bAEU00aArabic gigaword third editionh[electronic resource].30aArabic gigaword  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c2007.  a1 DVD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2007T40  a"LDC2007T40."  aArabic Gigaword Third Edition is a comprehensive archive of newswire text data acquired from Arabic news sources by the LDC at the University of Pennsylvania.

This corpus is a re-release of part one of that project, with the addition in Version 3.0 of improved morphological/part-of-speech annotation (including full vocalization and case endings). The project targets the description of a written Modern Standard Arabic corpus from the Agence France Presse (AFP) newswire archives for July-November 2000 (files dated 20000/7/15 to 2000/11/15). This corpus includes 734 stories representing 145,386 words (166,068 tokens after clitic segmentation in the Treebank; the number of Arabic tokens is 123,796). For this work, annotators must be native speakers of Arabic, and they must understand enough linguistics to check morphosyntactic analysis and build syntactic structures.

Schiffman, Professor, emeritus, of Dravidian Lingusitics and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania's Department of South Asia Studies. It contains translations for 6597 English verbs and defines 9716 Tamil verbs. This release presents the dictionary in two formats: Adobe PDF and XML. The PDF format displays the dictionary in a human readable form and is suitable for printing. The XML version is a purely electronic form which, while readable by humans, is intended mainly for application development and the creation of searchable electronic databases. In the electronic XML version each entry contains the following: the English entry or head word; the Tamil equivalent (in Tamil script and transliteration); the verb class and transitivity specification; the spoken Tamil pronunciation (audio files in mp3 format); the English definition(s); additional Tamil entries (if applicable); example sentences or phrases in Literary Tamil, Spoken Tamil (with a corresponding audio file in .mp3 format) and an English translation; and Tamil synonyms or near-synonyms, where appropriate. Some foods referenced in the example sentences are illustrated in html files that include detailed description of each dish. It is expected that the dictionary will be useful for Tamil learners, scholars and others interested in the Tamil language.  a48 0aTamil languagexVerbvDictionaries. 0aTamil languagevDictionariesxEnglish.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2008L01.42zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC websiteuhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2008L01  1OLAC2Tamil  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2008L01wLCc1i0162021830227lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/7/2008xDATABASE03168cmm  2200469Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350021001200350016001410400023001570410013001800500022001930900036002152450099002512500009003502600063003593000026004223360038004483370026004864900030005125000037005425000018005795201426005975380086020235460024021095960007021336500049021406500042021896500027022316500051022587000024023097100032023337100024023658300031023898560134024209900026025549990118025804137582OCoLC20080507155817.0co ng||m||||||061013s2004    pau        m        ara d  a1585633194  a9781585633197  a(Sirsi) 72840284  aocm72840284  aRCEbengcRCEdAEU1 aaraaeng  aPJ6074b.P73 2004  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2004T23bAEU00aPrague Arabic dependency treebank 1.0h[electronic resource] /cAuthors, Jan Hajic ... et al.  a1.0.  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2004.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2004T23  aTitle from index.html on CD-ROM.  a"LDC2004T23."  a"This page contains information on Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank 1.0, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004T23 and ISBN 1-58563-319-4. Authors: Jan Hajic, Otakar Smrz, Petr Zemanek, Petr Pajas, Jan Snaidauf, Emanuel Beska, Jakub Kracmar, Kamila Hassanova. Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) not only consists of multi-level linguistic annotations over the language of Modern Standard Arabic, but even provides a variety of unique software implementations designed for general use in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper delivers an overview of the recent and most interesting results, findings and innovations within the project. The PADT project might be summarized as an open-ended activity of the Center for Computational Linguistics, the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, and the Institute of Comparative Linguistics, Charles University in Prague, resting in multi-level annotation of Arabic language resources in the light of the theory of Functional Generative Description (Sgall et al., 1986; Hajicova and Sgall, 2003). The project is a younger sibling to Prague Dependency Treebank for Czech (Hajic et al., 2001), and is maintained upon co-operation with the Linguistic Data Consortium, University of Pennsylvania, who release non-annotated corpora of Arabic newswire and develop an independent Penn Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004)."--index.html.  aSystem requirements: CD-ROM drive; web browser; other requirements not specified.  aArabic and English.  a48 0aArabic languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aCross-language information retrieval. 0aInformation retrieval. 0aNatural language processing (Computer science)1 aHajic, Jan,d1960-2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.2 aUniverzita Karlova. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2004T23.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC websiteuhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2004T23  1OLAC2Arabic2English  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2004T23wLCc1i0162021830342lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/7/2008xDATABASE02424cmm  2200349Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140080041000310200015000720200018000870350027001050350016001320400023001480500024001710900036001952450076002312600062003073000041003693360038004103370026004484900030004745000018005045201136005225960007016586500034016656500037016997100032017368300031017688560138017999900019019379990118019564137585OCoLC20080507161353.0050616s2005    pau        a        man d  a1585633372  z9781585633372  a(Sirsi) i9781585633371  aocm60652684  aAZUbengcAZUdAEU  aPL8490.M36bM3 2005  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2005L01bAEU00aMawukakan lexiconh[electronic resource] /cLinguistic Data Consortium.  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c2005.  a1 computer optical disc ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2005L01  a"LDC2005L01."  a"The Mawukakan Dictionary is the first publication of an on going project aiming to build an Electronic Dictionary of four Mandekan [Eastern Manding languages of the Mande Group of the Niger-Congo family] at the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) of the University of Pennsylvania. The other three variants of Mandekan involved are the Bambara or Bamanankan [Mali], the Maninka or Maninkakan [Guinea-Conakry] and the Odienne Jula or Wojenekakan [Cote d'Ivoire]. The lack of written tradition makes such a dictionary project extremely important. For the dictionary of a small language like Mawukakan (less than half of a million speakers) to be the most useful, it has to combine the linguistic component with a cultural component. The fact that the Mawukakan-English lexicon is coupled with a Mawukakan-French one makes this project a bit more important, given the Mawukakan speakers live mostly in the francophone area of West Africa. The project consists in the collection of the largest amount possible of data on the Mandekan and the Manding culture, and making it available electronically at the LDC for the research community."  a48 0aMandingo languagevDatabases. 0aMandingo languagevDictionaries.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2005L01.42zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC websiteuhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2005L01  1OLAC2Mandingo  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2005L01wLCc1i0162021830367lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/7/2008xDATABASE02182cmm  2200373 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350027001200350016001470400013001630500021001760900036001972450113002332460037003462600062003833000041004453360038004863370026005244900030005505000018005805000787005985960007013856500033013926500041014257100032014668300031014988560134015299900027016639990118016904137601OCoLC20070413160913.0co cg|||||||||031015s2004    pau        u        chi d  a1585632899  z9781585632899  a(Sirsi) i9781585632893  aocm56725601  aAEUbeng  aP121b.M838 2004  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2004T07bAEU00aMultiple translation Chinese (MTC)nPart 3h[electronic resource] /cproduced by Linguistic Data Consortium.30aMultiple-translation Chinese MTC  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c2004.  a1 computer optical disc ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2004T07  a"LDC2004T07."  aTo support the development of automatic means for evaluating translation quality, the LDC was sponsored to solicit four sets of human translations for a single set of Mandarin Chinese source materials.

Each Chinese news story was translated once."  a48 0aLinguisticsvDatabases. 0aForeign newszChinavDatabases. 0aChinese languagexMachine translatingvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2005T06.42zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC websiteuhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2005T06  1OLAC2Chinese2English  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2005T06wLCc1i0162025581693lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/13/2008xDATABASE01788cam  2200397 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350017001290400013001460900036001592450102001952600062002973000041003593360026004003370026004263380027004524900030004795000042005095000018005515000027005695200280005965960007008766500028008836500036009116500054009476500042010017100032010438300031010758560138011069900027012449990119012714145047OCoLC20080513144120.0co |g|||||||||080513s2005    pau        u      0 chi d  a158563333X  a(Sirsi) i9781585633333  aocn464598378  aAEUbeng  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2005T10bAEU00aChinese English news magazine parallel texth[electronic resource] /cLinguistic Data Consortium.  a[Philadelphia, PA.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c2005.  a1 computer optical disc ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2005T10  aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.  a"LDC2005T10."  aTitle from disc label.  aThis corpus contains Chinese news stories and their English translations LDC collected via Sinorama Magazine, Taiwan, from 1976 to 2004.

This data set has been created and distributed by Linguistic Data Consortium. This data was previously released to the EARS MDE community as LDC2004E31.The goal of MDE is to enable technology that can take raw Speech-to-Text output and refine it into forms that are of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. In simple terms, this means the creation of automatic transcripts that are maximally readable. This readability might be achieved in a number of ways: flagging non-content words like filled pauses and discourse markers for optional removal; marking sections of disfluent speech; and creating boundaries between natural breakpoints in the flow of speech so that each sentence or other meaningful unit of speech might be presented on a separate line within the resulting transcript. Natural capitalization, punctuation and standardized spelling, plus sensible conventions for representing speaker turns and identity are further elements in the readable transcript. LDC has defined a SimpleMDE annotation task specification and has annotated English telephone and broadcast news data to provide training data for MDE.In this release, some original annotations contained in LDC2004E31 have been re-mapped to new MDE elements to support better annotation consistency. In particular, the mapping affects Discourse Responses (DR), Discourse Markers (DM) and Backchannel SUs (BC).

This data set has been created and distributed by Linguistic Data Consortium. This data was previously released to the EARS MDE community as LDC2004E31. The goal of MDE is to enable technology that can take raw Speech-to-Text output and refine it into forms that are of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. In simple terms, this means the creation of automatic transcripts that are maximally readable. This readability might be achieved in a number of ways: flagging non-content words like filled pauses and discourse markers for optional removal; marking sections of disfluent speech; and creating boundaries between natural breakpoints in the flow of speech so that each sentence or other meaningful unit of speech might be presented on a separate line within the resulting transcript. Natural capitalization, punctuation and standardized spelling, plus sensible conventions for representing speaker turns and identity are further elements in the readable transcript. LDC has defined a SimpleMDE annotation task specification and has annotated English telephone and broadcast news data to provide training data for MDE. The transcript and annotation files corresponding to this release are available as LDC2005ST4 (MDE RT04 Training Text/Annotations). In general, there is one-to-one correspondence between speech files and annotation files with one exception: several .ag.xml annotation files correspond to one speech file in the bnews corpus. It's because the bnews files were divided into roughly 5 minute chunks and then each chunk was annotated as a unit. These chunks are labeled with "-split001", "-split002", etc. Note that the ag-to-rttm script combines these chunks together, so the one-to-one correspondence is kept between the speech files and .rttm files."--index.html  aSystem requirements: DVD-ROM drive; software to process .wav files.  a48 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aMetadatabases.1 aLee, Haejoong.1 aStrassel, Stephanie.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.0 aMDE RT-04 training data text/annotations. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2005S16.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC web-siteuhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2005S16  1OLAC2English  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2005S16wLCc1i0162025592831lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/20/2008xDATABASE03014cmm  2200529Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350021001200350016001410400030001570500025001870900036002122450119002482460044003672460030004112600063004413000028005043360038005323370026005704900030005965000027006265000018006535200754006715200103014255380095015285960007016236500081016306500033017116500045017446500051017897000022018407000024018627000018018867100064019047100032019687300024020007300038020248300031020628560135020939900018022289990119022469990119023654152679OCoLC20080520135623.0co ug|||||||||050224s2004    pau        u        eng d  a1585632945  a9781585632947  a(Sirsi) 57729096  aocm57729096  aCVUbengcCVUdOCLCQdAEU  aQA76.9.N38bI75 2004  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2004S05bAEU00aISL meeting speech.nPart 1h[electronic resource] /cauthors: Susanne Burger, Victoria MacLaren, and Alex Waibel.3 aInteractive Systems Laboratories speech3 aISL meeting corpus speech  a[Philadelphia, PA.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2004.  a2 DVD-ROMs ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2004S05  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2004S05."  a"The ISL Meeting Speech [Corpus] Part 1 is a first subset of the ISL Meeting Corpus (112 meetings).

This corpus is an addendum to the 2000 Communicator Evaluation corpus produced by the LDC in 2002. This addendum contains annotations on the transcriptions of the system and user utterances as taken from the logfiles of the 2000 Communicator Evaluation corpus. The version of the logfiles used for Dialogue Act annotation do not contain the time stamps as were recorded in the original logfiles published in the 2000 Communicator Evaluation corpus. The logfiles without the time stamps are released as part of this addendum. Dialogue tasks, turns and utterances in these logfiles can be aligned with those in the original time-stamped logfiles and the alignment projected to the Dialogue Act Annotations. Dialogue Act annotations are provided for system utterances in the dialogues. The dialogue act tags follow the DATE (Dialogue Act Tagging for Evaluation) scheme. Three papers describing the DATE scheme are provided in the doc directory. In addition, both system as well as user utterances are tagged for named entities. For further description of the 2000 Communicator Evaluation corpus, please refer to the main publication from 2002 (LDC2002S56)."--index.html.  a"The complete Dialogue Act annotated corpus is available as a single XML text file totalling approximately 16 MB. The total number of dialogues is 648. The non-time-stamped versions of the logfiles are available in the data/raw-dialogs-2000 directory. The total number of logfiles is 663. The difference between the number of annotated dialogues and the number of logfiles is due to the fact that some of the logfiles are empty. Only non-empty logfiles were used for annotation. There are 314223 words (tokens) and 1403985 unique words. Each dialogue is segmented into system and user turns. The total number of turns for the entire corpus is 24728 (13013 system turns and 11715 user turns). Except for one system (see the readme file in the doc directory), no utterance segmentation was done within the turns in the log files. We have therefore treated the number of utterances to be the same as the number of turns. However, utterance segmentation is partially reflected in the dialogue act segmentation. The total number of tagged dialogue acts is 22701 with 61 unique tags (see the readme file in the doc directory for the list of dialogue act tags appearing in this corpus: each dialogue act tag is listed with its frequency of occurrence). There are a total of 275938 words in the system utterances and a total of 38285 words in the user utterances. Dialogue Act tagging was done automatically using pattern matching with human-labeled dialogue utterances used by the 9 different participating Communicator Systems. Named entity tagging also followed the same methodology. For more information about the dialogue act tagging scheme and the dialogue act labels represented in the corpus, please consult the readme file in the doc directory. The file da_tagged_communicator_2000.dtd in the dtd directory provides the formal "Document Type Declaration" for parsing the XML content.

Hindi, a member of the Indo-Iranian language family, is the primary national language of India and is spoken by approximately 500 million people making it the fifth largest language in the world. Inspired by the well-known English language Wordnet, Hindi Wordnet is the first wordnet for an Indian language. Wordnets are systems for analyzing the different lexical and semantic relations between words. Specifically, a wordnet is a word sense network in which words are grouped into sematically equivalent units called synsets. Each synset represents a lexical concept, and synsets are linked to each other by semantic relations (between synsets) and lexical relations (between words). Similar in design to the Princeton Wordnet for English, Hindi Wordnet incorporates additional features to capture the complexities of Hindi. This release of Hindi Wordnet consists of 56,928 unique words and 26,208 synsets."  a4800aWordNet. 0aHindi languagevDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aHindi languagexData processingvDatabases.1 aPande, Prabhakar.1 aLupu, Laxmi.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2008L02.42zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC websiteuhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2008L02  1OLAC2Hindi  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2008L02wLCc1i0162022997470lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu6/24/2008xDATABASE02753cmm  2200397 a 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870350027001020350017001290400013001460900036001591000018001952450128002132600063003413000027004043360038004313370026004694900030004955000027005255000018005525201232005705960007018026500063018096500045018726500042019177000033019597000022019927100032020148300031020468560138020779900021022159990119022364167029OCoLC20061130131753.0co cg|||||||||080304s2008    pau        m        por d  a1585634719  a(Sirsi) i9781585634712  aocn232999424  aAEUbeng  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2008S04bAEU1 aMorgan, John.10aWest Point Brazilian Portuguese speechh[electronic resource] /c[Authors, John Morgan, Sheila Ackerlind, Sterling Packer].  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2008.  a1 DVD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2008S04  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2008S04."  a"West Point Brazilian Portuguese Speech is a database of digital recordings of spoken Brazilian Portuguese designed and collected by staff and faculty of the Department of Foreign Languages (DFL) and Center for Technology Enhanced Language Learning (CTELL) to develop acoustic models for speech recognition systems. The U.S. government uses such systems to provide speech-recognition enhanced language learning courseware to government linguists and students enrolled in various government language programs. The data in this corpus was collected in March 1999 in Brasilia, Brazil using informants from a Brazilian military academy. The corpus consists of read speech from 60 female and 68 male native and non-native speakers.

The goal of the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE) is to establish the baseline of current performance capability for language recognition of conversational telephone speech and to lay the groundwork for further research efforts in the field. NIST conducted two previous evaluations in 1996 and 2003. For the 2005 LRE, the emphasis was on research directed toward a general base of technology to be ported to various language recognition tasks with minimum effort and the development of the ability to make more difficult discriminations between similar languages and dialects of the same language. That focus augmented the traditional evaluation goals, those being: 1. to drive the technology forward 2. to measure the state-of-the-art 3. to find the most promising algorithmic approaches The task evaluated was the detection of a given target language or dialect. From a test segment of speech and a target language or dialect, the system to be evaluated determined whether the speech was from the target language or dialect.

The corpus includes: over 1.8 million articles (excluding wire services articles that appeared during the covered period); over 650,000 article summaries written by library scientists; over 1,500,000 articles manually tagged by library scientists with tags drawn from a normalized indexing vocabulary of people, organizations, locations and topic descriptors; over 275,000 algorithmically-tagged articles that have been hand verified by the online production staff at nytimes.com; Java tools for parsing corpus documents from .xml into a memory resident object. As part of the New York Times' indexing procedures, most articles are manually summarized and tagged by a staff of library scientists. This collection contains over 650,000 article-summary pairs which may prove to be useful in the development and evaluation of algorithms for automated document summarization.

The data was obtained in two different sessions with a time separation of about two months. The goal of the corpus is to provide a range of speaking styles and voice modifications for speakers sharing the same accent. Other existing corpora, in particular CSLU Speaker Recognition Version 1.1, TIMIT and the IViE corpus (English Intonation in the British Isles), served as referents in the selection of material.

It is a collection of naturally produced numbers taken from utterances in various CSLU telephone speech data collections. The corpus consists of approximately fifteen hours of speech and includes isolated digit strings, continuous digit strings, and ordinal/cardinal numbers. The numbers have several sources, among them, phone numbers, numbers from street addresses and zip codes, uttered by 12618 speakers in a total of 23902 files. In most of CSLU's telephone data collections, callers were asked for their phone number, birthdate or zip code. Callers would also occasionally leave numbers in the midst of another utterance. The numbers in those situations were extracted from the host utterance and added to the corpus.."  a48 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishvDatabases.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.2 aOregon Health Sciences University.bCenter for Spoken Language Understanding. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2009S01.42zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC websiteuhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2009S01  1OLAC2English  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009S01wLCc1i0162027475639lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu4/21/200902817cmm  2200493Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350022001200350017001420400023001590490009001820900036001911000016002272450058002432600069003013000028003703360026003983370026004244900030004505000027004805000061005075000021005685000017005895201059006065380087016655960007017526500050017596500022018096500051018317000020018827100032019027100018019348300030019528560139019829480035021219900019021569940012021750790017021879990119022044359829OCoLC20090515181952.0co ngu---uuuuu090515s2009    pau        d        jpn d  a1585635103  a9781585635108  a(Sirsi) 321238300  aocn321148466  aUABbengcUABdUAB  aUABA  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009T08bAEU1 aKudo, Taku.10aJapanese Web n-gram version 1h[electronic resource].  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2007, c2009.  a6 DVD-ROMs ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2009T08  aTitle from disc label.  a"Authors: Taku Kudo and Hideto Kazawa" -- LDC catalogue.  aData type: text.  a"LDC2009T08"  a"Japanese Web n-gram version 1, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2009T08 and isbn 1-58563-510-3, was created by Google Inc.

English CTS treebank with structural metadata was created to support EARS work in English. It applies EARS metadata extraction annotations and Penn Treebank methods to conversations from Switchboard-1 Release 2 (LDC97S62) and from data collected for EARS under the Fisher Protocol (released in EARS as LDC2004E16, LDC2004E29 and LDC2005E73). The purpose of the EARS program was to develop robust speech recognition technology to address a range of languages and speaking styles. LDC provided conversational and broadcast speech and transcripts, annotations, lexicons and texts for language modeling in each of the EARS languages (Arabic, Chinese, English). LDC also supported a metadata extraction (MDE) research evaluation, the goal of which was to enable technology to take raw speech-to-text (STT) output and to refine it into forms of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. In simple terms, this means the creation of automatic transcripts that are maximally readable. This readability might be achieved in a number of ways: removing non-content words like filled pauses and discourse markers from the text; removing sections of disfluent speech; and creating boundaries between natural breakpoints in the flow of speech so that each sentence or other meaningful unit of speech might be presented on a separate line within the resulting transcript. Natural capitalization, punctuation and standardized spelling, plus sensible conventions for representing speaker turns and identity are further elements in the readable transcript. Some of the data developed by LDC for the MDE task is contained in the LDC Catalog, i.e., RT-04 MDE Training Data Speech, LDC2005S16 and RT-04 MDE Training Data Text/Annotations, LDC2005T24.  aSystem requirements: DVD-ROM drive; web browser; other requirements not specified.  a48 0aEnglish languagexData processing. 0aAutomatic speech recognition.1 aBies, Ann.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2009T01.4 3For additional information on data files, see the LDC website.uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2009T01  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2English  aZ0bUAB  aocn327967928  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009T01wLCc1i0162027611324lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/20/2009xDATABASE03324cmm  2200517Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140080041000310200015000720200018000870350022001050350017001270400023001440410018001670490009001850900036001942450074002302600062003043000027003663360026003933370026004194900045004455000027004905000060005175000021005775000017005985050102006155201249007175380087019665460039020535960007020926500038020996500039021376500039021766500031022157100032022467300069022787300071023478300031024188560139024499480035025889900035026239940012026580790017026709990119026874360226OCoLC20090520142529.0090520s2009    pau        d        mul d  a1585635111  a9781585635115  a(Sirsi) 328218568  aocn328112593  aUABbengcUABdUAB0 aaraachiaeng  aUABA  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009T07bAEU00aUnified linguistic annotation text collectionh[electronic resource].  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c[2009]  a1 DVD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLinguistic Data Consortium ;vLDC2009T07  aTitle from disc label.  a"Authors: Linguistic Data Consortium" -- LDC catalogue.  aData type: text.  a"LDC2009T07"0 a[1]. Language understanding annotation corpus -- [2]. REFLEX entity translation training/devtest.  aThe Unified linguistic annotation text collection, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2009T07 and isbn 1-58563-511-1, consists of two separate corpora: The Language Understanding Annotation Corpus (LDC2009T10) and REFLEX EntityTranslation Training/DevTest (LDC2009T11). Most recent annotation efforts for language have focused on small pieces of the larger problem of semantic annotation rather than producing a single unified representation. The Unified Linguistic Annotation (ULA) project, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, seeks to integrate into one framework different layers of annotation (e.g., semantics, discourse, temporal, opinions) using various existing resources, including PropBank, NomBank, TimeBank, Penn Discourse Treebank and coreference and opinion annotations. The project represents a concerted effort of researchers from several institutions to develop a large word corpus with balanced and annotated data. The ULA Text Collection is provided as a resource for the ULA effort. It consists of two datasets, the Language Understanding Annotation Corpus from the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Human Language Technology and ACE Reflex Entity Translation Training Dev/Test developed by LDC.  aSystem requirements: DVD-ROM drive; web browser; other requirements not specified.  aArabic, English, Mandarin Chinese.  a48 0aArabic languagexData processing. 0aChinese languagexData processing. 0aEnglish languagexData processing. 0aComputational linguistics.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.02aLanguage understanding annotation corpush[electronic resource].02aREFLEX entity translation training/devtesth[electronic resource]. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2009T07.4 3For additional information on data files, see the LDC website.uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2009T07  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2English2Arabic2Chinese  aZ0bUAB  aocn328112593  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009T07wLCc1i0162024043125lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/20/2009xDATABASE02674cmm  2200481Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140080041000310200015000720200018000870350022001050350017001270400023001440410018001670490009001850900036001941000016002302450095002462600062003413000027004033360026004303370026004564900045004825000027005275000043005545000021005975000061006185000017006795200879006965380087015755460041016625960007017036500039017106500031017497100032017808300031018128560139018439480035019829900027020179940012020440790017020569990119020734360228OCoLC20090520145909.0090520s2009    pau        d        eng d  a1585634999  a9781585634996  a(Sirsi) 328319914  aocn328265375  aUABbengcUABdUAB1 aengachihchi  aUABA  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009T02bAEU1 aMa, Xiaoyi.10aGALE phase 1 Chinese broadcast conversation parallel text.nPart 1h[electronic resource].  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c[2009]  a1 DVD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLinguistic Data Consortium ;vLDC2009T02  aTitle from disc label.  a"Authors: Xiaoyi Ma" -- LDC catalogue.  aData type: text.  aData source: broadcast conversation, transcribed speech.  a"LDC2009T02"  a"GALE Phase 1 Chinese broadcast conversation parallel text - part 1, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2009T02 and ISBN 1-58563-499-9, contains transcripts and English translations of 20.4 hours of Chinese broadcast conversation programming from China Central TV (CCTV) and Phoenix TV.

In this program, participants submit their metrics to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST runs those metrics on certain held-back test data for which it has human assessments measuring quality and then calculates correlations between the automatic metric scores and the human assessments. This release contains the development data received by participants in NIST Metrics for Machine Translation 2008 Evaluation (MetricsMATR08). Specifically, this corpus is comprised of a subset of the materials used in the NIST Open MT06 evaluation and includes human reference translations, system translations, and human assessments of adequacy and preference. The source data consists of twenty-five Arabic language newswire documents with a total of 249 segments. The data in each segment includes four human reference translations in English and system translations from eight different MT06 machine translation systems. In addition to the data and reference translations, this release includes software tools for evaluation and reporting and documentation describing how the human assessments were obtained and how they are represented in the data. The evaluation plan contains further information and rules on the use of this data." -- LDC catalogue.  aSystem requirements: DVD-ROM drive; web browser; other requirements not specified.  aArabic and English.  a48 0aArabic languagexData processing. 0aMachine translating. 0aComputational linguistics.1 aPeterson, Kay.1 aBronsart, Sebastien.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2009T05.4 3For additional information on data files, see the LDC website.uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2009T05  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2English2Arabic  aZ0bUAB  aocn329269024  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009T05wLCc1i0162024043166lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/21/2009xDATABASE03588cmm  2200481Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140080041000310200015000720200018000870350022001050350017001270400023001440410013001670490009001800900036001891000025002252450068002502500012003182600062003303000027003923360038004193370026004574900045004835000027005285000068005555000024006235000017006475201860006645460026025245960007025506500040025576500043025977000023026407100032026638300031026958560172027269480035028989900025029339940012029580790017029709990119029874360630OCoLC20090521133207.0090521s2009    pau        m        tam d  a1585635073  a9781585635078  a(Sirsi) 334886400  aocn334940594  aUABbengcUABdUAB0 atamaeng  aUABA  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009L01bAEU1 aSchiffman, Harold F.13aAn English dictionary of the Tamil verbh[electronic resource].  a2nd ed.  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,c2009.  a1 DVD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLinguistic Data Consortium ;vLDC2009L01  aTitle from disc label.  a"Authors: Harold Schiffman, Vasu Renganathan" -- LDC catalogue.  aData type: Lexicon.  a"LDC2009L01"  a"An English dictionary of the Tamil verb represents over twenty-five years of work led by Harold F. Schiffman, Professor, emeritus, of Dravidian Linguistics and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania's Department of South Asia Studies. It contains translations for 6597 English verbs and defines 9716 Tamil verbs. This release presents the dictionary in two formats: Adobe PDF and XML. The PDF format displays the dictionary in a human readable form. The XML version is a purely electronic form which, while readable by humans, is intended mainly for application development and the creation of searchable electronic databases. In the electronic XML version each entry contains the following: the English entry or head word; the Tamil equivalent (in Tamil script and transliteration); the verb class and transitivity specification; the spoken Tamil pronunciation (audio files in mp3 format); the English definition(s); additional Tamil entries (if applicable); example sentences or phrases in Literary Tamil, Spoken Tamil (with a corresponding audio file in .mp3 format) and an English translation; and Tamil synonyms or near-synonyms, where appropriate. Some foods referenced in the example sentences are illustrated in html files that include detailed description of each dish. It is expected that the dictionary will be useful for Tamil learners, scholars and others interested in the Tamil language. What's new in the second edition? Errors in the Tamil text and the roman transliteration have been corrected; audio files have been updated and corrected and missing files have been added; a brand new search and browse application that can access the audio has been included in this edition, this application can be accessed from the tools directory; the XML structure has been modified to normalize the presentation of synonyms." -- LDC catalogue.  aIn Tamil and English.  a48 0aTamil languagexVerbvDictionaries. 0aTamil languagevDictionariesxEnglish.1 aRenganathan, Vasu.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2009L01.4 3For additional information on data files, see the LDC websiteuhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2009L01  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2English2Tamil  aZ0bUAB  aocn334940594  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009L01wLCc1i0162027611027lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/21/2009xDATABASE02501cmm  2200481Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350022001200350017001420400023001590490009001820900036001912450056002272460050002832600063003333000026003963360026004223370026004484900045004745000027005195000111005465000021006575000043006785000018007215200639007395380086013785960007014646500050014716500042015217000021015637100032015847110059016168300031016758560139017069480035018459900018018809940012018989990109019104387999OCoLC20090618174110.0co cg|||||||||090618s2009    pau        d        eng d  a1585635057  a9781585635054  a(Sirsi) 402770843  aocn464664190  aCVUbengcUABdUAB  aUABA  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009T12bAEU00a2008 CoNLL shared task datah[electronic resource].30aCoNLL shared task datah[electronic resource]  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2009.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLinguistic Data Consortium ;vLDC2009T12  aTitle from disc label.  a"Authors: Mihai Surdeanu, Richard Johansson, Lluis Marquez, Adam Meyers, Joakim Nivre" -- LDC catalogue.  aData type: Text.  aData sources: News magazine, newswire.  a"LDC2009T12".  a"... contains the the trial corpus, training corpus, development and test data for the 2008 CoNLL (Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning) Shared Task Evaluation.

Czech broadcast conversation speech consists of 72 single channel recordings of Radioforum, a live talk program broadcast by Czech Radio 1 (CRo1) every weekday evening. Its format consists of invited guests (most often politicians) spontaneously answering topical questions posed by one or two interviewers. The number of interviewees in a single program varies from one to three, but typically, one interviewer and two interviewees appear in the program.

[Prepared] by researchers at the University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic, and consists of approximately 33 hours of transcribed speech from Radioforum, a talk show broadcast on Czech Radio 1. Czech broadcast conversation MDE transcripts was created to extend metadata extraction (MDE) research to conversational Czech. The goal of MDE is to take raw speech recognition output and refine it into forms that are of more use to humans and to downstream automatic processes. In simple terms, this means the creation of automatic transcripts that are maximally readable. This readability might be achieved in a number of ways: removing non-content words like filled pauses and discourse markers from the text; removing sections of disfluent speech; and creating boundaries between natural breakpoints in the flow of speech so that each sentence or other meaningful unit of speech might be presented on a separate line within the resulting transcript. Natural capitalization, punctuation and standardized spelling, plus sensible conventions for representing speaker turns and identity are further elements in the readable transcript." -- LDC catalogue.  aSystem requirements: CD-ROM drive; web browser; other requirements not specified.  aCzech.  a48 0aCzech languagexData processing.1 aSvec, Jan.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2009T20.4 3For additional information on data files, see the LDC website.uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2009T20  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2Czech.  aZ0bUAB  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009T20wLCc1i0162024043067lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu8/7/2009xDATABASE02231cmm  2200493Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350027001200350017001470400023001640410018001870490009002050900036002141000016002502450075002662600062003413000026004033360026004293370026004554900045004815000027005265000058005535000021006115000027006325000018006595200433006775380086011105460021011965960007012176500049012246500059012737000020013327100032013528300031013848560139014159480035015549900027015899940012016169990109016284414645OCoLC20090911190818.0co ug|||||||||090911s2009    pau        d        ara d  a1585635219  a9781585635214  a(Sirsi) i9781585635214  aocn436317706  aUABbengcUABdUAB1 aaraaenghara  aUABA  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2009T22bAEU1 aMa, Xiaoyi.10aArabic newswire English translation collectionh[electronic resource].  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2009.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLinguistic Data Consortium ;vLDC2009T22  aTitle from disc label.  a"Authors: Xiaoyi Ma, Dalal Zakhary" -- LDC catalogue.  aData type: Text.  aData source: Newswire.  a"LDC2009T22".  a"The Arabic English newswire translation collection was produced by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).

TIMIT contains wideband speech recordings (i.e., sampled at 16 kHz) of 630 speakers in American English from eight major dialectic regions, each reading ten phonetically rich sentences. The TIMIT speech corpus was completed in 1993, being intended for acoustic-phonetic studies as well as for development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In the meantime, five TIMIT derivatives have been developed: FFMTIMIT, NTIMIT, CTIMIT, HTIMIT, and STC-TIMIT. The FFMTIMIT (LDC96S32) corpus (Free-Field Microphone TIMIT) consists of the original TIMIT database, being recorded by a free-field microphone. NTIMIT (LDC93S2) (Network TIMIT) serves as a telephone bandwidth adjunct to TIMIT, containing its speech files transmitted over a telephone handset and the NYNEX telephone network, subject to a large variety of channel conditions. For the cellular bandwidth speech corpus CTIMIT (LDC96S30), the original TIMIT recordings were passed through cellular telephone circuits. The HTIMIT (LDC98S67) corpus (Handset TIMIT) offers a TIMIT subset of 192 male and 192 female speakers through different telephone handsets for the study of telephone transducer effects on speech. For the single-channel telephone corpus STC-TIMIT (LDC2008S03), the TIMIT recordings were sent through a real and, in contrast to NTIMIT, single telephone channel." -- LDC catalogue.  aSystem requirements: DVD drive; web browser; other requirements not specified.  aEnglish.  a48 0aEnglish languagexSpoken EnglishxData processingvDatabases. 0aSpeech perceptionxData processing.1 aFingscheidt, Tim,d1966-2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.0 aTIMIT acoustic-phonetic continuous speech corpus. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2010S02.4 3For additional information on data files, see the LDC website.uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2010S02  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2English  aZ0bUAB  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2010S02wLCc1i0162028595195lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu4/14/2010xDATABASE02131cmm  2200409Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350027001200350017001470400018001640900036001822450060002182600062002783000026003403360026003663370026003924900030004185000128004485000021005765000027005975000137006245200495007615960007012566500049012637000023013127100032013358300031013678560139013989480035015379900018015729940012015909990119016024614349OCoLC20100426173028.0co ng|---uu|||100426s2010    pau        d        ara d  a1585635448  a9781585635443  a(Sirsi) i9781585635443  aocn609429989  aUABcUABdUAB  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2010T08bAEU00aArabic treebank.nPart 3, v 3.2h[electronic resource].  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2010.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2010T08  a"Authors: Mohamed Maamouri, Ann Bies, Seth Kulick, Sondos Krouna, Fatma Gaddeche, Wajdi Zaghouani" -- LDC online catalogue.  aData type: Text.  aData source: Newswire.  aApplications: automatic content extraction, cross-lingual information retrieval, information detection, natural language processing.  a"It consists of 599 distinct newswire stories from the Lebanese publication An Nahar with part-of-speech (POS), morphology, gloss and syntactic treebank annotation in accordance with the Penn Arabic treebank (PATB) guidelines developed in 2008 and 2009.

SpatialML is a mark-up language for representing spatial expressions in natural language documents. SpatialML focuses is on geography and culturally-relevant landmarks, rather than biology, cosmology, geology, or other regions of the spatial language domain. The goal is to allow for better integration of text collections with resources such as databases that provide spatial information about a domain, including gazetteers, physical feature databases and mapping services." -- LDC online catalogue.  a48 0aContent analysis (Communication) 0aComputational linguistics. 0aChinese languagexData processingvDatabases.1 aWang, Xiaoman.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.2 aMitre Corporation. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2010T09.4 zFor additional information on data files, see the LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2010T09.  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2Chinese.  aZ0bUAB  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2010T09wLCc1i0162028344230lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/25/2010xDATABASE02375cmm  2200541Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350027001200350017001470400018001640660007001820900019001890900036002082450048002442600062002923000026003543360026003803370026004064900030004325000027004625000018004895000102005075000021006095000083006305000200007135200202009135460039011155960007011546500036011616500033011976510058012306510055012887000020013437000016013637100034013797100032014138300031014458560135014768800038016119480035016499900018016849940012017029990119017144667363OCoLC20100712130537.0co cg|||||||||100708s2010    pau        d        chi d  a1585635421  a9781585635429  a(Sirsi) i9781585635429  aocn646367669  aCVUcCVUdUAB  c$1  aD860b.C5 2010  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2010T07bAEU00aChinese treebank 7.0h[electronic resource]  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2010.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2010T07  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2010T07."  aAuthors: "Martha Palmer, Mitch Marcus, Tony Kroch, Nianwen Xue, Fu-Dong Chiou." -- LDC catalogue.  aData type: Text.  aData sources: Broadcast conversation, broadcast news, news magazine, newswire.  aIncludes text from the following genres and sources: newswire (Xinhua), news magazine (Sinorama), broadcast news (CBS, CNR, CTS, CCTV, VOM), and broadcast conversation (CCTV, CNN, MSNBC, Phoenix)  a"Chinese treebank 7.0 consists of 840,000 words of annotated and parsed text from Chinese newswire, magazine news, and various broadcast news and broadcast conversation programs." -- LDC catalogue.  aMandarin Chinese, Taiwan Mandarin.  a48 0aForeign newszChinavDatabases. 0aChinese languagevDatabases. 0aChinaxPolitics and governmenty1976-2002vDatabases. 0aChinaxPolitics and governmenty2002- vDatabases.1 aPalmer, Martha.1 aGuang, Hua.2 6880-01aXin hua tong xun she.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2010T07.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC website:uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2010T072 6710-01/(3a$1!Be'U<!\('X@!Na(B.  hHELD BY UAB - 1 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2Chinese  aZ0bUAB  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2010T07wLCc1i0162028379020lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu7/13/2010xDATABASE02745cmm  2200493Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350027001200350017001470400018001640410018001820900021002000900036002212450083002572600062003403000026004023360026004283370026004544900030004805000027005105000018005375000047005555000021006025000027006235200932006505460033015825960007016156500025016226500053016476500054017007100058017547100039018127100032018518300031018838560135019149480035020499900036020849940012021209990119021324667366OCoLC20100712134034.0co nga||||||||100708s2010    pau        d        eng d  a1585635499  a9781585635498  a(Sirsi) i9781585635498  aocn646367060  aCVUcCVUdUAB0 aengaaraachi  aP308b.N565 2010  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2010T11bAEU00aNIST 2003 open machine translation (OpenMT) evaluationh[electronic resource].  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2010.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2010T11  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2010T11".  aAuthor: NIST Multimodal Information Group.  aData type: Text.  aData source: Newswire.  a"A package containing source data, reference translations, and scoring software used in the NIST 2003 OpenMT evaluation.

SAMA 3.1 is based on, and updates, Buckwalter Arabic morphological analyzer (BAMA) 2.0 (LDC2004L02), which was developed by Tim Buckwalter. Since this is the first public release of SAMA, it has been numbered continuously to reflect the continuity between this release and previous BAMA releases. SAMA 3.1 is a software tool for the morphological analysis of standard Arabic. SAMA 3.1 considers each Arabic word token in all possible 'prefix-stem-suffix' segmentations, and lists all known/possible annotation solutions, with assignment of all diacritic marks, morpheme boundaries (separating clitics and inflectional morphemes from stems), and all part-of-speech (POS) labels and glosses for each morpheme segment. The generated output may then be reviewed by users, and the most appropriate annotation selected from among several choices." -- LDC online catalogue.  a48 0aMachine translating. 0aArabic languagexData processing.1 aMaamouri, Mohamed.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.0 aBuckwalter Arabic morphological analyzer. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2010L01.42zFor additional information on data files, see LDC website.uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2010L01  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2Arabic.  aZ0bUAB  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2010L01wLCc1i0162028695334lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu8/9/2010xDATABASE03249cmm  2200457Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350027001200350017001470400018001640490009001820900036001912450057002272600062002843000027003463360026003733370026003994900030004255000027004555000023004825000035005055000018005405000057005585201588006155960007022036500058022106500051022686500046023196500036023657000023024017100032024248300031024568560139024879480035026269940012026619990118026734743939OCoLC20100903170250.0co nga---uu|||100903s2010    pau        d        zxx d  a158563557X  a9781585635573  a(Sirsi) i9781585635573  aocn660847751  aUABcUABdUAB  aUABA  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2010S05bAEU00aAsian elephant vocalizationsh[electronic resource].  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2010.  a6 DVD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2010S05  aTitle from disc label.  aData type: Speech.  aData source: Field recordings.  a"LDC2010S05".  a"Authors: Shermin de Silva" -- LDC online catalogue.  a"... consists of 57.5 hours of audio recordings of vocalizations by Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in the Uda Walawe National Park, Sri Lanka, of which 31.25 hours have been annotated. Voice recording field notes were made by Shermin de Silva and Ashoka Ranjeewa, of the Uda Walawe Elephant Research Project. The collection and annotation of the recordings was conducted and overseen by Shermin de Silva, through the University of Pennsylvania Department of Biology, and Institute for Research in Cognitive Science. The recordings primarily feature adult female, and juvenile elephants. Existing knowledge of acoustic communication in elephants is based mostly on African species (Loxodonta africana and Loxodonta cyclotis). There has been comparatively less study of communication in Asian elephants, primarily because the habitat in which Asian elephants typically live makes them more difficult to study than African forest elephants. For other current elephant vocalization research, see 'Elephant voices' and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Elephant Listening Project. This corpus is intended to enable researchers in acoustic communication to evaluate acoustic features and repertoire diversity of the recorded population. Of particular interest is whether there may be regional dialects that differ among Asian elephant populations in the wild and in captivity. A second interest is in whether structural commonalities exist between this and other species that shed light on underlying social and ecological factors shaping communication systems." -- LDC online catalogue.  a48 0aAsiatic elephantxVocalizationzSri LankavDatabases. 0aElephantsxVocalizationzSri LankavDatabases. 0aElephantsxVocalizationzAsiavDatabases. 0aAnimal soundszAsiavDatabases.1 aDe Silva, Shermin.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2010S05.4 3For additional information on data files, see the LDC website.uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2010S05  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  aZ0bUAB  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2010S05wLCc1i0162028733598lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu9/7/2010xDATABASE02097cmm  2200481Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350027001200350017001470400018001640410013001820490009001950900036002042450083002402600062003233000026003853360026004113370026004374900045004635000027005085000018005355000067005535000027006205200306006475460033009535960007009866500025009936500053010186500054010717100058011257100032011837100039012158300031012548560139012859480035014249900026014599940012014859990118014974743949OCoLC20100903172633.0co ngu|uu|||||100903s2010    pau        d        ara d  a1585635561  a9781585635566  a(Sirsi) i9781585635566  aocn660419911  aCVUcUABdUAB0 aaraachi  aUABA  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2010T14bAEU00aNIST 2005 open machine translation (OpenMT) evaluationh[electronic resource].  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2010.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLinguistic Data Consortium ;vLDC2010T14  aTitle from disc label.  a"LDC2010T14".  a"Authors: NIST Multimodal Information Group" -- LDC catalogue.  aData source: Newswire.  a"Consists of 100 Arabic newswire documents, 100 Chinese newswire documents, and a corresponding set of four separate human expert reference translations.

Sentences of the Czech translation were automatically morphologically annotated and parsed into two levels (analytical and tectogrammatical) of dependency structures introduced in the theory of Functional Generative Description and closely related to the Prague Dependency Treebank project. The original English sentences were transformed from the Penn Treebank phrase-structure trees into dependency representations. A heldout (development and evaluation) set of 515 sentence pairs was selected and manually annotated on tectogrammatical level in both Czech and English; for the purposes of quantitative evaluation, this set has been retranslated from Czech into English by 4 different translation companies. PCEDT 1.0 also contains a parallel Czech-English corpus of plain text from Reader's Digest 1993-1996 consisting of 53,000 parallel sentences, and a large monolingual corpus of Czech (2.4 M sentences). The included Czech-English translation dictionary consists of 46,150 translation pairs in its lemmatized version and 496,673 pairs of word forms, where for each entry-translation pair all corresponding word form pairs have been generated.

It contains approximately 375 hours of interviews from 784 interviewees along with transcripts and other documentation.... Inspired by his experience making Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg established the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation in 1994 to gather video testimonies from survivors and other witnesses of the Holocaust.... The goal of the MALACH project was to develop methods for improved access to large multitnational spoken archives; the focus was advancing the state of the art of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and information retrieval. The characteristics of the USC-SFI collection -- unconstrained, natural speech filled with disfluencies, heavy accents, age-related coarticulations, un-cued speaker and language switching and emotional speech -- were considered well-suited for that task." -- LDC online catalogue.  a4820aSurvivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation. 0aHolocaust, Jewish (1939-1945)vPersonal narrativesvDatabases. 0aHolocaust survivorsvDatabases. 0aSpeech perceptionvDatabases. 0aSociolinguistics. 0aOral communicationxArchival resources.1 aRamabhadran, Bhuvana.2 aUSC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education.2 aLinguistic Data Consortium. 0aLDC corpora ;vLDC2012S05.4 3For additional information on data files, see the LDC websiteuhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2012S05  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2English  aZ0bUAB  aocn793397474  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2012S05wLCc1i0162031000571lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/14/2012xDATABASE02100cmm  2200517Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350027001200350017001470400018001640410013001820490009001950900036002042450060002402460045003002600063003453000026004083360026004343370026004605000044004865000027005305000036005575000021005935000028006145000062006425000018007045200219007225460028009415960007009696500050009766500050010266500042010767000024011187100032011427110059011748560139012339480035013729900027014079940012014340790017014469990119014635576334OCoLC20120510175626.0co ugu---uu|||120510s2012    pau        d        eng d  a1585636118  a9781585636112  a(Sirsi) i9781585636112  aocn793401384  aUABcUABdUAB0 achiaeng  aUABA  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2012T04bAEU00a2009 CoNLL shared task.nPart 2h[electronic resource].30aCoNLL shared taskh[electronic resource]  a[Philadelphia, Pa.] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2012.  a1 CD-ROM ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aLinguistic Data Consortium ; LDC2012T04  aTitle from disc label.  aAuthors: Jan Hajic and others.  aData type: Text.  aData sources: Newswire.  aApplications: Semantic role labelling, syntactic parsing.  a"LDC2012T04".  a"... contains the Chinese and English trial corpora, training corpora, development and test data for the 2009 CoNLL (Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning) shared task evaluation." -- LDC catalogue.  aIn Chinese and English.  a48 0aChinese languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aEnglish languagexData processingvDatabases. 0aComputational linguisticsvDatabases.1 aHajic, Jan,d1960-2 aLinguistic Data Consortium.2 aConference on Computational Natural Language Learning.4 3For additional information on data files, see the LDC website.uhttp://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2012T04  hHELD BY UAB - 0 OTHER HOLDINGS  1OLAC2Chinese2English  aZ0bUAB  aocn793401384  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2012T04wLCc1i0162031000639lDATA_REFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu5/14/2012xDATABASE02118cmm  2200481Ia 45000010008000000030006000080050017000140070015000310080041000460200015000870200018001020350027001200350017001470400018001640490009001820900036001911000022002272450074002492600062003233000024003853360026004093370026004354900030004615000027004915000029005185000033005475000037005805000018006175000029006355200467006645960007011316500033011386500034011717100030012057100032012358300031012678560138012989480035014369900018014719940012014890790017015019990118015185601797OCoLC20120606150147.0co nga---uu|||120606s2012    pau        d        tur d  a1585636142  a9781585636143  a(Sirsi) i9781585636143  aocn794855864  aUABcUABdUAB  aUABA  aDATA LIB 00840 LDC 2012S06bAEU1 aSaraclar, Murat.10aTurkish broadcast news speech and transcriptsh[electronic resource].  a[Philadelphia, PA] :bLinguistic Data Consortium,cc2012.  a4 DVDs ;c4 3/4 in.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia1 aLDC corpora ;vLDC2012S06  aTitle from disc label.  aData type: Speech, text.  aData source: Broadcast news.  aApplication: Speech recognition.  a"LDC2012S06".  aAuthor: Murat Saraclar.  a"Turkish broadcast news speech and transcripts was developed by Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey and contains approximatley 130 hours of Voice of America (VOA) Turkish radio broadcasts and corresponding transcripts.

The objective of the OpenMT evaluation series is to support research in, and help advance the state of the art of, machine translation (MT) technologies -- technologies that translate text between human languages. Input may include all forms of text. The goal is for the output to be an adequate and fluent translation of the original.
