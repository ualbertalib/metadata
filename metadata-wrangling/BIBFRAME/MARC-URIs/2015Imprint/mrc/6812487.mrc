Their unique stories reveal African Americans fighting for an alternative economic and civil rights movement--even as the Republican Party appeared increasingly hostile to that very idea. Black party members attempted to influence the direction of conservatism--not to destroy it, but rather to expand the ideology to include Black needs and interests. As racial minorities in their political party and as political minorities within their community, Black Republicans occupied an irreconcilable position--they were shunned by African American communities and subordinated by the GOP. In response, black Republicans vocally, and at times viciously, critiqued members of their race and party, in an effort to shape the attitudes and public images of black citizens and the GOP. And yet, there was also a measure of irony to Black Republicans' 'loneliness': at various points, factions of the Republican Party, such as the Nixon administration, instituted some of the policies and programs offered by black party members. What's more, black Republican initiatives, such as the fair housing legislation of senator Edward Brooke, sometimes garnered support from outside the Republican Party, especially among the black press, Democratic officials, and constituents of all races. Moving beyond traditional liberalism and conservatism, Black Republicans sought to address African American racial experiences in a distinctly Republican way.The Loneliness of the Black Republican provides a new understanding of the interaction between African Americans and the Republican Party, and the seemingly incongruous intersection of civil rights and American conservatism"--cProvided by publisher.  a1620aRepublican Party (U.S. : 1854- )xHistoryy20th century. 0aAfrican AmericansxPolitics and governmenty20th century. 0aAfrican American politiciansxHistoryy20th century. 0aAfrican American political activistsxHistoryy20th century. 0aConservatismzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aPolitics, PracticalzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aPower (Social sciences)zUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1933-1945. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1945-1989. 0aPolitics and society in twentieth-century America.  aE 185.615 W795 2015hUAAU-Bi0162035245206  aE 185.615 W795 2015wLCc1i0162034579142d12/7/2016e3/2/2015lON_SHELFmUAAUGn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/26/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n80067040
