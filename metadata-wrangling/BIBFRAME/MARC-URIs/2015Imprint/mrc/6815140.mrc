The book opens with a review of the criticisms that have emerged about the prevalence of Catholic schools within the state system and, indeed, about the very notion of there being such a thing as 'Catholic education'. The author then goes on to survey official Church teaching on education and the work of key Catholic thinkers, Newman and Maritain, before moving on to discuss the writings of Karl Rahner, a leading twentieth century theologian. A Theory of Catholic Education argues that Rahner's approach, with his focus on the place of mystery in human experience, provides a way forward. Ultimately, Whittle demonstrates how Catholic theology can offer a unique and much needed theory of education"--cProvided by publisher.  a4920aCatholic ChurchxEducation.20aCatholic ChurchxDoctrines.  aLC 473 W55 2015wLCc1i0160000520769d9/13/2016e9/1/2016lON_SHELFmUASJCn5rYsYtBOOKu3/6/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79041716
