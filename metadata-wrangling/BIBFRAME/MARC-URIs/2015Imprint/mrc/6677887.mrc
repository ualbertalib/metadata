Toward the goal of helping educators make connections between beliefs and philosophies and practice, it includes stories or extended vignettes from a variety of classrooms that highlight how teachers and programs are integrating guiding principles and beliefs into applied practice. A resource for those beginning or continuing a reflective journey on the evolving path of defining and reshaping an educator's own practice with children and families, it encourages educators to go forth and find a voice that will be used to advocate on behalf of all children and families. Now also available as a Pearson Video-Enhanced eText, this new edition reflects recent changes in early care and education practice based on legislative and policy changes, as well as the latest research on effective practice. Included are contextualized videos, Learning Outcomes, streamlined summaries, additional charts and graphic features, coverage of evidence-based practice and Common Core State Standards, and some important content changes that bring the material up-to-date and in step with today's latest information in the field.  a21 0aEarly childhood education. 0aChild development.  aLB 1139.23 F66 2015wLCc1i33333001199922d3/14/2017e2/17/2017lCURRICULUMmCONCORDIAn1rYsYtCURR_BOOKu1/5/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2006039705bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/36343926
