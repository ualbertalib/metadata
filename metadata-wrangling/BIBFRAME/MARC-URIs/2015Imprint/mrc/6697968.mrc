The term substance misuse is a general term to describe the misuse of drugs. All drugs (those legally obtained or prescribed and those illegally supplied) including alcohol and tobacco have the potential for being misused. Individuals may use drugs occasionally (so-called 'recreational' use), for example at weekends, or may become addicted to, and dependent upon, certain drugs. Drugs can affect all aspects of life including home, relationships, school, college, university, employment, sporting and personal life. The effects of drugs on individuals or institutions are frequently highlighted in news stories, often coated with a veneer of excitement, daring or glamour. This can be very misleading. Unfortunately, whether drug use is recreational, or results in dependence or addiction, each drug will have physical or psychological effects, or a combination of both. Some of these effects may appear positive - e.g. a temporary feeling of well-being and some individuals may be lucky enough to use drugs without any adverse consequences. However for many drug users, adverse consequences are frequently seen, and such effects may be prolonged or fatal, may affect the ability to maintain or seek employment, to travel, and may result in a criminal record. The undesirable and unwanted effects differ from drug to drug. Individuals may describe physical or psychological effects that they feel or experience - these are 'symptoms', or others may see or observe physical effects - these are 'signs'"--cProvided by publisher.  a8 29 0aSubstance abuse.12aSubstance-Related DisordersxdiagnosisvHandbooks.22aPrescription Drug MisusevHandbooks.22aSubstance-Related DisordersxtherapyvHandbooks.1 aPayne-James, Jason,eauthor.1 aScott-Ham, Michael,eauthor.  bPSWfQGMhGMCT-OS-Bp28.12q1z9781444181746  hGMCT-OS-B  aRC 564 S74 2015wLCc1i34917001371140d3/8/2016lON_SHELFmKEYANOp$30.35q1rYsYtBOOKu9/26/2014o.STAFF.
