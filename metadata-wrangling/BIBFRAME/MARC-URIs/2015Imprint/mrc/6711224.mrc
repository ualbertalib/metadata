As compared to the corporate sector, higher education institutions have been slow to implement policies aimed at fostering diversity and a healthy work-life balance, which can result in lower morale, job satisfaction, and productivity, and causes poor recruitment and retention. Based on extensive research, this book argues that an effective organizational culture is one in which managers and supervisors recognize that professional and personal lives are not mutually exclusive. With concrete guidelines, recommendations, techniques, and additional resources throughout, this book outlines best practices for creating a beneficial work-life culture on campus, and documents cases of supportive department chairs and administrators. A necessary guide for higher education leaders, this book will inform administrators about how they can foster positive work-life cultures in their departments and institutions"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aUniversities and collegeszUnited StatesxAdministration. 0aEducation, HigherzUnited StatesxAdministration. 0aCollege teachersxProfessional relationshipszUnited States. 0aCollege teachersxWorkloadzUnited States. 0aCollege teachersxFamily relationshipszUnited States. 0aCollege teachersxJob satisfactionzUnited States.1 aWilson, Cheryl A.,eauthor.  aLB 2341 B713 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035170388  aLB 2341 B713 2015wLCc1i0162035170388d1/30/2017e1/30/2017kCHECKEDOUTlFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn3p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu10/22/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014022761bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/308230399
