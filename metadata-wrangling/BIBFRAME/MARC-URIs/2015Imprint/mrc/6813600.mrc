Growth has slowed. Volatility has increased and the world is more global. Brands are defined by innovation and services. Supply chain excellence matters more than ever. It makes a difference in corporate performance. One cannot snap their fingers and deliver supply chain success. It happens over the course of many years. It is measured in inches not miles. In this book, the author evaluates the progress of over a hundred companies in twenty-two industries in five value networks over the period of 2010-2012.Success drives value. The effective supply chain makes a difference in winning a war, saving a patient, and driving commerce; but it also makes a difference in a community having clean air, potable water, and a standard of living. Mistakes are hard to overcome. Supply Chain Metrics that Matter tells this story. The book links corporate financials to supply chain maturity. In the book, the author analyzes which metrics matter. She does this by interviewing over sixty-five industry experts and correlating twenty-two financial ratios to six years of market capitalization data. The author Lora M. Cecere is a supply chain researcher as well as an authority in supply chain technology. She helps companies gain first mover advantage. In the book, Cecere provides concrete, actionable steps to align and balance the supply chain to drive value. The book explores the crossover between supply chain efficiency and financial growth with topics such as: Outlining the metrics that matter, the metrics that don't Progress in industry sub-segment in improving inventory, cash, productivity and margin The supply chain's role in improving market capitalization The management techniques that improve performance Sharing insights on how metrics change as the supply chain matures The roadmap to improve performance. Today, supply chains are global and dynamic. They are rapidly evolving. Companies that constantly seek out new solutions and opportunities for improvement drive differentiation. In a market where growth is stalled and one out of nine companies are stuck in driving supply chain performance, this book provides a clear, concise framework for a more modern, effective supply chain"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aBusiness logistics.08iOnline version:aCecere, Lora M.tSupply chain metrics that matterdHoboken, New Jersey : Wiley, 2015z9781118938980w(DLC) 2014045948 0aWiley corporate F & A.423Cover imageuhttp://catalogimages.wiley.com/images/db/jimages/9781118858110.jpg  aHD38.5 .C345 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007401415p73.19kAVAIL_SOON  aHD38.5 .C345 2015wLCc1i1007401415d3/12/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$69.70rYsYtBOOKu3/3/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2012066016bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/273856890
