In some respects, the U.S. PCAOB and ISA are similar, but in other ways they are not. In this book, we describe key differences between PCAOB auditing standards and ISA. Our goal in doing so is to provide students, managers, and researchers with a clear, concise guide to the major differences between PCAOB and ISA standards. Understanding these differences will provide the reader with a greater appreciation of the differences in the auditing process between nations, and a greater understanding of what the audit opinion means as issued in different parts of the world.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on January 27, 2015).  a4420aPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board.00aInternational standard on auditing. 0aAuditingxStandardszUnited States.1 aKleinman, Gary.,eauthor. 0aFinancial accounting and auditing collection.x2151-2817403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=11007941  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6813102-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/27/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/210360911
