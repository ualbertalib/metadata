At its best, such representations can reach a very high level of expressiveness and usefulness, an ideal we refer to as Knowledge Art. Achieving that level requires effective engagement, often aided by facilitators or other practitioners. Most PD research focuses on tools and methods, or on participant experience. The next source of advantage is to better illuminate the role of practitioners--the people working with participants, tools, and methods in service of a project's larger goals. Just like participants, practitioners experience challenges, interactions, and setbacks, and come up with creative ways to address them while maintaining their stance of service to participants and stakeholders. Our research interest is in understanding what moves and choices practitioners make that either help or hinder participants' engagement with representations. We present a theoretical framework that looks at these choices from the experiential perspectives of narrative, aesthetics, ethics, sensemaking and improvisation and apply it to five diverse case studies of actual practice.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on November 19, 2014).  a44 0aUser-centered system design. 0aKnowledge representation (Information theory)1 aBuckingham Shum, Simon J.,eauthor. 0aSynthesis digital library of engineering and computer science. 0aSynthesis lectures on human-centered informatics ;v# 23.x1946-7699403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2200/S00593ED1V01Y201408HCI023  hUAINzSYNTHDIG  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6742013-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu11/25/2014xE-BOOKzSYNTHDIG01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb2002082178bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/269754986
