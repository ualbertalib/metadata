It explores the core principles that drive advertising, using a lively voice that goes beyond academic theory. The authors' goal was to present advertising as it is actually practiced and make the fundamentals accessible and relevant to the student's "real life." This approach truly transcends the conceptual and propels students into an exciting and practical dimension." --cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aAdvertising.1 aSchaefer, David H.1 aWeigold, Michael F.,d1958-  aHF5821 .A74 A48 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007410705p102.62kAVAIL_SOON  aHF5821 .A74 A48 2015wLCc1i1007410705d7/5/2016e6/25/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn1p$102.62q1rYsYtBOOKu4/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2007000453bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/24042155
