The research for this book is informed by interviews with key stakeholders in ten countries and extensive engagement with policy makers and international agencies. It analyses the ways in which governments are able to direct or at least influence these cross-border movements in higher education. The book explores key issues that national governments are invariably required to contend with in an increasingly globalised higher education market, as well as the policy options available to them in such a climate. Alongside this, there is analysis into why states adopt particular approaches, with critical assessment of their varying success. Key topics include: the political economy of international higher education;recruiting students;promoting and regulating transnational provision; student migration;governing educational imports; managing the outflow of students; the regulated market.This book will be a valuable and insightful resource for those involved in higher education policy and interested in the globalisation of the higher education market"--cProvided by publisher.  a"Governing Cross-Border Higher Education examines the role of governments in relation to three key aspects of international education: student mobility; migration of international students; and transnational provision through collaboration or branch campuses.
