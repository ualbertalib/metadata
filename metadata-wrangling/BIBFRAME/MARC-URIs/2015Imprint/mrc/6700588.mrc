Through a wide variety of ethnic experiences ranging from the Transatlantic, Asian American, Latino/a and Caribbean alongside their corresponding forms of displacement - political exile, war trauma, and economic migration - the essays in this collection connect the intimate experience of the returning subject to multiple locations, historical experiences, inter-subjective relations, and cultural interactions. They challenge the idea of the narrative of return as a journey back to the untouched roots and home that the ethnic subject left behind. Their diacritical approach combines, on the one hand, a sensitivity to the context and structural elements of modern diaspora; and on the other, an analysis of the individual psychological processes inherent to the experience of displacement and return such as nostalgia, memory and belonging. In the narratives of return analyzed in this volume, space and identity are never static or easily definable; rather, they are in-process and subject to change as they are always entangled in the historical and inter-subjective relations ensuing from displacement and mobility. This book will interest students and scholars who wish to further explore the role of American literature within current debates on globalization, migration, and ethnicity"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 0aAmerican literaturexHistory and criticismxTheory, etc. 0aIdentity (Psychology) in literature. 0aReturn in literature. 0aAmerican literaturexMinority authorsxHistory and criticism. 0aDisplacement (Psychology) in literature.1 aOliver-Rotger, Maria Antònia,eeditor of compilation. 0aRoutledge transnational perspectives on American literature ;v23.  aPS 217 I35 I35 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035162138  aPS 217 I35 I35 2015wLCc1i0162035162138d10/24/2014e10/6/2014lON_SHELFmUAAUGn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu10/1/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2004002931bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/42080624
