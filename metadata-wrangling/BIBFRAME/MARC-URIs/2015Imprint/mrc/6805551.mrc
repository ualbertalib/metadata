Drawing on a range of interdisciplinary perspectives, this volume takes up the challenge to provide a framework for the effective implementation of simple concepts into complex ecosystem-related decision-making. Addressing the measurement, valuation and governance of ecosystem services, the book is specifically designed to guide students and policy-makers from definitions and measurements to applications in terms of policy instruments and governance arrangements. Each chapter discusses key methodological approaches, illustrating their applications at various scales by drawing on case studies from around the world. Presenting a range of perspectives from across many fields, this text ultimately considers the crucial question of how ecosystem service delivery can be safeguarded for generations to come"--cProvided by publisher.  a"Ecosystem services are hot, and they have been hot for a while. In 1998, Costanza et al. published their famous article about the societal value produced by ecosystems through ecosystem service delivery, an article which at the time this introduction was written was cited more than 10,000 times. In 2005, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) framed the need to protect biodiversity and the world's ecosystems in terms of ecosystem services (MA 2005)"--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a44 0aEcosystem services.1 aBouma, Jetske A.1 aBeukering, Pieter van.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107477612  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6805551-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/17/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/75924368
