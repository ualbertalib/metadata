The Age of Reason and the Enlightenment led theorists to apply scientific reasoning to the non-scientific disciplines of politics, economics, and moral philosophy. Instead of relying on the woodcuts of dissected bodies in old medical texts, physicians opened bodies themselves to see what was there; instead of divining truth through the authority of an ancient holy book or philosophical treatise, people began to explore the book of nature for themselves through travel and exploration; instead of the supernatural belief in the divine right of kings, people employed a natural belief in the right of democracy. In this provocative and compelling book, Shermer will explain how abstract reasoning, rationality, empiricism, skepticism--scientific ways of thinking--have profoundly changed the way we perceive morality and, indeed, move us ever closer to a more just world"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 43 0aSciencexMoral and ethical aspectsxHistory. 0aSciencexSocial aspectsxHistory.  aBJ 57 S48 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035241916  aBJ 57 S48 2015wLCc1i0162035241916d4/4/2016e3/11/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSn4p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/26/2015  aBJ57 .S48 2015wLCc1i1007403643d3/20/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$37.08rYsYtBOOKu3/16/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n85018913bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/298626666
