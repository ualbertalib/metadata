The Oregon Shakespeare Festival is bringing in lots of tourists looking for some crumpets to go with their heroic couplets. But when one of Torte's customers turns up dead, there's much ado about murder... The victim is Nancy Hudson, the festival's newest board member. A modern-day Lady Macbeth, Nancy has given more than a few actors and artists enough reasons to kill her... but still. The silver lining? Jules's high school sweetheart, Thomas, is the investigator on the case. His flirtations are as delicious as ever, and Jules can't help but want to have her cake and eat it too. But will she have her just desserts? Murder might be bad for business, but love is the sweetest treat of all..."--Back cover.  a3 0aBakery employeesvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aBakersvFiction. 0aFamily-owned business enterprisesvFiction. 0aOregonvFiction.1 aAlexander, Ellie.tBakeshop mystery  aMystery ALEwASISc1i33862001356462lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINp$7.49rYsYtPAPERBACKu3/23/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2015002193bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/313298737
