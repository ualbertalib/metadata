Through reference to his entire oeuvre, his published literary criticism, and his private conversations, letters and manuscripts, it seeks to understand the extent to which Whitman experienced the anxiety of influence as he sought to establish himself as America's poet-prophet or bard (and the extent to which he sought to conceal such influence).  aDescription based on online resource; title from home page (viewed on December 10, 2014).  a4410aWhitman, Walt,d1819-1892xKnowledgexLiterature. 0aInfluence (Literary, artistic, etc.)403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199374410.001.0001z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzUPSO  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6799788-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/6/2015xE-BOOKzUPSO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79081476bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/2478331
