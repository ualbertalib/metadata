The book provides undergraduate and graduate biology students with the tools needed to make sense of the array of specific pathways used by the cell to communicate. As each concept is explained, numerous examples derived from known signaling mechanisms are used to illustrate the key points. It describes basic signaling mechanisms such as protein interactions, changes in enzyme activity, post-translational modifications, subcellular localization of signaling molecules, and small diffusible signaling mediators. The book also explores the components of signaling pathways and how they are "wired" into pathways and circuits that can process information. The book concludes with a unique chapter that presents extended examples in which specific problems encountered in signaling are introduced and solved, followed by a chapter on methods"--cProvided by publisher.  a42 0aCell interactionvTextbooks. 0aCellular signal transductionvTextbooks.1 aMayer, Bruce,eauthor.1 aPawson, T.,eauthor.  aQH 604.2 L56 2015c1hUAHL-Bi0162035178944  aQH 604.2 L56 2015wLCc1i0162035178944d7/12/2016e1/27/2016lON_SHELFmUAHLTHSCn6p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu8/11/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n96117737bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/66763938
