The Critical Role of Parenting in Human Development surprises readers with the realization that the way we were parented in childhood impacts nearly every aspect of our lives. Based in part on cutting-edge research using MRI and fMRI technologies demonstrating that the brains of those traumatized in childhood are essentially different, the book explains that our brain development during our earliest years and in the womb is fundamental to the lives we lead.It covers attachment theory, the impact of corporal punishment on the brain, the effects of emotional abuse and neglect, and the widespread nature of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, describing the process that leads to the transmission of parenting patterns through the generations and explaining how resulting personal issues recur throughout the lifespan. The Critical Role of Parenting in Human Development also examines laws and policies that impact parenting in our culture, making a case for their importance, and describes the effect of childrearing on various aspects of human life, including relationships, crime and violence, economics, mental and physical health, addiction, education, and career issues, among others. Interdisciplinary in nature, this book is a much-needed resource for professionals and students in the psychology, psychotherapy, social work, and related mental health and child welfare fields"--cProvided by publisher.  a"The importance of parenting is immense yet undervalued in many Western cultures. As child welfare advocates and mental health professionals know, the first years of life have a tremendous impact on our adult selves, and negative parenting practices, such as corporal punishment, emotional abuse, and neglect, are now shown to have long-lasting effects on an individual's biological, psychological, and emotional development"--cProvided by publisher.  a3 16 0aParent and child. 0aParentingxPsychological aspects. 0aDevelopmental psychology.1 aTravis, Adam D.,eauthor.  aBF 723 P25 K54 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035167657  aBF 723 P25 K54 2015wLCc1i0162035167657d1/18/2017e9/15/2016lON_SHELFmUAAUGn5p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu10/17/2014  a155.4 KLEwDEWEYc1i33862001343346d12/2/2016e11/21/2016lON_SHELFmNORQ_MAINn9p$42.84rYsYtBOOKu10/16/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014011995bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/306382522
