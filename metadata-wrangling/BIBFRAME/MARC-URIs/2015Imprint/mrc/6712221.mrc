With detailed high-quality photographs of musculoskeletal structures, it provides an updated review of the anatomical variations within gorillas as well as an extensive list of the synonyms used in the literature to designate the structures discussed. It will be of interest to students, teachers, and researchers studying primatology, comparative anatomy, functional morphology, zoology, and physical anthropology"--cProvided by publisher.  a"Gorillas, together with chimpanzees, are our closest living relatives. This book is the first photographic and descriptive musculoskeletal atlas of a baby for any nonhuman primate species, being particularly relevant after the remarkable discovery of a 3.3 million-year-old fossilized human child at Dikika, Ethiopia ("Lucy's baby"). The book therefore adopts the same format as our photographic atlases of adult gorillas, chimpanzees, hylobatids and orangutans, which are part of a series of monographs that will set out the comparative and phylogenetic context of the gross anatomy and evolutionary history of the soft tissue morphology of modern humans and their closest relatives. As the previous books of this series, the present atlas includes detailed high-quality photographs of musculoskeletal structures from most anatomical regions of the body as well as textual information about the attachments, innervation, function and weight of the respective muscles. However, it includes additional information and photographs about the internal organs and skin, as well as CT-scans. The book will be of interest to students, teachers and researchers studying primatology, comparative anatomy, functional morphology, zoology, and physical anthropology and to medical students, doctors and researchers who are curious about the origin, evolution, homology and variations of the musculoskeletal structures of modern humans.
