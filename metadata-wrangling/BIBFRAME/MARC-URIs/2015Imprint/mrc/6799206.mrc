The communist movement manifested itself differently in each phase of India's political history and Communism continues to remain a meaningful alternative ideological discourse in India. This book examines left politics in India focusing on its rise, consolidation and relative decline in the present century. Left radicalism in India is a distinct ideological phenomenon which is articulated in two complementary ways: while the parliamentary left remains social democratic in character, its bÃªte noire, the left wing extremists, continue to uphold the classical Marxist, Leninist and Maoist notion of violent revolution. By concentrating on the nature and also activities of these two versions of left radicalism, this book is a thorough study of the phenomenon. The author analyses the states of Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura and presents a variety of case studies of communist movements. He argues that the political power of the left parties depends on the degree to which they have built organizational strength, political hegemony and a broad social base through legal and extra-parliamentary struggles. An in-depth study of socio-economic circumstances that remain critical in conceptualizing radical extremism, Left Radicalism in India will be of interest to those studying Indian Politics, South Asian History, Development Studies and Global Politics"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 0aCommunismzIndiaxHistory. 0aCommunist partieszIndiaxHistory. 0aIndiaxPolitics and governmenty21st century. 0aRoutledge contemporary South Asia series.  aHX 393.5 C34 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035229473  aHX 393.5 C34 2015wLCc1i0162035229473d4/11/2016e3/13/2016lON_SHELFmUAAUGn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n89113435bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/2522094
