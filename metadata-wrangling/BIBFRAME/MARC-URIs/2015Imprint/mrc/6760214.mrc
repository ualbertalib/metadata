Making sense of the complexities of teaching occurs primarily during the work day, and instead of relying on before or after school one-size-fits-all professional development activities, schools must support teachers in learning on -the -job. The latest book from renowned author Sally J. Zepeda is written for teachers, teacher leaders, and school and district leaders who want to support job-embedded learning, a powerful form of professional development characterized by active learning and reflection grounded in the context of a teachers' work environment. Job-Embedded Professional Development provides a framework for helping teachers stop, take a deep breath, and learn along the way as they engage in their daily work with students, fellow teachers, administrators, parents, and others"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aTeachersxIn-service training. 0aReflective teaching. 0aProfessional learning communities. 0aEye on education book.  aLB 1731 Z46 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035203742  aLB 1731 Z46 2015wLCc1i0162035203742d4/14/2015e3/26/2015lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn3p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu12/18/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n95088116bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/63259958
