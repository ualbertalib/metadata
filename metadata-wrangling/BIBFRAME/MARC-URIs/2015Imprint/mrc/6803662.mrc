As a result, one fundamental aspect of our most detailed contemporary and near-contemporary sources about magistracy has remained largely neglected: their literariness. This book takes a new approach to the representation of magistrates and shows how the rhetorical and formal features of prose texts - principally Livy's history but also works by Cicero and Sallust - shape our understanding of magistracy. Applying to the texts an expanded concept of exemplarity, Haimson Lushkov shows how a rich body of anecdotes concerning the behaviour and speech of magistrates reflects on the values and tensions that defined the republic. A variety of contexts - familial, military, and electoral, among others - flesh out the experience of being, becoming, and encountering a Roman magistrate, and the political and ethical problems highlighted and negotiated in such circumstances"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aMagistrates, Roman. 0aPolitical culturezRomexHistory. 0aRhetoricxPolitical aspectszRomexHistory. 0aRomexHistoryyRepublic, 265-30 B.C. 0aRomexPolitics and governmenty265-30 B.C.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139644303  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6803662-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/11/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/8.51146284269e+20
