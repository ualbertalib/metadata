Weaving together theory, research findings, and practical "how-to" strategies and materials, it fills an important gap by offering a clear roadmap and resources for influencing the knowledge, beliefs, and actions of faculty working with pre-service teachers. While the book has implications for policy change, most immediately, readers will feel empowered with ideas for faculty development they can implement in their own teacher education programs. Looking at both the politics and practices of teacher education and the ways in which queer issues manifest in schools, it is hopeful in suggesting that if teachers and pre-service teachers can critically reflect on homophobia and heteronormativity, they can begin to think about and relate to queer youth in a different, more positive and inclusive way. A Companion Website [http://queerinclusion.com] with additional activities and materials for teacher educators and faculty development and a practical guide enhances the usefulness of the book"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aTeachersxTraining ofzUnited States. 0aHomosexuality and educationzUnited States. 0aInclusive educationzUnited States.  aLB 1715 M776 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035203239  aLB 1715 M776 2015wLCc1i0162035203239d9/29/2016e5/26/2016lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn7p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu12/18/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2012107446bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/252548409
