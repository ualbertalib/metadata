Using examples from foster care systems in the states of Delaware, Michigan, New York, and Rhode Island, Rebecca Padot eloquently combines a rigorous methodology and theory work to expose the conditions under which foster care outcomes can be improved. The cases selected suggest that the federal government has increased its focus on measuring the performance of state programs while simultaneously decreasing its funding of state foster care programs and offering the states very little management or mentorship. Padot turns the page and recommends administrators place a greater priority on building community partners, integrating the advice of mentors, providing leadership from public managers, and cultivating relationships with the federal government.An original and timely resource for scholars and practitioners, this book represents a significant contribution to our understanding of how leadership and management variables may be associated with more positive foster care practices and performance in the United States"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aFoster home carezUnited States. 0aRoutledge research in public administration and public policy ;v12.  aHV 881 P33 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035235421  aHV 881 P33 2015wLCc1i0162035235421lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014031389bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/308755507
