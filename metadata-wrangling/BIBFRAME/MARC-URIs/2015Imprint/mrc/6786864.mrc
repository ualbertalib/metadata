But she is having a tough time providing for herself and her daughter. Writing her secret yearnings on slips of paper and sending them into the wind helps her cling to the hope that things will get better and that she can find happiness again. Jeb Sterling has no idea that the handwritten messages he finds scattered across his land are the first hints that his life is about to change. Nor does he understand why he feels so compelled to help Amanda Banning and her daughter when a cold snap leaves them temporarily homeless. Maybe he is inspired by her courage or perhaps by her beautiful brown eyes. Either way, the man who once renounced love suddenly finds himself willing to do anything for the pair. Amanda seems to have given up on her dreams, but Jeb refuses to quit until he makes her every wish come true."-- Provided by publisher.  a3 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLove stories. 0aOregonvFiction.  aRomance ANDwASISc1i33862001351752d11/8/2016e11/4/2016lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINn2p$7.50rYsYtPAPERBACKu1/22/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no92011566bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/24730724
