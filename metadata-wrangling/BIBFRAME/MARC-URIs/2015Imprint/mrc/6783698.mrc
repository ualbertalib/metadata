States attempt to nationalise it, financial centres spring up in its wake, and INGOs attempt to deal with its de-territorialising, supranational characteristics. A global adjudication system (arbitration) has been introduced to safeguard and buttress its flow. The power of Islamic capital has generated numerous sites of legal contestation and negotiation, ranging from gateway financial centres, international law firms and transnational financial institutions, all of which interact in the production of Islamic financial law (IFL). The process of producing IFL illustrates complex fields of action driven by power dynamics, neoliberal paradigms and the institutional momentum of the global economy. The municipal legal systems under study in this book (the United Kingdom, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and the Dubai International Financial Centre) illustrate globalisation's acceleration of legal, economic and social production"--cProvided by publisher.  a"Islamic Investment Co Ltd v Symphony Gems NV [2002] All ER (D) 171 (Feb), QB; [2009] EWHC 2378 (Comm), [2009] All ER (D) 07 (Oct), [2008] All ER (D) 141 (Mar), (2008) Times, 4 April, CA Law Debenture Trust Corp Plc v Elektrim Finance BV [2005] EWHC 1412 (Ch) Libyan American Oil Co v The Government of the Libyan Arab Republic [1981] 20 ILM 1 Lloyds and Scottish Finance Ltd v Prentice (1977) 121 Sol Jo 847 "--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a44 0aFinancexLaw and legislation. 0aFinance (Islamic law) 0aFinancexLaw and legislationzGreat Britain. 0aFinancexLaw and legislationzPersian Gulf States.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107447929  hUAINzCBO  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6783698-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/16/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014048623bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/310611923
