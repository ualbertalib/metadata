The Corwin Connected Educators series is your key to unlocking the greatest resource available to all educators: other educators. Using social media and web tools, you'll learn and collaborate with one another in new ways. These brief books feature strategies to use immediately, and the series website lets you connect with authors and access additional resources. Leaders will learn how smartphones and tablets can work for your goals ; the secret to getting -- and keeping -- parents involved -- how tools like Skype can connect the community at large. Being a Connected Educator is more than a set of actions: it's a belief in the potential of technology to fuel lifelong learning.  a41 0aEducational innovations. 0aCorwin connected educators series.  aLB 1027 C877 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035236338  aLB 1027 C877 2015wLCc1i0162035236338d4/20/2016e4/3/2016lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2014168566bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/313295317
