To brand yourself? These tasks  are critical to new generations entering the workforce.Robert Dickie has  served as a decorated Air Force Officer, the CEO of an international company, and  as the leader of several non-profits. He now serves as president of Crown. With  real world experience and advice from a host of industry leaders, Bob outlines seven  proven strategies for operating in our ever-changing landscape that can be translated  into a practical personal action plan to achieve results.This book is exactly  what's needed to help a new generation of adults make the leap to work that lasts  in this new economy"--cProvided by publisher. 0aCareer development. 0aCareer changes.  a33  aHF 5381 D53 2015wLCc1i0164000772248lON_SHELFmOLDSrYsYtBOOKu2/10/201501bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/233854074
