That's just fine with him, as he never had any intention of marrying the lass anyway! Yet how can he ignore the fact that once rough and tumble Winnie has become a very fashionable--and incredibly desirable--young woman ... Brawny, rugged Lachlan is nothing like the aristocratic English gentleman who pursued Winnie--with a passion--in London. Three months away were more than enough to show her a world infinitely more glamorous than untamed Scottish Highlands--and her beloved childhood crush. But now that she's decided to find a prospective husband with a bit more polish, could Lachlan finally appreciate her charms? And is it remotely possible to ignore the wild attraction she feels for him?"-- Provided by publisher.  a3 35 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aMate selectionvFiction. 0aHighlands (Scotland)xSocial life and customsy19th centuryvFiction. 0aLove stories. 0aHistorical fiction.1 aEnoch, Suzanne.tScandalous Highlanders novel.  aENOwLCc1i30125302525711lPAPERBACKSmRED_DEER_CrYsYtBOOKu3/4/2015  aRomance ENOwASISc1i33862001356124d3/10/2016e3/4/2016lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINn2p$7.49rYsYtPAPERBACKu3/23/201501bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/286627288
