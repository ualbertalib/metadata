Each major food chemical contaminant will be discussed for toxic effects and the biological mechanisms behind their toxicity. Their absorption and distribution profiles and the factors influencing their levels in foods will be discussed. In addition, a listing of commonly used analytical techniques in food safety chemistry will make the book useful for food scientists and nutritionists"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aFood adulteration and inspection. 0aFood contamination. 0aFoodxAnalysis. 0aFoodxMicrobiology.1 aYu, Liangli,eeditor.1 aWang, Shuo,d1969-eeditor.1 aSun, Baoguo,d1961-eeditor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781466597952z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6748944-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu12/2/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014053163bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/310615579
