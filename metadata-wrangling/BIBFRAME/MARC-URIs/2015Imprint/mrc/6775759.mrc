Aristippus wasn't convinced. Instead, he and his followers espoused the most radical form of hedonism in ancient Western philosophy. Before the rise of the better known but comparatively ascetic Epicureans, the Cyrenaics pursued a way of life in which moments of pleasure, particularly bodily pleasure, held the highest value. In The Birth of Hedonism, Kurt Lampe provides the most comprehensive account in any language of Cyrenaic ideas and behavior, revolutionizing the understanding of this neglected but important school of philosophy.  a16 0aHedonism. 0aCyrenaics (Greek philosophy)  aB 279 L36 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035220472  aB 279 L36 2015wLCc1i0162034576932lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2013070070bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/305445106
