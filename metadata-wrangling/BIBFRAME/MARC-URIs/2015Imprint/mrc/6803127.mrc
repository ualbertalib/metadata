'The environment' may not have existed as a notion then, yet practices of re-use and transformation obviously shaped the early-modern world. Still, this period of booming commerce and exchange was also marked by scarcity and want. This book reveals the fascinating variety and ingenuity of recycling processes that may be observed in the commerce, crafts, literature, and medicine of the eighteenth century. Recycling is used as a thought-provoking means to revisit subjects such as consumption, the new science, or novel writing, and cast them in a new light where the waste of some becomes the luxury of others, clothes worn to rags are turned into paper and into books, and scientific breakthroughs are carried out in old kitchen pans"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 0aRecycling (Waste, etc.)xHistoryy18th century. 0aMaterial culturexHistoryy18th century. 0aSecondhand tradexHistoryy18th century. 0aSocial historyy18th century. 0aEconomic historyy1600-1750. 0aEconomic historyy1750-1918. 0aLiteraturey18th centuryxHistory and criticism.1 aFennetaux, Ariane,eeditor.1 aJunqua, Amélie,eeditor.1 aVasset, Sophie,eeditor. 0aRoutledge studies in cultural history ;v26.  aTD 794.5 A415 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035234754  aTD 794.5 A415 2015wLCc1i0162035234754lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2012033367bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/228394019
