He was also the creator of Wonder Woman, the comic that he used to express two of his greatest passions: feminism and women in bondage. Comics expert Noah Berlatsky takes us on a wild ride through the Wonder Woman comics of the 1940s, vividly illustrating how Marston's many quirks and contradictions, along with the odd disproportionate composition created by illustrator Harry Peter, produced a comic that was radically ahead of its time in terms of its bold presentation of female power and sexuality. Himself a committed polyamorist, Marston created a universe that was friendly to queer sexualities and lifestyles, from kink to lesbianism to cross-dressing. Written with a deep affection for the fantastically pulpy elements of the early Wonder Womancomics, from invisible jets to giant multi-lunged space kangaroos, the book also reveals how the comic addressed serious, even taboo issues like rape and incest. Wonder Woman: Bondage and Feminism in the Marston/Peter Comics reveals how illustrator and writer came together to create a unique, visionary work of art, filled with bizarre ambition, revolutionary fervor, and love, far different from the action hero symbol of the feminist movement many of us recall from television"--cProvided by publisher.  a8 4300aWonder Womanc(Fictitious character) 0aFeminism in literature. 0aWomen in literature. 0aBondage (Sexual behavior) in literature. 0aComic books, strips, etc.zUnited States. 0aComics culture.  aPN 6728 W6 B47 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035238623  aPN 6728 W6 B47 2015wLCc1i0162035238623d2/24/2016e11/3/2015lON_SHELFmUAHSSn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/2015  aPN 6728 W6 B47 2015wLCc1i34917001376883lON_SHELFmKEYANOp$35.31rYsYtBOOKu2/16/2017o.STAFF. 4/19/2016 Midwest PO 5058001ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb2016002161bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/1.37145541778e+20
