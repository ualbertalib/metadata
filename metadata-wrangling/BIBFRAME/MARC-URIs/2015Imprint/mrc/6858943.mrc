While there is a lot of interest in mobile technology, many schools still aren't sure how to best use it for learning and teaching. Learning with Handhelds and Mobiles explores this landscape and offers examples of how these technologies have been used for learning, how the problems that have arisen are being addressed, and offers ideas for the future. This invaluable book gives a voice to teachers and educators using mobiles and technology-enhanced learning in and out of schools, for regular school work and for innovative projects through exciting partnerships like Apps for Good. Learning with Handhelds and Mobiles shows the changes that are taking place within schools as a direct result of these emerging technologies, and contains case studies with accounts of best practice in a variety of settings including primary, secondary, and special schools, and learning beyond their boundaries. The book also explores themes of pedagogy, communication and affordances, collaborative learning, individual creativity and expression, self-directed and informal learning and outdoor education. The learning potential of handheld and mobile devices has excited teachers and educators, but until now there has been no structured, systematic overview available along with reflections on how this technology is changing educational practice. This book brings these together to provide a clearer picture of what is currently a fragmented area, and offers expert views of how we can understand these, and where it may take us next"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aMobile communication systems in education. 0aInformation technology. 0aPocket computers.1 aJohn, Merlin,eauthor.1 aMcTaggart, Maureen,eauthor.  aLB1044.84 .G35 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007764887p52.73kAVAIL_SOON  aLB1044.84 .G35 2015wLCc1i1007764887d8/4/2015e8/7/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn5p$52.73rYsYtBOOKu5/12/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014048961bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/310612182
