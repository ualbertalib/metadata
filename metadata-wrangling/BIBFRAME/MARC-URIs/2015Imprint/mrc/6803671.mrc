The Strike not only drew writers into political action but inspired literature that served to shape twentieth-century British views of class, culture and politics. While major figures active at the time wrote on or responded to this crucial moment, this is the first volume to address their respective works. Ferrall and McNeill show how novels then in progress, such as Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse and D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, were affected by the Strike, as well as the ways in which it has been remembered from the 1930s to the present. Their study sheds new light on the relationship between politics and literature of the modernist era"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aEnglish fictiony20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aGeneral Strike, Great Britain, 1926, in literature. 0aPolitics and literaturezGreat Britain.1 aMcNeill, Dougal,d1981-403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316163771  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6803671-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/11/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2005055009bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/95243920
