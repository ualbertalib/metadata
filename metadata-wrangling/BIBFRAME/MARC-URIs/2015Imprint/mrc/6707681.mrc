Yet the fashion industry is also a significant contributor to the degradation of natural systems, with the associated environmental footprint of clothing high in comparison with other products. This comprehensive handbook recognizes the complexity of aligning fashion with sustainability. It explores fashion and sustainability at the levels of products, processes, and paradigms and takes a truly multi-disciplinary approach to critically question and suggest creative responses to issues of fashion in a post-growth society, fashion, diversity and equity and fashion, fluidity and balance across natural, social and economic systems"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print version record.  a44 0aFashionxEnvironmental aspects. 0aClothing tradexEnvironmental aspects. 0aSustainability.1 aFletcher, Kate,d1971-eeditor of compilation.1 aTham, Mathilda,eeditor of compilation. 0aRoutledge international handbooks.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=835145z(Single User Access)  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6707681-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu10/16/2014xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014040005bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/20867669
