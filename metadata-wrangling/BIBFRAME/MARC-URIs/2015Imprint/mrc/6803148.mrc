From a philosophical perspective, events are irregular occurrences--moments of change and interruption--categorized by human perception, language, and thought. While philosophers have pored over this subject extensively in recent years, The Event: Literature and Theory seeks to ground it: What is literature's approach to the event? How does literature produce and give testimony to events? Ilai Rowner's study not only revisits some of the most important thinkers of our time, including Maurice Blanchot, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, and Martin Heidegger, it also develops a critical approach to literature that questions the meaning of the literary event through examinations of literary works by Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand Ce;line, and T.S. Eliot. Rowner offers a new method of thinking about the particular characteristics of the event within literary works and defines the creative value of literature as the aspiration toward the un-happening within the happening. In this study the experience of literature--as an act of both writing and reading--becomes the struggle to capture the excessive movement of the event while yet revealing the creative energy within the work of literature."--cProvided by publisher.  a16 0aLiteraturexPhilosophy.  aPN 45 R648 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035236411  aPN 45 R648 2015wLCc1i0162034579183d4/14/2015e2/23/2015lON_SHELFmUAAUGn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014048855bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/242352265
