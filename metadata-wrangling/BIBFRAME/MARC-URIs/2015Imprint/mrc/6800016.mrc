The industry is highly regulated, thus dramatically increasing costs and sometimes even interfering with the ability to deliver healthcare. New drugs, treatments, and medical technologies are so common that keeping track of them can be overwhelming, and incorporating them into patient care or administration can be costly and complicated. On the social side, different groups have different opinions on any given topic and often the right thing to do depends on your point of view. Third party payers add another level of complexity, and competition adds yet another layer of difficulty as organizations seek to grow patient volume by positioning themselves as distinguished in terms of cost, quality, accessibility, and quality of patient experience.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on December 21, 2014).  a44 0aHealth services administration. 0aStrategic planning. 2aHealth Services Administration.1 aThompson, Steven M.,eauthor. 0aStrategic management collection.x2150-9646403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=10997456  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800016-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2015108437
