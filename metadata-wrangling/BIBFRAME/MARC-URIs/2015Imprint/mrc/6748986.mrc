Taking into consideration operating constraints as well as generation cost, line overload, and congestion for expected and inadvertent loading stress, the text presents solutions based on stochastic optimization techniques--such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and differential evolution--for improving the stability, reliability, and efficiency of LPS and deregulated multi-bus networks. It also proposes the use of stochastic techniques in optimizing utility management in the smart grid"--cProvided by publisher.  a"Electricity is the prime mover of a modern society. Per capita consumption of electricity is an indicator of a country's growth. This indicator depends on availability, quality and reliability of power and most particularly its overall cost. The cost of electricity governs its usage. Thus the electricity pricing is a major issue to consumers for its liberal use. But due to demand of social and technological advancements the changes in power networks and their mode of operation are inevitable. Revolutionize of electric power industries engross technical and also various non-technical and economic issues. Even though as an inevitable consequence, power networks have been undergoing changes from regulated to de-regulated structures, finally stepping into smart grid concept which in turns, involves the change in electricity price methodology"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aElectric utilitiesxRates. 0aElectric utilitiesxGovernment policy. 0aElectric utilitiesxDeregulation. 0aSmart power grids.1 aSengupta, Samarjit,eauthor.1 aChakrabarti, Abhijit,eauthor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781482251753z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6748986-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu12/2/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2011103799bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/173030954
