As early as the seventh century, however, questions were raised about Irish orthodoxy, primarily concerning Easter observances. Yet heresy trials did not occur in Ireland until significantly later, long after allegations of Irish apostasy from Christianity had sanctioned the English invasion of Ireland. In The Templars, the Witch, and the Wild Irish, Maeve Brigid Callan analyzes Ireland's medieval heresy trials, which all occurred in the volatile fourteenth century. These include the celebrated case of Alice Kyteler and her associates, prosecuted by Richard de Ledrede, bishop of Ossory, in 1324. This trial marks the dawn of the "devil-worshipping witch" in European prosecutions, with Ireland an unexpected birthplace"--cPublisher's Web site.  a16 23 0aTrials (Heresy)zIrelandxHistoryyTo 1500. 0aTrials (Witchcraft)zIrelandxHistoryyTo 1500. 0aIrelandxChurch historyy600-1500.  aBR 794 C35 2015hUAAU-Bi0162035241635  aBR 794 C35 2015wLCc1i0162034578912lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/19/2015  aBR 794 C35 2015wLCc1i32860001071959lON_SHELFmBURMANrYsYtBOOKu8/26/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2014078338bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/308771976
