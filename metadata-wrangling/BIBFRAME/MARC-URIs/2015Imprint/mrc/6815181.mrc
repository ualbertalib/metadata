If he gives the order, he has the opportunity to take down a global menace, once and for all. If the mission fails, he would face certain impeachment, and the threats against the nation would multiply. So the president turns to the one team that can pull off the impossible: Will Robie and his partner, Jessica Reel. Together, Robie and Reel's talents as assassins are unmatched. But there are some in power who don't trust the pair. They doubt their willingness to follow orders. And they will do anything to see that the two assassins succeed, but that they do not survive. As they prepare for their mission, Reel faces a personal crisis that could well lead old enemies right to her doorstep, resurrecting the ghosts of her earlier life and bringing stark danger to all those close to her. And all the while, Robie and Reel are stalked by a new adversary: an unknown and unlikely assassin, a woman who has trained her entire life to kill, and who has her own list of targets -- a list that includes Will Robie and Jessica Reel.  a3 35 0aTargeted killingvFiction. 0aAssassinsvFiction. 0aAssassinationvFiction. 0aBetrayalvFiction. 0aPolitical persecutionzKorea (North)vFiction. 0aNeo-NaziszUnited StatesvFiction.  aBALwLCc1i30125302525679d9/6/2016e8/11/2016lPAPERBACKSmRED_DEER_Cn10rYsYtBOOKu3/4/2015  aMystery BALwASISc1i33862001359599d3/21/2016e2/4/2016kLOST-ASSUMlPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINn1p$9.51rMsYtPAPERBACKu4/8/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n95052956bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/102339955
