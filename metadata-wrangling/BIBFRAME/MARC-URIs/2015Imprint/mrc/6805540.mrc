In light of Williams' centennial in 2011, which was marked internationally by productions and world premieres of his late plays, Annette J. Saddik's new reading of these works illuminates them in the context of what she terms a "theatre of excess," which seeks liberation through exaggeration, chaos, ambiguity, and laughter. Saddik explains why these plays are now gaining increasing acclaim, and analyzes recent productions that successfully captured elements central to Williams' late aesthetic, particularly a delicate balance of laughter and horror with a self-consciously ironic acting style. Grounding the plays through the work of Bakhtin, Artaud, and Kristeva, as well as through the carnivalesque, the grotesque, and psychoanalytic, feminist, and queer theory, Saddik demonstrates how Williams engaged the freedom of exaggeration and excess in celebration of what he called "the strange, the crazed, the queer.""--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a4410aWilliams, Tennessee,d1911-1983xCriticism and interpretation.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139924603  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6805540-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/17/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79090096bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/51697407
