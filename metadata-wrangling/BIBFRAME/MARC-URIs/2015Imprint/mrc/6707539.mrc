The case studies challenge conventional wisdoms about why gold is valuable, why the internal combustion engine triumphed, and when and why suburbs sprawled. The book shows how the power of individuals, the power of classes, the power of the market and the power of the state at different times and in different ways were critical to setting us on a path to environmental degradation. It also challenges conventional wisdoms about what we need to do now. Rather than reducing consumption and shrinking from outcomes we don’t want, it proposes growing towards outcomes we do want. We invested massive resources in creating our problems; it will take equally large investments to fix them. Written in a clear and engaging style, the book is underpinned with a political economy framework and addresses how we should understand our responsibility to the environment and to each other as individuals within a large and impersonal system.  a33 0aEnvironmental degradationxSocial aspects. 0aPower (Social sciences) 0aNaturexEffect of human beings on. 0aGold mines and miningxEnvironmental aspects. 0aAutomobilesxEnvironmental aspects. 0aCities and townsxGrowthxEnvironmental aspects.  aGE 140 S34 2015wLCc1i0164000766497lON_SHELFmOLDSrYsYtBOOKu10/31/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n87102482bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/71539161
