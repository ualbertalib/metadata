Lifelong recovery requires much more than to just stop gambling. Women's groups provide long-term benefits and support and have proven to be highly successful in promoting recovery from gambling addiction. By following the story of a real women's group for problem gambling over the course of a year, Liz Karter explains how, for women, both the cause of and the cure for gambling addiction lies in relationship. Karter shows clearly how learning to face and cope with real life situations and relationships is essential to maintain recovery. She shares the themes which run through each women's group, such as fear of trusting others, and the guilt, shame and risk associated with being truly seen and heard. Women's Groups for Problem Gambling shows that with a combination of specialist intervention, women's group support, courage and compassion, women can learn to stop running from their addiction and instead find joy and support in building relationships and communities. This highly accessible book provides a unique opportunity to gain a very personal insight into the group process, both for therapists and clinicians and for women wishing to better understand their addiction"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 29 0aWomen gamblers. 0aCompulsive gambling.  aHV 6713 K37 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035207719  aHV 6713 K37 2015wLCc1i0162035207719lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/6/2015  aHV6713 .K37 2015wLCc1i1007433657d1/23/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$48.37rYsYtBOOKu1/20/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2012062603bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/264923769
