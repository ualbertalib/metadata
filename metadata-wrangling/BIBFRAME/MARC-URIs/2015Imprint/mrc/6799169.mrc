Getting started : how do we prepare to review and conduct cold case investigations? -- Section II. The evaluation process -- Section III. Follow-up investigative strategies.  a"Most agencies do little cold-case work due to tenuous funding, low success rates, and inconsistent access to databases. Written by experts who conduct training and consulting worldwide, this text enables police and public safety agencies--whether large or small, domestic or international--to more easily get these cases to court. It provides readers with a revised evaluation model for determining if a cold case is solvable and explains how to organize, manage, and evaluate the investigation. The book features a new chapter by the Dutch Police Detective Academy and new chapters on DNA and suspectology."--cProvided by publisher.  a"Series Editor's Preface While the literature on police and allied subjects is growing exponentially, its impact upon day-to- day policing remains limited. The two worlds of research and practice in relation to policing remain disconnected, even though cooperation between the two is growing. A major reason for this is that the two groups speak different languages. The research work is published in hard-to- access journals and presented in a manner that is difficult to comprehend. On the other hand, police practitioners tend not to mix with researchers and remain secretive about their work. Consequently, there is little dialog between the two and almost no attempt to learn from one another. Dialog across the globe, among researchers and practitioners situated in different continents, is of course even more limited. I attempted to address this problem by starting the International Police Executive Symposium (IPES), www.ipes.info, where a common platform has brought the two together. IPES is now in its 20th year. The annual meetings which constitute most major annual events of the organization have been hosted in all parts of the world. Several publications have come from these deliberations and a new collaborative community of scholars and police officers has been created whose membership runs into the several hundreds. Another attempt was to begin a new journal, aptly called Police Practice and Research: An International Journal (PPR), which has opened the gate for practitioners to share their work and experiences."--cProvided by publisher.  a16 29 0aCold cases (Criminal investigation) 0aCriminal investigation.1 aStein, Sarah L.,eauthor. 0aAdvances in police theory and practice.423Cover imageuhttp://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/websmall/978148222/9781482221442.jpg  aHV 8073 A5285 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035231669  aHV 8073 A5285 2015wLCc1i0162035231669lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/4/2015  aHV8073 .A5285 2015wLCc1i1007436734d2/13/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$110.28rYsYtBOOKu2/6/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2010046121bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/124575087
