And what role can librarians play in helping students attain these competencies? In addressing these questions, this book articulates a new area of opportunity for librarians and other information professionals, developing educational programs that introduce graduate students to the knowledge and skills needed to work with research data. The term "data information literacy" has been adopted with the deliberate intent of tying two emerging roles for librarians together. By viewing information literacy and data services as complementary rather than separate activities, the contributors seek to leverage the progress made and the lessons learned in each service area. The intent of the publication is to help librarians cultivate strategies and approaches for developing data information literacy programs"--cProvided by publisher.  a"The intent of the publication is to help librarians cultivate strategies and approaches for developing data information literacy programs of their own using the work done in the multiyear, IMLS-supported Data Information Literacy (DIL) project as real-world case studies. The initial chapters introduce the concepts and ideas behind data information literacy, such as the twelve data competencies. The middle chapters describe five case studies in data information literacy conducted at different institutions (Cornell, Purdue, Minnesota, Oregon), each focused on a different disciplinary area in science and engineering. They detail the approaches taken, how the programs were implemented, and the assessment metrics used to evaluate their impact. The later chapters include the "DIL Toolkit," a distillation of the lessons learned, which is presented as a handbook for librarians interested in developing their own DIL programs. The book concludes with recommendations for future directions and growth of data information literacy. More information about the DIL project can be found on the project's website: datainfolit.org"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 43 0aAcademic librariesxServices to graduate students. 0aAcademic librariesxRelations with faculty and curriculumzUnited StatesvCase studies. 0aAcademic librariansxEffect of technological innovations on. 0aInformation literacyxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aElectronic information resource literacyxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aSciencexData processingxManagement. 0aResearchxData processingxManagement. 0aDatabase management. 0aCyberinfrastructure. 0aDigital preservation.1 aCarlson, Jake,d1970-eeditor.1 aJohnston, Lisaq(Lisa R.),eeditor. 0aPurdue information literacy handbooks.  aZ711.92 .G73 D38 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007558602p35.53kAVAIL_SOON  a9034834521 aAU@b0000537461491 aCHVBKb3307018431 aCHBISb010233785  aZ711.92 .G73 D38 2015wLCc1i1007558602d1/24/2017e12/13/2016lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn4p$35.53rYsYtBOOKu4/27/2015  aZ 711.92 G73 D38 2015wLCc1i0162035299211d1/28/2017e1/28/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmUAHSSn2p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu5/27/2015zCOUTTS_ADD01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2012003315bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/231372448
