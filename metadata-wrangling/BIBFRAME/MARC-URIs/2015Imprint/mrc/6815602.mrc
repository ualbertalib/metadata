In this book, historian Emily West offers the first comprehensive overview of the lives of enslaved women in America by placing their stories within the broader context of slavery in this country from the colonial era through to the end of the Civil War. She compares the lives of enslaved women with the lives of enslaved men from the same period, and with the white men and women who unjustly held them in bondage. West's thorough research and eye for detail construct a narrative of the enslaved woman's life, giving voice to and revealing the significance of a singularly strong but largely overlooked member of early American society"--Publisher.  a16 0aWomen slaveszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aAfrican American womenzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aSlaveryzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aUnited StatesxRace relationsxHistory. 0aAfrican American history series (Lanham, Md.)  aE 443 W47 2015hUAAU-Bi0162035249463  aE 443 W47 2015wLCc1i0162034579985d12/2/2015e11/4/2015lON_SHELFmUAAUGn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2003046386bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/160944759
