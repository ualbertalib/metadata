The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) inspired and haunted an extraordinary number of exceptional artists and writers, including Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, Martha Gellhorn, Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, and John Dos Passos. The idealism of the cause--defending democracy from fascism at a time when Europe was darkening toward another world war--and the brutality of the conflict drew from them some of their best work: Guernica, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Homage to Catalonia, The Spanish Earth. The war spurred breakthroughs in military and medical technology as well. New aircraft, new weapons, new tactics and strategy all emerged in the intense Spanish conflict. Indiscriminate destruction raining from the sky became a dreaded reality for the first time. Progress also arose from the horror: the doctors and nurses who volunteered to serve with the Spanish defenders devised major advances in battlefield surgery and front-line blood transfusion. In those ways, and in many others, the Spanish Civil War served as a test bed for World War II, and for the entire twentieth century" --cfrom publisher's web site.  a29 0aSpainxHistoryyCivil War, 1936-1939.  aDP269 .R48 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007403767p36.51kAVAIL_SOON  aDP269 .R48 2015wLCc1i1007403767d3/20/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$36.51rYsYtBOOKu3/10/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79127879bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/85178524
