The unifying theme is that they have always been and will in the future continue to form a crucial part of the foundations of public international law. While many publications focus on new actors in international law such as international organisations, individuals, companies, NGOs and even humanity as a whole, this book offers a timely, thought-provoking and innovative reappraisal of the core actors on the international stage: States. It includes reflections on the interactions between States and non-state actors and on how increasing participation by and recognition of the latter within international law has impacted upon the role and attributes of statehood"--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a44 0aSovereignty. 0aState, The. 0aGovernment liability. 0aInternational law.1 aChinkin, C.
