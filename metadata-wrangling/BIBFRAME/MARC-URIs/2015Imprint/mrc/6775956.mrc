The scope of damage brought about by this natural disaster urges focus on recovery and post-disaster reconstruction from several perspectives. Here we find an in-depth ethnography of Thailand and the role of culture and religion as an underpinning issue in post-disaster recovery. Following the post-tsunami recovery over five years, the book provides knowledge on socio-cultural responses from affected local communities after natural hazards, and is based on original material collected in Thailand after the 2004 tsunami. With a focus on how culture and religion interplay in the processes of building resilience and decreasing vulnerability, it gives a deeper understanding of how disasters are experienced and dealt with on a local level. It examines survivors' experiences of rituals and ceremonies that became a part of the survivors' lives in new ways after the tsunami, offering psychological reassurance and religious efficaciousness as well as communication links between themselves and the deceased. Using observations, narratives and material from in-depth interviews with survivors, relatives, relief workers, officials and Buddhist monks and nuns, this book contributes to the research on anthropology of disaster and to the development of research on cultural resilience and religion in post-disaster recovery"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aTsunami reliefxSocial aspectszThailand. 0aDisaster victimsxRehabilitationzThailand. 0aIndian Ocean Tsunami, 2004xSocial aspects. 0aModern anthropology of South-East Asia.  aHV 603 2004 T5 F35 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035218633  aHV 603 2004 T5 F35 2015wLCc1i0162035218633lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2005025944bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/2711345
