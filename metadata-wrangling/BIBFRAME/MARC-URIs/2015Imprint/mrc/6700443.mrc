The practice-to-research direction is easy to see: Our own research studies, and those of other scholars, have been guided by specific concerns that arise in real accommodations cases. The research-to-practice direction is still in its infancy, but it is our aim to make accommodation decisions in schools and other testing settings that are based directly on research findings like those reviewed in this book. We see many reasons to be optimistic that this can happen; when we present to school psychologists at conventions, or to KÂ¿12 teachers at in-service workshops, we are pleased by the enthusiastic responses of audience members who are excited to learn that researchers have actually tried to investigate empirically the dilemmas that they, as practitioners, deal with every day. Often audience members interrupt our presentations to ask, "What would you do with a kid who . . ." and we are always eager to try to apply research to a new real-life situation. Sometimes, we find it difficult to answer, and then the audience member's question prompts a new empirical study! It is therefore a genuine pleasure to present this book, which covers those empirical studies, to readers who can then actually implement research-based accommodations decisions"--Preface.
