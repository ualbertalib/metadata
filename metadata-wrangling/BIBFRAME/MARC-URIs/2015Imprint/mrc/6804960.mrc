Their choices proved to be of enormous consequence for the development of American foreign policy in the final decades of the twentieth century and beyond. In A Superpower Transformed, historian Daniel J. Sargent chronicles how policymakers across three administrations worked to manage complex international changes in a tumultuous era. Drawing on many newly-released archival documents and interviews with key figures, including President Jimmy Carter and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, Sargent explores the collision of geopolitics and globalization that pervaded the decade. From the Nixon administration's efforts to stabilize a faltering Pax Americana; to Henry Kissinger's attempts to devise new strategies to manage or mitigate the consequences of economic globalization after the oil crisis of 1973-74; to the Carter administration's embrace of human rights promotion as a central task for foreign policy, Sargent explores the challenges that afflicted US policymakers in the 1970s, offering new insights into the complexities that emerged as the new forces of globalization and human rights transformed the United States as a superpower. A sweeping reinterpretation of a pivotal era, A Superpower Transformed is a must-read for anyone interested in U.S. foreign relations, American politics, globalization, economic policy, human rights, and contemporary American history"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aPresidentszUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aStatesmenzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aGreat powersxHistoryy20th century. 0aGeopoliticsxHistoryy20th century. 0aCold War. 0aWorld politicsy1945-1989. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationsy1969-1974. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationsy1974-1977. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationsy1977-1981. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationsxDecision making.  aE855 .S26 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007403114p42.54kAVAIL_SOON  aE855 .S26 2015wLCc1i1007403114d4/4/2017e3/14/2017lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn2p$42.54rYsYtBOOKu3/10/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014021954bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/308229750
