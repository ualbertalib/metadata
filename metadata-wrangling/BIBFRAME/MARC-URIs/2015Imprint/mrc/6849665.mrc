Heartbroken, she accepted the proposal of a diplomat and moved to America, where she played the role of a dutiful wife among Washington's elite. Now a widow, Glynis is back in Scotland. Though Lennox can still unravel her with just one glance, Glynis is no longer the naïve girl Lennox knew and vows to resist him. With the American Civil War raging, shipbuilder Lennox Cameron must complete a sleek new blockade runner for the Confederate Navy. He cannot afford any distractions, especially the one woman he's always loved. Glynis's cool demeanor tempts him to prove to her what a terrible mistake she made seven years ago. As the war casts its long shadow across the ocean, will a secret from Glynis's past destroy any chance for a future between the two star-crossed lovers?"-- From back cover.  a3 0aScotlandxHistoryy19th centuryvFiction. 0aAvon romance.  aRomance RANwASISc1i33862001359060lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINp$7.49rYsYtPAPERBACKu5/5/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no96046398bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/285181323
