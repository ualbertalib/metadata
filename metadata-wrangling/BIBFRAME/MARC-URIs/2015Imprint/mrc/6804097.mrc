This theory is both original and radical in its emphasis on the role and importance of social and historical conditions as a context for our actions. This location of human action within a social, historical and institutional framework is an important philosophical development but the details of the theory are subject to debate, and even those most influenced by Hegel's emphasis on sociality have not agreed on exactly what its value is. Mark Alznauer offers the first book-length account of the structure of the theory and its place within Hegel's thought as a whole. The reader is carefully walked through the psychological, social, and historical aspects of responsibility in Hegel's texts. The book demonstrates that attention to the concept of responsibility reveals the true nature and function of Hegel's claims about the sociality of human action"--cProvided by publisher.  a4410aHegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich,d1770-1831. 0aResponsibility.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139939614  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6804097-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/12/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n98024012bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/89774942
