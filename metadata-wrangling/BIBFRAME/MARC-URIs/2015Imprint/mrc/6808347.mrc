It has a multiparty system, free elections, and a parliament that functions much the same way that any other democratic parliament functions, however for much of its existence the Japanese party system has been dominated by one party. This fact is crucial to understanding contemporary politics in Japan, especially since the long term ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party, is once again back in power. This book presents an up-to-date analysis of the political parties that make up the Japanese party system and their impact on Japanese politics and government. Given that the executive branch is selected as a result of the pattern of party numbers in the parliament, to understand Japanese politics and policy, one must first know the nature of the ruling and opposition parties and their leaders. Indeed, in the past decade the quality of Japan's government has been closely associated with the strengths and weaknesses of Japan's prime ministers and the dominant party in the system. This book focuses on a central question: why Japanese politics and government has been so dysfunctional in the past two decades? With this question in mind, the chapters provide key background information on Japanese politics and political parties; discuss each of the major political parties that have governed Japan since 1955; and finally, examine the December 2012 House of Representatives elections that returned the LDP to power, and the differences between the First (1955-1993) and the Second Post War Party Systems (1993- )"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print version record.  a29 57 0aPolitical partieszJapanxHistoryy21st century. 0aOpposition (Political science)zJapanxHistoryy21st century. 0aJapanxPolitics and governmenty21st century.1 aHrebenar, Ronald J.,d1945-eeditor of compilation,eauthor.1 aNakamura, Akira,eeditor of compilation,eauthor. 0aRoutledge contemporary Japan series.403MacEwan University Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=850021z(Single User Access)  hUAINmGR_MAC_INTzEBSCOGMPp189.69  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6808347-4001lINTERNETmGR_MAC_INTp$189.69rYsYtE-RESOURCEu8/25/2015xE-BOOKzEBSCOGMP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81072263bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/108257713
