Extending and renewing Asian American studies and ecocriticism by drawing the two fields into deeper dialogue, it brings Asian American writers to the center of ecocritical studies. This collection demonstrates the distinctiveness of Asian American writers' positions on topics of major concern today: environmental justice, identity and the land, war environments, consumption, urban environments, and the environment and creativity. Represented authors include Amy Tan, Maxine Hong Kingston, Ruth Ozeki, Ha Jin, Fae Myenne Ng, Le Ly Hayslip, Lan Cao, Mitsuye Yamada, Lawson Fusao Inada, Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, Milton Murayama, Don Lee, Mae Myenne Ng, and Hisaye Yamamoto. These writers provide a range of perspectives on the historical, social, psychological, economic, philosophical, and aesthetic responses of Asian Americans to the environment conceived in relation to labor, racism, immigration, domesticity, global capitalism, relocation, pollution, violence, and religion. Contributors apply a diversity of critical frameworks, including critical radical race studies, counter-memory studies, ecofeminism, and geomantic criticism. The book presents a compelling and timely "green" perspective through which to understand key works of Asian American literature and leads the field of ecocriticism into neglected terrain"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 0aAmerican literaturexAsian American authorsxHistory and criticism. 0aEnvironmental protection in literature. 0aEcology in literature. 0aEcocriticism.1 aFitzsimmons, Lorna,d1957-eeditor.1 aChae, Youngsuk,eeditor.1 aAdams, Bella,eeditor. 0aRoutledge interdisciplinary perspectives on literature ;v35.  aPS 153 A84 A74 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035232279  aPS 153 A84 A74 2015wLCc1i0162035232279lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2005085394bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/71652586
