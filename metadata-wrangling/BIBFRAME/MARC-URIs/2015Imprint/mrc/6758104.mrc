Operations researchers have made significant developments in the algorithms for their solution, and Vehicle Routing: Problems, Methods, and Applications, Second Edition reflects these advances. The text of the new edition is either completely new or significantly revised and provides extensive and complete state-of-the-art coverage of vehicle routing by those who have done most of the innovative research in the area; emphasizes methodology related to specific classes of vehicle routing problems and, since vehicle routing is used as a benchmark for all new solution techniques, contains a complete overview of current solutions to combinatorial optimization problems; includes several chapters on important and emerging applications, such as disaster relief and green vehicle routing.  aTitle from title screen, viewed 11/11/2014.  a44 0aTransportation problems (Programming)1 aToth, Paolo,eeditor.1 aVigo, Daniele,eeditor.2 aSociety for Industrial and Applied Mathematics,epublisher. 0aMOS-SIAM series on optimization.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611973594zfrom SIAM  aInternet AccesswLCc2i6758104-1002lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/27/2017xE-BOOKzSIAM01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79053057
