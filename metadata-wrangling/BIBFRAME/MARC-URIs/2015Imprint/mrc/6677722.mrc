The book is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather an introductory text to natural products chemistry, and hence is broad rather than in-depth. It covers the major classes of natural product compounds and their sources. It is a preparatory text for more advanced studies on synthesis, biosynthesis, and mode of action studies. The authors have selected examples from marine life, plants, insects, and, importantly, actual examples taken from the pharmaceutical industry (e.g., anti-infective compounds), which are not always discussed or worked on in universities. Natural products have played a central role in advancing synthetic and biosynthetic chemistry, medicine, and our understanding of nature. The training of chemists and pharmacognocists in the area of microscale chromatographic purification and spectroscopy is ever increasing to tackle the challenging questions in bioorganic chemistry and molecular biology. Over the lifetime of this author, dramatic changes have taken place in our approaches for the isolation, structure determination, and mode of action studies of chemicals from nature: from isolation of large quantities to even nanogram quantities. It continues to be essential to properly train natural products chemists in the area of the analytical challenges in the field of botanical medicines (supplements), and to provide confidence to encounter ever-increasing new challenges to solve critical biological questions at the interface of bioorganic and molecular biology"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aChromatographic analysis. 0aBiological productsxSeparation. 0aMicrobial metabolitesxSeparation.1 aNicola, Georgec(Chemist),eauthor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781466567627z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6677722-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu9/15/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014027812bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/308752680
