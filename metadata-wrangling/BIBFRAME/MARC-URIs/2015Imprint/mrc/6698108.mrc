While magazines in general have long been understood as a significant force in women's lives, many critiques have limited themselves to discussions of mainstream printed publications that engage with narrowly stereotypical representations of femininity. Looking at a range of women's magazines (Cooperative Correspondence Club and Housewife) and magazine programmes (Woman's Hour and Houseparty), Magazine Movements not only extends our definition of a magazine, but most importantly, unearths the connections between women's cultures, specific magazines and the implied reader. The author first outlines the existing field of magazine studies, and analyzes the methodologies employed in accessing and assessing the cultural competence of magazines. Each chapter then provides a case study of a different kind of magazine: different in media form or style of presentation or audience connection, or all three. Forster not only extends our definition of a magazine, but most importantly, unearths the connections between women's cultures, specific magazines and the implied reader. In this way, fresh insights are provided into the long-standing importance of the magazine to the variety of feminisms on offer in Britain, from the mid twentieth century to the present day"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aWomen's studies. 0aFeminism. 0aWomen in mass media.423Cover imageuhttp://www.netread.com/jcusers2/bk1388/631/9781441172631/image/lgcover.9781441172631.jpg  aHQ1180 .F677 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007769910p35.07kAVAIL_SOON  a9077947841 aAU@b000053717400  aHQ1180 .F677 2015wLCc1i1007769910d6/10/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$35.07rYsYtBOOKu5/25/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2003002352bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/22396872
