This movement challenges some of the most foundational concepts in educational theory and has implications within educational research, curriculum design and pedagogical interactions. In this volume, a group of international contributors use posthumanist theory to present new modes of institutional collaboration and pedagogical practice.  aDescription based on print version of record.  a44 0aEducationxPhilosophy.1 aWeaver, John. 0aRoutledge international studies in the philosophy of education.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=853984z(3 Concurrent Users)zfrom EBSCO  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6756342-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu12/9/2014xE-BOOKzEBSCOPDAP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n97851060
