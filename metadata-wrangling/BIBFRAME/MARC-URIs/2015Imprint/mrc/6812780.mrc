Most municipal solid waste goes to landfills which have liners to protect ground water. Humans are often exposed to pathogens, resulting in serious diseases from the disposal of human and animal wastes. This book describes the various pathogens and diseases that can be found in solid waste and describes the means and opportunities for disposal and management of various solid waste materials"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aSanitary microbiology. 0aPathogenic microorganisms. 0aRefuse and refuse disposalxHeatlth aspects. 0aRefuse and refuse disposalxToxicology. 0aSewagexMicrobiology. 0aDiseasesxCauses and theories of causation. 7aElectronic books.2lcsh403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781482248159z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6812780-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/26/2015xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n80038254bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/115719761
