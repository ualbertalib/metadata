The analysis begins with an understanding of the basic engineering description of technology in terms of capacity, efficiency, constraints, and dependability. It continues in modeling the cash flow of a project, which is affected by the installed cost, the revenues or expenses avoided by using the technology, the operating expenses of the technology, available tax credits and rebates, and laws regarding depreciation and income tax. The feasibility study is completed by discounted cash flow analysis, using an appropriate discount rate and a proper accounting for inflation, to evaluate the financial viability of the project. The elements of this analysis are illustrated using numerous examples of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, biogas digestion, energy storage, biofuels, and energy-efficient appliances and buildings.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on January 11, 2015).  a44 0aSustainable developmentxManagement. 0aFeasibility studies. 0aEnvironmental and social sustainability for business advantage collection.x2327-3348403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=11001845  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800040-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/9250849
