It quantifies the benefits of improved quality in terms of cost savings, increased efficiency and consistency, and sustainability. It shows the relation between concrete quality and concrete strength variability, and discusses the components of variability (materials, manufacturing, testing) and how one could methodically relate component changes (for example, changes in cement quality, or mixing water content) to variability in concrete strength and other properties. It also recommends specific steps that producers might take to reduce component variability and achieve a more consistent product"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aConcretexQuality control.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781466592131z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6657824-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu8/8/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014009292bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/306380540
