She offers a complete wardrobe of 28 pieces from smart dresses to smocks, trousers and even a parka. Also included are a cute cap, clasp purse and drawstring bag, which are bound to delight their owners. She doesn't neglect the details bows, pin tucks, patch pockets and lace edging make gorgeous extras. As children's clothes should be, these designs are comfortable and practical to wear as well as pleasing to look at. The designs are based on unfussy shapes, straightforward sewing techniques and a minimum of pattern pieces, making them easily adaptable for use with different fabrics or in longer or shorter lengths. Comprehensive instructions, with step-by-step diagrams, are included, together with a full-scale paper pattern in five sizes (covering roughly ages 3 to 10).  a48 0aGirls' clothing. 0aChildren's clothingxPattern design.1 aWalker, Andy,etranslator.  aTT 562 T78 2015hUASC-Bi0162035249489  aTT 562 T78 2015wLCc1i0162035249489lON_SHELFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr2001043839
