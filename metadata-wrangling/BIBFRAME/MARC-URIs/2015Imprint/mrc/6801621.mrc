Contrary to popular myth, it demonstrates that US support for Israel is not based on the pro-Israel lobby, but rather is deeply rooted in American political culture. That support has increased since 9/11. However, the bulk of this increase has been among Republicans, conservatives, evangelicals, and Orthodox Jews. Meanwhile, among Democrats, liberals, the Mainline Protestant Church, and non-Orthodox Jews, criticism of Israeli policies toward the Palestinians has become more vociferous. This book works to explain this paradox"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aArab-Israeli conflicty1993-xForeign public opinion, American. 0aArab-Israeli conflictxForeign public opinion, American. 0aPolitical culturezUnited States. 0aRight and left (Political science)zUnited States. 0aJewszUnited StatesxAttitudes toward Israel. 0aProtestantszUnited StatesxAttitudes. 0aIsraelxRelationszUnited States. 0aUnited StatesxRelationszIsrael. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1989-403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO97813161467  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6801621-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/4447933
