There is a need for better knowledge sharing and resources to facilitate learning. This is the second of two volumes designed as a collective graduate guidebook for conducting fieldwork in healthcare. This volume brings together thematic chapters that draw out issues and lessons learned from practical experience. Researchers who have first-hand experience of conducting healthcare fieldwork collaborated to write these chapters. This volume contains insights, tips, and tricks from studies in clinical and non-clinical environments, from hospital to home. This volume starts with an introduction to the ethics and governance procedures a researcher might encounter when conducting fieldwork in this sensitive study area. Subsequent chapters address specific aspects of conducting situated healthcare research. Chapters on readying the researcher and relationships in the medical domain break down some of the complex social aspects of this type of research. They are followed by chapters on the practicalities of collecting data and implementing interventions, which focus on domain-specific issues that may arise. Finally, we close the volume by discussing the management of impact in healthcare fieldwork.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on January 17, 2015).  a44 0aMedical carexFieldwork. 0aHuman-computer interaction. 0aMedical instruments and apparatus.1 aFurniss, Dominic.,eeditor of compilation.1 aRandell, Rebecca.,eeditor of compilation.1 aO'Kane, Aisling Ann.,eeditor of compilation.1 aTaneva, Svetlena.,eeditor of compilation.1 aMentis, Helena Marie.,eeditor of compilation.1 aBlandford, Ann.,eeditor of compilation. 0aSynthesis digital library of engineering and computer science. 0aSynthesis lectures on assistive, rehabilitative, and health-preserving technologies ;v# 7.x2162-7266403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2200/S00606ED1V02Y201410ARH007  hUAINzSYNTHDIG  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6790077-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/28/2015xE-BOOKzSYNTHDIG01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/85193762
