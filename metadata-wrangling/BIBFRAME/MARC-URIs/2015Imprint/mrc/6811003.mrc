Unlike most existing books in this area, it is not written from a particular philosophical standpoint, and is the ideal first introduction for any student or researcher looking to use grounded theory in their analysis for the first time.   Birks and Mills' accessible and highly-readable text is driven by practical case examples throughout to help the reader get to grips with the process of doing grounded theory analysis for themselves. The book deploys a variety of educational activities to guide readers through both the principles and the application of grounded theory, making this an ideal starter text for those new to the approach.   This updated second edition: guides the reader through each step of the grounded theory process clearly explains how to memo effectively, using examples includes a chapter which explains the difference between data generation and collection features information on how to use digital resources to manage data discusses the philosophy and ethics of grounded theory within the qualitative paradigm. -- Provided by publisher  a29 43 0aGrounded theory. 0aGrounded theoryvCase studies.1 aMills, Janeq(Jane Elizabeth),eauthor.  aH61.24 .B57 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007760182p56.94kAVAIL_SOON  aH61.24 .B57 2015wLCc1i1007760182d3/22/2017e3/22/2017kMISSINGlON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn10p$56.94rMsYtBOOKu4/27/2015  aH 61.24 B57 2015wLCc1i0162034883064d4/3/2017e4/3/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmUAHSSn11p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu12/3/2015zCOUTTS_ADD01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb2011002149bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/165353937
