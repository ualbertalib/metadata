It includes a discussion of the gaps between family needs and contemporary family policies in the United States and European countries, as demonstrated in these households' surveys. In addition, the volume offers a comparative analysis of cash benefits, tax credits and deductions, and in-kind provisions between the United States and select European countries (UK, France, and Sweden). Most importantly, this book identifies and continues the discussion regarding the critical role of family-centered policies, as expressed in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), as well as the future of family policy toward families of children with disabilities at a time of economic crisis"--cProvided by publisher.  a"In the postscript of my recent book, Social inclusion of people with disabilities: National and international perspectives, I highlighted the central role that the family plays in providing socialisation, support, stability and opportunities for social inclusion. This is a particular challenge for a family of a child with severe disability which requires coping with extra demands in order to provide the care needed. There is no doubt that this responsibility takes its toll on personal and marital life, is a financial burden and curtails employment opportunities. In my earlier book, I noted that government policies are primarily aimed toward individuals with disabilities, with those targeting family protection or support being the exception"--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a44 0aParents of children with disabilitiesxServices for. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxGovernment policyzUnited States. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxGovernment policyzEurope. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxLegal status, laws, etc. 0aCambridge disability law and policy series403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107278806  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800001-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/44637321
