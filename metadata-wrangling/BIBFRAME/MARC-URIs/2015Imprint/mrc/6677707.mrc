Sustainability and development of plasma treatment in textile wet processing.  aAccess restricted to authorized users and institutions.  a"Focusing on green chemistry and sustainability, this book discusses how plasma treatment has been used to modify textile properties. The book highlights the benefits of generating plasma and the reaction mechanisms between the surface of a textile and plasma species. The text addresses factors such as the nature of plasma gas, gas flow rate, system pressure, and discharge power that affect the final results of plasma treatments. An opening chapter presents current "brown" methods of treating textiles, exploring the environmental, economic and social costs of these methods. Throughout the book, the author presents the twelve principles of green chemistry and how they can be applied to the textile industry.
