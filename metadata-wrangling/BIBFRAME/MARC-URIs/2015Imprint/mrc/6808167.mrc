In this edited collection, a prominent set of contributors explore the double relationship between power and group identity, focusing on two complementary lines of enquiry:In what ways can the powerful dictate the identities of the powerless?How can the powerless redefine their identity to challenge the powerful? Each chapter is written by leading authorities in the field, and investigates a particular aspect of the interplay of identity and power via a range of empirical contexts such as colonialism, nationalism, collective action, and electoral politics.The case studies include early modern Goa under Portuguese rule, the tribes of modern-day Jordan, the use of sexual stereotyping and objectification by female activists seeking to transform social systems, and a revisiting of the classic Stanford Prison Experiment. The chapters include contributions from a variety of social disciplines and research methodologies, and together provide a comprehensive overview of a subject at the cutting-edge of social and political psychology.Power and Identity will be of great interest to researchers, graduates and upper-level undergraduate students from across the social sciences"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 43 0aGroup identity. 0aPower (Social sciences) 0aSocial psychology.1 aSindic, Denis,eeditor.1 aBarreto, Manuela da Costa,eeditor.1 aCosta-Lopes, Rui,eeditor. 0aCurrent issues in social psychology.  aHM 753 P69 2015hUAAU-Bi0162035240405  aHM 753 P69 2015wLCc1i0162035240405d12/8/2015e12/7/2015lON_SHELFmUAAUGn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/19/2015  aHM 753 P69 2015wLCc1i0162035257003d4/10/2017e4/10/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu3/19/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014067900bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/129573800
