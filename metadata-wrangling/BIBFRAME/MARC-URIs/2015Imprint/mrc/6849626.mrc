Shifts in communication and privacy are affecting us more than we realize or understand. Terms of Service crystallizes the current moment in technology and contemplates its implications: the identity-validating pleasures and perils of online visibility; our newly adopted view of daily life through the lens of what is share-worthy; and the surveillance state operated by social media platforms--Facebook, Google, Twitter, and others--to mine our personal data for advertising revenue: an invasion of our lives that is as pervasive as government spying. Jacob Silverman calls for social media users to take back ownership of their digital selves from the Silicon Valley corporations who claim to know what's best for them. Integrating politics, sociology, national security, pop culture, and technology, he reveals the surprising conformity at the heart of Internet culture, explaining how social media companies engineer their products to encourage shallow engagement and discourage dissent. Reflecting on the collapsed barriers between our private and public lives, Silverman brings into focus the inner conflict we feel when deciding what to share and what to "like," and explains how we can take the steps we need to free ourselves from its grip."--Publisher description.  a8 16 29 43 0aInformation technologyxSocial aspects. 0aInformation technologyxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aPrivacy, Right of. 0aElectronic surveillancexSocial aspects.  aHM 851 S554 2015wLCc1i34917001374748d9/12/2015e9/2/2015lON_SHELFmKEYANOn4p$18.99rYsYtBOOKu3/9/2015o.STAFF.
