UN peace operations are a vital component of international conflict management. Since the end of the Cold War one of the foremost developments has been the rise of UN policing (UNPOL). Instances of UNPOL action have increased dramatically in number and have evolved from passive observation to participation in frontline law enforcement activities. Attempts to ascertain the impact of UNPOL activities have proven inadequate. This book seeks to redress this lacuna by investigating the ways in which the effects of peace operations - and UNPOL in particular - are monitored and evaluated. Furthermore, it aims to develop a framework, tested through field research in Liberia, for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) that enables more effective impact assessment. By enhancing the relationship between field-level M&E and organisational learning this research aims to make an important contribution to the pursuit of more professional and effective UN peace operations. This book will be of much interest to students of peace operations, conflict management, policing, security studies and IR in general"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 4320aUnited NationsxPeacekeeping forces. 0aInternational police. 0aPeace-buildingxInternational cooperation. 0aConflict managementxInternational cooperation. 0aInternational relations. 0aSecurity, International. 0aRoutledge studies in peace and conflict resolution.  aJZ 4971 H86 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035180221  aJZ 4971 H86 2015wLCc1i0162035180221lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu10/29/2014  aJZ 4971 H86 2015wLCc1i0162035195062d3/15/2017e2/27/2017lON_SHELFmUAHSSn3p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/26/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79021345
