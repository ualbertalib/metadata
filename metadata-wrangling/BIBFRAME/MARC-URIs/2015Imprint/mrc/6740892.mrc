Identifying core controversies surrounding teen pregnancy and parenting, this book resolves misperceptions using findings from large-scale, longitudinal, and qualitative research studies from the U.S. and other Western countries. Summarising the evidence and integrating it with a systems perspective, the authors explore ten prevalent myths about teenage parents, including: Teen pregnancy is associated with other behavior problems. Children of teen parents will experience cognitive delay, adjustment problems, and will themselves become teen parents. Better outcomes are achieved when teen mothers live with their own mothers. Teen pregnancy costs tax payers lots of money. Abstinence education is the best way to prevent teen pregnancy. Teen Pregnancy and Parenting ends by highlighting the prevention and intervention implications for families, practitioners, and policymakers. It will be of interest to academics and advanced students from a range of disciplines and professions including psychology, public policy, nursing, social work and sociology"--Provided by publisher.  a43 0aTeenage pregnancy. 0aParenting.12aPregnancy in Adolescence.22aParenting.22aSocial Perception.22aSocioeconomic Factors.1 aNicholson, Jody S.,eauthor.1 aFarris, Jaelyn Renee,eauthor. 0aRoutledge advances in health and social policy.  aRG 556.5 W44 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035188323  aRG 556.5 W44 2015wLCc1i0162035188323d3/22/2017e3/14/2017lON_SHELFmUAHSSn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/21/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2005061047bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/36651354
