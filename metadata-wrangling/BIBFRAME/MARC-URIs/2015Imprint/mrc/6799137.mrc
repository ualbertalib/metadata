Since first joining the London Institute of Education in 1965, he has made significant contributions to the landscape of the discipline through his teaching, research and numerous publications. His academic work encompasses a broad range of rich philosophical issues, ranging from questions surrounding the child's mind, through the moral and pedagogical obligations of teachers and schools, to local and national questions of educational policy. In this volume, international contributors address key issues in the philosophy of education, touching on significant contemporary concerns and demonstrating the breadth and influence of John White's work. Each chapter critically examines, builds on, and pays tribute to John White's unique contribution, considering how his work has impacted on the discipline of education as we know it today. Topics covered include: - policy and the role of philosophy of education - liberal education - the aims of education - moral education - leadership. Education, Philosophy and Wellbeing will appeal to postgraduate students and academics in the fields of history, policy, education studies, and philosophy, as well as to policy-makers, educational administrators and teachers"--cProvided by publisher.  a4110aWhite, John,d1934 November 7- 0aEducationxPhilosophy. 0aMoral education.1 aSuissa, Judith,d1966-eeditor of compilation.1 aWinstanley, Carrie,eeditor of compilation.1 aMarples, Roger,eeditor of compilation. 0aRoutledge research in education ;v122.  aLB 880 W482 E38 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035232212  aLB 880 W482 E38 2015wLCc1i0162035232212d1/17/2017e1/10/2017lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn3p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n98089249bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/27239387
