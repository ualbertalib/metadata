Jonah Kirk's story is all of those things as he draws readers into his life in the city as a young boy, introducing his indomitable grandfather, also a "piano man;" his single mother, a struggling singer; and the heroes, villains, and everyday saints and sinners who make up the fabric of the metropolis in which they live--and who will change the course of Jonah's life forever. Welcome to The City, a place of evergreen dreams where enchantment and malice entwine, where courage and honor are found in the most unexpected corners and the way forward lies buried deep inside the heart"-- Provided by publisher.  a3 35 0aMusiciansvFiction. 0aCity and town lifevFiction.1 aKoontz, Dean R.q(Dean Ray),d1945-tNeighbor.42aThe neighbor.08iReproduction of (manifestation):aKoontz, Dean (Dean Ray), 1945-tCity : a noveldNew York : Bantam Books, 2014h398 pages ; 25 cmw(DLC)  2014010553  aKOOwLCc1i30125302525695d7/6/2015e7/3/2015lPAPERBACKSmRED_DEER_Cn1rYsYtBOOKu3/4/2015  aMystery KOOwASISc1i33862001359102lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINp$8.99rYsYtPAPERBACKu5/5/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79081582bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/110880758
