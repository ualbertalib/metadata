The Psychology After Critique series brings together for the first time his most important papers. Each volume in the series has been prepared by Ian Parker and presents a newly written introduction and focused overview of a key topic area. Psychology After the Unconscious is the fifth volume in the series and addresses three central questions: - Why is Freud's concept of the unconscious important today? - Does language itself play a role in the creation of the unconscious? - How does Lacan radicalize Freud's notion of the unconscious in relation to cultural research? The book provides a clear explanation of Freudian and Lacanian accounts of the unconscious. It also highlights their role in offering a new way of describing, understanding and working with the human subject in clinical settings and in cultural research. Part One shows how the unconscious is elaborated in Freud's early case studies in Studies on Hysteria, while Part Two focuses on Lacan's re-working of the unconscious and its relationship to language and culture in his influential public seminars. The book also provides access to key debates currently occurring in Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, exploring both the clinical dimension and the consequences for psychological and cultural research. Psychology After the Unconscious is essential reading for students and researchers in psychology, psychosocial studies, sociology, social anthropology and cultural studies, and to psychoanalysts of different traditions engaged in academic research. It will also introduce key ideas and debates within critical psychology to undergraduates and postgraduate students across the social sciences"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 4310aLacan, Jacques,d1901-1981.10aFreud, Sigmund,d1856-1939. 0aSubconsciousness. 0aPsychoanalysis. 0aPsychology after critique.  aBF 315 P28937 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035191327  aBF 315 P28937 2015wLCc1i0162035191327d1/8/2016e11/26/2015lON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu12/9/2014  aBF 315 P28937 2015wLCc1i0162035192242lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu12/11/201401bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/34456780
