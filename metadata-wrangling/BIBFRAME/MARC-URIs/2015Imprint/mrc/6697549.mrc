This premiere learning resource provides everything you need to master course content, including clear explanations; a thorough synopsis of functional components, tracts, pathways, and systems; superb, high-quality MRI, CT, MRA, and MRV images; abundant color illustrations and photographs; hundreds of review questions; a wide range of clinical correlates; and a host of interactive online resources. To prepare you for exams and rotations, the atlas emphasizes the application of neuroanatomy concepts in clinical settings. Prepare for the boards with a wide range of multiple-choice USMLE-style review questions (with extensive explanations) and a vast online interactive question bank. Fine tune your understanding with innovative color illustrations that show clinical images of representative lesions integrated with the corresponding deficits. Prepare for rotations with color illustrations of pathways, lesions, and brain slices integrated with clinical images. Visualize structures as they appear both to the unaided eye and on imaging studies with superb MRI images. Build your clinical understanding with MRI/CT images that provide the clearest and most clinically relevant views of key structures using the latest imaging modalities. Test your understanding with the assessment section in Chapter 10 that serves as a practice test for neuroanatomy. Take your learning beyond the book with online resources, including interactive Q & A andinteractive atlas/labeling.--Provided by publisher.  a16 42 0aNeuroanatomyvAtlases.12aCentral Nervous Systemxanatomy & histologyvAtlases.  aQM 451 H18 2015c1hUAHL-Bi0162035159936  aQM 451 H18 2015wLCc1i0162035159936d2/19/2017e2/19/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmUAHLTHSCn8p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu9/25/2014  aQM 451 H18 2015 foliowLCc1i0162036895207lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu6/9/2016zCOUTTS_ADD01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81143479bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/34747343
