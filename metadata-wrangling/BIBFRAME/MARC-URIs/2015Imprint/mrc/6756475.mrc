(dyslexic pupil) "Fantastic ideas that engage learners in their learning. Thank you!" (Teaching Assistant) "I like finding tactics which help me win!" (dyslexic pupil) "My son is now asking to play spelling games!" (parent) "I like playing homework games with my dad." (dyslexic pupil) "Its easy to adapt a game to suit different topics." (Teacher) "Things aren't so difficult now I know how to make hard things fun." (dyslexic pupil) Dragonfly Games is designed for use with small groups of dyslexic pupils. These practical and varied resources can be used inside and outside of the classroom to encourage over-learning and revision of curriculum topics. Stimulating and fun to do, the games help pupils: overcome specific barriers to learning through the use of experience, over-learning and discovery; master skills beyond those of literacy and numeracy development, including thinking skills, tactical strategies, sequential application and gamesmanship; devise their own games, developing their ability to use varied methods of application. Useful for overcoming learning weaknesses within their own specific profile. Fully updated in its second edition, this book builds on the success of the author's Dragonfly Worksheets, as featured in her previous book Supporting Dyslexia Pupils Across the Curriculum and can be used independently or in conjunction with it"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aDyslexic childrenxEducation. 0aSpelling disability. 0aSpelling games. 0aEnglish languagexOrthography and spellingvProblems, exercises, etc.  aLC 4708 R39 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035195906  aLC 4708 R39 2015wLCc1i0162035195906lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu12/9/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb97032023bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/14258974
