In the last two decades there has been a lot of development in designing algorithms for background subtraction, as well as wide use of these algorithms in various important applications, such as visual surveillance, sports video analysis, motion capture, etc. Various statistical approaches have been proposed to model scene backgrounds. The concept of background subtraction also has been extended to detect objects from videos captured from moving cameras. This book reviews the concept and practice of background subtraction. We discuss several traditional statistical background subtraction models, including the widely used parametric Gaussian mixture models and non-parametric models. We also discuss the issue of shadow suppression, which is essential for human motion analysis applications. This book discusses approaches and tradeoffs for background maintenance. This book also reviews many of the recent developments in background subtraction paradigm. Recent advances in developing algorithms for background subtraction from moving cameras are described, including motion-compensation-based approaches and motion-segmentation-based approaches.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on December 24, 2014).  a44 0aImage stabilization. 0aImage processingxDigital techniques. 0aSynthesis digital library of engineering and computer science. 0aSynthesis lectures on computer vision ;v# 6.x2153-1064403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2200/S00613ED1V01Y201411COV006  hUAINzSYNTHDIG  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6771830-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/9/2015xE-BOOKzSYNTHDIG01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/306104453
