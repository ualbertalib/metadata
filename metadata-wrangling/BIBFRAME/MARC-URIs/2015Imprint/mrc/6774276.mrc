The nonlinear behaviors of DC-DC converters have been studied heavily over the past 20 years, yet researchers are still unsure of the practical application of bifurcations and chaos in switching converters. The electromagnetic interference (EMI), which resulted from the high rates of changes of voltage and current, has become a major design criterion in DC-DC converters due to wide applications of various electronic devices in industry and daily life, and the question of how to reduce the annoying, harmful EMI has attracted much research interest. This book focuses on the analysis and application of chaos to reduce harmful EMI of DC-DC converters.  After a review of the fundamentals of chaos behaviors of DC-DC converters, the authors present some recent findings such as Symbolic Entropy, Complexity and Chaos Point Process, to analyze the characters of chaotic DC-DC converters. Using these methods, the statistic characters of chaotic DC-DC converters are extracted and the foundations for the following researches of chaotic EMI suppression are reinforced. The focus then transfers to estimating the power spectral density of chaotic PWM converters behind an introduction of basic principles of spectrum analysis and chaotic PWM technique. Invariant Density, and Prony and Wavelet analysis methods are suggested for estimating the power spectral density of chaotic PWM converters.  Finally, some design-oriented applications provide a good example of applying chaos theory in engineering practice, and illustrate the effectiveness on suppressing EMI of the proposed chaotic PWM.  Introduces chaos theory, its analytical methods and the means to apply chaos to the switching power supply design  Approaches the subject in a systematic manner from analyzing method, chaotic phenomenon and EMI characteristics, analytical methods for chaos, and applying chaos to reduce EMI (electromagnetic interference)  Highlights advanced research work in the fields of statistic characters of nonlinear behaviors and chaotic PWM technology to suppress EMI of switching converters  Bridges the gap between numerical theory and real-world applications, enabling power electronics designers to both analyze the effects of chaos and leverage these effects to reduce EMI  "--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print version record.  a21 35 44 57 60 0aDC-to-DC converters. 0aElectromagnetic interferencexPrevention. 0aChaotic behavior in systems.1 aWang, Xuemeic(Electrical engineer),eauthor.403Concordia University of Edmonton Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/concordiaab/Doc?id=10986567zfrom ebrary403Grande Prairie Regional College Accessuhttp://ezproxy.agpc.talonline.ca:80/login?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/gprc/Doc?id=10986567zfrom ebrary403MacEwan University Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/macewan/Doc?id=10986567z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)zfrom ebrary403Red Deer College Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/rdcollege/Doc?id=10986567zfrom ebrary403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781118451106z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINmCONCORDIAzEBRARYACCN  hUAINmGPRC_INTzEBRARYACGP  hUAINmGR_MAC_INTzEBRARYACGM  hUAINmRED_DEER_CzEBRARYACRD  aebr10986567  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6774276-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/12/2015xE-BOOKzWILEYOL  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6774276-2001kDISCARDlINTERNETmCONCORDIArYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/6/2016xE-BOOKzEBRARYACCN  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6774276-3001kDISCARDlINTERNETmGPRC_INTrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/6/2016xE-BOOKzEBRARYACGP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6774276-4001kDISCARDlINTERNETmGR_MAC_INTrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/6/2016xE-BOOKzEBRARYACGM  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6774276-5001kDISCARDlINTERNETmRED_DEER_CrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/6/2016xE-BOOKzEBRARYACRD01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014035198bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/309818682
