Its influence on reputational value and customer decision-making is only now beginning to be understood. Interest in corporate branding is exploding as marketing academics and professionals begin to realise how it can boost business performance in measurable ways. For example, it promotes customer patronage without expensive advertising and raises profitability by enabling companies to leverage their brand image when buying from particular sources.Yet there are few empirical studies available to clarify its basic tenets and fewer still that help us understand corporate branding in different parts of the world. Existing books focus mainly on conceptual ideas and real-life examples. Corporate Branding: Areas, Arenas and Approaches is a unique take on corporate branding that provides a global overview through rigorous research of different geographical areas across industries. An international range of leading scholars contribute their coverage across three clear themes:Area: Geographical areas across the globe including the UK, US, Europe and AsiaArena: A variety of commercial and not-for-profit sectors, both B2B and B2C Approach: Methodological approaches to brand research design, including qualitative, quantitative, case studies, interpretivistic and social narrative. These three themes enable the reader to consider corporate branding from more perspectives and in more ways than any other corporate branding book. The result is an understanding of this strategically important, growing subject that can't be found anywhere else. This book is an essential read for any branding student or interested professional.
