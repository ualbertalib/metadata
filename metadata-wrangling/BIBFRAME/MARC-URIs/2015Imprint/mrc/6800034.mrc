So far, the majority of opinions favor a consensus that both approaches are relevant and should be used complementarily for optimal results. This book provides unique insights into the experience of seasoned academics regarding embedding business ethics into their teaching of the practice of management. Its multidisciplinary approach makes its content very rich, since the insights of our colleagues from within their fields are invaluable. The book therefore functions as a handbook for faculty as well as a complementary textbook for the business student (to highlight the ethical dilemmas for the different managerial functional roles). Disciplines covered include decision- making, strategy and agency theory; management accounting and macroeconomics; operations management, supply chain management and the management of information systems; marketing and consumer behavior; human resources management, career management, negotiation, managing corporate power and politics, and community and investor relations.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on January 11, 2015).  a44 0aBusiness ethics. 0aPrinciples of responsible management education collection.x2331-0022403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=11001839  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800034-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/312603120
