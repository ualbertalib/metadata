Traditionally, these challenges have hindered high resolution imaging by restricting both bandwidth and aperture, and by imposing uniformity and bounds on sampling rates.Compressive Sensing for Urban Radar is the first book to focus on a hybrid of two key areas: compressive sensing and urban sensing. It explains how reliable imaging, tracking, and localization of indoor targets can be achieved using compressed observations that amount to a tiny percentage of the entire data volume. Capturing the latest and most important advances in the field, this state-of-the-art text:Covers both ground-based and airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and uses different signal waveforms Demonstrates successful applications of compressive sensing for target detection and revealing building interiors Describes problems facing urban radar and highlights sparse reconstruction techniques applicable to urban environmentsDeals with both stationary and moving indoor targets in the presence of wall clutter and multipath exploitation Provides numerous supporting examples using real data and computational electromagnetic modeling Featuring 13 chapters written by leading researchers and experts, Compressive Sensing for Urban Radar is a useful and authoritative reference for radar engineers and defense contractors, as well as a seminal work for graduate students and academia"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aThrough-the-wall radar imaging. 0aData compression (Telecommunication) 0aSampling (Statistics)1 aAmin, Moeness G.,eeditor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781466597853z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6677744-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu9/15/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2010052826bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/140961660
