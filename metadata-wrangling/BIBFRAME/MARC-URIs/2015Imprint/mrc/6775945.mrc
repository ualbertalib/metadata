This book stages a critical conversation between the interdisciplinary fields of museum studies, heritage studies and development studies to explore this under-researched sphere of development intervention. In an agenda-setting introduction, the editors explore the seemingly oppositional temporalities and values represented by these 'past-making' and 'future-making' projects, arguing that these provide a framework for mutual critique. Contributors to the volume bring insights from a wide range of academic and practitioner perspectives on a series of international case studies, which each raise challenging questions that reach beyond merely cultural concerns and fully engage with both the legacies of colonial power inequalities and the shifting geopolitical dynamics of contemporary international relations. Cultural heritage embodies different values and can be instrumentalized to serve different economic, social and political objectives within development contexts, but the past is also intrinsic to the present and is foundational to people's aspirations for the future. Museums, Heritage and International Development explores the problematics as well as potentials, the politics as well as possibilities, in this fascinating nexus"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aMuseumsxPolitical aspectszDeveloping countries. 0aMuseumsxSocial aspectszDeveloping countries. 0aMuseumsxEconomic aspectszDeveloping countries. 0aCultural propertyxProtectionzDeveloping countries. 0aHistoric preservationzDeveloping countries. 0aEconomic developmentzDeveloping countries. 0aSustainable developmentzDeveloping countries. 0aInternational relations. 0aDeveloping countriesxCultural policy. 0aDeveloping countriesxColonial influence.1 aBasu, Paul,eeditor.1 aModest, Wayne,eeditor. 0aRoutledge studies in culture and development ;v1.423Cover imageuhttp://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/websmall/978041565/9780415659512.jpg  aAM 7 M8846 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035220712  aAM 7 M8846 2015wLCc1i0162035220712lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2012071431bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/281933400
