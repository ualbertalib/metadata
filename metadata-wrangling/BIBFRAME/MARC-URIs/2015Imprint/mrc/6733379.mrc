What kinds (and amounts) of screen time boost learning and development--and what kinds may be harmful? What is the right age for a game console or a smartphone? How can kids and teens be protected from cyberbullying and learn to be good digital citizens? What impact do parents' technology habits have? In her busy psychiatry practice--and while raising her own kids--Jodi Gold sees every day both the mind-boggling benefits and the serious downsides of technology. In a positive, accessible style, she gives parents a wealth of practical strategies for navigating the digital frontier and creating realistic, doable rules and expectations for the whole family"--cProvided by publisher.  a3 28 0aInternet and children. 0aParenting. 0aSocial media.  aHQ 784 I58 G65 2015wLCc1i31847001270021d10/29/2015e10/20/2015lON_SHELFmGPRC_GPn5p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/7/2014  a649.1 GOLwDEWEYc1i33862001353360d11/30/2016e11/21/2016lON_SHELFmNORQ_MAINn3p$12.64rYsYtBOOKu1/21/201501bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/68222928
