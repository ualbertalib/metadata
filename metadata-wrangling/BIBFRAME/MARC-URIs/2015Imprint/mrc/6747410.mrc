This relationship developed against the backdrop of a far broader, and deeply consequential meeting: between Japan's long-standing, Chinese-influenced intellectual and institutional forms, and the politics, science, philosophy, and religion of the post-Enlightenment West. In striving to craft a modern society and culture that could exist on terms with - rather than be subsumed by - western power and influence, Japan became home to a religion--psy dialogue informed by pressing political priorities and rapidly shifting cultural concerns.  aDescription based on print version record.  a44 0aPsychotherapyzJapan. 0aPsychotherapyxReligious aspects. 0aPsychology and religionzJapan.1 aHarding, Christopher.1 aFumiaki, Iwata.1 aShin'ichi, Yoshinaga. 0aRoutledge contemporary Japan series.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=846870z(Single User Access)  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6747410-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu11/28/2014xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/314898951
