Kevin's guilt wasn't proven, but Max and Kevin's friendship never recovered and Max moved across the country shortly afterward. She never looked back. Thirteen years later, Max, now a successful investigative reporter, returns home to attend Kevin's funeral. The police say it was suicide, but Kevin's little sister doesn't believe it. Nor does she believe that Kevin committed murder all those years ago, and she begs Max to help clear Kevin's name. For Max, digging into Kevin's life means facing demons from her own past, as well as crossing a stubborn detective who wants Max to stay the hell away from his case. Soon it becomes terrifyingly clear that someone will do whatever it takes to make sure the truth stays buried. Allison Brennan, author of the New York Times bestselling Lucy Kincaid series in mass market, debuts in hardcover with a dynamic new character in Max Revere and an absolutely riveting thriller"-- Provided by publisher. 0aWomen journalistsvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction.08iReproduction of (manifestation):aBrennan, Allison.tNotoriousdNew York : Minotaur Books, 2014hviii, 326 pages ; 24 cm.w(DLC)  2013032878  a35  aBREwLCc1i30125302523096d7/12/2016e6/22/2016lPAPERBACKSmRED_DEER_Cn1rYsYtBOOKu1/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2006012763bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/306303632
