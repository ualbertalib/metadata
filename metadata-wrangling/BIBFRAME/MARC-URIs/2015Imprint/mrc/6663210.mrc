The program is open source and can be downloaded and used, free of charge, from www.blender.org. Blender is a challenging program but it has limitless possibilities and will give you a wonderful understanding of computer animation. Due to the complexity of the subject, it is not possible to cover everything. This manual is designed for beginners to help with the very basics of computer animation using Blender. My approach has been to introducing the program through the Graphical User Interface by introduce the different features with reference to the interface and providing examples. Blender has many facets which allow the user to create and animate models and figures in scenes and finally compile feature movies. There is also the facility to interact with the models and create video games"--cProvided by publisher.  a3100aBlender (Computer file) 0aComputer animation. 0aThree-dimensional display systems. 0aComputer graphics.  i31979000585032hSKING-RF-BlON_SHELF  aTR 897.7 B573 2015wLCc1i31979000585032lON_SHELFmKINGSrYsYtBOOKu8/21/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2012009976bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/232221922
