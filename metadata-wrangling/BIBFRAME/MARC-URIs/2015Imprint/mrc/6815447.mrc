Using participatory theatre can break the uncomfortable silence, and with over 700 performances across Canada, Jane Heather's play Are We There Yet? has been an effective tool for teaching teen sexuality since 1998. The play and program were the subject of a major impact assessment and researchers of many kinds examined how and why theatre can make change. This comprehensive, well-organized volume by two leading experts offers a rich diversity of material and analysis. The play appears in the volume and is available for separate purchase as a reproducible PDF, and a video production of examples of theatrical participation is included on a pocketed DVD. Theatre, Teens, Sex Ed will be a valuable resource for academics, practitioners, and specialist readerships in the fields of theatre, sex education, sociology, and public health"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 4310aHeather, Jane.tAre we there yet? 0aSex instruction for teenagers. 0aTeenagersxSexual behavior. 0aParticipatory theater. 0aDrama in education.1 aHeather, Jane,eauthor.12aHeather, Jane.tAre we there yet?  aHQ 35 S442 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035244704  aHQ 35 S442 2015wLCc1i0162035244704d6/5/2015e4/4/2015lON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/4/2015  aHQ 35 S442 2015wLCc1i0162026614709lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$100.00rYsYtBOOKu7/7/201601ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2015060511
