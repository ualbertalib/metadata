It continues to provide undergraduates with the foundation they need to understand the field, going back to the adoption of the First Amendment, and quickly brings them up to speed with the most current issues. In their popular conversational style, Don Pember and Clay Calvert introduce students to the newest threats to journalism and the role technology plays in the field of mass media law. The attention this program provides to both historical and contemporary issues gives students the background they need to fully understand the controversies surrounding speech and press across media"--cProvided by publisher.  a"Since the last edition of the textbook, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down important rulings in more than a half-dozen, high-profile cases affecting freedom of speech, access to information, and jury bias. Those rulings from 2010 and 2011, all of which are addressed in this new edition, include - United States v. Stevens, in which the Court declared as unconstitutionally overbroad a federal statute that criminalized the commercial creation, sale or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty, and, in particular, so-called "crush videos" (see Chapters 1 and 2). In issuing its ruling, the Court refused to carve out a new category of unprotected speech for images of animal cruelty - Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, in which the Court declared unconstitutional a California statute limiting minors' access to purchasing and renting violent video games (see Chapter 2). The decision hopefully will put an end to similar state and local legislation that seems to be adopted every time a school shooting occurs and legislators blame the violent media content"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aMass mediaxLaw and legislationzUnited States. 0aPress lawzUnited States.1 aCalvert, Clayc(Law professor),eauthor.  aKF2750 .P46 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007432238p219.11kAVAIL_SOON  aKF2750 .P46 2015wLCc1i1007432238d1/23/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$219.11rYsYtBOOKu1/8/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2013080156bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/220328957
