Jan Baetens and Hugo Frey explore this exciting form of visual and literary communication, showing readers how to situate and analyze graphic novels since their rise to prominence half a century ago. Several key questions are addressed: What is the graphic novel? How do we read graphic novels as narrative forms? Why is page design and publishing format so significant? What theories are developing to explain the genre? How is this form blurring the categories of high and popular literature? Why are graphic novelists nostalgic for the old comics? The authors address these and many other questions raised by the genre. Through their analysis of the works of many well-known graphic novelists - including Bechdel, Clowes, Spiegelman and Ware - Baetens and Frey offer significant insights for future teaching and research on the graphic novel"--cProvided by publisher.  a28 43 0aGraphic novelsxHistory and criticism. 0aComic books, strips, etc.xHistory and criticism.1 aFrey, Hugo,eauthor.423Cover imageuhttp://assets.cambridge.org/97811076/55768/cover/9781107655768.jpg  aPN 6710 B235 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035234275  aPN 6710 B235 2015wLCc1i0162035234275d3/20/2017e3/4/2017lON_SHELFmUAHSSn13p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/2015  aPN 6710 B235 2015wLCc1i31847001273892d3/15/2017e3/9/2017lON_SHELFmGPRC_GPn7p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/23/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr2004030974bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/36475195
