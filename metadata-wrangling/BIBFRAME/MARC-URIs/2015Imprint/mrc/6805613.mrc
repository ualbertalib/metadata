Some are synthetic while many others are products of nature. Molecules That Amaze Us presents the stories behind many of the most famous and infamous molecules that make up our modern world. Examples include the molecule responsible for the spicy heat in chilies (capsaicin), the world's first synthetic painkiller (aspirin), the pigment responsible for the color of autumn leaves (carotene), the explosive in dynamite (nitroglycerine), the antimalarial drug (quinine), the drug known as "speed" (methamphetamine), and many others. Other molecules discussed include caffeine, adrenaline, cholesterol, cocaine, digitalis, dopamine, glucose, insulin, methane, nicotine, oxytocin, penicillin, carbon dioxide, limonene, and testosterone. In all, the book includes 67 sections, each describing a different molecule, what it does, how it is made, and why it is so interesting. Written by experts in the field, the book is accessible and easy to read. It includes amusing anecdotes, historical curiosities, and entertaining facts about each molecule, thereby balancing educational content with entertainment. The book is heavily illustrated with relevant photographs, images, and cartoons--the aim being both to educate and entertain."--cProvided by publisher.  a"In the mid 1990s, soon after the World Wide Web became a reality, several chemists decided that Molecule of the Month websites would be a good way of disseminating information about interesting molecules in an accessible way. One of these websites, based at Bristol University in the UK, was set up in 1996 by one of the authors (PWM) and administered by him ever since - making it one of the longest running chemistry websites on the web! Over the years, the other author (SAC) contributed over 50 articles for the site, and it has now become a valuable chemistry resource for schools, colleges, or the interested layperson alike. At a time when more teaching materials are produced in an electronic format, the reader may wonder why the authors have bucked the trend, essentially proceeding in the reverse direction and turning electronic articles into a hardcopy book. Well, words in print still have life in them, and some readers do prefer to have a book in their hands. It also cannot be denied that there is a feel- good factor in seeing the articles in a more permanent form. Some of these articles have appeared on the Bristol MOT M site before, but all have been updated for these pages, and many are brand-new. We hope that they appeal to a wide readership; the chemistry is meant to be intelligible to a high-school student, but the stories that lie behind the molecules can appeal to any interested person. Chemicals are morally neutral; they can be put to either good or bad uses. We have tried to be light-hearted in our approach to the subject matter, but rest assured, every fact stated here is believed by the authors to be utterly true"--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a52 0aChemistryvPopular works. 0aChemistryvHumor.1 aCotton, S.
