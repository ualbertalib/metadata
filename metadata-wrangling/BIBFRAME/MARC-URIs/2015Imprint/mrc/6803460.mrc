Who has it. Who doesn't. How you get it. How you don't. In Refund, Bender creates an award-winning collection of stories that deeply explore the ways in which money and the estimation of value affect the lives of her characters. The stories in Refund reflect our contemporary world-swindlers, reality show creators, desperate artists, siblings, parents - who try to answer the question: What is the real definition of worth? In "Theft," an eighty-year-old swindler, accustomed to tricking people for their money, boards a cruise ship to see if she can find something of true value-a human connection. In "Anything for Money," the creator of a reality show is thrown into the real world when his estranged granddaughter reenters his life in need of a new heart; and in the title story, young artist parents in downtown Manhattan escape the attack on 9/11 only to face a battle over their subletted apartment with a stranger who might have lost more than only her deposit. Set in contemporary America, these stories herald a work of singular literary merit by an important writer at the height of her power"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aMoneyvFiction. 0aWealthxMoral and ethical aspectsvFiction.  aPS 3552 E53849 A6 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035235504  aPS 3552 E53849 A6 2015wLCc1i0162035235504d10/13/2016e10/8/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSn10p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n99263345bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/36251770
