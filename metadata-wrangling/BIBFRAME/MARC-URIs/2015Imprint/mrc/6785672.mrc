(Augie) Merasty was one of an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and Metis children who were taken from their families and sent to government-funded, church-run schools, where they were subjected to a policy of "aggressive assimiliation." As Merasty recounts, these schools did more than attempt to mold children in the ways of white society. They were taught to be ashamed of their native heritage and, as he experienced, often suffered physical and sexual abuse. Even as he looks back on this painful part of his childhood, Merasty’s generous and authentic voice shines through. -- Publisher.  a52 0aIndians of North AmericazCanadavBiography. 0aAdult child abuse victimszCanadavBiography. 0aIndians of North AmericazCanadaxResidential schools.1 aCarpenter, David,d1941-eauthor.  hGMAC-OS-B  bQACfQGMhGMAC-OS-Bp19.32q1z9780889773684  aE 96.5 M475 2015wLCc1i38288001128401d3/16/2017e4/17/2015f3/5/2015g1lON_SHELFmLAKELND_LLn3rYsYtBOOKu1/20/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n78006930bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/55330236
