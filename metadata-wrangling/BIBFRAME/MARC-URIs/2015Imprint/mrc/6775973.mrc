Employing a typology developed by the European Union Democracy Observatory on Citizenship, he convincingly shows that different nationality laws can be compared by using a systematic analytical grid. The individual country chapters additionally pay due regard to issues such as dual citizenship and statelessness, and include thorough historical observations as well as extensive bibliographical references for each state. 'Nationality Law in the Western Hemisphere' allows academics, practitioners, governments and international organizations to assess nationality legislation beyond a purely national context.  a45 0aEmigration and immigration lawzAmerica. 0aNaturalizationzAmerica. 0aCitizenship, Loss ofzAmerica.  aKDZ 561 V66 2015c1hUALA-Bi0162035220522  aKDZ 561 V66 2015wLCc1i0162035220522lON_SHELFmUALAWp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2012007169bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/232474181
