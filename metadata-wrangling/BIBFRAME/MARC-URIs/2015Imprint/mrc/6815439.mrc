Like William Wordsworth, who revised The Prelude over the course of his life, Williams revisited her epic several times within almost four decades, transforming it with each revision. It began as an ambitious poetic blueprint for revolution in terms of politics, gender, religion, and genre. By the time it appeared in 1823, under the title "Peruvian Tales" in her last poetry collection, Williams's voice had become more moderate, more restrained; in her words, her muse had become "timid," reflecting the cultural shift that had taken place in England since the poem's earliest publication. This edition includes both versions of the poem, along with extensive examples of Williams's literary sources, other poetic works, and the many and varied critical responses from contemporary reviewers"--Provided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 237-241).  a43 0aPeruvPoetry.1 aFeldman, Paula R.,eeditor. 0aBroadview editions.  aPR 3765 W54 A6 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035250339  aPR 3765 W54 A6 2015wLCc1i0162035250339d9/28/2016e8/17/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79143358bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/36947104
