Both North and South knew Robert E. Lee as the son of George Washington's most famous eulogist and the son-in-law of Washington's adopted child. Each side sought his service for high command. Lee could choose only one. Here, former White House speechwriter Jonathan Horn reveals how the officer most associated with Washington went to war against the Union that Washington had forged. This extensively researched and gracefully written biography follows Lee through married life, military glory, and misfortune. The story that emerges is more complicated, more tragic, and more illuminating than the familiar tale. As Washington was the man who would not be king, Lee was the man who would not be Washington. The choice was Lee's. The story is America's.--From publisher description.  a4310aLee, Robert E.q(Robert Edward),d1807-1870.10aWashington, George,d1732-1799xInfluence. 0aGeneralszConfederate States of AmericavBiography. 0aUnited StatesxHistoryyCivil War, 1861-1865vBiography.  aE 467.1 L4 H749 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035240041  aE 467.1 L4 H749 2015wLCc1i0162035240041d2/12/2016e2/1/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n86140996bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/31432428
