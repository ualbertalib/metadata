Numbering over 50 million, they currently represent about 16 percent of the population. This number is estimated to rise to about 102 million by 2050. Hispanic Latinos engage in a diversity of jobs that help keep the American economic engine running. The practice of entrepreneurship has been on the rise with over 2.3 million businesses in the United States categorized as Hispanic owned, generating over $345 billion in sales. This book examines the entrepreneurial mindset of Hispanic-Latinos in the United States. With limited literature on the subject, the authors created a pioneering book that captures the viewpoints of real-life Hispanic-Latino entrepreneurs. Using a 15-item questionnaire, the authors obtained information on entrepreneurial intent, goals, and business strategies utilized. Among several findings, the completed study uncovered that (1) real world experiences and challenges are relevant frameworks for entrepreneurial success, (2) race has not posed as a barrier for entrepreneurial pursuit, and (3) hard work, discipline and a positive mindset are anchors for success. The literature offers inspirational stories and innovative ideas that define a new age of business in the United States. The book is valuable to the Hispanic-Latino community, teachers and students of entrepreneurship, executives and entrepreneurs, government officials and organizations, policy makers, and minority entrepreneurs worldwide.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on December 21, 2014).  a44 0aEntrepreneurshipzUnited States. 0aHispanic American businesspeoplezUnited States.1 aSpain, Michelle Ingram.,eauthor. 0aEntrepreneurship and small business management collection.x1946-5661403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=10997460  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800020-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/316565844
