Based on his wildly popular speaking engagements, Let the Elephants Run shows us how to reignite creativity whether in the head office, the home office or the artist’s studio. Usher believes creativity is in our DNA; it's in everyone, not just the creative class. We all start our lives as creative beings but for many that spark becomes lost over time. How do we jump-start our creative process as adults? What does it means to be a creative person? How do we follow through with our ideas and turn them into tangible outcomes? Usher empowers readers to achieve more “aha” moments through two cornerstone principles of creativity: freedom and structure. Using a mix of personal anecdotes and professional examples from the worlds of industry, technology, science, music and art, he shows us that creativity is not magic; it is a learnable skill that any person or business can master. The dynamic full-colour design includes photographs, artwork and illustrations, as well as action pages to help readers start cultivating the habit of documenting their ideas for future execution.  a28 330 aCreative ability.4 3Imageu http://images.contentreserve.com/ImageType-100/2016-1/{DCE1B650-B3CE-4468-958E-7175D8A6D2EF}Img100.jpg  aBF 408 U84 2015wLCc1i0164000771356d6/19/2015e5/18/2015lON_SHELFmOLDSn4rYsYtBOOKu3/16/2015  aON ORDERwORDERc1i6812332-2001lON-ORDERmGPRC_GPp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/8/201701ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2016069683bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/90570971
