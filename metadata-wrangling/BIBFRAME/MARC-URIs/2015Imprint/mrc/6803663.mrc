Based on new primary and archival materials, as well as on original interviews with former US and Chilean officials, it traces the evolution of Reagan policy from an initial 'close embrace' of the junta to a re-evaluation of whether Pinochet was a risk to long-term US interests in Chile and, finally, to an acceptance in Washington of the need to push for a return to democracy. It provides fresh insights into the bureaucratic conflicts that were a key part of the Reagan decision-making process and reveals not only the successes but also the limits of US influence on Pinochet's regime. Finally, it contributes to the ongoing debate about the US approach toward democracy promotion in the Third World over the past half century"--cProvided by publisher.2 a"During the first three decades of the twentieth century, the United States transformed itself from a dominant regional into a competitive global power, all the while projecting its power abroad driven less by a desire 'to make the world safe for democracy' than to put down nationalist threats to an expanding U.S. capital and commerce. Throughout the Cold War era, the gap between idealistic rhetoric and policy practice showed no signs of closing: the verbal commitment to promoting democracy by American presidents 'with few exceptions...' was distinctly secondary to the U.S. quest for private economic opportunity and public support for military-dominated regimes that would maintain order"--cProvided by publisher.  a4410aReagan, Ronald.10aPinochet Ugarte, Augusto. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationszChile. 0aChilexForeign relationszUnited States. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationsy1981-1989.1 aMcGillion, Chris,d1954-403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316104217  bTHIfQGMhGMCT-OS-Bp36.95q1z9781107458093  hGMCT-OS-B  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6803663-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/11/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2002022566bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/34690542
