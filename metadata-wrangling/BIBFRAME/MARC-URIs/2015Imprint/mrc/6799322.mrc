Throughout that period Chinese geographers have studied these processes from close at hand, drawing on sources that are far from easy to access, and publishing their results in Chinese. Much of this research has underpinned the assessment of policies and the policy choices of the Chinese government at different levels, and yet it is not well-known outside of China. This volume deals with aspects of the socio-economic geography of China's transformation including its changing relations with the rest of the world, although it also deals with the impact of China's development path on China's ecological systems. Each chapter deals with aggregate trends and with specific cases to show the ways in which the particular characteristics of China's economic and social order (economic organisation, political system and cultural model and values) have shaped and are shaped by its geography"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aRural developmentzChina. 0aRegional planningzChina. 0aMigration, InternalzChina.1 aDunford, Michael,eeditor.1 aWeidong, Liu,eeditor. 0aRoutledge studies in the modern world economy ;v133.  aHN49 .C6 G46 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007437955p193.69kAVAIL_SOON  aHN49 .C6 G46 2015wLCc1i1007437955d5/1/2015e4/21/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn1p$184.47rYsYtBOOKu2/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr96012688bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/18360830
