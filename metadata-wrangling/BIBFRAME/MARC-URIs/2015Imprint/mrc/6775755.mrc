This study argues that New York authors do not simply depict masculinity as a social and historical construction but seek to challenge the archetypal ideals of masculinity by writing counter-hegemonic narratives. Gendering canonical New York writers, namely Paul Auster, Bret Easton Ellis, and Don DeLillo, illustrates how explorations of masculinity are tied into the principal themes that have defined the American novel from its very beginning. The themes that feature in this study include the role of the novel in American society; the individual and (urban) society; the journey from innocence to awareness (of masculinity); the archetypal image of the absent and/or patriarchal father; the impact of homosocial relations on the everyday performance of masculinity; male sexuality; and the male individual and globalization. What connects these contemporary New York writers is their employment of the one of the great figures in the history of literature: the flâneur. These authors take the flâneur from the shadows of the Manhattan streets and elevate this figure to the role of self-reflexive agent of male subjectivity through which they write counter-hegemonic narratives of masculinity. This book is an essential reference for those with an interest in gender studies and contemporary American fiction"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 0aAmerican fictiony20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aAmerican fictiony21st centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aMasculinity in literature. 0aSex role in literature. 0aMen in literature. 0aFlaneurs in literature. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xIn literature. 0aRoutledge transnational perspectives on American literature ;v25.  aPS 374 M37 F47 2014c1hUAAU-Bi0162035220175  aPS 374 M37 F47 2014wLCc1i0162035220175d1/30/2017e1/30/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmUAAUGn4p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu1/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014034830bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/73308653
