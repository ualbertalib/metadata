But contrary to other disrupting technologies such as nuclear energy or genetics, the scientific community has started to investigate the risks associated with novel nanomaterials early in the development phase. Although there are still gaps in our knowledge of the risks presented by nanomaterials, we now know enough to describe scenarios that are too high-risk to implement as well as scenarios for the safe use of nanomaterials. The goal of this book is to help the reader in making such safely decisions"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aNanostructured materialsxEnvironmental aspects. 0aNanostructured materialsxHealth aspects. 0aNanoparticlesxToxicology.1 aWohlleben, Wendel,eeditor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781466567887z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6786197-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/20/2015xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014050940bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/310613809
