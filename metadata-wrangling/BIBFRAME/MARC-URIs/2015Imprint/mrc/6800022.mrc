The issue of this book is to be seen in the fact that controlling departments are hardly involved in sustainability topics and do not contribute to corporate responsibility. This book postulates the following assertion: responsible controlling is indispensable to make an organization more responsible. The objective of this book is the conceptual development of a responsible controlling framework toward decision making which is based on an ethical fundament in order to make a company a responsible business.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on December 21, 2014).  a44 0aManagerial accounting. 0aControllership. 0aSustainability. 0aPrinciples of responsible management education collection.x2331-0022403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=10997462  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800022-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2017018265bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/1.96414814951e+21
