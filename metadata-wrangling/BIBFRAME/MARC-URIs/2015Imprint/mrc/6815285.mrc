Arranged broadly chronologically, the book looks at the overnight revolutions, the flashes of inspiration and the long-term evolutions that advertisers have wrought upon their industry. Author Simon Veksner guides us through the key ideas behind these changes, from the development of the first advertising formats and the history of branding, to the creative revolutions of the 1960s and the digital age. Looking forward, the book considers the most recent thinking in reaching new audiences, including the rise of neuromarketing and the latest behavioural economics. Illustrated with hundreds of examples of adverts and explaining their power to inspire, delight and annoy, but above all, to make us buy, the book is an absorbing guide to a turbulent, highly-creative industry.  a43 0aAdvertisingxHistory. 0aMarketing. 0aBranding (Marketing)  aHF 5811 V45 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035247996  aHF 5811 V45 2015wLCc1i0162035247996d6/3/2015e5/25/2015lON_SHELFmUAHSSn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2011039513bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/160174571
