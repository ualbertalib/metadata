Filled with laughs-a-minute, this sexy novel will appeal to fans of Jill Shalvis, Kristan Higgins, and Rachel Gibson. "Is there a problem, officer?" Small-town cop Sam West certainly doesn't mind a routine traffic stop--speeding ticket, stern warning, and "sayonara." And with a whopper of a blizzard closing in, that's all he has time for. But the lawbreaker he pulls over is anything but typical. From her mile-long legs to her razor-sharp wit, Maisa Bradley is like nothing Coot Lake, Minnesota, has ever seen...and she's about to take Sam on the ride of his life. Being bad has its benefits. Whoever said blood is thicker than water probably wasn't related to a former Russian mobster. But an innocent mix-up and rumors of stolen diamonds soon have the Russian mob taking an unusual interest in the sleepy little town--and Maisa facing heated scrutiny from a certain tall, dark, and handsome deputy. Sam's dazzling blue eyes beg her to reveal all her secrets, but how much should she tell? Getting snowed in with the sexiest lawman in the frozen north may not be the worst way to decide.  a3 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aPolicevFiction. 0aMinnesotavFiction. 0aLove stories.  aRomance HARwDEWEYc1i33862001358963lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINp$5.60rYsYtPAPERBACKu5/5/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb2008021392bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/265483775
