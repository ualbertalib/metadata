A growing global convergence between the market and the public sector means that private sector values, priorities, and forms of work organization increasingly permeate social and community services. As challenges facing people and communities become more layered and complex, our means of responding become more time-bound and reductionist. This book is premised on the belief in the revitalizing power of arts-informed approaches to social justice work; it affirms and invites creative responses to personal, community, and political struggles and aspirations. The projects described in the book address themes of colonization, displacement and forced migration, sexual violence, ableism, and vicarious trauma. Each chapter shows how art can facilitate transformation: by supporting processes of conscientization and enabling re-storying of selves and identities; by contributing to community and cultural healing, sustainability and resilience; by helping us understand and challenge oppressive social relations; and by deepening experiences, images, and practices of care." -- Publisher's description.  aIssued also in electronic format.  a8 28 29 43 0aArts and societyzCanada. 0aArts and societyzSouth Africa. 0aSocial servicezCanada. 0aSocial servicezSouth Africa. 0aSocial changezCanada. 0aSocial changezSouth Africa.1 aSinding, Christina,d1967-,eauthor,eeditor.1 aBarnes, Hazel,d1945-eauthor,eeditor.1 tSocial work artfully.dWaterloo, Ontario : Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2014.w(CaOONL)20149043902  hGMCT-OS-B  bPSWfQGMhGMCT-OS-Bp48.99q1z9781771121224  aNX 180 S6 S62 2015wLCc1i31847001272571lON_SHELFmGPRC_GPp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu8/27/2014  aNX 180 S6 S62 2015wLCc1i0162035308145d1/31/2017e1/31/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmUAHSSn7p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu6/17/2015  aNX180 .S6 S62 2015wLCc1i1007694241d11/11/2016lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$48.99rYsYtBOOKu5/25/2016  aNX 180 S6 S62 2015wLCc1i34917001381107lON_SHELFmKEYANOp$50.00rYsYtBOOKu3/6/2017o.STAFF. 03/06/17 Midwest PO 51053; est. $50. no list price01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2010031039bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/309894534
