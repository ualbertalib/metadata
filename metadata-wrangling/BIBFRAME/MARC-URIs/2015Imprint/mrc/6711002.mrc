The past decade has witnessed a change in both the wider knowledge production on, and political profile of, the Naqab Bedouin. This book addresses this change by firstly, endeavouring to overcome the historic isolation of Naqab Bedouin studies from the rest of Palestine studies by situating, studying and analyzing their predicaments firmly within the contemporary context of Israeli settler-colonial policies. Secondly, it strives to de-colonise research and advocacy on the Naqab Bedouin, by, for example, reclaiming "indigenous" knowledge and terminology. Offering not only a nuanced description and analysis of Naqab Bedouin agency and activism, but also trying to draw broader conclusion as to the functioning of settler-colonial power structures as well as to the politics of research in such a context, this book is essential reading for students and researchers with an interest in Postcolonial Studies, Development Studies, Israel/Palestine Studies and the contemporary Middle East more broadly"--cProvided by publisher.  a38 0aBedouinszIsraelzNegev. 0aBedouinszIsraelzNegevxSocial conditions. 0aWomen, BedouinzIsraelzNegevxSocial conditions. 0aNegev (Israel)xSocial conditions.1 aNsasra, Mansour,eauthor,eeditor of compilation.1 aRatcliffe, Richard,eeditor of compilation.1 aRabia-Queder, Sarab abu,eauthor,eeditor of compilation.1 aRichter-Devroe, Sophie,eeditor of compilation. 0aRoutledge studies on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  aDS 113.75 N37 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035169315  aDS 113.75 N37 2015wLCc1i0162035169315lON_SHELFmUABARDp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu10/22/2014o.STAFF.
