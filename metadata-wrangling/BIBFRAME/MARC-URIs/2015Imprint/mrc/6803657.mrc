New documentary materials discovered by Rolf Bagemihl add to the early history of the stone block that became the David and provide an identity for the painted terracotta colossus that stood on the cathedral buttresses for which Michelangelo's statue was to be a companion. The David, with its placement at the Palazzo della Signoria, was deeply implicated in the civic history of Florence, where public nakedness played a ritual role in the military and in the political lives of its people. This book, then, places the David not only within the artistic history of Florence and its monuments but also within the popular culture of the period as well"--cProvided by publisher.  a4400aMichelangelo Buonarroti,d1475-1564.tDavid. 0aArt and societyzItalyzFlorencexHistoryy16th century. 0aFlorence (Italy)xSymbolic representation. 0aFlorence (Italy)xPolitics and governmenty1421-1737.1 aBagemihl, Rolf.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107338784  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6803657-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/11/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/10171757
