The quality of cast metal is the foundation of its performance in downstream processing and in final parts. That is why the research centers and universities are focusing on improving traditional and developing new means of melt processing and casting. Specific attention in given to the physical means of treatment that do not involve expensive additions or environmentally and health hazardous substances. New types of materials, e.g. nanocomposites, require unconventional technological approaches that also involve physical means such as electrical and magnetic fields, intensive shearing, microwaves, etc. Ultrasonic melt processing accompanied by developed cavitation and acoustic streaming is among those physical processes that can potentially influence different stages of solidification with the resultant cleaner metal with fine grain structure and better mechanical properties. The ultrasonic melt processing of light alloys has a long history that can be traced back to the 1960s. The first monograph was published in 1965 (G.I. Eskin. Ultrasonic Treatment of Molten Aluminum, Moscow, Metallurgiya, 1965), followed by two other monographs in 1988 (G.I. Eskin, Ultrasonic Treatment of Molten Aluminum, 2nd revised and enlarged edition, Moscow, Metallurgiya, 1988) and 1998 (G.I. Eskin, Ultrasonic Treatment of Light Alloy Melts, 1st edition, Amsterdam, Gordon and Breach, 1998). These books covered the fundamentals and practical application of ultrasonic melt treatment to main technologies of light metals, mostly based on the own research results"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aUltrasonics in metallurgy. 0aLight metal alloys.1 aEskin, D.
