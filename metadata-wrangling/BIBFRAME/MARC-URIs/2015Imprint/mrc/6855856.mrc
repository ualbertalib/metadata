Her body, naked but for a T-shirt, was covered in bruises; her blood-smeared hand was suspended in the air above her face; and she had fatal stab wounds in her neck. The Italian police eventually arrested three people in connection with Meredith’s killing. One was her flat-mate Amanda Knox who, with her boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and Rudy Guede, was convicted of murder in 2011. They received jail terms of twenty-six and twenty-five years. After four years in prison, Knox and Sollecito successfully appealed their convictions and were released, only to be reconvicted in January 2014.  Barbie Latza Nadeau covered every step of the investigation, trial, and appeal. She has been relentless in following the byzantine processes of Italian law and has never lost sight of the central question: who killed Meredith Kercher?  a31 aKnox, AmandaxTrials, litigation, etc.1 aKercher, MeredithxTrials, litigation, etc. 0aMurderzItaly. 0aHomicide investigationzItaly. 0aTrials (Murder)zItaly. 0aMurderzItalyzPerugiavCase studies.  aPAP 300wASISc1i33862001359227lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINp$13.88rYsYtPAPERBACKu5/5/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2009016957bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/78922368
