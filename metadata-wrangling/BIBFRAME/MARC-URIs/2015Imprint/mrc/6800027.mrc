It addresses how it is taught in colleges across the United States and the world, how it is deeply flawed and what the future holds for economies around the world, especially in the context of mega-banks that impact Main Street more now than they did in the past. This book will explore how derivatives have swarmed the balance sheets of banks and how governments throughout the "free world" have guaranteed private profits for banks, but have socialized losses for these same banks, impacting the taxpayer, and putting the economy at increased risk as volatility and leverage increase over time.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on December 21, 2014).  a44 0aEconomics. 0aUnited StatesxEconomic conditionsy2009- 0aEconomics collection.x2163-7628403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=10997469  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800027-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79111283
