Examples include various power dividing units, including symmetric and non-symmetric varieties, as well as open and lockable differentials, various limited slip differentials, no spins, and viscous clutches. The text presents logic control algorithms used to control vehicle power dividing units and designs of torque/power managing devices. The authors' approach to designing driveline systems is that characteristics and parameters of a driveline system and a set of power dividing units are established through vehicle performance and energy-fuel efficiency analysis and optimization"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aAutomobilesxMotorsxDesign and construction. 0aAutomobilesxPower trainsxDesign and construction. 0aPropulsion systemsxAutomatic control.1 aZhu, Guomingc(Engineer),eauthor. 0aMechanical and aerospace engineering (CRC Press)403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781439820193z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6786170-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/20/2015xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014041512bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/309823752
