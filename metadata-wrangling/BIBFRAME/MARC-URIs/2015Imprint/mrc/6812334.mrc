This timeless classic presents a systematic nuts-and-bolts approach to developing the skills and mindset required to achieve exceptional success in any field or endeavor, personal or professional. Hill explains in detail 13 steps required to achieve those goals. The book contains numerous self-tests and checklists. In addition, it provides key details about Dr. Hill’s life and times, his life-long research, and the leaders of business and industry he studied to glean the invaluable principles of success you’ll discover here.  aHill, Napoleon  aCornwell, Ross4edt  a330 aWealth.0 aSuccess in business.0 aSelf-actualization (Psychology).  aHF 5386 H57 2015wLCc1i0164000902852d3/31/2017e3/21/2017lON_SHELFmOLDSn23rYsYtBOOKu3/16/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79110604
