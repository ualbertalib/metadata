Yet, we are still in need of an explanation as to how this entanglement between Law and EU polity-building emerged and how it was maintained over time. While most of the literature offers a disembodied account of European legal integration, Brokering Europe reveals the multifaceted roles Euro-lawyers have played in EU polity, notably beyond the litigation arena. In particular, the book points at select transnational groups of multipositioned legal entrepreneurs which have been in a situation to elevate the role of law in all sorts of EU venues. In doing so, it draws from anew set of intellectual resources (field-theory) and empirical strategies only very recently mobilized for the study of the EU. Grounded on an extensive historical investigation, Brokering Europe provides a revised narrative of the 'constitutionalization of Europe'"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aLawzEuropean Union countries. 0aCambridge studies in European law and policy403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107326323  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6801627-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr2006001809bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/39539407
