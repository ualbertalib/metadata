Whether you work with a brand, retail storefront or are studying to do just that, we wrote A Beginner's Guide to Mobile Marketing to help you learn about the exploding opportunities that mobile marketing offers and why it is so important to embrace it in your integrated marketing strategy. As you are well aware, cell phones are no longer just for calling people. Based on the latest trends in consumer behavior on mobiles, we introduce ways that marketers can use Smartphone popularity to reach people with tactics like mobile apps, mobile web, social media, search, text messaging (SMS/MMS/RMM), mobile advertising, location-based services, retail programs and more. NFC, QR codes and texting are a few pull tactics introduced, alongside push tactics like beacons, ads and in-app push notifications. Tablets require a different strategy but this book touches on that to offer background on mobile vs. tablet marketing. Citing the latest and greatest third-party research, learn from an expert about mobile marketing, starting with the basics and ending with a roadmap to develop and measure strategic mobile marketing campaigns. Along the way, participate in exercises to ensure that you understand the material and how to apply it to the real world. Whether you are an educator, student, professional, or mobile maven, we hope that you enjoy the content and case studies we bring to life in this book.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on January 26, 2015).  a44 0aCell phone advertising. 0aInternet marketing.1 aMishra, Karen E.,eauthor. 0aDigital and social media marketing and advertising collection.x2333-8830403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=11007932  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6813098-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/27/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2012048642bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/258620790
