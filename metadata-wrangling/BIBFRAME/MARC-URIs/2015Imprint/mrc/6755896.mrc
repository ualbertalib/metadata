It begins by outlining the Aboriginal legal system as it is embedded in Aboriginal people's complex relationship with their ancestral lands. This is Raw Law : a natural system of obligations and benefits, flowing from an Aboriginal ontology. And this book places Raw Law at the centre of an analysis of colonization - thereby decentring the usual analytical tendency to privilege the dominant structures and concepts of Western law. From the perspective of Aboriginal law, colonisation was a violation of the code of political and social conduct embodied in Raw Law. Its effects were damaging. It forced Aboriginal peoples to violate their own principles of natural responsibility to self, community, country and future existence. But this book is not simply a work of mourning. Most profoundly, it is a celebration of the resilience of Aboriginal ways, and a call for these to be recognized as central in discussions of colonial and postcolonial legality"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on online resource; title from digital title page (viewed on October 24, 2014).  a44 0aAboriginal AustraliansxLegal status, laws, etc. 0aAboriginal AustraliansxLegal status, laws, etc.xSocial aspects. 0aIndigenous peoples (International law) 0aLaw, Aboriginal Australian. 0aPhilosophy, Aboriginal Australian.1 aWatson, Ireneq(Irene Margaret).tRaw law. 0aIndigenous peoples and the law.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=873048z(Single User Access)  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6755896-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu12/9/2014xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2002118953bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/19048709
