More than 2,240 trials against some 5,700 suspected war criminals were carried out at 51 separate locations across the Asia Pacific region. This book analyzes fourteen high-profile American, Australian, British, and Philippine trials, including the two subsequent proceedings at Tokyo and the Yamashita trial. By delving into a large body of hitherto underutilized oral and documentary history of the war as contained in the trial records, Yuma Totani illuminates diverse firsthand accounts of the war that were offered by former Japanese and Allied combatants, prisoners of war, and the civilian population. Furthermore, the author makes a systematic inquiry into select trials to shed light on a highly complex - and at times contradictory - legal and jurisprudential legacy of Allied war crimes prosecutions"--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a44 0aWar crime trialszPacific AreaxHistoryy20th century. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xLaw and legislationzPacific Area. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xAtrocitieszPacific Area.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316104118  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6805544-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/17/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2008001364bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/31462737
