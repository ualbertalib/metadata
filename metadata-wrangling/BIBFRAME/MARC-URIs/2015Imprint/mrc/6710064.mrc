Why are males involved in violent crime more often than females? And why do the precursors of serious pathological behavior typically emerge in childhood? Criminals in the Making: Criminality Across the Life Course, Second Edition, by John Paul Wright, Stephen G. Tibbetts, and Leah E. Daigle, addresses key questions surrounding criminal propensity by discussing studies of the life-course perspective-criminological research that links biological factors associated with criminality with the social and environmental agents thought to cause, facilitate, or otherwise influence a tendency towards criminal activity. The book provides comprehensive, interdisciplinary coverage of the current thinking in the field about criminal behavior over the course of a lifetime. Additionally, it highlights interventions proven effective and illustrates how the life-course perspective has contributed to a greater understanding of the causes of crime.  a29 0aCriminal behavior. 0aCriminology.1 aTibbetts, Stephen G.1 aDaigle, Leah E.  aHV6080 .W74 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007423963p70.19kAVAIL_SOON  aHV6080 .W74 2015wLCc1i1007423963d3/22/2017e3/22/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn1p$66.85q1rMsYtBOOKu10/20/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2008001805bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/21607663
