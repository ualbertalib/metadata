It is almost impossible to read or study literature without acknowledging its relationship to criticism and this guide shows how the two have been inextricable since Plato. Introducing theory and criticism through the texts themselves, Pelagia Goulimari examines: - A variety of key thinkers from Plato and Aristotle through to Foucault and Derrida - Topics and themes in the history of literary criticism such as mimesis and creation, inspiration, the emotions, reason, aesthetic, history, morality, ethics, culture and discourse - The main genres and movements in the history of literature including the epic, tragedy, comedy, romanticism, realism, modernism and postmodernism - Cross-historical connections between theories and theorists and the dissemination, appropriation and creative misunderstanding of concepts, ideas and arguments. With handy features such as a glossary, annotated further reading, descriptive text boxes and instructive marginalia this book is the ideal introduction to anyone approaching theory and criticism for the first time"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 23 43 0aCriticismxHistory. 0aLiteraturexHistory and criticismxTheory, etc. 0aLiteraturexPhilosophyxHistory.  aPN 86 G684 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035184876  aPN 86 G684 2015wLCc1i0162035185444d3/20/2016e3/15/2016lON_SHELFmUAAUGn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/19/2014  aPN 86 G684 2015wLCc1i0162035184876d2/1/2016e2/1/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSn7p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/19/2014  aPN 86 G684 2015wLCc1i32860001062099d11/10/2015e10/29/2015lON_SHELFmBURMANn5rYsYtBOOKu12/15/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n97069893bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/250206024
