It shows how network sampling is a reliable guide in capturing inaccessible entities through linked auxiliaries. The text also explores how adaptive sampling is strengthened in information content through subsidiary sampling with devices to mitigate unmanageable expanding sample sizes. Empirical data illustrates the applicability of both methods"--cProvided by publisher.  a"Preface Network Sampling was possibly invented by Sirken (1970, 1983) while Chaudhuri & Stenger (2005) briefly narrated his theory; and J.N.K. Rao (1999) further elaborated about this subject as introduced by Sirken. Chaudhuri's (2000) exposition on it thrives on the foundation laid by Thompson (1990,1992) and Thompson & Seber (1996) on 'Network Sampling', named by the latter two researchers. In this treatise we shall follow this approach. "Adaptive Sampling" too, from what is understood, originated through the researches made by Thompson (1990, 1992) while Thompson & Seber (1996) and further strengthened by Chaudhuri (2000). Salehi & Seber (2002) and Seber & Salehi (2013) have also contributed immensely to the subject. But the aspects of Network Sampling and Adaptive Sampling which will be discussed in the present volume are confined mainly to the contributions published in the follwing documents bearing participation by us: Chaudhuri (2000, 2010), Chaudhuri & Saha (2004), Chaudhuri, Bose & Ghosh (2004), Chaudhuri & Stenger (2005), Chaudhuri, Bose & Dihidar (2005) and an exposure by Chaudhuri & Dihidar (2010) plus the current involvement as in Chaudhuri (2011). First, let us shed some light on the subject. In a standard household survey our intention may be to serviceably estimate the population total or mean of a variable which is an important consideration but is valued zero for many households while it is substantial for many others. However, before conducting the survey viii Network and Adpative Sampling"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aAdaptive sampling (Statistics)403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781466577572z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6677730-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu9/15/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n85259184bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/15423627
