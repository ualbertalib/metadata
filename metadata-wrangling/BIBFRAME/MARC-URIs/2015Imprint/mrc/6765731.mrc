As both author and character in her own books, she became one of the most famous figures in American children's literature. Her famous Little House on the Prairie series, based on her childhood in Wisconsin, Kansas, Minnesota, and South Dakota, blended memoir and fiction into a vivid depiction of 19th-century settler life that continues to shape many Americans' understanding of the country's past. Poised between fiction and fact, literature and history, Wilder's life is a fascinating window on the American west. Placing Wilder's life and work in historical context, and including previously unpublished material from the Wilder archives, Sallie Ketcham introduces students to domestic frontier life, the conflict between Native Americans and infringing white populations, and the West in public memory and imagination"--cProvided by publisher.  a1610aWilder, Laura Ingalls,d1867-1957.10aWilder, Laura Ingalls,d1867-1957.tLittle house books.10aWilder, Laura Ingalls,d1867-1957xPolitical and social views.10aWilder, Laura Ingalls,d1867-1957xCriticism and interpretation. 0aAutobiographical fiction, AmericanxHistory and criticism. 0aAuthors, Americany20th centuryvBiography. 0aWomen pioneerszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aFrontier and pioneer lifezUnited States. 0aRoutledge historical Americans.  aPS 3545 I265 Z73 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035205457  aPS 3545 I265 Z73 2015wLCc1i0162035205457lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/6/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79095251bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/34464422
