Widely celebrated but at times criticized for the roles he played during a career that spanned 60 years, there can be no comprehensive discussion of black men in American film, and no serious analysis of 20th century American film history that excludes him. Poitier Revisited offers a fresh interrogation of the social, cultural and political significance of the Poitier oeuvre. The contributions explore the broad spectrum of critical issues summoned up by Poitier's iconic work as actor, director and filmmaker. Despite his stature, Poitier has actually been under-examined in film criticism generally. This work reconsiders his pivotal role in film and American race relations, by arguing persuasively, that even in this supposedly 'post-racial' moment of Barack Obama, the struggles, aspirations, anxieties, and tensions Poitier's films explored are every bit as relevant today as when they were first made"--cProvided by publisher.  a"A critical anthology re-contextualizing the work of one of America's most recognized and celebrated actors, Sidney Poitier"--cProvided by publisher.  a4310aPoitier, SidneyxCriticism and interpretation.1 aStrachan, Ian G.q(Ian Gregory),d1969-eeditor.1 aMask, Mia,d1969-eeditor.  aPN 2287 P75 P65 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035222122  aPN 2287 P75 P65 2015wLCc1i0162035222122lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/21/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2008063889bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/95385896
