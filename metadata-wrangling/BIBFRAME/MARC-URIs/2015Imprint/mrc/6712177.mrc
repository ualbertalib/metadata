The introductory chapters bring readers who have a scientific background, but who are not experts in electrochemical energy conversion, up to date on the urgency and implications of the global energy challenge, the prospects of electrochemical energy conversion technologies, and the thermodynamic and electrochemical principles underlying the operation of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The book then presents the scientific challenges in fuel cell research as a systematic account of distinct components, length scales, physicochemical processes, and scientific disciplines. The main part of the book focuses on theory and molecular modeling. Theoretical tools and approaches, applied to fuel cell research, are presented in a self-contained manner. Chapters are arranged by different fuel cell materials and components, and sections advance through the hierarchy of scales, starting from molecular-level processes in proton conducting media or electro catalytic systems and ending with performance issues at the device level, including electrochemical performance, water management, durability and analysis of failure mechanisms. Throughout, the book gives numerous examples of formidable scientific challenges as well as of tools to facilitate materials design and development of diagnostic methods. It reveals reserves for performance improvements and uncovers misapprehensions in scientific understanding that have misled or may continue to mislead technological development. An indispensable resource for scientifically minded and practically oriented researchers, this book helps industry leaders to appreciate the contributions of fundamental research, and leaders of fundamental research to appreciate the needs of industry"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cells.1 aKulikovsky, Andrei A.,eauthor. 0aGreen chemistry and chemical engineering ;v19.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781439854068z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6712177-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu10/27/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2010174065bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/143501862
