The workshops reviewed previous work in the field in light of new data generated as part of the work of the NRC Panel on Understanding Divergent Trends in Longevity in High-Income Countries (NRC, 2011) and the NRC/IOM Panel on Understanding Cross-National Differences Among High-Income Countries (NRC/IOM, 2013). The workshop presentations considered the state of the science of measuring the determinants of the causes of premature death, assessed the availability and quality of data sources, and charted future courses of action to improve the understanding of the causes of premature death. Presenters shared their approaches to and results of measuring premature mortality and specific risk factors, with a particular focus on those factors most amenable to improvement through public health policy. This report summarizes the presentations and discussion of both workshops"--Publisher's description.  aDescription based on online resource; title from resource home page (National Academies Press, viewed February 25, 2015).  a13 44 5712aMortality, PrematurezUnited StatesvCongresses.22aLife ExpectancyzUnited StatesvCongresses.22aResearch DesignzUnited StatesvCongresses.1 aRhodes, Holly Greenwood,erapporteur.2 aInstitute of Medicine (U.S.).bBoard on Health Care Services,eissuing body.2 aNational Research Council (U.S.).bCommittee on Population,eissuing body.2 aWorkshop on Determinants of Premature Mortalityn(2nd :d2014 :cSeattle, Wash.),jauthor.403Free Accessuhttp://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=21656  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6815197-2001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu3/4/2015xE-BOOKzNAP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6815197-3001lINTERNETmNEOS_FREErYsYtE-RESOURCEu3/4/2015xE-BOOKzNAP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6815197-4001lINTERNETmGR_MAC_INTrYsYtE-RESOURCEu3/4/2015xE-BOOKzNAP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2015026124
