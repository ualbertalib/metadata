Violence in adolescents is often seen as the result of a mental-health diagnosis, delinquency, or as a response to dysfunctional parenting, and though understanding a youth's mental-health status or a parenting style can be helpful, complete focus on either is misplaced. Adolescent Violence in the Home uses a restorative framework, developed by the authors and in use in court systems and organizations around the world, to situate violent behaviors in the context of power and the intergenerational cycle of violence. Readers will come away from this book with a profound understanding of the social and individual factors that lead youth to use violence and how adolescent violence affects parents, and they'll also learn about a variety of interventions that specifically address teen violence against parents."--cProvided by publisher.  a3 43 0aYouth and violence. 0aFamilies. 0aInterpersonal relations.1 aAnderson, Lily,eauthor.  aHQ 799.2 V56 R68 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035149622  aHQ 799.2 V56 R68 2015wLCc1i0162035149622lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu10/6/2014  a303.60835 ROUwDEWEYc1i33862001377864lON_SHELFmNORQ_MAINp$30.78rYsYtBOOKu9/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014010946bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/306381733
