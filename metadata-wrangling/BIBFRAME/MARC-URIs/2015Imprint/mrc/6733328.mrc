Many have called for new paradigms of mental health and new practices that can better support recovery, community integration, and adaptive functioning for persons diagnosed with psychiatric disabilities. While there has recently been much discourse about transformation and recovery, there has yet to be a critical and systematic review that unpacks the concept of mental health systems transformation or that examines strategies for how to create transformative change in mental health. Community Psychology and Community Mental Health provides empirical justification and a conceptual foundation for transformative change in mental health, based on community psychology values and principles of ecology, collaboration, empowerment, and social justice. Chapters provide strategies for making changes at the level of society, policy, organizations, community settings, and mental health practices. The editors and authors draw from experience in different countries in recognition of the need to tailor change strategies to different contexts. The common experiences of the international perspectives represented underscore the importance and the need for a new paradigm while demonstrating that there are many alternatives and opportunities for pursuing transformative change. This book will be of interest to community mental health professionals, researchers, and students, as well as policymakers, administrators, and those with lived experience of mental health issues"--cProvided by publisher.  a"Community Psychology and Community Mental Health provides theoretical justification and a conceptual foundation for transformative change in mental health, based on community psychology values and principles of ecology, collaboration, empowerment, and social justice"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print version record.  a44 0aCommunity mental health services. 0aCommunity psychology. 1aChange (Psychology)1 aNelson, Geoffrey B.q(Geoffrey Brian)1 aKloos, Bret.1 aOrnelas, Jose.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199362424.001.0001/acprof-9780199362424zfrom University Press Scholarship  aInternet AccesswLCc2i6733328-1002lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu9/19/2016xE-BOOKzUPSO01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/99926782
