This separation allowed adolescents and young adults to begin to formulate an identity distinct from previous generations, and was a significant factor in their widespread rejection of contemporary American society. This study traces the emergence of a distinctive post-war family dynamic between parent and adolescent or already adult child. In-depth readings of individual writers such as, Arthur Miller, William Styron, J. D. Salinger, Tennessee Williams, Vladimir Nabokov, Jack Kerouac, Flannery O'Connor and Sylvia Plath, situate their work in relation to the Cold War and suggest how the figuring of adolescents and young people reflected and contributed to an empowerment of American youth. This book is a superb research tool for any student or academic with an interest in youth culture, cultural studies, American studies, cold war studies, twentieth-century American literature, history of the family, and age studies."--cProvided by publisher.  a16 0aAmerican literaturey20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aCold War in literature. 0aYouth in literature. 0aYouthzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aRoutledge Transnational Perspectives on American Literature ;v24.  aPS 228 C58 J66 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035218146  aPS 228 C58 J66 2015wLCc1i0162035218146lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n89103190bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/64648248
