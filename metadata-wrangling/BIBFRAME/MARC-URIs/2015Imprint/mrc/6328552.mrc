It encompasses skills for print and online media, and includes both written and visual reports (video, photography). Taking a strong real world approach, this textbook includes many case studies and interviews with fashion journalists working for newspapers, magazines, broadcast and websites, and with stylists, PR executives, photographers and bloggers. Their explanations of their roles and their practical tips and advice will be accompanied by analysis of examples of their work. The business of fashion and fashion PR will be explained for the trainee journalist, with the focus of the book being on offering practical guidance on how to report effectively on fashion - from sources and research to writing and layout. Each chapter will include suggested exercises and further reading. Covering every aspect from the law and ethics to using social media, from fashion theory to reporting the catwalk, this text offers everything a student or trainee needs to know to excel in fashion journalism"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aFashion writing.  aTT503.5 .B73 2015hGR_MACEWANi1007423997p46.61kAVAIL_SOON  aTT503.5 .B73 2015wLCc1i1007423997d11/12/2014lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$46.61rYsYtBOOKu10/21/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014004013bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/310686254
