As a human, Meg should be barely tolerated prey, but her abilities as a cassandra sangue make her something more. The appearance of two addictive drugs has sparked violence between the humans and the Others, resulting in the murders of both species in nearby cities. So when Meg has a dream about blood and black feathers in the snow, Simon Wolfgard--Lakeside's shape-shifting leader--wonders whether their blood prophet dreamed of a past attack or of a future threat. As the urge to speak prophecies strikes Meg more frequently, trouble finds its way inside the Courtyard. Now the Others and the handful of humans residing there must work together to stop the man bent on reclaiming their blood prophet--and stop the danger that threatens to destroy them all"--cProvided by publisher.  a3 0aWomen prophetsvFiction. 0aWerewolvesvFiction.  aFantasy BISwASISc1i33862001359052d4/8/2016e4/4/2016lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINn2p$7.49rYsYtPAPERBACKu5/5/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n88293190bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/99115577
