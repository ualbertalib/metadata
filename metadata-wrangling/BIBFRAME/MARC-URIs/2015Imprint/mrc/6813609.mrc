Facebook. Twitter. Repeat. We live in a world unimaginable even a few decades ago, one like no other in human history. It's a parallel world where we can be on the move in the real world, yet always hooked into an alternative time and place. And although it's a two-dimensional world of sight and sound, it offers instant information, connected identities, and constant novelty. In this world, our screen technologies are increasingly where we work, where we unwind, where we relieve our boredom and where we learn. The subsequent transformation in how we live and think is a vitally important issue, perhaps even the most important issue of our time. When toddlers are given iPads, and adults spend ten hours a day staring at a screen, can we afford to assume that our brave new screen technologies are harmless tools? Blending a wide range of scientific studies, news events, and cultural criticism with brio and verve, Mind Change presents an incisive snapshot of the global 'now.' Greenfield examines how the dawn of the Digital Age has already altered our cultural landscape, fueled an epidemic of oversharing, and transformed how we learn, remember and spread information -- and how these innovations are changing our physical brains. A warning cry, a shot across the bow, and a call to action, Mind Change explores the social, cultural and physiological ramifications of our new digital lifestyle"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 33 0aCognition. 0aInformation technologyxPsychological aspects. 0aInformation technologyxSocial aspects.  aBF311 .G7135 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007402231p34.15kAVAIL_SOON  aBF311 .G7135 2015wLCc1i1007402231d1/3/2017e12/8/2016lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn6p$32.52rYsYtBOOKu3/3/2015  aBF 311 G74 2015wLCc1i0164000771653d2/4/2016e1/7/2016lON_SHELFmOLDSn2rYsYtBOOKu3/10/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n85250594bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/56637180
