In this book, leaders in the field of serious games and professionals in entertainment games share practical guidelines and lessons learned from their own experiences researching and developing learning games. This volume includes: [bullet] A summary of the key elements of design and development that require particular attention from multiple disciplines to ensure success [bullet] An overview of successful models and methods, and of the tradeoffs made throughout the process, to help guide development [bullet] Cohesive, multidisciplinary views of the issues that may arise and of the techniques applied in order to produce effective learning games grounded in specific experiences, community consensus, and analysis of successful learning games that have already been released [bullet] The stories behind the games, to illustrate how final design and development decisions were reached. Aimed at professionals and academics interested in developing and researching learning games, it offers a comprehensive picture of the state of the art"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 41 0aComputer gamesxDesign. 0aEducational games. 0aVideo games. 0aSimulation games.1 aHussain, Talib S.,d1969-1 aColeman, Susan L.,d1961-  aGV 1469.3 D48 2015hUAAU-Bi0162035244944  aGV 1469.3 D48 2015wLCc1i0162035244944lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/26/2015  aGV 1469.3 D48 2015wLCc1i0162035257581d2/27/2017e1/16/2017lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn7p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/19/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014022335bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/1.22148207867e+20
