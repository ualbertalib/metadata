And how far is too far when it comes to secrecy in the name of security? These are just a few of the questions that have dominated American consciousness since Edward Snowden exposed the breath of the NSA's domestic surveillance program. In these seven previously unpublished essays, a group of prominent legal and political experts delve in to life After Snowden, examining the ramifications of the infamous leak from multiple angles: - Director of the National Security Archive THOMAS BLANTON looks at the impact of the Snowden leaks on the classification of government documents. - Former Assistant Secretary of State HODDING CARTER explores whether the press is justified in unearthing and publishing classified information. - Georgetown Law Professor DAVID COLE addresses the motives and complicated legacy of Snowden and other leakers. - Former federal prosecutor RONALD GOLDFARB outlines the many debates sparked by the Snowden leaks. - Dean Emeritus at the University of Florida Law School JON MILLS addresses the constitutional right to privacy and the difficulty applying to the digital age. - Pulitzer Prize winning journalist BARRY SIEGEL analyses the role of the state secrets provision in the judicial system. - Dean of the UC Berkley School of Journalism EDWARD WASSERMAN discusses the uneven relationship between journalists and whistleblowers"--cProvided by publisher.  a2910aSnowden, Edward J.,d1983- 0aOfficial secretszUnited States. 0aGovernment informationzUnited States. 0aElectronic surveillancezUnited States.1 aGoldfarb, Ronald L.,eeditor.423Cover imageuhttp://www.netread.com/jcusers2/bk1388/609/9781250067609/image/lgcover.9781250067609.jpg  aJK468 .S4 A67 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007770736p31.33kAVAIL_SOON  aJK468 .S4 A67 2015wLCc1i1007770736d1/6/2016e12/8/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn6p$31.33rYsYtBOOKu6/2/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50034582bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/111035427
