This revision outlines the origin and development of these disciplines and looks forward to their application of the latest data and technologies. It identifies current conflicts and includes discussion on the changing focuses of the field and the broader realms it encompasses. The text is organized in an easy to follow format, first defining the profession of exercise science and sport science, then providing an overview of the disciplines that study the cultural, social, and scientific foundations of this profession. In later chapters, the text builds upon that foundation and examines career development and job opportunities, looking at the traditional areas of teaching and coaching, the expanding career options of sport management, and the new world of the technological workplace.  a16 21 35 0aPhysical education and training. 0aPhysical education and trainingxProfessional ethics. 0aSports sciencesxStudy and teaching.12aPhysical Education and Trainingxhistory.22aExercise.22aKinesiology, Applied.22aSportsxhistory.  aGV 211 F73 2015wLCc1i33333001310701lON_SHELFmCONCORDIArYsYtBOOKu9/15/2014  aGV 211 F73 2015wLCc1i0162035177342d1/27/2017e9/19/2016lON_SHELFmUAAUGn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu8/11/2014  aGV 211 F73 2015wLCc1i30125302521645lFLOOR_2mRED_DEER_CrYsYtBOOKu4/2/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n82013445bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/109444265
