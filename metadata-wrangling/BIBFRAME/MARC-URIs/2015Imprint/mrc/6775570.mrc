Do they know as much as they know about their favorite sports teams or their favorite celebrities? Can they describe the operations of their brains with the precision that they list the ingredients and steps in a favorite recipe or explain the nuances of playing a popular electronic game? Do they track their brains with the regularity that they follow the weather, the price of gas, or how much money they have in their wallets? Yet, all that we experience, all that we know, and all that we do is a direct, inseparable product of our brains. For most of us, our brains serve as the conduit through which we experience life, but nothing more. We may have thoughtfully devised programs for exercising our bodies, and on any given day, we may know our weight within a couple of pounds, but we pay scant attention to the state of our brains, how we may be affecting them, how we may be affecting the brains of others, and how our own brains are being affected during the course of everyday life. In the following chapters, our primary objective is to summarize current brain science, but most importantly, highlight and explain the practical, everyday application of brain science. Today, there may be no field that produces a larger volume of scientific papers, books, and other publications than brain science, or neuroscience. However, with little exception, these publications are esoteric and beyond the reach of those without the requisite academic training (i.e., generally, an advanced degree in neuroscience or a similar field)"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aCognitive neuroscience. 0aHuman engineering.1 aLiao, Huafei,eauthor.1 aTrumbo, Michael,eauthor.1 aCardona-Rivera, Rogelio E.,eauthor. 0aHuman factors and ergonomics.423Cover imageuhttp://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/websmall/978146657/9781466570573.jpg  aQP360.5 .F65 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007435512p148.96kAVAIL_SOON  aQP360.5 .F65 2015wLCc1i1007435512d2/1/2017lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$141.87q1rYsYtBOOKu1/13/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014042975bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/309824963
