From movies, magazines and advertisements, to social networking sites, music videos and television shows, this text presents key rhetorical concepts and applies them with critical analysis to a variety of exciting examples drawn from today's popular culture. Moving from theory to practice throughout the text, this book links concepts in an easy-to-understand way. This book covers the concept rhetoric, itself, as well as its place and dynamic change in history, and offers methods to effectively employ rhetorical criticism in daily life. The new edition includes pertinent critical essays and case studies that show readers how the critical methods discussed can be used to study the hidden rhetoric of extended texts, and more.  a29 0aRhetoric. 0aPopular culture. 0aRhetorical criticism.  aP301 .B67 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007405689p85.58kAVAIL_SOON  aP301 .B67 2015wLCc1i1007405689d4/6/2017e3/30/2017lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn7p$85.58rYsYtBOOKu3/18/2015  aP301 .B67 2015wLCc2i1007757360d9/1/2016kRESERVESlON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$108.45rYsYtBOOKu8/25/2016zTEXTBK-MAC0TEXTBK-MAC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n83024511bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/111718942
