Taking an anthropological approach, the book covers 51 topics that would have been studied if China were a newly discovered civilization, plus one overarching chapter that presents nine core concepts of CWOL. While the book is a rigorous treatment of CWOL, it is also filled with personal stories and perspectives from close to 1000 successful Chinese from academia, business, and government. The Chinese Way equips readers with a deep understanding of a society that is a major player in global business today and offers a foundation for successful business interactions with Chinese companies, organizations, and people"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print version record.  a44 0aNational characteristics, Chinese. 0aChinaxSocial life and customsy21st century.1 aXu, Jie,d1988-eauthor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=831916xPerpetualz(3 Concurrent Users)zfrom EBSCO  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  acis28829803  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6733334-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu11/7/2014xE-BOOKzEBSCOPDAP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014013353bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/307429186
