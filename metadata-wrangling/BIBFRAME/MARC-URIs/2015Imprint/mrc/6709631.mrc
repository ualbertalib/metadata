In the fully revised and updated edition of this important volume, the editors and chapter contributors explore how diverse populations of students experience college differently and encounter group-specific barriers to success. Informed by relevant theories, each chapter focuses on engaging a different student population, including: low-income students, students of color, international students, students with disabilities, LGBT students, religious minority students, student-athletes, homeless students, transfer students, commuter and part-time students, adult learners, student veterans, and graduate students. The forward-thinking, practical strategies offered throughout the book are based on research and the collected professional wisdom of experienced educators and scholars at two-year and four-year institutions of higher education. Current and future faculty, administrators, and student affairs staff will undoubtedly find this book complete with fresh ideas to reverse troubling engagement trends among various college student populations."--cProvided by publisher.  a28 41 0aStudent affairs serviceszUnited States. 0aStudent activitieszUnited States. 0aCollege studentsxServices forzUnited States. 0aMulticultural educationzUnited States.1 aQuaye, Stephen John,d1980-1 aHarper, Shaun R.,d1975-  aLB 2342.92 S78 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035168986  aLB 2342.92 S78 2015wLCc1i0162035168986d1/2/2017e1/2/2017kCHECKEDOUTlFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn6p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu10/17/2014  aLB 2342.92 S78 2015wLCc1i31847001291522lON_SHELFmGPRC_GPp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/10/201601ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2008004233bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/95383857
