Starting with an incisive introduction that calls for a reconceptualization of American feminist history to encompass multiple streams of women's activism, she weaves the personal with the political, vividly evoking the events and people who participated in our era's most far-reaching social revolutions. In short, thematic chapters, Orleck enables readers to understand the impact of women's activism, and highlights how feminism has flourished through much of the past century within social movements that have too often been treated as completely separate. Showing that women's activism has taken many forms, has intersected with issues of class and race, and has continued during periods of backlash, Rethinking American Women's Activism is a perfect introduction to the subject for anyone interested in women's history and social movements"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 43 0aFeminismzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aWomenxPolitical activityzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aWomen's rightszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aSocial movementszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aUnited StatesxSocial conditions. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and government. 0aAmerican social and political movements of the twentieth century.  aHQ 1410 O75 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035225638  aHQ 1410 O75 2015wLCc1i0162035225638lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/21/2015  aHQ 1410 O75 2015wLCc1i0162035248689d4/25/2016e3/7/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n94083919bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/26296356
