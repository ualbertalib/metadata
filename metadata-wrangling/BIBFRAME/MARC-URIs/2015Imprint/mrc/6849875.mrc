Structured chronologically from pre-history to the present day, this is the first broad study of the complex relationship between dress and technology. Over the course of human history, dress-making and fashion technology has changed beyond recognition: from needles and human hands in the ancient world to complex 20th century textile production machines, it has now come to include the technologies that influence dress styles and the fashion industry, such as the media and printing presses. In the last century, new technologies have helped not just to produce but to define fashion: the creation of automobiles prompted a decline in long skirts for women while the beginnings of space travel caused people to radically rethink the function of dress. In many ways, technology has itself created avant garde and contemporary fashions. Through an impressive range of international case studies, the book challenges the perception that fashion is unique to western dress and outlines the many ways in which dress and technology intersect. Dress, Fashion and Technology is ideal reading for students and scholars of fashion studies, textile history, anthropology and cultural studies"--Provided by publisher.  aDescription based on print version record.  a44 0aFashion designxHistory. 0aClothing and dressxHistory. 0aTailoringxHistory. 0aDress, body, culture403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=944511xLimited to 365 Uses Per Calendar Yearz(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6849875-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu3/9/2015xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81059051bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/276214774
