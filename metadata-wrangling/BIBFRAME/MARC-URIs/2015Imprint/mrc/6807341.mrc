The book is mainly intended for junior chemical engineers. It exposes them to problems in material and energy balances that arise in relation to problems involving chemical reactors. The focus is on single and multiphase systems related to material and energy balances. This material is introduced in a manner that there will be little lecture content. Most of the material presented covers work on problem solving skills. The material intrusion theory is explained briefly and simply to make this book more user-friendly. Many examples are included and solved in a simple and understandable format that explains the related theory. A few examples related to unsteady state material and energy balance are solved using MATLAB.  a29 0aChemical engineering.1 aHenda, Redhouane,eauthor.423Cover imageuhttp://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/websmall/978148222/9781482222289.jpg  aTP155 .G47 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007400656p145.12kAVAIL_SOON  aTP155 .G47 2015wLCc1i1007400656d10/7/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$138.21q1rYsYtBOOKu2/18/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2008037474bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/214199497
