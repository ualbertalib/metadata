This event had a major impact not only in the British Isles, but also on the continent, where British exiles, diplomats and agents waged propaganda battles to conquer the minds of foreign audiences. In the Dutch Republic above all their efforts had a significant impact on public opinion, and succeeded in triggering violent debate. This is the first book-length study devoted to the continental backlash of the English Civil Wars. Interdisciplinary in scope and drawing on a wide range of sources, from pamphlets to paintings, Helmer Helmers shows how the royalist cause managed to triumph in one of the most unlikely places in early modern Europe. In doing so, Helmers transforms our understanding of both British and Dutch political culture, and provides new contexts for major literary works by Milton, Marvell, Huygens, and many others"--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a44 0aPolitics and literaturezEnglandy17th century. 0aPolitics and literaturezNetherlandsy17th century. 0aEnglishzNetherlandsxSocial conditionsy17th century. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryyCivil War, 1642-1649xInfluence.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316104095  hUAINzCBO  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6783663-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/16/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014057084bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/281690627
