An edited collection, Social Networks and Music Worlds introduces students and scholars of music in society through the core concepts and tools of social network analysis. The collection showcases their use by sociologists, historians and musicologists examining, in turn, the punk, jazz, folk, classical music, Riot Grrrl, indie acoustic, R&B and calypso scenes. An overarching introduction is provided by leading network scholar and cultural sociologist Nick Crossley. The collection builds upon insights from canonic texts in the sociology of music, with the crucial innovation of examining musical network interaction via formal methods. With network analysis in the arts and humanities at an emergent stage, Social Networks and Music Worlds highlights its possibilities for non-scientists. Contributions hail from leading and emerging scholars who present social network graphs to represent different music worlds, locating individuals, resources and styles within them. The collection sits at the nexus of sociological, musicological and cultural studies traditions. Its range should ensure a large scholarly readership"--Provided by publisher.  a43 0aMusicxSocial aspects. 0aSocial networkszGreat Britain. 0aSocial sciencesxNetwork analysis.1 aCrossley, Nick,d1968- ,eeditor of compilation.1 aMcAndrew, Siobh√°n,d1978- ,eeditor of compilation.1 aWiddop, Paul,eeditor of compilation. 0aRoutledge advances in sociology ;v126.  aML 3916 S655 2015c1hUAHS-MU-Bi0162035180577  aML 3916 S655 2015wLCc1i0162035180577d1/30/2017e1/30/2017kCHECKEDOUTlMUSICmUAHSSn8p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu10/29/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb2011028651bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/214785348
