Creating new fields of communication for patients, their family members and health professionals in shared decision making processes, this book builds on knowledge about suffering to help and guide correct action in preventing and relieving chronic pain and improving systems of care. It offers a new phenomenology for understanding moral experience in serious illness and suffering, and its implication for policy, practice and research. A series of applied chapters, looking at individual experiences of suffering and care experiences, present some areas of ethical inquiry, including: pain and suffering maternal care ethics evaluation and moral deliberation about treatment options decision-making and moral agency end-of-life experiences of care. Exploring how moral phenomenology could provide fruitful alternatives to traditional frameworks in bioethics, this is an important addition to the literature. It will be of interest to scholars and students of bioethics and phenomenological methods in the health and human services"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aPain. 0aAging. 0aOlder people. 0aPhenomenology. 0aRoutledge advances in the medical humanities.  aBF 515 M76 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035176625  aBF 515 M76 2015wLCc1i0162035176625lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu10/29/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014040955bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/309823301
