As women and children sicken and die, midwife Bridget Hodgson is pulled against her will into a full-scale witch-hunt that threatens to devour all in its path, guilty and innocent alike. Bridget--accompanied once again by her deputy Martha Hawkins and her nephew Will Hodgson--finds herself playing a lethal game of cat and mouse against the most dangerous men in York, as well as her sworn enemy Rebecca Hooke. As the trials begin, and the noose begins to tighten around her neck, Bridget must answer the question: How far will she go to protect the people she loves?"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aWomen detectivesvFiction 0aMidwivesvFiction. 0aWitchcraftvFiction. 0aYork (England)xHistoryvFiction.1 aThomas, Samuel S.tMidwife mystery.  aPS 3620 H64225 W58 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035245230  aPS 3620 H64225 W58 2015wLCc1i0162035245230lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/26/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2012050125
