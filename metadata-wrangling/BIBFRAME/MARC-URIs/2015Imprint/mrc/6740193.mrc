All issues important for understanding and using published research for these purposes are covered. Key principles are illustrated with research studies published in refereed journals across a wide spectrum of education. Exercises distributed throughout the text encourage readers to engage interactively with what they are reading at the point when the information is fresh in their minds. This text is designed for higher level undergraduate and graduate programs. Course instructors will find that it provides a solid framework in which to promote student interaction and discussion on important issues in research methodology"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aEducationxResearch.1 aNichols, Joe D.,d1957-eauthor.  aLB 1028 P347 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035186509  aLB 1028 P347 2015wLCc1i0162035186509d4/1/2017e4/1/2017kCHECKEDOUTlFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn9p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu11/19/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2010042463bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/271296390
