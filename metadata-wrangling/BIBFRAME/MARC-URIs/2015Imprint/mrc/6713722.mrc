Comparing curriculum developments around the globe, Understanding the School Curriculum draws on a range of educational, philosophical and sociological theories to examine the question "What is a curriculum for?" In considering different answers to this fundamental question, it explores a range of topical issues and debates, including:tensions and dynamics within curriculum policyThe implications of uncertainty and rapid social change for curriculum developmentthe positive and negative influence of free market ideologies on public educationthe impact of globalization and digital technologiesarguments for and against common core curricula and state controlIt examines the possibility of a school curriculum that is not shaped and monitored by dominant interests but that has as its founding principles the promotion of responsibility, responsiveness, a love of learning, and a sense of wonder and respect for the natural and social world.Understanding the School Curriculum is for all students following undergraduate and Masters courses in curriculum, public policy and education-related subjects. It is also for all training and practising teachers who wish to combine a deeper understanding of major curriculum issues with a critical understanding of the ways in which ideologies impact on formal state education, and to consider ways of producing school curricula that are appropriate to the times we live in"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aEducationxCurricula. 0aPublic schools.  aLB 1570 M688 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035176435  aLB 1570 M688 2015wLCc1i0162035176435d1/20/2017e1/20/2017kCHECKEDOUTlFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn2p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu10/29/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n99024950bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/14100251
