This collection takes the study of diasporic communication beyond the level of simply praising its existence, to offering critical engagements and analysis with the systems of journalistic production and dissemination as they relate to people who are living outside the borders of their birth nation, offering compelling case studies of production, process and consumption practices. Taking diasporic journalism seriously, as this book does, means examining how diasporic news discourses push back against, and at times reaffirm, existing national and transnational power relations. The 15 chapters in this book explore how diasporic communities engage with local, national, and global processes (social, cultural, governmental) and how diasporic news reflects those linkages."--cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aEthnic press. 0aMinoritiesxPress coverage. 0aJournalismxSocial aspects. 0aMass media and minorities. 0aForeign news.1 aOgunyemi, Ola,d1962-eeditor.  aPN4784 .E78 J68 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007761412p112.70kAVAIL_SOON  aPN4784 .E78 J68 2015wLCc1i1007761412d5/8/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$112.70rYsYtBOOKu4/27/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2012025853bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/245885341
