He has long been celebrated for his faithfulness in the face of his father's rejection, and the scene in which he saves his blinded father from suicide is regarded as one of the most moving in all of Shakespeare. In 'Poor Tom', Simon Palfrey asks us to rethink all those received ideas - and thus to experience King Lear as never before. He argues that Edgar is Shakespeare's most radical experiment in characterization - and also his most exhaustive model of both human and theatrical possibility.  aDescription based on online resource; title from home page (viewed on November 26, 2014).  a4410aShakespeare, William,d1564-1616.tKing Lear. 0aEdgar (Fictitious character : Shakespeare)403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://chicago.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7208/chicago/9780226150789.001.0001/upso-9780226150642z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzUPSO  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6799692-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/6/2015xE-BOOKzUPSO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n83190930bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/96994048
