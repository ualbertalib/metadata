This gospel for interpretation is often the starting-point of judgments in the WTO. Its use in the WTO became established with the Appellate Body (AB) decision in the US-Gasoline case wherein it was pointed out that the general rule of interpretation set out in Article 31 of the VC had attained the status of a rule of customary or general international law. As such, it forms part of the 'customary rules of interpretation of public international law' which the Appellate Body has been directed, by Article 3(2) of the DSU [Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes], to apply in seeking to clarify the provisions of the General Agreement and the other 'covered agreements' of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization .... That direction reflects a measure of recognition that the General Agreement is not to be read in clinical isolation from public international law. (Footnotes omitted) This statement is often religiously cited in other WTO cases"--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a4420aWorld Trade Organization. 0aCommercial treatiesxInterpretation and construction. 0aForeign trade regulationxInterpretation and construction. 0aTariffxLaw and legislationxInterpretation and construction. 0aJudicial process.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107337992  hUAINzCBO  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6783702-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/16/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n93087282bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/35537156
