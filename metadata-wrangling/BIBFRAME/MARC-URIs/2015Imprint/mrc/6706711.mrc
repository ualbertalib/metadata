The Toxicology and Biochemistry of Insecticides provides essential insecticide knowledge required for the effective management of insect pests. Continuing as the sole book in more than two decades to address this multifaceted field, the Second Edition of this highly praised review on insecticide toxicology has been greatly expanded and updated to present the most current information on: Systemic classification of insecticides (Chapter 4) How insecticides function at the molecular level and newly discovered modes of action (Chapter 7) Insecticide resistance, molecular mechanisms, fitness costs, reversion, and management of resistance (Chapter 10) Various bioassay methods including the interpretation of probit analysis (Chapter 5) Molecular mechanisms of insecticide selectivity (Chapter 9) Major biochemical mechanisms involved in the transformation of insecticides (Chapter 8) Fate of insecticides in the environment and the sublethal effects of insecticides on wildlife (Chapter 11) Newly developed insecticides, including the addition of more microbial insecticides in keeping with current integrated pest management (IPM) approaches (Chapter 4) Incorporating extensive reference lists for further reading.0 aInsecticidesvTextbooks.0 aInsecticidesxToxicologyvTextbooks.0 aInsecticidesxPhysiological effectvTextbooks.  a33  aSB 951.5 Y8 2015wLCc1i0164000767768lON_SHELFmOLDSrYsYtBOOKu10/10/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2008001287bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/29860025
