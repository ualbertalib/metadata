Spare and stark, it follows a novelist teaching a course in creative writing during an oppressively hot summer in Athens. She leads her students in storytelling exercises. She meets other visiting writers for dinners and discourse. She goes swimming with an elderly Greek bachelor. The people she encounters speak, volubly, about themselves: their fantasies, anxieties, pet theories, regrets, and longings. And through these disclosures, a portrait of the narrator is drawn by contrast, a portrait of a woman learning to face a great loss. Outline is Cusk's finest work yet, and one of the most startling, brilliant, original novels of recent years"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aEnglish teachersvFiction.423Cover imageuhttp://www.netread.com/jcusers2/bk1388/347/9780374228347/image/lgcover.9780374228347.jpg  aPR 6053 U8252 O95 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035238391  aPR 6053 U8252 O95 2015wLCc1i0162035238391d3/30/2017e3/30/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmUAHSSn12p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu2/11/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr94028997bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/318745
