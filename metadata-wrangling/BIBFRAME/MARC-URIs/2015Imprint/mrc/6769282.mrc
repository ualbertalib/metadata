Some basic concepts -- Welfare states and welfare regimes -- The state -- Financing the public sector -- The role of the market -- The labour market: employment and unemployment -- Civil society -- Equality and inequality -- Different groups' position in welfare states -- New ways of steering the welfare state -- The role of the EU in the development of welfare states -- Is there a future for the welfare state?  a"The welfare state plays a key role in people's everyday lives in developed societies. At the same time, the welfare state is contested and there are constant discussions on how and to what degree the state should intervene, influence and have an impact on the development of society. Recent years have seen an accelerated transformation of the welfare state in the light of the global financial crisis, demographic change and changes in the perception of the state's role in relation to social welfare. This raises fundamentally new issues related to social policy and welfare state analysis. This book provides: - an introduction to the principles of welfare - a conceptual framework necessary for understanding social policy at the macro-level - a comparative approach to welfare states globally - an overview of new ways to organise and steer welfare states - an introduction to welfare state politics and underlying economic framework - an account of equality and inequality in modern societies - new directions for welfare states The book's focus on core concepts and the variety of international welfare state regimes and mechanisms for delivering social policy provides a much needed introduction to the rapidly changing concept of welfare for students on social policy, social studies, sociology and politics courses."--cProvided by publisher.  a16 29 43 0aWelfare state. 0aState, The. 0aSocial policy. 0aGlobalizationxSocial aspects.  aJC 479 G748 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035211224  aJC 479 G748 2015wLCc1i0162035211224lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/9/2015  aJC 479 G748 2015wLCc1i0162035225471d12/2/2015e11/21/2015lON_SHELFmUAHSSn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/21/2015  aJC479 .G748 2015wLCc1i1007401027d3/12/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$58.80rYsYtBOOKu3/3/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n88212762bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/20859214
