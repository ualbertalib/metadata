They maybe two of the biggest mega movie stars in the world, but they're also great parents, philanthropists and just all-around good people. When they disappear without a word from their ranch, facts are hard to find. They live behind such a high wall of security and image control that even world-renowned Private Investigator Jack Morgan can't get to the truth. But as Jack keeps probing, secrets sprout thick and fast--and the world's golden couple may emerge as hiding behind a world of desperation and deception that the wildest reality show couldn't begin to unveil. Murder is only the opening scene"--cProvided by publisher.  a3 35 0aPrivate investigatorsvFiction. 0aPrivate security servicesvFiction. 0aLos Angeles (Calif.)vFiction. 0aSuspense fiction.1 aSullivan, Mark T.1 aPatterson, James,d1947-tPrivate novels.  aPATwLCc1i30125302524433lPAPERBACKSmRED_DEER_CrYsYtBOOKu2/9/2015  aMystery PATwASISc1i33862001358971d1/24/2017e1/3/2017lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINn3p$8.80rYsYtPAPERBACKu5/5/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n78086409bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/22272314
