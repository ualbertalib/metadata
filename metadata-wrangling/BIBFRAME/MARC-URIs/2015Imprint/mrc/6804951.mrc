Besides a detailed overview of the sources of Roman law, the book also includes sections on private and criminal law and procedure, with special attention given to those aspects of Roman law that have particular importance to today's lawyer. The last three chapters of the book offer an overview of the history of Roman law from the early Middle Ages to modern times and illustrate the way in which Roman law furnished the basis of contemporary civil law systems. In this part, special attention is given to the factors that warranted the revival and subsequent reception of Roman law as the 'common law' of Continental Europe. ... The civil law tradition is the oldest legal tradition in the world today, embracing many legal systems currently in force in Continental Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world. Despite the considerable differences in the substantive laws of civil law countries, a fundamental unity exists between them. The most obvious element of unity is the fact that the civil law systems are all derived from the same sources and their legal institutions are classified in accordance with a commonly accepted scheme existing prior to their own development, which they adopted and adapted at some stage in their history. Roman law is both in point of time and range of influence the first catalyst in the evolution of the civil law tradition." -- Back cover.  a29 43 0aRoman lawxHistory. 0aCivil lawxHistory. 0aRoman lawxInfluence. 0aRoman lawxSources.  aKJA147 .M687 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007405275p121.02kAVAIL_SOON  aKJA147 .M687 2015wLCc1i1007405275d4/27/2016e2/1/2016lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn3p$121.02q1rYsYtBOOKu3/18/2015  aKJA 147 M687 2015wLCc1i0162034458420lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu6/30/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n98044170bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/64294422
