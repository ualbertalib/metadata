However, care and education in the first three years of life continues to be a neglected area.Thoroughly updated to take account of key policy and practice changes in childcare provision, this landmark text translates child development theory and research into everyday practice. All the practical ideas in the book have been developed and tested in nurseries, family and children's centres and include the importance of providing opportunities for adventurous and exploratory play for babies and toddlers, understanding and responding to children's emotional needs and offering personalized and sensitive care. The book also explores different ways of working with parents and the role of early years settings and practitioners in helping to keep children safe. It includes chapters on:Childcare policy and services Planning spaces for living, learning and playing Babies in day care Heuristic play with objects Mealtimes Learning out of doors Leading and managing a childcare centre Involving and working with parents Safeguarding children People Under Three is an established practical text for all those training to work with young children or managing day care facilities. Focusing on the care and learning of very young children, it is designed specifically for those who look after them day by day, as well as being a useful resource for social work students and policy makers"--cProvided by publisher.  a8 29 41 0aDay care centers. 0aDay care centerszGreat Britain. 0aInfantsxCare.1 aForbes, Ruth,eauthor.08iRevision of:aGoldschmied, ElinortPeople under threedLondon : Routledge, 1994w(DLC) 93007401  aHV 851 G65 2015wLCc1i34917001371652d1/21/2016e1/14/2016lON_SHELFmKEYANOn1p$42.70rYsYtBOOKu10/2/2014o.STAFF.
