This book provides strategies, theoretical frameworks, links to research evidence, descriptions of best practice, and resources to develop essential digital literacy knowledge, skills and experiences for early childhood educators in the digital age.Technology and Digital Media in the Early Years puts educators right at the intersections of child development, early learning, developmentally appropriate practice, early childhood teaching practices, children's media research, teacher education, and professional development practices. The book is based on current research, promising programs and practices, and a set of best practices for teaching with technology in early childhood education that are based on the NAEYC/FRC Position Statement on Technology and Interactive Media and the Fred Rogers Center Framework for Quality in Children's Digital Media. Pedagogical principles, classroom practices, and teaching strategies are presented in a practical, straightforward way informed by child development theory, developmentally appropriate practice, and research on effective, appropriate, and intentional use of technology in early childhood settings. A companion website provides additional resources and links to further illustrate principles and best practices for teaching and learning in the digital age"--cProvided by publisher.  a3 8 41 0aEarly childhood educationxComputer-assisted instruction. 0aComputers and children. 0aEducational technology.1 aDonohue, Chip,eeditor.  aLB 1139.35 C64 T38 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035184447  aLB 1139.35 C64 T38 2015wLCc1i0162035184447d2/8/2017e11/1/2016lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn12p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/21/2014  aLB 1139.35 C64 T38 2015wLCc1i34917001372569lON_SHELFmKEYANOp$42.58rYsYtBOOKu1/26/2015o.STAFF.
