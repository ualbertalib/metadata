We also wanted to identify a few of the most significant and potentially promising new directions for future research in various areas. After surveying the field, we identified seven broad areas in which especially good, interesting, and promising relationship-relevant research was occurring. These areas are organized around seven major themes: (a) major theoretical approaches, (b) biological-health approaches, (c) attraction- relationship development, (d) motivation-emotion, (e) communication-support-power, (f) friendship and loveÂ¿sexuality, and (g) relationship maintenance-dissolution. The authors invited to write chapters for the volume were chosen in part to represent the diverse array of disciplines within relationship science, including clinical psychology, health psychology, social and personality psychology, family social science, communication studies, sociology, neuroscience, human sexuality, and marketing. We wanted to assemble authors from a broad array of disciplines so that wider swaths of the theoretical and empirical literature in relationship science would be covered. The authors were given a set of instructions before writing their chapters. We requested that each chapter be structured to accomplish three goals: (a) highlighting the most important principles, ideas, and findings relevant to the topic of the chapter; (b) identifying the most important and novel emerging themes or issues relevant to the topic; and (c) proposing new, promising directions for future research"--Introduction.
