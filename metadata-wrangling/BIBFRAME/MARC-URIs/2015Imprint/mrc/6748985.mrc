Although some organizations used portfolio management techniques to select and prioritize programs and projects to pursue since the 1960s, these organizations rarely discussed its use recognizing it was a competitive advantage for them to do so. In the late 1970s and 1980s, software to assist in prioritizing programs and projects and to allocate resources became available, and there was increased interest in organizations to adopt the software and then recognition that tools alone were insufficient to manage a portfolio. Portfolio management requires a culture change, with processes and procedures in place that are consistently followed at all levels to support organizational strategies and promote organizational success. It requires strategic goals to ensure the work being done, whether a program, project, or an operational activity, supports these goals; having an inventory of existing work in progress available to determine if it supports organizational strategy and should be continued; and business cases, which are prepared and approved for proposed work to undertake. Such a culture change takes time and dedication to implement, but increasingly, organizational leaders are doing so recognizing its necessity especially in terms of the complexity of work under way and the often lack of qualified and available resources to do this work effectively.
