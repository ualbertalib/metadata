The book uses a historical perspective to study American employment. Chapter 1 focuses on the background prior to the New Deal revolution. An important part of that background was the idea of "employment-at-will," which permitted an employee without a fixed contract to quit work at any time, and permitted the employer to fire the employee at any time. This idea was so important that the U.S. Supreme Court created a constitutional rule prohibiting any legislative attempt to regulate work relations. The law now recognizes a number of exceptions to employment-at-will, and the Constitution has been reinterpreted to allow both state and federal laws regulating employment in many ways. Insurance to protect workers against on-the-job injuries came into existence in the 1920s, and its birth and development offer an interesting variation on modern regulation.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on January 11, 2015).  a44 0aIndustrial relationszUnited States. 0aLabor laws and legislationzUnited States. 0aHuman resource management and organizational behavior collection.x1946-5645403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=11001847  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800042-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n89651301bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/50836030
