Rather than advancing a purely chronological account, this examination of the development of contract law doctrine in England during that time explores key themes in order to better understand the drivers of legal change. These themes include the relationship between lawyers and merchants, the role of equity, the place of statute, and the part played by legal literature. Developments are considered in the context of the legal system of the time and through those who were involved in litigation as lawyers, judges, jurors or litigants. It concludes that the way in which contract law developed was complex. Legal change was often uneven and slow, and some of the apparent changes had deep roots in the past. Clashes between conservative and more reformist tendencies were not uncommon"--cProvided by publisher.  a"This book is concerned with the history of contract law over a two hundred year period stretching between 1670 and 1870. Inevitably it is also about how the Common law and Equity develops and evolves during that time"--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a44 0aContractszEnglandxHistory. 0aCambridge studies in English legal history.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139629324  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6803661-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/11/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr2005028346bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/17181181
