The authors have updated this second edition to reflect current practice standards, including updated core professional documents addressing direction and supervision to align with developments in the physical therapy profession. It expands on the first edition and includes an overview of the physical therapy profession, the physical therapist (PT), physical therapist assistant (PTA) preferred relationship, evidenced-based practice and information literacy, diversity and cultural proficiency, and planning for life-long learning and leadership development. It also covers information that assists advisors and counselors in college and work re-entry programs to provide guidance regarding the physical therapy profession and specifically the differing roles of the PTA and PT. This text also serves as a key guide for groups of 21st century learners frequently seeking PTA education, including first-generation college students, adult learners, career re-entry, second-language learners, and learners with disabilities. -- Provided by publisher.  a3 42 0aPhysical therapy assistantsxVocational guidance. 0aPhysical therapyxVocational guidance. 0aPhysical therapyxPractice.12aPhysical Therapist Assistantsxeducation.12aPhysical Therapist Assistantsxstandards.1 aNewman, Peggy DeCelle,eauthor.  a615.82 CURwDEWEYc1i33862001349954d3/18/2016e3/11/2016lON_SHELFmNORQ_MAINn1p$61.95rYsYtBOOKu12/19/2014  aRM 705 C873 2015wLCc1i0162034882207lON_SHELFmUAHLTHSCp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu12/3/2015zCOUTTS_ADD01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2004123800bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/6793297
