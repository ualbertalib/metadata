Home to three religions, it contains spiritual meaning for people the world over; it is at once a tourist destination and a location with a complex political reality. Tourism, therefore, is an integral part of Jerusalem's development and its political conflicts. The book traces tourism and pilgrimage to Jerusalem from the late Ottoman era, through the British Mandate, during the period of the divided city, and to the reunification of the city under Israeli rule. Throughout, the city's evolution is shown to be intertwined with its tourist industry, as tourist sites, accommodations, infrastructure, and services transform the city's structures and open spaces. At the same time, tourism is wielded by various parties in an effort to gain political recognition, to bolster territorial control, or to garner support. The city's future and the role tourism can play in it are examined. While the construction of a "security fence" will have many implications on Jerusalem's tourist industry, steps are proposed to minimize the effects of the security fence and optimize tourism. Written by leading academics, this title will be valuable reading students, academics and researchers in the fields of tourism, religious studies, geography, history, cultural studies, and anthropology"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aTourismxReligious aspectsxJudaism. 0aPilgrims and pilgrimageszJerusalem.1 aShoval, Noam,eauthor. 0aContemporary geographies of leisure, tourism and mobility ;v45.  aG 156.5 R44 C65 2015hUAED-Bi0162035240066  aG 156.5 R44 C65 2015wLCc1i0162035240066lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/19/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2006065761bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/43729974
