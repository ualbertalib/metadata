Drawing on original data, this book is the first general account of popular understandings of political ethics in contemporary British politics. It offers new insights into how citizens understand political ethics and integrity and how they form judgments of their leaders. By locating these insights against the backdrop of contemporary British political ethics, the book shows how current institutional preoccupations with standards of conduct all too often miss the mark. While the use of official resources is the primary focus of much regulation, politicians' consistency, frankness and sincerity, which citizens tend to see in terms of right and wrong, are treated as 'normal politics'. The authors suggest that new approaches may need to be adopted if public confidence in politicians' integrity is to be restored"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aPolitical corruptionzGreat Britain. 0aPolitical ethicszGreat Britain. 0aPoliticianszGreat Britain. 0aGreat BritainxPolitics and government.1 aBirch, Sarah.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107279568  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6801968-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/103119531
