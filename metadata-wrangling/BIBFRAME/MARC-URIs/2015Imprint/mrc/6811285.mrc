This format prevents students from understanding the connection between material learned in previous chapters with that of the current chapter. Using a unique format, A Hands-On Introduction to Forensic Science: Cracking the Case approaches the topic of forensic science from a real-life perspective in a way that these vital connections are encouraged and established. The book utilizes an ongoing fictional narrative throughout, entertaining students as it provides hands-on learning in order to "crack the case." As two investigators try to solve a missing persons case, each succeeding chapter reveals new characters, new information, and new physical evidence to be processed. A full range of topics are covered, including processing the crime scene, lifting prints, trace and blood evidence, DNA and mtDNA sequencing, ballistics, skeletal remains, and court testimony. Following the storyline, students are introduced to the appropriate science necessary to process the physical evidence, including math, physics, chemistry, and biology. The final element of each chapter includes a series of cost-effective, field-tested lab activities that train students in processing, analyzing, and documenting the physical evidence revealed in the narrative. Practical and realistic in its approach, this book enables students to understand how forensic science operates in the real world" --cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aCriminal investigation. 0aForensic ballistics. 0aChemistry, Forensic.1 aStephenson, Frank H.,eauthor.423Cover imageuhttp://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/websmall/978148223/9781482234909.jpg  aHV8073 .O453 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007400904p96.64kAVAIL_SOON  aHV8073 .O453 2015wLCc1i1007400904d7/21/2015e7/14/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn3p$92.04rYsYtBOOKu2/24/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014058556bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/310711483
