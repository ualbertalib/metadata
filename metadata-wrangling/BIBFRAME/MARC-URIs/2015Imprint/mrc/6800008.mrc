This book explores the composition of Roman silver coinage of the first century AD, re-examining traditional interpretations in the light of an entirely new programme of analyses of the coins, which illustrates the inadequacy of many earlier analytical projects. In addition, minor and trace elements, and lead isotopes, provide evidence for the supply of materials and refining and minting technology. Sometimes this allows us to determine the origin of the metal, whether freshly mined, or recycled. It can even pinpoint likely episodes of recycling old coins and, when combined with the study of hoards, hint at possible strategies of stockpiling of metal. The creation of reserves has a direct bearing on the question of the adequacy of revenues and fiscal health"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aCoins, Roman. 0aSilver coinszRome. 0aSilverxMetallurgy. 0aMetalsxAnalysis. 0aNumismatics, Roman. 0aCoinagezRomexHistory. 0aRomexAntiquities. 0aRomexHistoryyEmpire, 30 B.C.-284 A.D.1 aPonting, Matthew.1 aEvans, Janec(Geochemist)1 aPashley, Vanessa.1 aSomerfield, Christopher.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139225274  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800008-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/307433262
