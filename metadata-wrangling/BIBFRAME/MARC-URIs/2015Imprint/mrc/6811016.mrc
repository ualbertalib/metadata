In this book: theory boxes show you how to use key ideas in work contexts; case studies from European, Chinese, Australian and American contexts give you a truly global perspective; critical questions help you to challenge yourself; a full chapter gives practical tips on how to become an effective intercultural communicator; annotated lists of further reading and free access to online SAGE journal articles assist you in your research; and, a companion website provides you with exercise questions, as well as extended reading lists. This book will guide you to success in your studies and will teach you to become a more critical consumer of information.  a29 0aIntercultural communication.1 aVol훾i훾, Zala1 aGallois, Cynthia.  aP94.6 .L58 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007408717p63.16kAVAIL_SOON  aP94.6 .L58 2015wLCc1i1007408717d12/16/2016e12/13/2016lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn17p$63.16rYsYtBOOKu3/31/201501bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/222241018
