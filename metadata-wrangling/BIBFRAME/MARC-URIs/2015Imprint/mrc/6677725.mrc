The importance of these initiatives is such that an oversight function is required from executive management, whose role is to monitor the program ensuring that all parts are on track, support the program when required, and control different aspects of the program if things seem to go in the wrong direction. These dimensions of unification form the core of program governance. The need for program governance comes from the fact that there are certain aspects of the program that are not under the direct control of the program manager, and he or she requires support from the program governors to ascertain successful delivery of the program objectives. In addition, the program governors have to ensure that the program activities are being carried out as planned, and that any major deviations are accounted for and approved. In the following chapters, for the sake of clarity, all governance entities or roles (such as steering committees, program boards, program sponsors, etc., ) will be grouped together and referred to as program governors.
