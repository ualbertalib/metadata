Each chapter takes readers into the problems that plague this endangered member of our ecosystem, describing how teams of scientists examined how "white-nose syndrome, " caused by a fungus called Pd, is infecting the brown bat population. Scientists have searched different caves and mines in the eastern United States and discovered that Pd affects bats by damaging their wings. Since this discovery, they have been exploring ways to change the conditions so that these small mammals can survive hibernation. The text is written in a clear tone, providing information on the plight of the bats in an accessible style. The book integrates textual and visual information well, and strong back matter allows students to do additional research. An excellent work that will enlighten readers about a growing problem in the natural world."  a41 0aLittle brown batvJuvenile literature. 0aWhite-nose syndromexResearchvJuvenile literature. 0aLittle brown batxDiseasesxResearchvJuvenile literature.  aQL 737 C595 M365 2014c1hUAED-CU-Bi0162035151974  aQL 737 C595 M365 2014wLCc1i0162035151974d3/14/2016e3/3/2016lCURRICULUMmUAEDUCn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu9/19/201401bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/28445559
