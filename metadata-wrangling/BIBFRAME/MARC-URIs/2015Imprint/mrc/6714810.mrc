Stock markets are efficient in that they incorporate, and even anticipate, information about companies based on financial accounting data provided by companies. However, market efficiency results from extensive analysis performed by financial analysts. Much of this financial analysis is based on the analysis of financial information provided by companies and analyzed using financial ratio analysis. The goal of this book is to provide a step-by-step demonstration of how to download data from Internet sources, transfer the data into a spreadsheet, and conduct a financial ratio analysis of Coca-Cola. The book shows the steps needed to perform a financial ratio analysis, the financial statements to be retrieved from EDGAR, and the five categories of financial ratios used in the financial analysis of Coca-Cola. The data retrieved from the financial statements is copied to a worksheet and used to compute and graph the financial ratios. The ratios and graphs are used to determine the performance drivers of Coca-Cola.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on October 13, 2014).  a4420aCoca-Cola CompanyxAccounting. 0aFinancial statementsvCase studies.1 aGardner, John C.,eauthor.1 aMoeller, Susan E.,eauthor. 0aFinance and financial management collectionx2331-0057.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=10951841z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6714810-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu10/31/2014xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n88179282bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/31094317
