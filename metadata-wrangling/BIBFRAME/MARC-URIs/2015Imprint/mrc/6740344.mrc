There are often important divergences and even competing logics at work in these areas of research, some which may indeed be incommensurable. This volume explores how researchers around the globe are coming to terms - both theoretically and practically - with place in the context of settler colonialism, globalization, and environmental degradation. McKenzie and Tuck outline a trajectory of critical place inquiry that not only furthers empirical knowledge, but ethically imagines new possibilities for collaboration and action. Critical place inquiry can involve a range of research methodologies; this volume argues that what matters is how the chosen methodology engages conceptually with place in order to mobilize methods that enable data collection and analyses which address place explicitly and politically. Unlike other approaches which attempt to superficially tag on Indigenous concerns, decolonizing conceptualizations of land and place and Indigenous methods are central, not peripheral, to practices of critical place inquiry"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 43 0aSpacexSocial aspectsxResearch. 0aSocial sciencesxResearch.1 aMcKenzie, Marcia,eauthor. 0aRoutledge advances in research methods ;v9.  aHM 654 T83 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035184991  aHM 654 T83 2015wLCc1i0162035184991d7/5/2016e5/31/2016lON_SHELFmUAAUGn20p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/19/2014  aHM 654 T83 2015wLCc1i0162035193786d1/17/2017e1/17/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmUAHSSn9p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu11/26/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2009008003bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/78843055
