This is the first book of its kind to address how bilinguals acquire, store, and process figurative language, such as idiomatic expressions (e.g., kick the bucket), metaphors (e.g., lawyers are sharks), and irony, and how these tropes might interact in real time across the bilingual's two languages. This volume offers the reader and the bilingual student an overview of the major strands of research, both theoretical and empirical, currently being undertaken in this field of inquiry. At the same time, Bilingual Figurative Language Processing provides readers and undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to acquire hands-on experience in the development of psycholinguistic experiments in bilingual figurative language. Each chapter includes a section on suggested student research projects. Selected chapters provide detailed procedures on how to design and develop psycholinguistic experiments"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aLanguage and languagesxStudy and teaching. 0aPhraseologyxStudy and teaching. 0aVocabularyxStudy and teaching. 0aFigures of speech. 0aIdioms. 0aMetaphor. 0aEducation, Bilingual. 0aPsycholinguistics.1 aHeredia, Roberto R.,d1964-eeditor.1 aCieślicka, Anna B.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139342100  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6804093-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/12/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014057855bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/166630034
