Bragg's study addresses why such work should be the subject of scholarly examination, describes the events and attitudes which account for the critical neglect of this body of work, and models a critical approach to such narratives that demonstrates the distinctive ways in which this literature captures the complexities of post-civil rights era black experiences. In making her arguments regarding the value of popular writing, Bragg argues that black women's popular fiction foregrounds gender in ways that are frequently missing from other modes of narrative production. They exhibit a responsiveness and timeliness to the shifting social terrain which is reflected in the rapidly shifting styles and themes which characterize popular fiction. In doing so, they extend the historical function of African American literature by continuing to engage the black body as a symbol of political meaning in the social context of the United States. In popular literature Beauty Bragg locates a space from which black women engage a variety of public discourses"--Provided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a44 0aAmerican literaturexAfrican American authors. 0aAmerican literaturexWomen writers. 0aAmerican literaturexWomen authorsxHistory and criticism. 0aAmerican literaturexAfrican American authorsxHistory and criticism. 0aAfrican Americans in literature.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=909938z(Single User Access)  hUAINzEBSCOUA  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6789276-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/26/2015xE-BOOKzEBSCOUA01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014053363bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/287360578
