Looking at food producers and operators, consumers, and government agencies as part of an organic system, the book examines the complete system of the food supply chain from multi-scientific systematic points of view. It begins with the production of agricultural products and investigates the changing track of food safety (including imported and exported products) in the key aspects of production, circulation, and consumption between 2006 and 2011"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aFood adulteration and inspectionzChina. 0aFoodxSafety measuresxGovernment policyzChina. 0aFood contaminationzChina.1 aZhu, Dian.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781482218343z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6677751-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu9/15/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2010035617
