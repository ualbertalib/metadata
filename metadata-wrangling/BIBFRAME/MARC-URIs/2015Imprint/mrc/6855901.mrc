Fascinated by the sport of freediving―in which competitors descend great depths on a single breath―James Nestor embeds with a gang of oceangoing extreme athletes and renegade researchers. He finds whales that communicate with other whales hundreds of miles away, sharks that swim in unerringly straight lines through pitch-black waters, and other strange phenomena. Most illuminating of all, he learns that these abilities are reflected in our own remarkable, and often hidden, potential―including echolocation, directional sense, and the profound bodily changes humans undergo when underwater. Along the way, Nestor unlocks his own freediving skills as he communes with the pioneers who are expanding our definition of what is possible in the natural world, and in ourselves.  a330 aDeep diving.0 aUnderwater physiology.0 aMarine biology.0 aOceanography.  aGV 838.672 N47 2014wLCc1i0164000902340lON_SHELFmOLDSrYsYtBOOKu3/10/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2009040738bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/91026635
