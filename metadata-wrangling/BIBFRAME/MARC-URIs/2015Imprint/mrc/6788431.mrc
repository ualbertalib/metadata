Her focus is on spectatorship--in particular, the way blackness and black people are experienced in literature, music, television, and especially film--and her aim is to create a radical intervention into the way we talk about race and representation. As she describes: 'The essays in Black Looks are meant to challenge and unsettle, to disrupt and subvert.' As students, scholars, activists, intellectuals, and any other readers who have engaged with the book since its original release in 1992 can attest, that's exactly what these pieces do"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print version record.  a44 0aAfrican AmericansxSocial conditionsy1975- 0aAfrican Americans in popular culture. 0aAfrican American women. 0aSex rolezUnited States. 0aAfrican AmericansxRace identity. 0aWhitesxRace identityzUnited States. 0aRacismzUnited States. 0aUnited StatesxRace relations.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=864843z(Single User Access)  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6788431-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/23/2015xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n82203435bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/79115934
