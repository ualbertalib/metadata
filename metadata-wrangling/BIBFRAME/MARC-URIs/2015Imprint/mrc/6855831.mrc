The moment she and her two daughters, Jade and Gracie, pull up the isolated drive, Sarah is beset by uneasy memories--of her cold, distant mother, of the half-sister who vanished without a trace, and of a long-ago night when Sarah was found on the widow's walk, feverish and delirious. But Sarah has vowed to make a fresh start and renovate the old place. Between tending to her girls and the rundown property, she has little time to dwell on the past...Until a new, more urgent menace enters the picture. One by one, teenage girls are disappearing. Frantic for her daughters' safety, Sarah feels the house's walls closing in on her again. Somewhere deep in her memory is the key to a very real and terrifying danger. And only by confronting her most terrifying fears can she stop the nightmare roaring back to life once more..."--Page 4 of cover.  a3 0aSingle mothersvFiction. 0aMothers and daughtersvFiction. 0aMansionsxRemodelingvFiction. 0aMissing personsvFiction. 0aTeenage girlsxCrimes againstvFiction. 0aOregonvFiction.  aMystery JACwASISc1i33862001359110d11/4/2016e9/29/2016lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINn1p$7.49rYsYtPAPERBACKu5/5/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no91028092bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/50377559
