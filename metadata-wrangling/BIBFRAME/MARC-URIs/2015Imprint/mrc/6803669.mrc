As writings by Roland Barthes, Maurice Blanchot, Albert Camus, and Marguerite Duras show, seemingly disengaged literary principles - such as blankness, minimalism, silence, and indeterminateness - can be deployed to a number of potent political and ethical ends. At the time the main focus of this activism was the escalation of violence in colonial Algeria. The poetics formulated by these writers suggests that blankness, weakness, and withdrawal from action are not symptoms of impotence and political escapism in the face of historical events, but deliberate literary strategies aimed to neutralize the drive to dominate others that characterized the colonial project"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aFrench literaturey20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aPolitics and literaturezFrancexHistoryy20th century. 0aEthics in literature. 0aDecolonization in literature.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316145463  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6803669-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/11/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014054788bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/310616918
