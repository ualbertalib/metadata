The project aimed to develop a set of tools for reducing road and rail traffic noise in outdoor environments by the optimal use of vegetation, soil, other natural materials and recycled materials in combination with artificial elements. The project studied a number of green abatement strategies that might achieve cost-effective improvements using new barrier designs, planting of trees, shrubs, or bushes, ground and road surface treatments, and greening of building facades and roofs. The noise reduction was assessed in terms of sound level reductions, perceptual effects, and cost-benefit analyses"-Provided by publisher.  a44 0aTransportation noise. 0aRailroadsxNoise. 0aNoise barriers. 0aPlants as noise barriers. 0aTrees.1 aNilsson, Mats,d1964-eeditor.1 aBengtsson, Jörgen,eeditor.1 aKlæboe, Ronny,eeditor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781482288773z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6749005-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu12/2/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2006113111bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/2.91459714843e+19
