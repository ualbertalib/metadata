The planning process is shown to be an integral function of developing management strategies for future growth and the gaining of competitive advantage in these fast moving times. Budgeting is presented as a logical outgrowth and an essential part of the planning process rather than an independent internal activity. The book emphasizes the principal factors that should be considered in planning and budgeting for the company, what management and operations personnel must know to better understand effective planning for the business, and what can be done to enhance the overall strategic and financial planning for the organization.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on December 21, 2014).  a44 0aStrategic planning. 0aBusiness planning. 0aStrategic management collection,.x2150-9646403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=10997457  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800017-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n93046814bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/79528369
