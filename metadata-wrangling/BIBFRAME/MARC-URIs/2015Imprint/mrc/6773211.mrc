David Barnett examines both Brecht the theorist and Brecht the practitioner to reveal the complementary relationship between the two. This book aims to sensitize the reader to the approaches Brecht took to the world and the stage with a view to revealing just how carefully he thought about and realized his vision of a politicized, interventionist theatre. What emerges is a nuanced understanding of his concepts, his work with actors and his approaches to directing. The reader is encouraged to engage with Brecht's method that sought to 'make theatre politically' in order to locate the innovations he introduced into his stagecraft. There are many examples given of how Brecht's ideas can be staged, and the final chapter takes two very different plays and asks how a Brechtian approach can enliven and illuminate their production. Ultimately, the book invites readers, students and theatre-makers to discover new ways of apprehending and making use of Brecht"--cProvided by publisher.  a"A re-examination of Bertolt Brecht the theatre practitioner in the light of his theoretical writings and his work in the theatre"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print version record.  a4410aBrecht, Bertolt,d1898-1956xCriticism and interpretation.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=839567xLimited to 365 Uses Per Calendar Yearz(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  aInternet AccesshUAINzPDAOWNED  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6773211-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/12/2015xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79018801bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/2467372
