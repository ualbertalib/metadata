It has made an important contribution toward improving our soft power. The 'Confucius' brand has a natural attractiveness. Using the excuse of teaching Chinese language, everything looks reasonable and logical." So runs the report of a speech by Li Changchun, member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the highest body of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Beijing Headquarters of the Confucius Institute in November 2011. Officially known as The Office of the Chinese Language Council International and commonly as 'Hanban,' the Confucius Institute is a Chinese government agency inserted into an increasing number of universities and lower schools the world around, ostensibly with the reasonable and logical mission of teaching Chinese language and culture and veritably with the practical mission of promoting the real-political influence of the People's Republic. This pamphlet is about the academic malpractices that ensue from mixing the two." --page 4 of cover.  aIncludes bibliographical references.  a43 0aChinese languagexStudy and teachingxForeign speakers. 0aParadigm (Chicago, Ill.) ;v48.  aPL 1069 C66 S24 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035242104  aPL 1069 C66 S24 2015wLCc1i0162035242104d2/18/2016e2/10/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/26/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50016277bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/108302555
