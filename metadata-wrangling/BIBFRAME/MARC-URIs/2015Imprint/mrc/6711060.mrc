Making creative connections between existing scholarship in language policy and contemporary theory and research in other social sciences, authors from around the world offer new critical perspectives for analyzing language phenomena and language theories, suggesting new meeting points among language users and language policy makers, norms, and traditions in diverse cultural, geographical, and historical contexts. Identifying and expanding on previously neglected aspects of language studies, the book is inspired by the work of Elana Shohamy, whose critical view and innovative work on a broad spectrum of key topics in applied linguistics has influenced many scholars in the field to think "out of the box" and to reconsider some basic commonly held understandings, specifically with regard to the impact of language and languaging on individual language users rather than on the masses"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aEnglish languagexStudy and teachingxForeign speakers.1 aSpolsky, Bernard,eeditor.1 aInbar-Lourie, Ofra,eeditor.1 aTannenbaum, Michal,eeditor.  aPE 1128 C474 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035172186  aPE 1128 C474 2015wLCc1i0162035172186d8/16/2016e8/8/2016lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn5p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu10/22/201401bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/311829430
