Social media covers a number of different platforms that enable a user to interact and share information such as comments, photographs, videos and audio, publicly or privately with other users online. The most well-known include LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and Facebook. While there are existing works covering the law of defamation and communications based offences, this is the first book to cover the specific issues highlighted by social media. This practical guide offers practitioners' innovative ways to handle claims using the existing law and working within the rules of the platform providers themselves. The author also explores the risks which social media may present in a manner which allows in house counsel and communications professionals determine what procedures, policies, specifications and standards must be adopted in organisations' internal governance and explains how to build regulatory frameworks to achieve compliance. This book will be of great use to legal practitioners specialising in communications or internet law, in house counsel, communications professionals, journalists, students of communications law and anyone who uses social media in their work"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 0aSocial mediaxLaw and legislationzGreat Britain.423Cover imageuhttp://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/websmall/978041574/9780415745482.jpg  aKD667 .C65 S27 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007436247p215.20kAVAIL_SOON  aKD667 .C65 S27 2015wLCc1i1007436247d3/5/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$215.20rYsYtBOOKu1/26/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014026095bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/308232998
