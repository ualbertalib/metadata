More than an anthology, Personal Effects represents an author case study and an example for modern Italian American interdisciplinary scholarship. Personal Effects examines DeSalvo's memoirs as works that push the boundaries of the most controversial genre of the past few decades. In these works, the author fearlessly explores issues such as immigration, domesticity, war, adultery, illness, mental health, sexuality, the environment, and trauma through the lens of gender, ethnic, and working-class identity. Alongside her groundbreaking scholarship, DeSalvo's memoirs attest to the power and influence of this feminist Italian American writer"--cProvided by publisher.  a"The two editors and eighteen scholars and creative nonfiction writers offer a lucid view of a writer who has produced one of the most provocative bodies of memoir writing in contemporary US literature, a scholar who has enriched our understanding of Virginia Woolf, and a teacher who has transformed countless lives"--cProvided by publisher.  a1610aDeSalvo, Louise A.,d1942-xCriticism and interpretation.1 aCaronia, Nancy,eeditor.1 aGiunta, Edvige,eeditor. 0aCritical studies in Italian America.  aPR 55 D47 P47 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035223567  aPR 55 D47 P47 2015wLCc1i0162034576866lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n98101232bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/27316193
