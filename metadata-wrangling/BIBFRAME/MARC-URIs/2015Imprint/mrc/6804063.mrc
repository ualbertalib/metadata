As ironic as it may seem, very few academic leaders have had any formal training in academic administration, or in any kind of administration at all. For the most part, academic administrators learn on the job. They also seek advice wherever they can get it. The purpose of this book is to offer such advice. The book is written both for academic administrators at all levels as well as for those who aspire to academic administration.  a33 41 0aUniversities and collegeszUnited StatesxAdministration. 0aEducational leadershipzUnited States.1 aSternberg, Robert J.  aLB 2341 A228 2015wLCc1i1164000175680lON_SHELFmOLDSrYsYtBOOKu2/20/2015  aLB 2341 A228 2015wLCc1i0162035279031d1/30/2017e1/30/2017kCHECKEDOUTlFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn2p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu4/29/2015zCOUTTS_ADD01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79081284bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/108476906
