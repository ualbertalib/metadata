From wrongful convictions to botched executions, capital punishment is fraught with controversy. In The Death Penalty: What's Keeping it Alive, award-winning criminal defense attorney Andrea Lyon turns a critical eye towards the reasons why the death penalty remains active in most states, in spite of well-documented flaws in the justice system. The book opens with an overview of the history of the death penalty in America, then digs into the reasons capital punishment is a fixture in the justice system of most states. The author argues that religious and moral convictions play a role, as does media coverage of crime and punishment. Politics, however, plays the biggest role, according to the author, with no one wanting to look soft on crime. The death penalty remains a deadly political tool in most of the United States."--Publisher's description.  a16 0aCapital punishmentzUnited StatesxHistory.  aHV 8699 U5 L96 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035232071  aHV 8699 U5 L96 2015wLCc1i0162034578367d2/12/2015e2/9/2015lON_SHELFmUAAUGn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n85306933bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/75309017
