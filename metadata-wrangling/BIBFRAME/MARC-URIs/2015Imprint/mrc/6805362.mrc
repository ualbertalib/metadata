STEM competence has become seen as key to higher productivity, technological adaptation and research-based innovation. No area of educational provision has a greater current importance than the STEM disciplines yet there is a surprising dearth of comprehensive and world-wide information about STEM policy, participation, programs and practice. The Age of STEM is a state of the art survey of the global trends and major country initiatives in STEM. It gives an international overview of issues such as:STEM strategy and coordination curricula, teaching and assessment women in STEM indigenous students research training STEM in the graduate labour marketsSTEM breadth and STEM depthThe individual chapters give comparative international analysis as well as a global overview, particularly focusing on the growing number of policies and practices in mobilising and developing talent in the STEM fields. The book will be of particular interest to anyone involved in educational policy, those in education management and leaders in both schooling and tertiary education. It will have a wider resonance among practitioners in the STEM disciplines, particularly at university level, and for those interested in contemporary public policy"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print version record.  a44 0aSciencexStudy and teaching (Secondary)vCase studies. 0aSciencexStudy and teaching (Higher)vCase studies. 0aTechnologyxStudy and teaching (Secondary)vCase studies. 0aTechnologyxStudy and teaching (Higher)vCase studies. 0aEngineeringxStudy and teaching (Secondary)vCase studies. 0aEngineeringxStudy and teaching (Higher)vCase studies. 0aMathematicsxStudy and teaching (Secondary)vCase studies. 0aMathematicsxStudy and teaching (Higher)vCase studies. 0aEducation and statevCase studies.1 aFreeman, Brigid,eeditor.1 aMarginson, Simon,d1951-eeditor.1 aTytler, Russell,eeditor. 0aRoutledge research in education.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=880915z(Single User Access)  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6805362-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/17/2015xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014054118bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/93242612
