The faerie world Brianna remembers from childhood was a place of wonders and delights. But by the time she was a teenager, the eternal jockeying over the succession had become a grim business of shifting allegiances and secrets bargains for power. Brianna and her mother--a human, a witch, and, for a time, the lover of the Fae king--fled to Earth. To protect her half-human, half-Fae, definitely royal daughter, Brianna's mother changed the Veil that separates the two worlds, making it impenetrable by faerie magic. Since then, Brianna has mostly lived as a human. She runs a small magic shop, selling herbs, magical objects, and the occasional spell--keeping always to First, Do No Harm--with the help of her best friend and protector, a living stone gargoyle. Brianna is unaware that in the Fae world, events foretold in an ancient prophecy begin to come to pass ... placing everything and everyone she holds dear in dire jeopardy"--Page 4 of cover.  a3 0aFairiesvFiction. 0aMagicvFiction. 0aGargoylesvFiction. 7aFantasy fiction.2gsafd  aFantasy ADAwASISc1i33862001359128d6/27/2016e6/9/2016lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINn3p$13.88rYsYtPAPERBACKu5/5/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2003049418bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/63383042
