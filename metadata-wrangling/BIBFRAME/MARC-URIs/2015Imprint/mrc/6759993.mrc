The Lesbian and Gay Movements explores this dilemma in both contemporary and historical contexts, describing the sources of these conflicts, to what extent the conflicts have been resolved, and how they might be resolved in future. Rimmerman also tackles the challenging issue of what constitutes movement "effectiveness" and how "effective" the assimilationist and liberationist strategies have been in three contentious policy arenas: the military ban, same-sex marriage, and AIDS. Considerable attention is devoted to how policy elites-presidents, federal and state legislatures, courts-have responded to the movements' grievances. Since the publication of the first edition in 2007, there have been enormous changes in the landscape of lesbian and gay movements and rights. The thoroughly revised second edition includes updated discussion of LGBT movements' undertakings in, as well the Obama administration's response to, AIDS/HIV policy, the fight to legalize same-sex marriage and overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, and the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell.""--cProvided by publisher.  a"Throughout their relatively short history, the lesbian and gay movements in the United States have endured searing conflicts over whether to embrace assimilationist or liberationist strategies. This new book explores this dilemma in both contemporary and historical contexts, describing the sources of these conflicts, to what extent the conflicts have been resolved, and how they might be resolved in future. The text also tackles the challenging issue of what constitutes movement "effectiveness" and how "effective" the assimilationist and liberationist strategies have been in three contentious policy arenas: the military ban, same-sex marriage, and AIDS. Considerable attention is devoted to how policy elites--most notably Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton; Congress; and the Supreme Court--have responded to the movements' grievances. The book examines the George W. Bush presidency with an eye to assessing how political opportunities have informed the broader lesbian and gay movements' strategies, and also details the response of the Christian Right to the movements' various assimilationist and liberationist strategies"--cProvided by publisher.  a29 43 0aGay liberation movementzUnited States. 0aGay rightszUnited States. 0aHomosexualityxPolitical aspectszUnited States. 0aAssimilation (Sociology) 0aUnited StatesxSocial conditions. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and government. 0aDilemmas in American politics.  aHQ 76.8 U5 R58 2014c1hUAHS-Bi0162035200839  aHQ 76.8 U5 R58 2014wLCc1i0162035200839d7/28/2016e7/16/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu12/18/2014  aHQ76.8 .U5 R58 2014wLCc1i1007431750d4/19/2016e4/6/2016lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn1p$44.60rYsYtBOOKu1/13/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n92090286bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/44386678
