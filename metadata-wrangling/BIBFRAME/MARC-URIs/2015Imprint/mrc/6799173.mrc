Should the public expect punitive and coercive approaches to offender rehabilitation? Why should the state be interested in the reform of individuals and how can helping offenders be justified when there are other disadvantaged groups in society who are unable to access the services they desperately need? Finally, why does the state appear to target and criminalise certain groups and individuals and not others? These are just some of the questions asked in this new text, which offers an analysis of the delivery of rehabilitative services to offenders over the past two decades. It focuses particularly on the ideological and political imperatives of a neoliberal state that intends to segment the work of the Probation Service and hand over the majority of its work to the private sector. Issues covered include: governance, politics and performance of probation, occupational culture and professional identity, markets, profit and delivery, partnership, localism and civil society, citizenship, exclusion and the State. This book is aimed at academics, practitioners, managers and leaders within the field of corrections and wider social policy. It will also appeal to under undergraduates and postgraduates specialising in criminal justice, criminology, politics and social policy"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 0aProbationzGreat Britain. 0aCriminalsxRehabilitationzGreat Britain. 0aRehabilitationzGreat Britain.1 aCollett, Steve,eauthor.  aHV 9345 A5 B87 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035232642  aHV 9345 A5 B87 2015wLCc1i0162035232642lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014021922bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/308229724
