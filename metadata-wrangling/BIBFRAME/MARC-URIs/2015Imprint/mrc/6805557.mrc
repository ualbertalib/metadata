The 2008 subprime crisis - as well as the housing bubble that produced it - was the most recent manifestation of this buildup, boom, and bust cycle, developing as a consequence of the decision to deficit-finance the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Earlier instances of financial crises were generated by deficit-financed buildups in the 1980s and the late 1960s. The buildup, boom, and bust pattern results from the way political institutions and financial power shape America's response to military challenges: political institutions transform increased military spending into budget deficits, and financial power enables the United States to finance these deficits by borrowing cheaply from the rest of the world. Oatley examines how this cycle has had a powerful impact on American and global economic and financial performance"--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a44 0aMilitary policy. 0aGlobal Financial Crisis, 2008-2009. 0aBusiness cycleszUnited States. 0aGlobalizationxEconomic aspects. 0aUnited StatesxDefensesxEconomic aspects. 0aUnited StatesxForeign economic relations.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316109199  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6805557-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/17/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n97046538bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/116021798
