It focuses on similarity search queries, showing how to use distance functions to measure the notion of dissimilarity.After defining database queries and similarity search queries, the book organizes the most common and representative index structures according to their characteristics. The author first describes low-dimensional index structures, memory-based index structures, and hierarchical disk-based index structures. He then outlines useful distance measures and index structures that use the distance information to efficiently solve similarity search queries. Focusing on the difficult dimensionality phenomenon, he also presents several indexing methods that specifically deal with high-dimensional spaces. In addition, the book covers data reduction techniques, including embedding, various data transforms, and histograms.Through numerous real-world examples, this book explores how to effectively index and search for information in large collections of data. Requiring only a basic computer science background, it is accessible to practitioners and advanced undergraduate students"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aFile organization (Computer science) 0aDatabase management. 0aQuerying (Computer science) 0aDatabase searching. 0aIndexing.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781466582552z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6786206-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/20/2015xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014063783bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/311458143
