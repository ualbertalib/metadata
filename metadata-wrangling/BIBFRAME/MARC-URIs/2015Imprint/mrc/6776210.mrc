In this context systematic management of innovation and product management are increasingly important for company success. This book presents the fundamentals of innovation and product management and introduces the reader to a holistic process model with particular focus on innovation and uncertainty. This integrated consideration of innovation management and product innovation within an interdisciplinary approach represents a unique characteristic of this book. The book is designed to address the needs of managers who want a practical but well-researched guide to innovation and product management. Graduate and advanced undergraduate students would also find the chapters in this book particularly useful. 0aProduction management. 0aProduct management. 0aManufacturesxTechnological innovations.1 aRabl, Michael,eauthor.1 aSwan, Scott,eauthor.1 aWerani, Thomas,eauthor. 0aSpringer texts in business and economics.x2192-4333  a29  aTS155 .G38 2015wLCc1i1007400193d1/20/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$115.64rYsYtBOOKu1/14/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n00111230bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/3.07314906853e+21
