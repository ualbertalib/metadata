Zdenek Salzmann and coauthors James Stanlaw and Nobuko Adachi have revised this classic text with extensive updates and expanded discussions of contemporary issues in the field. This sixth edition continues to be the essential teaching text for the introductory linguistic anthropology course.

More exercises on phonetics and syntax, reflecting contemporary research. Sidebars and boxes throughout the book to provide ethnographic detail, enhance student comprehension of context, and illustrate the practical experience of conducting linguistic research. A global perspective and a focus on transnational and multilingual anthropology Expanded sections on written languages and theoretical and historical perspectives of Linguistic Anthropology. End-of-chapter summary and conclusion sections and a glossary for easy review, as well as an updated bibliography for further research.
