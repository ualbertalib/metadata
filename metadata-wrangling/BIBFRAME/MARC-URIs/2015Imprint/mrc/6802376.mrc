Indeed, few analysts would dispute the observation that China's power has strongly influenced the structure of the international system, major-power strategic relations, international security, the patterns of trans-border economic activities, and most importantly, the political and security dynamics in Asia in the twenty-first century. This book maps the growth of China's political, economic, and military capabilities and its impact on the security order in Asia over the coming decades. While updating the emerging power dimensions and prevailing discourse, it provides a nuanced analysis of whether the growth of Chinese power is resulting in Beijing becoming more assertive, or even aggressive, in its behavior and pursuit of national interests. It also examines how the key Asian countries perceive and react to the growth of China's power and how US rebalancing would play out in the context of Beijing's political, economic, and military power. China's Power and Asian Security will be of huge interest to student and scholars of Asian politics, Chinese politics, security studies and international security and international relations more generally"--cProvided by publisher.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (EBSCO, viewed December 10, 2014).  a44 0aSecurity, InternationalzAsia. 0aChinaxForeign relationsy21st century. 0aChinaxEconomic conditionsy2000- 0aChinaxForeign economic relations. 0aChinaxMilitary policy. 0aChinaxForeign relationszAsia. 0aAsiaxForeign relationszChina.1 aLi, Mingjiang,eeditor of compilation.1 aKemburi, Kalyan M.,eeditor of compilation. 0aPolitics in Asia series.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=916888z(Single User Access)  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6802376-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/10/2015xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2012201181bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/285919974
