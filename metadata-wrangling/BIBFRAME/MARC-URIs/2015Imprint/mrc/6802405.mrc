Based on working-class autobiography, the book challenges dominant assumptions about absent or 'feckless' fathers, and reintegrates the paternal figure within the emotional life of families. Locating this autobiography within broader social and cultural commentary, Julie-Marie Strange considers material culture, everyday practice, obligation, duty and comedy as sites for the development and expression of complex emotional lives. Emphasising the importance of separating men as husbands from men as fathers, Strange explores how emotional ties were formed between fathers and their children, the models of fatherhood available to working-class men, and the ways in which fathers interacted with children inside and outside the home. She explodes the myth that working-class interiorities are inaccessible or unrecoverable, and locates life stories in the context of other sources, including social surveys, visual culture and popular fiction"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aFatherhoodzGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century. 0aFatherhoodzGreat BritainxHistoryy20th century. 0aWorking class familieszGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century. 0aWorking class familieszGreat BritainxHistoryy20th century. 0aWorking class menzGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century. 0aWorking class menzGreat BritainxHistoryy20th century. 0aGreat BritainxSocial conditionsy19th century. 0aGreat BritainxSocial conditionsy20th century.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316027059  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6802405-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/10/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2005027347bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/54479107
