When Isaac Bell's boss and lifelong friend Joseph Van Dorn is shot and nearly killed leading the high-speed chase of a rum-running vessel, Bell swears to him that he will hunt down the lawbreakers, but he doesn't know what he is getting into. When a witness to Van Dorn's shooting is executed in a ruthlessly efficient manner invented by the Russian secret police, it becomes clear that these are no ordinary criminals. On a trail that leads from the ravages of post WWI Europe to the speakeasies of New York to the lawless streets of Detroit and Florida's lavish beachside resorts, Isaac tracks the footsteps of a criminal enterprise more ingenious and far-reaching than any he has ever known. He is up against a team of Bolshevik assassins and saboteurs, and they are intent on overthrowing the government of the United States. Packed with daring escapades and incredible heroics"--Provided by publisher.  a21 35 0aBell, Isaac (Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aPrivate investigatorsvFiction. 0aProhibitionvFiction.1 aScott, Justin.1 aCussler, Clive.tIsaac Bell novels.  aCUSwLCc1i30125302525729lPAPERBACKSmRED_DEER_CrYsYtBOOKu3/4/2015  aFIC CUSwLCc1i33333001339858lFICTIONmCONCORDIArYsYtBOOKu11/14/201601bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/56608054
