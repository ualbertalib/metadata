The Essentials of Teaching provides the fundamental knowledge for becoming a great teacher. Combining a grounded, modern rationale for learning and teaching with highly practical training approaches it covers everything you need to know from preparing for your teaching practice to getting your first job. Harnessing a range of simple, but powerful techniques, the book shows you how you can translate the Teachers' Standards into your own classroom practice and provide the evidence that you have met them. It also demystifies what the best teachers know and do instinctively to create students who want to learn and get a buzz from developing new skills. The book is structured in clear sections which are then divided into short, easy-to-absorb units offering clear, straightforward advice on all aspects of teaching including: - why teach? - the application and recruitment process for training - helping students' achieve good progress - planning, differentiation and assessment - behaviour management - using language effectively in the classroom - managing parents' evenings - being an effective tutor - how to have lunch! With talking points to encourage reflection and a wide range of examples to illustrate practice, Teach Now! The Essentials of Teaching provides expert guidance as you start your exciting and rewarding career as an outstanding teacher"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aTeaching. 0aTeachersxTraining of. 0aTeach now!  aLB 1025.3 B365 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035221850  aLB 1025.3 B365 2015wLCc1i0162035221850d2/23/2016e1/10/2016lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn6p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/21/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb2004301591bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/85102989
