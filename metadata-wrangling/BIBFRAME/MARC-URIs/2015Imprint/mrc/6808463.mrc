This edited collection considers how the concept of Academic Bildung - a term suggesting a personal educational process beyond actual educational learning - can be applied to net-based higher education, drawing on Scandinavian research to address the topic from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. Chapters explore the facilitation of online courses and argue how and why universities should involve dimensions of Academic Bildung on both a strategic and technological pedagogical content level.The book is structured in three parts: Part I frames the current state of net-based learning and introduces Bildung as a concept; Part II contains a set of 4 case studies in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, also including a fifth study that looks at Scandinavian approaches to teaching and learning in comparison with data from USA, UK, Australia and Canada; Part III provides a synthesis of theories and cases to examine whether a Scandinavian orientation can be discerned. Contributions suggest that in order to address one of the fundamental functions of higher education, the ability to produce new knowledge, the Academic Bildung of the students has to be in focus. Grounded in theoretical and empirical discussion, this book will appeal to researchers and academics in the field of higher education as well as personnel who work with teaching and learning with technology, and academics interested in the question of Academic Bildung"--cProvided by publisher.0 aVendor-supplied metadata.  a44 0aInternet in higher educationzScandinavia. 0aProfessional educationxWeb-based instructionzScandinavia.1 aFossland, Trine,eeditor.1 aMathiasen, Helle,eeditor.1 aSolberg, Mariann,eeditor. 0aRoutledge research in higher education.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=955694z(Single User Access)  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6808463-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/20/2015xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/7.81459699375e+19
