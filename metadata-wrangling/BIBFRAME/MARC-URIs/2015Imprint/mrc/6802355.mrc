What are international family therapist's perspectives on treatment? These questions and more are explored in Multicultural Family Art Therapy, a text that demonstrates how to practice psychotherapy within an ethnocultural and empathetic context. Each international author presents their clinical perspective and cultural family therapy narrative, thereby giving readers the structural framework they need to work successfully with clients with diverse ethnic backgrounds different from their own. A wide range of international contributors provide their perspectives on visual symbols and content from America, Canada, Britain, Ireland, Australia, Israel, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Trinidad, Central America, and Brazil. They also address a diversity of theoretical orientations, including attachment, solution-focused, narrative, parent-child, and brief art therapy, and write about issues such as indigenous populations, immigration, acculturation, identity formation, and cultural isolation. At the core of this new text is the realization that family art therapy should address not only the diversity of theory, but also the diversity of international practice"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aFamily psychotherapyvCross-cultural studies. 0aCultural psychiatry. 0aArt therapy.1 aKerr, Christine,eeditor. 0aFamily therapy and counseling series.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=929042z(Single User Access)  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6802355-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/10/2015xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2006092374
