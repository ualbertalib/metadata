This outstanding collection corrects that, examining some of the central themes of Division two and their wide-ranging and challenging implications. An international team of leading philosophers explore the crucial notions that articulate Heidegger's concept of authenticity, including death, anxiety, conscience, guilt, resolution and temporality. In doing so, they clarify the bearing of Division two's reflections on our understanding of intentionality, normativity, responsibility, autonomy and selfhood. These discussions raise important questions about how we may need to rethink the morals of Division one of Being and time, the broader project to which that book was devoted, the shaping influence of figures such as Aristotle and Kierkegaard, as well as Heidegger's relationship with his contemporaries and successors."--Publisher's website.  a16 29 4310aHeidegger, Martin,d1889-1976.tSein und Zeit. 0aAuthenticity (Philosophy) 0aSelf (Philosophy) 0aOntology.1 aMcManus, Denis,d1967-eeditor.  aB 3279 H48 S4446 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035223112  aB 3279 H48 S4446 2015wLCc1i0162035218237d9/30/2015e9/27/2015lON_SHELFmUAAUGn3p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/14/2015  aB 3279 H48 S4446 2015wLCc1i0162035223112d2/15/2017e2/13/2017lON_SHELFmUAHSSn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/14/2015  aB3279 .H48 S4446 2015wLCc1i1007435991d2/10/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$55.33rYsYtBOOKu1/28/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2004089329bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/98046573
