Nitrogen is essential for all life on Earth. This informative book explains how the Earth's supply of nitrogen moves in different forms in a cycle from the air to the soil to living things. Highly readable text and supportive images help explain such processes as fixation, nitrification, and dentrification, as well as the important role of bacteria in the nitrogen cycle. Feature boxes highlight examples of the ways in which human activity, such as adding more nitrogen to the soil to make plants grow faster, releases harmful greenhouse gases into the air interfering with the nitrogen cycle. Readers are encouraged to find ways to take action and find solutions"--cProvided by publisher.  aUniversity of Alberta Library copy in the Canadian Children's Book Centre Depository Collection.  a41 0aNitrogen cyclevJuvenile literature.1 aDakers, Diane.tEarth's cycles in action.  aQH 344 D38 2015c1hUAED-CU-Bi0162035222395  aQH 344 D38 2015wLCc1i0162035222395lCURRICULUMmUAEDUCp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/21/2015  aQH 344 D38 2015wLCc2i0162034252435lCCBCCmUAEDUCp$150.00rYsYtNO_LOANu4/14/201501bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/121056102
