The atmosphere is the largest component of this environment, and, of the three portals for intoxication of the human body, the lungs are the largest surface exposed to this environment. Protecting the lungs from exposures to hazardous chemicals in the environment is often more difficult than protecting the human body from ingestion and dermal absorption hazards. Hazardous chemicals enter the body through the lungs in both the occupational and domestic environments. Among the substances frequently inhaled with air are an array of gases, aerosols, and particulates from natural and anthropogenic sources. In addition, some humans occasionally inhale therapeutic and/or abused drugs. The objective of Inhalation Toxicology is to provide the practicing professional as well as the aspiring student with a pragmatic textbook. It includes contributions from scientists in the academic, commercial/industrial, and governmental sectors and focuses on the regulatory aspects of exposure and testing, testing equipment and procedures, respiratory allergy and irritation of the respiratory tract, risk assessment, toxicology theory and toxicology modeling, and toxic effects of some individual toxicants. The contributors are from China, Germany, Israel, Slovenia, Switzerland, and United States"--Provided by publisher.  a44 0aGases, Asphyxiating and poisonousxToxicology.1 aSalem, Harry,d1929- ,eeditor.1 aKatz, Sidney A.,d1935- ,eeditor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781466552746z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6677717-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu9/15/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n83162125bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/51749831
