How should prices differ between ordinary and premium seating? How much of a discount in admission should be offered through membership or season subscription? Does it make sense to charge higher ticket prices but offer relatively low mark-ups on refreshments available inside the venue, or to have lower ticket prices but a high mark-up on refreshments? When does it make sense to partner with organizations (possibly not from the arts) to offer discounts? When should nonprofit or state arts organizations depart from profit-maximizing pricing strategies? Should ticket prices for a single performance remain fixed, or can it be beneficial to raise or lower ticket prices in response to surprisingly high, or low, demand? This accessible text provides a concise, practical, non-technical guide for setting prices. It brings the insights of sophisticated research into the art of pricing to the working arts manager or student, in accessible language, appropriate for students or practitioners with no formal training in economics"--cProvided by publisher.  a"With roughly half of all income for non-profit arts organizations in the United States coming from earned revenue rather than donations and state funding, the issue of pricing is paramount to success in the arts industry, yet pricing is not covered in any existing textbooks. How should prices differ between ordinary and premium seating? How much of a discount in admission should be offered through membership or season subscription? When does it make sense to partner with organizations to offer discounts? Arts managers, whether working in the performing arts, museums or festivals, and whether in the commercial, non-profit, or state sector, need to make informed decisions on the prices they set. This accessible text provides the first concise, practical, non-technical guide for setting prices in the arts industry. Offering a practical introduction to pricing, this book is perfectly suited to students studying arts management /administration as well as new managers working in the creative and cultural industries"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aArtsxMarketing. 0aPricing.  aNX 634 R87 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035153129  aNX 634 R87 2015wLCc1i0162035153129d2/23/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/26/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2003082564bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/29226160
