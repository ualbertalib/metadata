Our global interconnectedness and the scale of disaster events has grown to the point where catastrophic disasters have regional, national, and even global economic consequences. This volume presents a systematic process of hazards identification, vulnerability determination, and consequence assessment for the natural, built, and human environment. The book aims to examine strategies that may be taken at the individual, organization, community, and regional levels to reduce the adverse consequences of disasters and to foster sustainability"--cProvided by publisher.  a"Preface The social, economic and environmental impacts from natural and human caused disasters have increased during the recent decades. The impacts from these disasters are seen on a global scale and are driving efforts to reduce adverse consequences on vulnerable populations and communities. We have attempted to reduce the costs of these disasters but continue to carry out policies that encourage development in vulnerable geographic areas of the world. With threats imposed by global warming, we see that many communities are subject to increasing levels of risk and can achieve sustainable development through appropriately informed planning, protection, mitigation and recovery strategies. Strategies to enhance community resilience to hazards must be based on research that integrates complex social, economic and environmental systems. Hazards Analysis: Reducing the Impacts of Disasters provides a structure and process for understanding the nature of natural and human caused hazards and strategies for building sustainable communities. The key to sustainability is acknowledging the unique nature of the local community and how geography, social systems, the economy and infrastructures influence a community's capacity to withstand and recover from a disaster. This book demonstrates how we use hazards analysis to identify and prioritize risks and develop approaches to community hazard mitigation. The role of hazard risk management is stressed for public, private and non-profit organizations"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 23 0aDisastersxSocial aspects. 0aEmergency management. 0aPreparedness. 0aCommunity organization. 0aDisastersxRisk assessment. 0aRisk management.12aDisasters.12aRisk Management.22aCivil Defense.22aDisaster Planning.22aSocioeconomic Factors.08iRevision of:aPine, John C.tNatural hazards analysis.dBoca Raton, FL. : Auerbach Publications, ©2009w(DLC)  2008023245423Cover imageuhttp://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/websmall/978148222/9781482228915.jpg  aHV 553 P528 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035236056  aHV 553 P528 2015wLCc1i0162035236056lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/2015  aHV 553 P528 2015wLCc1i32860001070084lON_SHELFmBURMANrYsYtBOOKu9/8/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n80006447bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/6223264
