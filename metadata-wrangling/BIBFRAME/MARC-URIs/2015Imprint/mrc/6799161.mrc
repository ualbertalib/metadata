This important book shifts the conversation about the Arctic and Antarctic from conflict to cooperation. A multidisciplinary roster of experts provides fresh views of the polar regions, focusing on diplomacy and the potential for cooperative international decision-making. Collectively the contributors illustrate the breadth of issues that complicate governance in the Arctic and Antarctic, as well as parallels and differences between the politics of the two poles"--cProvided by publisher.  a48 0aGeopoliticszPolar regions. 0aEnergy developmentxEnvironmental aspectszPolar regions. 0aPolar regionsxInternational status.1 aPincus, Rebecca H.,eeditor.1 aAli, Saleem H.q(Saleem Hassan),d1973-eeditor.1 aSpeth, James Gustave,eauthor of foreword.  aG 593 D57 2015c1hUASC-P-Bi0162035229861  aG 593 D57 2015wLCc1i0162035229861lON_SHELFmUASCITECHp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n85212418bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/299383102
