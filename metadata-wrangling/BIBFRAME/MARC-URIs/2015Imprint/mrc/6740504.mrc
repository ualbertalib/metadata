Eliana Gil demonstrates a broad range of verbal and nonverbal strategies for engaging all family members--including those who are ambivalent toward therapy--and tailoring interventions for different types of presenting problems. Numerous case examples illustrate ways to effectively use puppets, storytelling, art making, the family play genogram, drama, and other expressive techniques with children, adolescents, and their parents. Gil offers specific guidance for becoming a more flexible, creative practitioner and shows how recent advances in neuroscience support her approach. Photographs of client artwork are included. New to This Edition *Incorporates 20 years of clinical experience and the ongoing development of Gil's influential integrative approach. *All-new case material. *Discusses how current brain research can inform creative interventions. *Heightened focus on personal metaphors, complete with detailed suggestions for exploring and processing them."--cProvided by publisher.  a28 43 0aFamily psychotherapy. 0aPlay therapy.  aRC 488.5 G525 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035185055  aRC 488.5 G525 2015wLCc1i0162035185055d3/18/2015e3/11/2015lON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/19/2014  aRC 488.5 G525 2015wLCc1i31847001297537lON_SHELFmGPRC_GPp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu10/3/201601ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n82157361bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/49327711
