Now Taylor turns back the clock to give us a portrait of the young Fingal and show us the pivotal events that shaped the man he would become. In the 1930s, fresh from a stint in the Royal Navy Reserve, and against the wishes of his disapproving father, Fingal O'Reilly goes to Dublin to study medicine. Fingal and his fellow aspiring doctors face the arduous demands of Trinity College and Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital. The hours are long and the cases challenging, but Fingal manages to find time to box and play rugby and to romance a fetching, gray-eyed nurse named Kitty O'Hallorhan.  a35 0aO'Reilly, Fingal Flahertie (Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aDublin (Ireland)vFiction 0aMedical studentsvFiction.  aTAYwLCc1i30125302524441d6/3/2016e4/8/2016lPAPERBACKSmRED_DEER_Cn1rYsYtBOOKu2/9/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79065753
