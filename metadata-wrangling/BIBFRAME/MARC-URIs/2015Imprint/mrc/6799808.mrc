The challenge for music teachers is to create meaningful learning opportunities for all children, preparing them to participate happily and successfully in rewarding music experiences throughout their lives. The principal features that characterize such experiences are universal in the sense that they are applicable in ways that engage diverse groups of children in common experiences that are valued by their teachers, their parents, and their peers.  aDescription based on online resource; title from home page (viewed on January 7, 2015).  a44 0aSchool musicxInstruction and study. 0aElementary school teaching. 0aInclusive education.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199358762.001.0001z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzUPSO  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6799808-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/6/2015xE-BOOKzUPSO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2001102117bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/41500542
