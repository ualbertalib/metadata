His speeches, messages, and letters were powerful and concise; they are of lasting theoretical interest and repay close attentive reading. Lincoln's words repay close interpretative reading because he was not always straightforward, and he was unusually complex. The book is about the meanings of his memorable words, especially his Second Inaugural address, and also considers those moments of truth that burst through Lincoln's political caution. In addition, the book takes up Lincoln's troubled justification for unconstitutional constitutionalism, in his unprecedented suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and examines some reservations toward the claimed military necessity for its justification. Always present in the background was the national crisis over slavery from 1850 to 1865. The book aims to show that Lincoln's success in achieving power came from a deliberate and at times artful moderation"--Provided by publisher.  a1610aLincoln, Abraham,d1809-1865xPolitical and social views.10aLincoln, Abraham,d1809-1865xPhilosophy.10aLincoln, Abraham,d1809-1865xOratory. 0aSlaveryxPolitical aspectszUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aPolitical sciencezUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1861-1865. 0aUnited StatesxHistoryyCivil War, 1861-1865.  aE 457.2 K37 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035232733  aE 457.2 K37 2015wLCc1i0162034577872d9/30/2015e9/27/2015lON_SHELFmUAAUGn4p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79006779bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/76349832
