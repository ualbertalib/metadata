They begin to make connections between that summer in Switzerland and this spring in Louisiana. Danni, the owner of an eccentric antiques shop, and Quinn, a private detective, have discovered that they have separate but complementary talents when it comes to investigating unusual situations. Trying to blend their personal relationship with the professional lives they've stumbled into, they learn how much they need each other. Especially as they confront this work of art-- and evil. The people in the portrait might be dead, but something seems to wake them and free them to commit bloody crimes. Cafferty and Quinn must discover what that is. And they have to destroy it-- before it destroys them.  a35 0aPaintingvFiction. 0aGood and evil in artvFiction. 0aAntiques businessvFiction. 0aGood and evilvFiction. 0aNew Orleans (La.)vFiction. 0aParanormal fiction.08iReproduction of (manfestation):aGraham, Heather.tWaking the deaddDon Mills, Ontario : Harlequin Mira, 2014h332 pages ; 25 cmw(DLC)  20144278641 aGraham, Heather.tCafferty & Quinn novel.  aGRAwLCc1i30125302524409d1/10/2017lOFF_CAMPUSmRED_DEER_CrYsYtBOOKu2/9/201501bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/84183990
