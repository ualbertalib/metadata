Its argument is that narratives of insecurity (powerful horror stories people tell and believe about their world and others) can easily make extreme acts appear acceptable, even necessary and heroic. As in action or horror movies, the script dictates how the 'hero' acts. The book provides theoretical justifications for this analysis, building on earlier studies but going beyond them in what amount to a breakthrough in mapping the context of mass violence. It backs its argument with a large number of case studies covering four continents, written by prominent scholars from the relevant countries or with deep knowledge of them. A substantial introduction by the UN's Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide demonstrates the policy relevance of this path-breaking work"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 43 0aGenocidexCauses. 0aAtrocitiesxCauses. 0aViolencexSocial aspects. 0aGenocidexCausesvCase studies. 0aAtrocitiesxCausesvCase studies. 0aViolencexSocial aspectsvCase studies.1 aEl-Affendi, Abdelwahab,eeditor.  aHV 6322.7 G436 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035205960  aHV 6322.7 G436 2015wLCc1i0162035205960lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/6/2015  aHV 6322.7 G436 2015wLCc1i0162035225661d3/7/2017e2/17/2017lON_SHELFmUAAUGn5p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/28/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no91024560bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/68992550
