However, none has taken his Shakespearean Equations paintings as its centerpiece for exploring this American artist's protean creative practice.  Painted principally in 1948 while working in his Hollywood studio and inspired by photographs of mathematical models he made in Paris in 1934-35, this series constitutes a major accomplishment from a period of the artist's career long overshadowed by his prodigious interwar photographic production and his celebrated association with the movememnts of Dada and Surrealism " -- Page 6.  a43 5600aMan Ray,d1890-1976vExhibitions.1 aSebline, Edouard,eeditor,ecurator.1 aStrauss, Andrew,ecurator.1 aKamien-Kazhdan, Adina,ecurator.2 aPhillips Collection,ehost institution.2 aMuzeʼon Yiśraʼel (Jerusalem),ehost institution.2 aNy Carlsberg glyptotek,ehost institution.  aN6537 .R3 A4 2015wLCc1i1007405416d12/7/2015e10/20/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MAC_CACn1p$69.85rYsYtBOOKu3/23/2015  aN 6537 R3 A4 2015wLCc1i0162034852457lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu10/7/2015zCOUTTS_ADD01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50052819
