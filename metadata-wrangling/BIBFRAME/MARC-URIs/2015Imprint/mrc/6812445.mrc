Thessaly's numerous small cities were home to some of the richest men in Greece, their fabulous wealth counted in innumerable flocks and slaves. It had a strict oligarchic government and a reputation for indulgence and witchcraft, but also a dominant position between Olympus and Delphi, and a claim to some of the greatest Greek heroes, such as Achilles himself. It can be viewed as both the cradle of many aspects of Greek civilization and as a challenge to the dominant image of ancient Greece as moderate, rational, and democratic.0This book explores the issues of regionalism in ancient Greek religion and the relationship between religion and society, as well as the problem of thinking about these matters through particular bodies of evidence. It discusses in depth the importance of citizenship and of other group-identities in Thessaly, and the relationship between cult activity and political and social organization. The volume investigates the Thessalian particularities of the evidence and the role of religion in giving the inhabitants of this land a sense of their identity and place in the wider Greek world, as well as the role of Thessaly in the ancients' and moderns' understanding of Greekness.  a43 0aReligion and statezGreecezThessaly. 0aOxford classical monographs.  aDF 261 T5 M55 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035242690  aDF 261 T5 M55 2015wLCc1i0162035242690d1/28/2017e1/28/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmUAHSSn4p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu2/26/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr2006006871bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/2428932
