Soon the hole will be filled and covered over with leaves, erasing all trace of the victim below, waking to the horror of being buried alive... Newly divorced Gaby Duran isn't really expecting to find her soul mate on a dating site like InTune.  She just needs a distraction from pining over her ex-husband, Ben, and the happy marriage they once had.  And she's wise enough to know that online the truth doesn't always match the profile.  Almost everyone lies a little--or a lot.  But Gaby quickly discovers there is more at stake than her lonely heart.  Local singles are going missing after making online connections.  And a predator is searching again for the perfect match.  One who will fulfill every twisted desire...or die trying,"--page [4] of cover.  a3 0aOnline datingvFiction. 0aTruthfulness and falsehoodvFiction. 0aMurdervFiction. 0aSingle peoplevFiction. 0aSuspense fiction.  aMystery STAwASISc1i33862001359201d6/5/2015e6/3/2015lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINn1p$7.49rYsYtPAPERBACKu5/5/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n96100296bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/51869637
