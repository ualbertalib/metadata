In 2012, the Nobel committee confirmed Mo Yan's position as one of the greatest and most important writers of our time. In his much-anticipated new novel, Mo Yan chronicles the sweeping history of modern China through the lens of the nation's controversial one-child policy. Frog opens with a playwright nicknamed Tadpole who plans to write about his aunt. In her youth, Gugu--the beautiful daughter of a famous doctor and staunch Communist--is revered for her skill as a midwife. But when her lover defects, Gugu's own loyalty to the Party is questioned. She decides to prove her allegiance by strictly enforcing the one-child policy, keeping tabs on the number of children in the village, and performing abortions on women as many as eight months pregnant. In sharply personal prose, Mo Yan depicts a world of desperate families, illegal surrogates, forced abortions, and the guilt of those who must enforce the policy. At once illuminating and devastating, it shines a light into the heart of communist China."--cProvided by publisher.  aTranslation of: Wa.  a43 0aChildbirthzChinaxHistoryy20th centuryvFiction. 0aFamily sizexGovernment policyzChinavFiction. 0aBirth controlxGovernment policyzChinavFiction. 0aFamily planningxGovernment policyzChinavFiction. 0aReproductive rightszChinavFiction. 0aChinaxPopulation policyvFiction.1 aGoldblatt, Howard,d1939-etranslator.  aPL 2886 O1684 W1913 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035245461  aPL 2886 O1684 W1913 2015wLCc1i0162035245461d6/9/2016e5/21/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSn8p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81063185bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/109250256
