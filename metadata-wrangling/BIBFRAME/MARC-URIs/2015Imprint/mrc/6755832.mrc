It is the only introductory textbook to adopt a strategic approach, explaining clearly how every element of the marketing process should be designed and managed, from goal-setting and planning to implementation and control. Covering all the key topics in the sports marketing curriculum, including consumer behavior, market research, promotions, products, pricing, sponsorship, business ethics, technology and e-marketing, the book introduces core theory and concepts, explains best practice, and surveys the rapidly-changing, international sports business environment. Every chapter contains extensive real-world case studies and biographies of key industry figures and challenging review exercises which encourage the reader to reflect critically on their own knowledge and professional practice. The book's companion website offers additional resources for instructors and students, including an instructors' guide, test bank, presentation slides and useful weblinks. Sports Marketing: A Strategic Perspective is an essential foundation for any sports marketing or sports business course, and an invaluable reference for any sports marketing practitioner looking to improve their professional practice"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aSportszUnited StatesxMarketing. 0aSportsxEconomic aspectszUnited States.1 aLyberger, Mark R.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=861931z(Single User Access)  wORDERhUAINzPDACOUTTS  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6755832-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu12/9/2014xE-BOOKzPDAOWNED01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2015012350bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/307324917
