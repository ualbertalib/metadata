A major theme is that what teachers choose to teach and the way they teach reflect their broader understanding of society, history, and the purpose of social studies education. Advocating an inquiry and activity-based view of social studies teaching that respects the points of view of students and teachers, and based in practice and experience, it offers systematic support and open, honest advice for new teachers. Each chapter addresses a broad question about social studies education; sub-chapters begin with narrower questions that direct attention to specific educational issues. Chapters conclude with essays about related social studies topics and sources for further reading, lesson "examples," and activities. Lesson ideas and materials in the book and online are especially designed to help new teachers to address common core learning standards, to work in inclusive settings, and to promote literacy and the use of technology in social studies classrooms"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aSocial sciencesxStudy and teaching (Secondary)zUnited States.  aH 62.5 U5 S56 2014c1hUAED-Bi0162035210168  aH 62.5 U5 S56 2014wLCc1i0162035210168lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/9/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n97020534bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/33736652
