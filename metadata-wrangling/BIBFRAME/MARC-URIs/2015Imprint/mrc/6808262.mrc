It explores the possibilities for the social and political project of the Cultural Centre that architecture both inhibits and affords. Whose idea of architecture counts when designing Indigenous Cultural Centres? How does architectural history and contemporary practice territorialise spaces of Indigenous occupation? What is architecture for Indigenous cultures and how is it recognised? This ambitious and provocative study pursues a new architecture for colonised Indigenous cultures that takes the politics of recognition to its heart. It advocates an ethics of mutual engagement as a crucial condition for architectural projects that design across cultural difference. The book's structure, method, and arguments are dialogically assembled around narratives told by Indigenous people of their pursuit of public recognition, spatial justice, and architectural presence in settler dominated societies. Possibilities for decolonising architecture emerge through these accounts"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aArts facilitiesxSocial aspects. 0aArchitecturexPhilosophy. 0aCultural landscapes. 0aIndigenous peoples. 0aArchitects and community.1 aPieris, Anoma,eauthor. 0aRoutledge research in architecture.423Cover imageuhttp://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/websmall/978041581/9780415815321.jpg  aNA 6811 M38 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035241452  aNA 6811 M38 2015wLCc1i0162035241452d1/14/2017e1/14/2017kCHECKEDOUTlON_SHELFmUAHSSn4p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu2/19/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2004036004bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/71099498
