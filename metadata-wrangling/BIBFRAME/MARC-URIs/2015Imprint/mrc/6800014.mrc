It includes Kelsen's seminal piece, 'The Nature and Development of Constitutional Adjudication', as well as key extracts from the 'Guardian of the Constitution' which present Schmitt's argument against constitutional review. Also included are Kelsen's review of Schmitt's 'Guardian of the Constitution', as well as some further material by Kelsen and Schmitt on presidential dictatorship under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. These texts show Kelsen and Schmitt responding to one another, in the context of a debate focused on a concrete constitutional crisis, thus allowing the reader to assess the plausibility of Kelsen's and Schmitt's legal and constitutional theories"--cProvided by publisher.  a"The aim of this series is to produce leading monographs in constitutional law. All areas of constitutional law and public law fall within the ambit of the series, including human rights and civil liberties law, administrative law, as well as constitutional theory and the history of constitutional law. A wide variety of scholarly approaches is encouraged, with the governing criterion being simply that the work is of interest to an international audience"--cProvided by publisher.  a4410aKelsen, Hans,d1881-1973xCorrespondence.10aSchmitt, Carl,d1888-1985xCorrespondence. 0aConstitutional lawxPhilosophy. 0aExecutive powerzGermany.1 aKelsen, Hans,d1881-1973,eauthor.1 aSchmitt, Carl,d1888-1985,eauthor.1 aVinx, Lars,eeditoretranslator 0aCambridge studies in constitutional law ;vno. 12.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316136256  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800014-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2007041211bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/36367193
