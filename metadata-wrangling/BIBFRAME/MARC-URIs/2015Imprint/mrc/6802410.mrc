But can we study the brain basis of language as we use it in our daily lives? As a topic of study, the cognitive neuroscience of language is far removed from these language-in-use examples. However, recent developments in research and technology have made studying the neural underpinnings of naturally occurring language much more feasible. In this book a range of international experts provide a state-of-the-art overview of current approaches to making the cognitive neuroscience of language more 'natural' and closer to language use as it occurs in real life. The chapters explore topics including discourse comprehension, the study of dialogue, literature comprehension and the insights gained from looking at natural speech in neuropsychology"--Provided by publisher.  a44 0aBiolinguistics. 0aNeurolinguistics. 0aLanguage and languagesxOrigin. 0aNatural language processing.12aLanguage.22aCognitionxphysiology.22aNeuropsychology.1 aWillems, Roel M.,d1980-eeditor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107323667  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6802410-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/10/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014187513bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/290355339
