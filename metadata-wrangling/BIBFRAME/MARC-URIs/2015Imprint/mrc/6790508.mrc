Assembled with a passionate and discerning eye over several years, the collection has been distilled to include only the most interesting, rare and varied of antique British silver boxes. The featured boxes were made predominantly to carry snuff and tobacco, and the book provides fascinating insight into the habits and customs that shaped their development. A handful of nutmeg graters, vinaigrettes and counter boxes of particular interest or rarity are also included. Maker's marks are given when present, and many of the boxes' engravings and details are explored, often providing clues about the objects' former owners. Arranged chronologically, enabling the reader to chart the development of British silver boxes over the course of two centuries, the boxes have been expertly photographed and researched. Details of provenance and other literary references help to complete the story of each piece in the collection.  a43 0aSilver boxeszGreat BritainxHistory. 0aSilver boxeszGreat BritainvCatalogs.  aNK 7236 B67 C85 2015 folioc1hUAHS-Bi0162035227386  aNK 7236 B67 C85 2015 foliowLCc1i0162035227386lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/28/201501bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/91311553
