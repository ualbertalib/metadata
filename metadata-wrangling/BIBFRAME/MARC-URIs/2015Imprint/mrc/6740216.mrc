Nevertheless, scholars within mainstream criminology have only recently begun to grapple with the problem of terrorism in a sustained fashion. In this provocative book the authors provide both an exposition of the contradictions that have emerged around the regulation of terrorism and an incisive analysis of the questions that the management of terrorism poses for the discipline. Focusing primarily on the processes and practices that have emerged in the United States and the United Kingdom, the book provides a critical account of the political construction, mediation and regulation of terrorist threat since the events of 9/11. The authors explore the ways in which new institutional modes of risk assessment based on the principle of pre-emption have impacted on individuals targeted by them. Noting the dilemmas produced by the pre-emptive turn, the authors also elucidate more recent moves to develop the idea of resilience in counter-terrorism and security policy. This book will be suitable for academics and students interested in political violence, terrorism, geopolitics and risk, as well as for practitioners and experts working in the security industries"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aTerrorismxPrevention. 0aInternal security. 0aNational security. 0aWar on Terrorism, 2001-2009.1 aMythen, Gabe,eauthor. 0aNew directions in critical criminology ;v7.  aHV 6431 W347 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035181302  aHV 6431 W347 2015wLCc1i0162035181302d11/30/2015e11/20/2015lON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/19/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2004058541bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/317149310
