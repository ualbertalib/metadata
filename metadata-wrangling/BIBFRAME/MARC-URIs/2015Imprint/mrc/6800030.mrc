Many of the topics presented apply to both our business and personal lives. As is the nature of managerial accounting, the concepts and applications are intended for internal use only. There are no rules regarding the content and format of in-house spreadsheets and reports. Our focus is strictly on reports that provide the best and most useful information to people and managers. Other accounting courses address "generally accepted accounting principles," IRS regulations, and stockholder and other external reports.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on December 21, 2014).  a44 0aSmall businessxAccounting. 0aManagerial accounting collection.x2152-7121403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=10997472  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800030-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2013140346bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/305944097
