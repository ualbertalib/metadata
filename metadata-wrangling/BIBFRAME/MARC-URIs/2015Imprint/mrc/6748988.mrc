A frequent first indication is a missing or errant process. Project Health Assessment presents an innovative approach for assessing project processes through a set of ten critical success factors based on PMI's PMBOK® Guide knowledge areas. The findings from such assessments can help project managers reduce project risk, improve stakeholder satisfaction, and increase the likelihood of project success, as demonstrated by 30+ assessments done over 15 years of putting this approach into practice.Project Health Assessment breaks down each PMBOK® Guide knowledge area into its process steps, inputs, and outputs and then creates critical success factor questions that evaluate its effectiveness and potential risk. These questions can be used by project managers to establish sufficient project processes or by external entities to evaluate a project and assess its overall riskThe book illustrates critical success factor points through numerous case studies, including a step-by-step example of how to conduct a project health assessment from engagement acquisition through startup, initial assessment, and periodic follow-up assessments. The book provides several downloadable document, spreadsheet, and scheduling templates that practitioners can customize and use in their projects. Using these tools, you can avoid or minimize the cost of failed projects to your organization"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aProject management. 0aRisk management. 0aBest practices and advances in program management series.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781482252835z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6748988-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu12/2/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2001084091bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/53498221
