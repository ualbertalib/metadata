Contextual Design was first invented in 1988 and has since been used in a wide variety of industries and taught in universities all over the world. It is a complete front-end design process rooted in Contextual Inquiry, the widespread, industry-standard field data gathering technique. Contextual Design adds techniques to analyze and present user data, drive ideation from data, design specific product solutions, and iterate those solutions with customers. In 2013, we overhauled the method to account for the way that technology has radically changed people's lives since the invention of the touchscreen phones and other always-on, always-connected, and always-carried devices. This book describes the new Contextual Design, evolved to help teams design for the way technology now fits into peoples' lives. We briefly describe the steps of the latest version of Contextual Design and show how they create a continual immersion in the world of the user for the purpose of innovative product design.  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on November 20, 2014).  a44 0aDesignxHuman factors. 0aHuman engineering. 0aHuman-computer interaction.1 aBeyer, Hugh.,eauthor. 0aSynthesis digital library of engineering and computer science. 0aSynthesis lectures on human-centered informatics ;v# 24.x1946-7699403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2200/S00597ED1V01Y201409HCI024  hUAINzSYNTHDIG  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6742018-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu11/25/2014xE-BOOKzSYNTHDIG01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/190899839
