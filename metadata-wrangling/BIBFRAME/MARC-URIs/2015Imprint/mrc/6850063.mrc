The chapters present the physiology and pathophysiology for defined patient populations consistent with the American Physical Therapy Association's Guide to Physical Therapy Practice and covers a wide assortment of topics ranging from a review of the cellular metabolic pathways to the discharge summary, with all the connections in between. Patient cases also supplement the chapters and are included throughout to illustrate how understanding the content in each chapter informs physical therapy examination, testing, and treatment. The patient/client management model from the Guide to Physical Therapy Practice defines the structure of the patient cases and the International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health (ICF) model of disablement has been inserted into each patient case. Highlighted "Clinician Comments" appear throughout each patient case to point out the critical thinking considerations. Clinical Exercise Pathophysiology for Physical Therapy: Examination, Testing, and Exercise Prescription for Movement-Related Disorders is a groundbreaking reference for the physical therapy student or clinician looking to understand how physiology and pathophysiology relate to responses to exercise in different patient populations"--Provided by publisher.12aPhysical Therapy Modalities12aExercisexphysiology. 2aCase Reports1 aCoglianese, Debra,d1951-,eeditor.  a20  aWB 460 C641 2015wNLMc1i0163710145786d9/18/2015e9/16/2015lON_SHELFmAHSGLENRSEn1rYsYtBOOKu8/18/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014182773bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/307435272
