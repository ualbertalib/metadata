In this book, Pappas and Zelcer provide a persuasive alternative reading of the text, one that contributes in many ways to our understanding of Plato, and specifically to our understanding of his political thought. The book is organized into two parts. In the first part the authors offer a synopsis of the dialogue, address the setting and its background in terms of the Athenian funeral speech, and discuss the alternative readings of the dialogue, showing their weaknesses and strengths. In the second part, the authors offer their positive interpretation of the dialogue, taking particular care to explain and ground their interpretive criteria and method, which considers Plato's text not simply as a de-contextualized collection of philosophical arguments but offers a theoretically reading of the text that situates it firmly within its historical context. The book will become a reference point in the debate about the Menexenus and Plato's political philosophy more generally and marks an important contribution to our understanding of ancient thought and classical Athenian society"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 29 4300aPlato.tMenexenus. 0aRhetoric, Ancient. 0aRhetoricxPhilosophy.1 aZelcer, Mark,eauthor.  aB376 .P37 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007439639p170.98kAVAIL_SOON  a857967606a858354888  aB376 .P37 2015wLCc1i1007439639d11/19/2015e11/15/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn2p$170.98rYsYtBOOKu2/10/2015  aB 376 P37 2015wLCc1i0162035267846lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu4/9/2015  aB 376 P37 2015wLCc1i0162035267960d5/11/2015e5/6/2015lON_SHELFmUAHSSn3p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu4/9/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014044303bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/309826051
