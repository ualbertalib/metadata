Coverage includes the operational aspects of school finance, including issues regarding teacher salaries and pensions, budgeting for instructional programs, school transportation, and risk management. Diving deeper than other school finance books, the authors explore the political framework within which the schools must function, discuss the privatization of education and its effects on public schools, offer perspectives regarding education as an investment in human capital, and expertly explain complex financial and economic issues. This comprehensive text provides the tools to apply the many and varied fiscal concepts and practices that are essential for aspiring public school administrators who aim to provide responsible stewardship for their students"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aEducationxFinance. 0aEducation and state. 0aSchool management and organization. 0aEducational leadership. 0aEducationxPhilosophy.1 aSalmon, Richard G.,d1938-eauthor.1 aAlexander, F.
