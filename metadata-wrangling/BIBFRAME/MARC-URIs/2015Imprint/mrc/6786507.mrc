In order for students to read and gain new understanding from texts, teachers must fully understand how to teach comprehension to a variety of learners. This supplemental textbook brings together a broad body of research on reading comprehension instruction for special education middle school and high school students in inclusive classrooms. It serves as a resource for classroom teachers as well as a practical, foundational supplemental text for undergraduate and master's level licensure programs. With its clear, research-based and applied instructional information, it will stand out in the marketplace as a text for novice teachers, both in-service and preservice. Chapters focus on a range of topics including helping students acquire new vocabulary, activating prior knowledge to make connections, utilizing reading comprehension strategies, asking questions while reading, and monitoring comprehension. By including vignettes, teaching materials, and activities, this book is an accessible, teacher-friendly volume that illustrates the most critical concepts for improving students' reading comprehension"--cProvided by publisher.  a31 41 0aReading comprehension. 0aLanguage arts (Middle school) 0aLanguage arts (Secondary) 0aChildren with disabilitiesxEducation. 0aSpecial education. 0aInclusive education.1 aTaboada Barber, Ana,eauthor.  aLB 1050.45 B465 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035224698  aLB 1050.45 B465 2015wLCc1i0162035224698d4/23/2015e4/10/2015lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn5p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu1/21/2015  aLB 1050.45 B465 2015wLCc1i3197900659401lCURRICULUMmKINGSrYsYtBOOKu4/1/201601ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014045342bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/309826870
