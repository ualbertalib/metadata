What led her to this point? Despair, solitude, perhaps even physical pain, but most decisively, demonology's two-pronged prosecutorial and truth-seeking confessional apparatus. This book examines the systematic and well-oiled machinery that served to extract, interpret, and disseminate witches' confessions in early modern France. For the demonologist, confession was the only way to find out the truth about the clandestine activities of witches. For the witch, however, trial confessions opened new horizons of selfhood. In this book, Virginia Krause unravels the threads that wove together the demonologist's will to know and the witch's subjectivity. By examining textual and visual evidence, Krause shows how confession not only generated demonological theory but also brought forth a specific kind of self, which we now recognize as the modern subject"--cProvided by publisher.0 aPrint version record.  a44 0aWitchcraftzFrancexHistoryy16th century. 0aWitchcraftzFrancexHistoryy17th century. 0aDemonologyzFrancexHistoryy16th century. 0aDemonologyzFrancexHistoryy17th century. 0aTrials (Witchcraft)zFrancexHistoryy16th century. 0aTrials (Witchcraft)zFrancexHistoryy17th century. 0aConfessionxHistoryy16th century. 0aConfessionxHistoryy17th century.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139696685  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6805555-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/17/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2003039619bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/4305983
