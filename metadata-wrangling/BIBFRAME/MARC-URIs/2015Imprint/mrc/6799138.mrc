This practical book illuminates the ways in which a text's purpose, structure, details, connective language, and construction of themes combine to create meaning. Classroom tested instructional recommendations and "kid friendly" explanations guide teachers in helping students to identify and understand the role of these elements in different types of informational texts. Numerous student work samples, excerpts from exemplary books and articles, and a Study Guide with discussion questions and activities for professional learning add to the book's utility"--cProvided by publisher.  a41 0aLanguage arts (Elementary) 0aLanguage arts (Middle school) 0aEnglish languagexComposition and exercisesxStudy and teaching (Elementary) 0aEnglish languagexComposition and exercisesxStudy and teaching (Middle school)  aLB 1576 C8544  2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035233152  aLB 1576 C8544  2015wLCc1i0162035233152d4/23/2015e4/10/2015lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn6p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2012065774bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/2.81614727037e+21
