The emphasis is on embankment dams, but much of the text, particularly those parts related to geology, can be used for concrete gravity and arch dams. The book aims to provide practising dam engineers and geologists with a practical approach, as well as to give university students an insight into the subject of dam engineering. The theoretical basis upon which design methods have been developed is included so readers develop a proper understanding of the limitations of the methods. All phases of investigation, design and construction are covered, from the initial assessment of a damsite and the development and carrying out of a detailed site investigation program, through to the preliminary and detailed design phases and ultimately the construction phase. The assessment of existing dams, including the analysis of risks posed by those dams, is also discussed. This wholly revised and significantly expanded 2nd edition includes a lengthy new chapter on the assessment of the likelihood of failure of dams by internal erosion and piping"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aDamsxDesign and construction.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9780203387313z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6786298-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/20/2015xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n89639208bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/109384757
