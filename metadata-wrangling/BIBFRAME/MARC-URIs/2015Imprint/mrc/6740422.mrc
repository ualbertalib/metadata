Museum as Process presents community-engaged "culture work" of a group of scholars whose collaborative projects consider the social spaces between the museum and community and offer new ways of addressing the challenges of bridging the local and the global. Museum as Process explores a variety of strategies for engaging source communities in the process of translation and the collaborative mediation of cultural knowledges. Scholars from around the world reflect upon their work with specific communities in different parts of the world--Australia, Canada, Ghana, Great Britain, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, South Africa, Taiwan and the United States. Each global case study provides significant insights into what happens to knowledge as it moves back and forth between source communities and global sites, especially the museum. Museum as Process is an important contribution to understanding the relationships between museums and source communities and the flow of cultural knowledge."c-- Publisher's website.  a43 0aEthnological museums and collectionsxSocial aspects. 0aMuseums and community. 0aIndigenous peoplesxAntiquitiesxCollection and preservationxSocial aspects. 0aCultural propertyxProtectionxSocial aspects. 0aIntercultural communication. 0aCommunication in ethnology. 0aMuseumsxSocial aspects.1 aSilverman, Raymond Aaron,eeditor. 0aMuseum meanings.  aGN 35 M87 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035183688  aGN 35 M87 2015wLCc1i0162035183688d5/18/2016e5/4/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSn3p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu11/19/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n87122066bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/44474111
