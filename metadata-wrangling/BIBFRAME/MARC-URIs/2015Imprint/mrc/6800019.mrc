The CEO and executive team are almost always highly compensated and the relative total compensation has mushroomed over time. Most of the compensation now is designed to be performance-based, but leading to charges that executives have incentives to manipulate corporate earnings and stock price in the short-term for their own self interests. The compensation at some companies became so egregious (Enron and other tech-bubble failures or Citigroup and other banks during the subprime meltdown) that compensation again became a major public policy issue subject to federal regulation. (Popular outrage and calls for government action against well-paid CEOs has been common at least since the 1930s.)  aTitle from PDF title page (viewed on December 21, 2014).  a44 0aExecutivesxSalaries, etc. 0aFinancial accounting and auditing collection.x2151-2817403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/ualbertagep/Doc?id=10997459  hUAINzEBRARYBEP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6800019-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/9/2015xE-BOOKzEBRARYBEP01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n80163232bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/94342883
