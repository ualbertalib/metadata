Here in this small East African nation, one of the four poorest nations on earth, however, was a desire for reconciliation--not revenge--and it still runs deep today. The University of Ngozi in northern Burundi was created in 1999 and is now dedicated to peace, reconciliation and sustainable development. People in this region tell remarkable stories of tragedy and recovery amid these horrors. Their stories can inspire others to preserve their humanity and resist the urge to continue the violence, focusing instead on forgiveness, reconciliation and a better way forward. This volume presents case study analysis while pointing to the promise of a new kind of education that is committed to sustainable peace and development. The lessons here for the rest of the world are deep and inspiring"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 4120aUniversité de Ngozi. 0aPeace-buildingxStudy and teachingzBurundi. 0aReconciliationxStudy and teachingzBurundi. 0aEthnic conflictzBurundi.1 aNdura-Ouédraogo, Elavie,eauthor.1 aBangayimbaga, Apollinaire,eauthor. 0aRoutledge research in international and comparative education ;v11.  aJZ 5584 B94 T56 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035232030  aJZ 5584 B94 T56 2015wLCc1i0162035232030lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/4/2015  aJZ 5584 B94 T56 2015wLCc1i0162035247277d10/5/2015e9/30/2015lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014039636bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/309822244
