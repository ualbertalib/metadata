In the office or at study we are 'mind workers,' with seemingly superfluous bodies. Conversely, in the gym we stretch, run and lift, but our minds are idle. In How to Think About Exercise, author and philosopher Damon Young challenges this idea of separation, revealing how fitness can develop our bodies and minds as one. Exploring exercises and sports with the help of ancient and modern philosophy, he uncovers the pleasures, virtues and big ideas of fitness. By learning how to exercise intelligently, we are contributing to our overall enjoyment of life and enhancing our full humanity. Find out how bestselling author Haruki Murakami quit smoking and took up running, and why the simple act radically changed his whole outlook on life; why Schopenhauer thought that swimming was a sublime act; how Charles Darwin came up with some of his best ideas while exercising; and much more.  a43 0aMind and body. 0aExercisexPsychological aspects. 0aPsychophysiology. 0aSelf. 0aSchool of life.  aBF 161 Y68 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035241460  aBF 161 Y68 2015wLCc1i0162035241460lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/19/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2009068086bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/88468591
