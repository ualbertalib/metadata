The book offers the first comprehensive treatment with supporting examples of mathematical models that describe contaminants reactivity and transport in soils and aquifers. It is also a practical guide for designing experiments and collecting data that focuses on characterizing retention as well as release kinetic reactions in soils and contaminant transport experiments in the laboratory, greenhouse (column) and in the field. "--cProvided by publisher.  a"Over the last four decades tremendous advances have been made toward the understanding of tranport characteristics of the transport contaminants in soils, as well as solutes and tracers in geological media. These advances were broad in nature and addressed physical and chemical processes that influence the behavior of solutes in porous media. Examples include nonlinear kinetics, release and desorption hysteresis, multisite and multireaction reactions, and competitive-type reactions. Examples that focus on physical processes include fractured media, multiregion, multiple porosities, and heterogeneity and effect of scale. This book provides the basic framework of the principals governing the sorption and transport of contaminants in soils. The physical and chemical processes presented above are the focus of this textbook. Details of sorption behavior of chemicals with soil matrix surfaces are presented, as well the integration of sorption characteristics with mechanisms that govern solute transport in soils. Applications of the principals of sorption and transport are not restricted to contaminants. Rather examples include tracers, phosphorus, and trace elements, including essential micronutrients, heavy metals, military explosives, pesticides, and radionuclides"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aSoilsxSolute movementxMathematical models. 0aSoil permeabilityxMathematical models. 0aInorganic soil pollutantsxTransport properties. 0aSoil absorption and adsorption. 0aAdvances in trace elements in the environment.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781466557956z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6712183-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu10/27/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n87806516bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/267527883
