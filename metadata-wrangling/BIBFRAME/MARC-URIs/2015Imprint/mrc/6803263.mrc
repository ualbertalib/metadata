Albena Vassileva argues that, because of the sudden invalidation of a reality that had been largely seen as unattained and everlasting, this shift remained secluded from the mind and totally resistant to cognition, thus causing a collectively traumatic psychological experience. The book proceeds by inquiring into a school of contemporary American poetry that has been likewise read as cut off from reality. Executing a comparative analysis, Vassileva advances a new understanding of this poetry as a testimony to the overwhelming and traumatic impact of contemporary media, which have assailed the mind with far more signals than it can register, digest and furnish with semantic weight"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aRussian poetryy20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aPostmodernism (Literature)zRussia. 0aLanguage poetryxHistory and criticism. 0aPoetry, ModernxHistory and criticism. 0aPsychic trauma in literature. 0aAvant-garde (Aesthetics)zRussia. 0aAvant-garde (Aesthetics)zUnited States. 0aPostmodernism (Literature)zUnited States. 0aAmerican poetryy20th centuryxHistory and criticism.  aPG 3056 L88 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035239258  aPG 3056 L88 2015wLCc1i0162035239258d6/24/2016e4/7/2016lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014045914bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/309827330
