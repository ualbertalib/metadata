Since his death in 1993, Howe's work and his personal example of commitment to high principle, both literary and political, have had a vigorous afterlife. This posthumous collection includes 26 essays that originally appeared in publications such as the New York Review of Books, the New Republic, and the Nation. Taken together, they reveal the depth and breadth of Howe's enthusiasms and range over politics, literature, Judaism, and the tumults of American society.  aDescription based on online resource; title from home page (viewed on December 3, 2014).  a441 aHowe, Nina,eeditor.1 aDickstein, Morris,econtributor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.12987/yale/9780300203660.001.0001z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzUPSO  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6799910-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETp$33.60rYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/6/2015xE-BOOKzUPSO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n88137519bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/107192307
