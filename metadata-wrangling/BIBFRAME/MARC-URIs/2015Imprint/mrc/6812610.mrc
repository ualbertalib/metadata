She is haunted by a baby boy she met when she was six, who sometimes recurs as other people's babies. Cheryl is also obsessed with Phillip, a philandering board member at the women's self-defense nonprofit where she works. She believes they've been making love for many lifetimes, though they have yet to consummate in this one. When Cheryl's bosses ask if their twenty-one-year-old daughter, Clee, can move into her house for a little while, Cheryl's eccentrically ordered world explodes. And yet it is Clee -- the selfish, cruel blond bombshell -- who bullies Cheryl into reality and, unexpectedly, provides her the love of a lifetime.  a43 0aMiddle-aged womenvFiction. 0aRole playingvFiction. 0aInfatuationvFiction. 0aSexual fantasiesvFiction. 0aMotherhoodvFiction. 0aYoung womenvFiction. 0aRoommatesvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction.  aPS 3610 U537 F57 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035244035  aPS 3610 U537 F57 2015wLCc1i0162035244035d2/21/2017e1/18/2017lON_SHELFmUAHSSn14p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/26/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2005020449bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/96584792
