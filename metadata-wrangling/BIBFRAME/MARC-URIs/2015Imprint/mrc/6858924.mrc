Filsinger presents a thorough overview of employment law in Canada and shows students how to identify and address potential legal problems in the workplace. Designed for college and university undergraduate courses in Business Administration, Human Resources Management, Employee Relations, as well as Paralegal and Law Clerk programs, this text introduces relevant statutory (e.g., human rights, employment standards, the AODA) and common-law issues in employment law, and walks students through the legal aspects of the employment process, from hiring to the end of the employment relationship and beyond. The third edition covers updates on several important cases, including Honda Canada Inc. v. Keays, R v. Cole, Jones v. Tsige, Bowes v. Goss Power Products, Stevens v. Sifton Properties, and Boucher v. Wal-Mart. The text also includes updates to the Open for Business Act aimed at streamlining Ontario government-to-business services, and a new section on monitoring company email, Internet, and computer usage--a growing issue in employment law today. To keep students engaged with current and hot-button issues in employment law, Filsinger has added new FYI, Case in Point, and In the News sections throughout the text. The author has also added updated review questions and case-based scenarios at the end of each chapter that serve as a useful study guide for students."--Publisher's website.  a29 45 0aLabor laws and legislationzOntario.1 aJeffries, Daryn M.,eeditor.  aKEO629 .F54 2015hGMCT-OS-Bi1007773730p92.74kAVAIL_SOON  aKEO629 .F54 2015wLCc1i1007773730d6/10/2016e4/22/2016lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANn5p$92.74rYsYtBOOKu6/16/2015  aKF 3319 F54 2015wLCc1i0162034866291d4/10/2017e4/10/2017kILL_lON_SHELFmUALAWn1p$150.00rMsYtBOOKu11/4/2015zCOUTTS_ADD01bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/102799424
