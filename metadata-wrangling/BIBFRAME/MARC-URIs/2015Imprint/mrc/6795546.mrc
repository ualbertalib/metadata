Now adults, the three Lockwood sisters are still recovering from the events that led to the destruction of their family when they were children. Determined to move forward, Tess and Kate are making fresh starts, ready to put bad--even deadly--memories to rest and settle happily in the small but booming town. And they're hoping their older sister, Charlene, can do the same. Char is back in town seeking comfort as she figures out her next move. A social worker used to difficult situations, she soon runs afoul of some locals who think she's sticking her nose where it doesn't belong. She's certain something sinister is being covered up, and when she witnesses Matt Rowan being run off the road, she knows she's right. Working together, Matt and Char figure uncovering the truth will be dangerous, but living in Cold Creek won't be safe for any of them until its secrets are revealed" --cfrom publisher's web site.  a3 0aWomen social workersvFiction. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aSistersvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction.1 aHarper, Karenq(Karen S.)tCold Creek novel.  aMystery HARwASISc1i33862001356314d1/25/2016e1/22/2016lPAPERBACKSmNORQ_MAINn3p$6.74rYsYtPAPERBACKu3/23/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n78019738bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/40532987
