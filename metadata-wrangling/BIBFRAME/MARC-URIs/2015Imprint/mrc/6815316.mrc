Stories of families in crisis, Jobst Welge argues, reflect the experience of historical and social change in regions or nations perceived as "peripheral." Though geographically and temporally diverse, the novels Welge considers all demonstrate a relation among family and national history, genealogical succession, and generational experience, along with social change and modernization. Welge's wide-ranging comparative study focuses on the novels of the late nineteenth century, but it also includes detailed analyses of the pre-Victorian origin of the genealogical-historical novel and the evolution of similar themes in twentieth-century literature. Moving through time, he uncovers often-unsuspected novelistic continuities and international transformations and echoes, from Maria Edgeworth's Castle Rackrent, published in 1800, to G. Tomasi di Lampedusa's 1958 book Il Gattopardo.By revealing the "family resemblance" of novels from Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Brazil, this volume shows how genealogical narratives take on special significance in contexts of cultural periphery. Welge links private and public histories, while simultaneously integrating detailed accounts of various literary fields across the globe. In combining theories of the novel, recent discussions of cultural geography, and new approaches to genealogical narratives, Genealogical Fictions addresses a significant part of European and Latin American literary history in which texts from different national cultures illuminate each other in unsuspected ways and reveal the repetition, as well as the variation, among them. This book should be of interest to students and scholars of comparative literature, world literature, and the history and theory of the modern novel"--cProvided by publisher.  a"In this truly comparative study of 19th and 20th-century literature, Jobst Welge argues that there is a "deep structure" to certain novels of this period that centers on the idea of genealogy and family history. Welge examines British, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Brazilian novels that share a "genealogical narrative" featuring stories of familial decline. Stories of families in crisis, Welge argues, reflect the experience of historical and social change among groups at the periphery of society. Though geographically and temporally diverse, the novels Welge considers all demonstrate a relation among family and national history, genealogical succession, generational experience, as well as social change and modernization. Welge links private and public histories, and also integrates detailed accounts of various literary fields across the globe. In combining theories of the novel, recent discussions of cultural geography, and new approaches to genealogical narratives, this study addresses a significant part of European (and, partly, Latin American) literary history in which texts from different "national" cultures illuminate each other in unsuspected ways and reveal the repetition, as well as the variation, among them"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aEuropean fictiony19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aEuropean fictiony20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aBrazilian fictiony19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aBrazilian fictiony20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aFamilies in literature. 0aSocial change in literature. 0aSocial changezEurope. 0aSocial changezBrazil. 0aGenealogyxSocial aspects. 0aLiterature and history.  aPN 3499 W454 2015hUAHS-Bi0162035248697  aPN 3499 W454 2015wLCc1i0162035248697d4/23/2015e4/23/2015lON_SHELFmUAHSSn2p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014037296bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/15943924
