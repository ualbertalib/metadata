The revival of global interest in the phenomenon of nonviolent struggle since the 2011 Arab Spring offers a welcome opportunity to revisit the potential of unarmed resistance as an alternative pathway out of armed conflicts, in cases where neither military (or counter-insurgency) nor negotiated solutions have succeeded. This volume brings together academics from various disciplinary traditions and offers a wide range of case studies-- including South Africa, Palestine and Egypt-- through which to view the changes from violence to nonviolence within self-determination, revolutionary or pro-democracy struggles. While current historiography focuses on armed conflicts and their termination through military means or negotiated settlements, this book is a first attempt to investigate the nature and the drivers of transitions from armed strategies to unarmed methods of contentious collective action on the part of non-state conflict actors. The text concentrates in particular on the internal and relational factors which underpin the decision-making process, from a change of leadership and a pragmatic re-evaluation of the goals and means of insurgency in the light of evolving inter-party power dynamics, to the search for new local or international allies and the cross-border emulation or diffusion of new repertoires of action. This book will be of interest to students of security studies, peace and conflict studies, political sociology and IR in general"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 0aGovernment, Resistance to. 0aNonviolence. 0aCivil disobedience. 0aConflict management. 0aWar and society. 0aGovernment, Resistance tovCase studies. 0aNonviolencevCase studies. 0aCivil disobediencevCase studies. 0aConflict managementvCase studies. 0aWar and societyvCase studies.1 aDudouet, Veronique,eeditor. 0aRoutledge studies in peace and conflict resolution.  aJC 328.3 C57 2015hUAAU-Bi0162035248432  aJC 328.3 C57 2015wLCc1i0162035248432d12/14/2015e12/5/2015lON_SHELFmUAAUGn4p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/4/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2010014820bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/279864871
