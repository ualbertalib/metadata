Gender role conflict (GRC) doesn't just harm boys and men, but also girls and women, transgendered people, and society at large. Extensive research relates men's GRC to myriad behavioral problems, including sexism, violence, homophobia, depression, substance abuse, and relationship issues. This book represents a call to action for researchers and practitioners, graduate students, and other mental healthcare professionals to confront men's GRC and reduce its harmful influence on individuals and society. James O'Neil is a pioneer in men's psychology who conceptualized GRC and created the Gender Role Conflict Scale. In this book, he combines numerous studies from renowned scholars in men's psychology with more than 30 years of his own clinical and research experience to promote activism and challenge the status quo. He describes multiple effects of men's GRC, including success, power, and competition issues; restricted emotionality; restricted affectionate behavior between men; and conflicts between men's work and family relations. O'Neil also explains when GRC can develop in a man's gender role journey, how to address it through preventative programs and therapy for boys and men, and what initiatives researchers and clinicians can pursue"--Publicity materials.
