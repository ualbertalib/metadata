Use of this reader will save time for instructors who may not want to spend weeks researching the best new articles in each subject domain. It consists of five parts: Part One: Historical Perspectives and Part Two: Theory and Grand Strategy sets the tone of the reader, wherein students are exposed to basic tenets of U.S. diplomatic history, and international relations theory; Part Three: Institutions and Processes examines the role of institutions and processes, largely at the domestic level of analysis, in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy; Part Four: The U.S. and the World provides a collection of essays on U.S. foreign relations with key states and regions in the 21st century; and Part Five: New Domains examines salient new domains in U.S. foreign policy in the 21st century. The reader will compliment existing U.S. foreign policy texts. The majority of the chapters are from published articles (e.g. Foreign Policy, Foreign Affairs, etc.), although several chapters were commissioned directly for this volume"--cProvided by publisher.  a43 0aUnited StatesxForeign relations. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationsvSources.1 aPrice-Smith, Andrew T.,eeditor of compilation.  aE 183.7 R57 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035135589  aE 183.7 R57 2015wLCc1i0162035135589d11/3/2014e10/21/2014lON_SHELFmUAHSSn5p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu9/2/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n00009125bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/6160690
