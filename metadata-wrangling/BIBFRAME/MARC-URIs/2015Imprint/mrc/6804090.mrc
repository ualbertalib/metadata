The comparative presentation of this volume offers an analysis of policy issues relating to tax structure and tax base as well as insights into how cases arising out of VAT disputes have been resolved. Its principal purpose is to provide comprehensive teaching tools - laws, cases, analytical exercises, and questions drawn from the experience of countries and organizations around the world. This second edition includes new VAT-related developments in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia and adds new chapters on VAT avoidance and evasion and on China's VAT. Designed to illustrate, analyze, and explain the principal theoretical and operating features of value added taxes, including their adoption and implementation, this book will be an invaluable resource for tax practitioners and government officials"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aValue-added taxxLaw and legislation. 0aSpendings taxxLaw and legislation. 0aTaxation of articles of consumptionxLaw and legislation.1 aThuronyi, Victoreauthor.1 aCui, Wei,d1970-eauthor.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107337671  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6804090-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu2/12/2015xE-BOOKzCBO01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014041502
