To general observers, the European Union's economic woes appear to be its greatest problem, but the real peril is an ongoing ideological-political crisis that threatens an era of instability and reactionary brutality. The fall of communism in 1989 seemed to end the leftist program of universal emancipation. However, nearly a quarter of a century later, the European Union has failed to produce any coherent vision that can mobilize people to action. Until recently, the only ideology receptive to European workers has been the nationalist call to "defend" against immigrant integration. Today, Europe is focused on regulating the development of capitalism and promoting a reactionary conception of its cultural heritage. Yet staying these courses, Žižek and Horvat show, only strips Europe of its power and stifles its political ingenuity. The best hope is for Europe to revive and defend its legacy of universal egalitarianism, which benefits all parties by preserving the promise of equal representation.  a29 4320aEuropean Union. 0aEquality before the lawzEuropean Union countries. 0aRepresentative government and representationzEuropean Union countries. 0aCivil rightszEuropean Union countries.1 aHorvat, Srećko,eauthor.2 aColumbia University.bPress. 0aInsurrections.  aJN 30 Z55 2015c1hUAHS-Bi0162035237484  aJN 30 Z55 2015wLCc1i0162035237484d2/28/2015e2/19/2015lON_SHELFmUAHSSn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/2015  aJN30 .Z55 2015wLCc1i1007400482d3/12/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$32.71rYsYtBOOKu3/3/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb2008026295bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/70925543
