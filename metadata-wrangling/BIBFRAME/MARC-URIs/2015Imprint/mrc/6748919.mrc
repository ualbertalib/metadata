This new edition has been updated with recent references and new material on analysis of small trials, analysis of baseline measurements, bioequivalence, cross-over trials in early phase drug development, and adaptive cross-over trials. The book includes numerous real examples, including some new data sets to illustrate the methods described, with SAS code available for their implementation"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aCrossover trials.1 aKenward, Michael G.,d1956-eauthor. 0aChapman & Hall / CRC monographs on statistics & applied probability ;v138.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781439861431z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6748919-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu12/2/2014xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n88163346bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/110446419
