Agur. 7th ed. c2014.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  a"Nineteen years have passed since the first edition of Essential Clinical Anatomy was published. The main aim of the fifth edition is to provide a compact yet thorough textbook of clinical anatomy for students and practitioners in the health care professions and related disciplines. We have made the book even more student friendly. The presentations - Provide a basic text of human clinical anatomy for use in current health sciences curricula - Present an appropriate amount of clinically relevant anatomical material in a readable and interesting form - Place emphasis on clinical anatomy that is important for practice - Provide a concise clinically oriented anatomical overview for clinical courses in subsequent years - Serve as a rapid review when preparing for examinations, particularly those prepared by the National Board of Medical Examiners - Offer enough information for those wishing to refresh their knowledge of clinical anatomy"--Provided by publisher.  a8 42 0aHuman anatomyvHandbooks, manuals, etc. 0aHuman anatomyvAtlases.12aAnatomyvHandbooks.1 aAgur, A.
