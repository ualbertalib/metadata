Their new aggregates M5 category encompass all instruments including cash from the Central Bank, in essence all receivables that in counterparty relationships are recorded as debts in some balance sheets, the M6 entry being the total of balance sheets from where the data has to be collected to compare them with revenues. By employing derivatives of M5 and M6 they cover all underlying collateral classes thus allowing a type of comprehensive economic modeling that no other authors have been able to propose. This text offers insights into the present situation of slow growth, rising debts and long term low inflation and puts forward some possible outcomes for the global economy.  The authors point out the social role of monetary contracts not only because they are grounding exchanges as it has always been the since ever in the past but also because it's sampling is the tool for redistribution between actors including "sectors" through taxation and inflation and deflation and finally between generations"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print version record.  a21 35 44 57 60 0aMoney. 0aFinance. 0aFinancial institutions. 0aMonetary policy.1 aTranié, Jean-Pascal,eauthor. 0aWiley finance series.403Concordia University of Edmonton Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/concordiaab/Doc?id=10990964zfrom ebrary403Grande Prairie Regional College Accessuhttp://ezproxy.agpc.talonline.ca:80/login?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/gprc/Doc?id=10990964zfrom ebrary403MacEwan University Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/macewan/Doc?id=10990964z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)zfrom ebrary403Red Deer College Accessuhttp://site.ebrary.com/lib/rdcollege/Doc?id=10990964zfrom ebrary403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781118867808z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINmCONCORDIAzEBRARYACCN  hUAINmGPRC_INTzEBRARYACGP  hUAINmGR_MAC_INTzEBRARYACGM  hUAINmRED_DEER_CzEBRARYACRD  aebr10990964  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6774321-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/12/2015xE-BOOKzWILEYOL  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6774321-2001kDISCARDlINTERNETmCONCORDIArYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/6/2016xE-BOOKzEBRARYACCN  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6774321-3001kDISCARDlINTERNETmGPRC_INTrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/6/2016xE-BOOKzEBRARYACGP  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6774321-4001kDISCARDlINTERNETmGR_MAC_INTrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/6/2016xE-BOOKzEBRARYACGM  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6774321-5001kDISCARDlINTERNETmRED_DEER_CrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/6/2016xE-BOOKzEBRARYACRD01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n88668201bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/21263010
