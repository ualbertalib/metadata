But who died, Sebastian or his best friend? When Ross Buchanan is forced to resign as chairman of the Barrington Shipping Company, Emma Clifton wants to replace him. But Don Pedro Martinez intends to install his puppet, Alex Fisher, in order to destroy the Barrington family firm just as the company plans to build its new luxury liner. In London, Harry and Emma's daughter wins a scholarship to the Slade Academy of Art where she falls in love with Clive Bingham, who asks her to marry him. Both families are delighted until Jessica's future mother-in-law has a visit from a friend who drops her particular brand of poison into the wedding chalice. Then Cedric Hardcastle, a Yorkshireman who no one has come across before, takes his place on the board of Barringtons. This causes upheaval and will change the lives of every member of the Clifton and Barrington families. Hardcastle's first decision is who to support to become the chairman of the board: Emma Clifton or Alex Fisher? And with that the story takes yet another twist.  a8 35 0aFamilieszEnglandxHistoryy20th centuryvFiction. 0aSocial classeszEnglandvFiction. 0aUnited StatesxHistoryy20th centuryvFiction.1 aArcher, Jeffrey,d1940-tClifton chronicles ;vvolume 4.  aARCwLCc1i30125302522999d4/29/2015e4/8/2015lPAPERBACKSmRED_DEER_Cn1rYsYtBOOKu1/14/2015  aARCwLCc1i34917001375646d11/2/2015e10/19/2015lPAPERBACKSmKEYANOn1rYsYtPAPERBACKu5/28/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79115945bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/110249804
