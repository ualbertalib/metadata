The work on Mary Wroth has been particularly impressive at integrating her poetry, prose and drama into the canon. This in turn has led to comparative studies that link Wroth to a number of male and female writers, including of course, William Shakespeare. At the same time no single volume has attempted a comprehensive comparative analysis. This book sets out to explore the ways in which Wroth negotiated the discourses that are embedded in the Shakespearean canon in order to develop an understanding of her oeuvre based, not on influence and imitation, but on difference, originality and innovation"--cProvided by publisher.  a1610aWroth, Mary,cLady,dapproximately 1586-approximately 1640xCriticism and interpretation.10aWroth, Mary,cLady,dapproximately 1586-approximately 1640xKnowledgexLiterature.10aShakespeare, William,d1564-1616xInfluence. 0aOriginality in literature. 0aDifference (Philosophy) in literature. 0aGender identity in literature. 0aWomen and literaturezEnglandxHistoryy17th century.1 aSalzman, Paul,eeditor.1 aWynne-Davies, Marion,eeditor. 0aRoutledge studies in Shakespeare ;v11.  aPR 2399 W7 Z75 2015c1hUAAU-Bi0162035239167  aPR 2399 W7 Z75 2015wLCc1i0162035239167d3/24/2015e3/11/2015lON_SHELFmUAAUGn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/11/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n90610100bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/271839316
