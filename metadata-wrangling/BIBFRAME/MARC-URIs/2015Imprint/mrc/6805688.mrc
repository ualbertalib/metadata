She documents how the low-fat nutrition advice of the past sixty years has amounted to a vast uncontrolled experiment on the entire population, with disastrous consequences for our health. For decades, we have been told that the best possible diet involves cutting back on fat, especially saturated fat, and that if we are not getting healthier or thinner, we are not trying hard enough. But what if the low-fat diet is itself the problem? Based on a nine-year investigation, Teicholz shows how the misinformation about saturated fats took hold in the scientific community and the public imagination, and how recent findings have overturned these beliefs. She explains why the Mediterranean Diet is not the healthiest, and how we might be replacing trans fats with something even worse. She upends the conventional wisdom with the groundbreaking claim that more, not less, dietary fat--including saturated fat--is what leads to better health and wellness. Science shows that we have been needlessly avoiding meat, cheese, whole milk, and eggs for decades and that we can now, guilt-free, welcome these delicious foods back into our lives.--From publisher description.  aChallenges popular misconceptions about fats and nutrition science, revealing the distorted claims of nutrition studies while arguing that more dietary fat can lead to better health, wellness, and fitness.  a16 52 0aLipids in human nutrition. 0aSaturated fatty acids in human nutrition.  aQP 751 T47 2015wLChLKLL-Bi38288001141297lIN_PROCESS  aQP 751 T47 2015wLCc1i38288001141297d4/23/2015e3/26/2015f4/23/2015g1lON_SHELFmLAKELND_LLn1p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/17/2015  aQP 751 T47 2015wLCc1i0162033666585d1/16/2017e11/21/2016lON_SHELFmUAAUGn6p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu5/12/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2010182215bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/159981085
