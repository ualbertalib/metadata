While other books focus on describing diagnostic conditions, this book focus on the critical link between psychopathology and psychotherapy. More specifically, it links diagnostic evaluation, case conceptualization, and treatment selection to psychotherapy practice. Research affirms that knowledge and awareness of these links is essential in planning and providing highly effective psychotherapy. This third edition incorporates detailed case conceptualizations and treatment considerations for the DSM-5 diagnoses most commonly seen in everyday clinical practice. Extensive case studies illustrate the diagnostic, case conceptualization, and treatment process in a way that makes it come alive. Written by practicing clinicians with expertise in specific disorders, this book will be an invaluable resource to both novice and experienced clinicians"--Provided by publisher.  a"This latest edition will incorporate all of the popular features of the first two editions, as well as follow the same chapter headings as in the DSM 5 and emphasize the most common diagnostic presentations; provide tables, charts, and discussion of full DSM 5 diagnostic criteria for all entities covered and serve as a complete diagnostic and treatment manual; and emphasize the roles of integrative diagnostic evaluation, case conceptualization, and treatment selection which are essential to understanding the link between psychopathology and psychotherapy in effective clinical practice"--Provided by publisher.  a2310aAdler, Alfred,d1870-1937.00aDiagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. 0aPsychology, Pathological. 0aPsychotherapy. 0aPsychiatryxDifferential therapeutics. 2aMental Disordersxdiagnosis.1 aSperry, Len,eeditor.  aRC 454 S68 2015wLCc1i32860001057644d4/15/2016e3/9/2016lON_SHELFmBURMANn4rYsYtBOOKu11/10/201401ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50021169bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/41931208
