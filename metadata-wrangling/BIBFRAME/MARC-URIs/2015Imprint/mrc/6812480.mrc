Latinos are both the largest and fastest-growing racial/ethnic group in the country, even while many continue to fight for their status as Americans. Respected movement builder and former leader of the Tides Foundation Idelisse Malave; and her daughter, Celeste Giordani--a communications strategist for the Social Transformation Project--distills the profusion of data, identifying the most telling and engaging facts to assemble a portrait of contemporary Latino life with glimpses of the past and future. From politics and the economy to popular culture, the arts, and ideas about race, gender, and family, Latino Stats both catalogs the inequities that plague Latino communities and documents Latinos' growing power and influence on American life. An essential tool for advocates, educators, and policy makers, Latino Stats will be a go-to guidebook for anyone wanting to raise their awareness and increase their understanding of the complex state of our nation"--cProvided by publisher.  a16 43 0aHispanic AmericansvStatistics.1 aGiordani, Esti,eauthor.  aE 184 S75 M363 2015hUAAU-Bi0162035244936  aE 184 S75 M363 2015wLCc1i0162035244936lON_SHELFmUAAUGp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu2/26/2015  aE 184 S75 M363 2015wLCc1i0162035257706lON_SHELFmUAHSSp$150.00rYsYtBOOKu3/19/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2014078943bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/313284817
