As a basis for teaching relationship skills, enhancing self-esteem and building a positive behaviour management and anti-bullying policy, circle time will not only increase confidence and "emotional intelligence" in pupils, but should also contribute towards a positive whole-school ethos.Fully updated in light of changes to the Early Years Foundation Stage, this highly practical book will explain how to put the principles for early years education into practice through well-structured and purposeful circle time lesson plans. Jenny Mosley, the UK's leading expert on circle time, provides accessible guidance on:incorporating the curriculum for personal, social and emotional development enabling children to understand universal moral skills developing young children's emotional intelligence helping children to practise problem-solving skills.Each chapter in this book explains circle time in a 'why? what? how?' format, and includes tick-sheets, bullet-pointed pages and examples showing how the theory works in practice. This is an invaluable and fun tool for developing young children's understanding of their feelings and relationships."--cProvided by publisher.  a29 41 0aPreschool teaching. 0aEducation, PreschoolxActivity programs. 0aNursery world/Routledge essential guides for early years practitioners.  aLB 1140.3 M67 2015c1hUAED-Bi0162035203189  aLB 1140.3 M67 2015wLCc1i0162035203189d4/27/2015e3/24/2015lFLOOR_2mUAEDUCn3p$150.00rYsYtBOOKu12/18/2014  aLB1140.3 .M67 2015wLCc1i1007432477d1/20/2015lON_SHELFmGR_MACEWANp$38.73rYsYtBOOKu1/15/201501ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no00021184bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/259194995
