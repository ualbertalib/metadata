The aim of the book is to help project managers with solutions to common project problems. It also helps project managers to gain insight in to crafting solutions to unique challenges in managing projects. This book is especially helpful to project managers whose teams are globally dispersed and present challenges based on cultural differences"--cProvided by publisher.  a"Preface As global project managers we continually have to fight against ever-changing currents of project stakeholder management, scope management, knowledge management, schedule management, resource management, and above all team management. As global project managers we have to strategize and find plausible solutions in a timely fashion to all events that endanger our project's feasible direction. Finding timely solutions to challenging events becomes more difficult in a global project environment. In this book I outline 82 challenging cases that I encountered during my global project management career all over the world. I analyze each case by detailing the issue, how I strategized and approached it for a solution, what the solution was, and what I learned from that case. As I became more experienced in project management, the quantity of challenging events in a project decreased. Lessons learned from each surprising event or personal mistake transformed me into a more careful and more detailed project manager. The benefits from this book can make a global project manager more proactive, more careful, more disciplined, and ready for sudden and similar surprises that can affect his or her project. Project cases detailed in this book will support and guide your strategizing process during execution of global projects. Lessons learned are summarized after every case. vi i i Preface"--cProvided by publisher.  a44 0aProject management. 0aIndustrial management.403University of Alberta Accessuhttp://marc.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781498700436z(Unlimited Concurrent Users)  hUAINzCRC  aInternet AccesswLCc1i6786285-1001lINTERNETmUAINTERNETrYsYtE-RESOURCEu1/20/2015xE-BOOKzCRC01ahttp://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2007085281bhttp://viaf.org/viaf/167101236
