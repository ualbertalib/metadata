Inform the Edmonton public and key stakeholders in the food industry of the survey results, and engage them in discussion to produce proposals for action that redress the barriers to food security. 4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies, processes and outcomes of the project with respect to developing healthy public policy and community action. Key objectives for the survey: 1. to find out who is experiencing food insecurity in Edmonton and how many people are having difficulty getting enough healthy affordable food. 2. To find out why these people are experiencing food insecurity and to identify the barriers to food security. 3. To identify existing coping strategies of low income people--strategies that help to reduce their experience of food insecurity. 4. To identify potential solutions as seen by those people experiencing food insecurity. 5. To gather information that has programming implications or that suggests needed policy changes for joint action by the community, business and government to address the issues of food security in Edmonton."],"keywords":["Social Sciences","Alberta--Social conditions--Statistics","Social surveys--Alberta","food consumption","food supply","food security"],"temporalCoverage":["1990-11/1990-12"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"spatialCoverage":["Canada","City of Edmonton"],"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1990EdmontonFoodPolicyCouncil_Codebook.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":1956192,"description":"Questionnaire and Codebook"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1990EdmontonFoodPolicyCouncil_Data.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":477765,"description":"Data File"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1990EdmontonFoodPolicyCouncil_Report.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":3252002,"description":"Methodology Report and Findings"}]},

This year the study was expanded with a larger interview schedule and mo re respondents (341 in 1977 versus 452 in 1978). As this is an amalgam survey, faculty members in the Department of Sociology were canvassed for submissions. There was a strong interest in the study and a broad range of topics were covered (see Appendix A). A concern which was carried over from the 1977 study was that we be able to develop a longitudinal picture of the \"quality of life\" in Edmonton and assess changes that take place in Edmontonians' evaluation of their daily lives. Some questions relating to social well-being asked last year were repeated on this year's study. The comparison of these findings is presented later in this discussion. From last year's study we found that we had put a heavy reliance on attitudinal measures but had spent little time gathering information on behavioural measures. As a result, questions relating to time budgets, social networks, residential mobility and life events were included. In addition, we added measures of objective living conditions (e.g. size of dwelling) and improved our measures of such things as income (this year we included questions on investments and transfer payments, as well as total household income); ethnic background; education; and so on. These measures should provide a much more comprehensive picture of the characteristics of our respondents. An innovation in this year's study was the addition of a \"special topics\" section which allows for a detailed analysis of a specific area of interest. This year's special topic related to \"urban values and included questions on residential characteristics, neighbourhoods, attitudes toward urban growth, and citizen participation strategies."],"keywords":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences","Public opinion -- Alberta","Social surveys -- Alberta","Alberta -- Social conditions -- Statistics","Alberta -- Economic conditions -- Statistics","time budgets","social networks","residential mobility","life events","living conditions","income","ethnic background","education","urban values","residential characteristics","urban growth","citizen participation"],"temporalCoverage":["1978-02/1978-03"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"spatialCoverage":["Canada","City of Edmonton"],"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1978EdmontonAreaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":387576,"description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4846"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1978EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":394722,"description":"Data File","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4848"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1978EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":115289,"description":"Methodology Report","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4847"}]},

The PRL specializes in the gathering, analysis, and presentation of data about demographic, social and public issues. The PRL research team provides expert consultation and implementation of quantitative and qualitative research methods, project design, sample design, web-based, paper-based and telephone surveys, field site testing, data analysis and report writing. The PRL follows scientifically rigorous and transparent methods in each phase of a research project. Research Coordinators are members of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and use best practices when conducting all types of research. The PRL has particular expertise in conducting computer-assisted telephone interviews (referred to as CATI surveys). When conducting telephone surveys, all calls are displayed as being from the \"U of A PRL\", a procedure that assures recipients that the call is not from a telemarketer, and thus helps increase response rates. The PRL maintains a complement of highly skilled telephone interviewers and supervisors who are thoroughly trained in FOIPP requirements, respondent selection procedures, questionnaire instructions, and neutral probing. A subset of interviewers are specially trained to convince otherwise reluctant respondents to participate in the study, a practice that increases response rates and lowers selection bias. PRL staff monitors data collection on a daily basis to allow any necessary adjustments to the volume and timing of calls and respondent selection criteria. The Population Research Laboratory (PRL) administered the 2012 Alberta Survey B. This survey of households across the province of Alberta continues to enable academic researchers, government departments, and non-profit organizations to explore a wide range of topics in a structured research framework and environment. Sponsors' research questions are asked together with demographic questions in a telephone interview of Alberta households. This data consists of the information from 1207 Alberta residence, interviewed between June 5, 2012 and June 27, 2012.

Questions were pilot tested. Three questions covered abuse, and the remaining five focused on aspects of household risk that can increase dysfunction.

Scientists know much less, however, about the relationship between prenatal nutrition and health (for the mother and child). The Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study is a longitudinal, prospective cohort in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada designed to investigate the relationship between maternal nutrient intake/status before, during and after gestation and a) maternal mood, b) birth and obstetric outcomes, and c) infant neurodevelopment. The data for approximately 5000 participants (2200 pregnant women, their offspring and many of their partners) includes information about maternal nutrition, anthropometric, biological, and mental health data at multiple points in pregnancy and the postpartum period, as well as obstetric, birth, health and neurodevelopment outcomes of these pregnancies and infants. Data from the APrON cohort can be used to answer questions related to prenatal nutrition, health and well-being and how they can impact neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes from infancy to childhood. Anchor participants were women over 16 years who can understand and answer questions in English, are pregnant for less than 27 weeks and are living in or near Calgary or Edmonton were eligible for recruitment into this study. Associated participants are the biological fathers and offspring resulting from study pregnancies. At this date this deposit of APrON data includes only the anthropometric measurements and questionnaires of survey mothers at the time of pregnancy and immediately post-partum.

Both instruments are self-report questionnaires used with care providers working in nursing homes. Our aim was to assess the factor structure, reliability, and measurement invariance between care provider groups responding to these instruments. Methods In a stratified random sample of 38 nursing homes in one German region (Metropolregion Rhein-Neckar), we collected questionnaires from 273 care aides, 196 regulated nurses, 152 allied health providers, 6 quality improvement specialists, 129 clinical leaders, and 65 nursing students. The factor structure was assessed using confirmatory factor models. The first model included all ten Alberta Context Tool concepts. We also decided a priori to run two separate models for the scale-based and the count-based Alberta Tool concepts as suggested by the instrument developers. The fourth model included the five Conceptual Research Utilization Scale items. Reliability scores were calculated based on the parameters of the best-fitting factor models. Multiple-group confirmatory factor models were used to assess measurement invariance between the provider groups. Results Rather than the hypothesized ten-factor structure of the Alberta Context Tool, confirmatory factor models suggested thirt een factors. The one-factor solution of the Conceptual Research Utilization Scale was confirmed. The reliability was acceptable (> .7 in the entire sample and in all provider groups) for 10 of 13 Alberta Context Tool concepts. The reliability of the Conceptual Research Utilization Scale was high (.90 to .96). We could demonstrate partial strong measurement invariance for both Alberta Context Tool models and partial strict measurement invariance for the Conceptual Research Utilization Scale. Conclusions Our results suggest that the scores of the German ACT and the CRU Scale for nursing homes are acceptably reliable and valid. However, as the ACT lacked strict measurement invariance, observed variables (or scale scores based on them) cannot be compared between provider groups. Rather, group comparisons should be based on latent variable models, which consider the different residual variances of each group."],"keywords":["psychometric testing, confirmatory factor analysis, measurement invariance","Alberta Context Tool, Conceptual Research Utilization Scale, organizational context, best practice use, residential long term care"],"citation":[{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"Factor structure, reliability and measurement invariance of the Alberta Context Tool and the Conceptual Research Utilization Scale, for German residential long term care"}],"temporalCoverage":["2012-08-23/2013-02-28"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"spatialCoverage":["Germany","One region in South Germany (Metropolregion Rhein-Neckar)"],"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"ACT_CRU_German_survey_data_11Oct2013.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":169077,"description":"","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/6087"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"ACT_RU_German_facility_data_10Mar2013.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":7225,"description":"","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/6088"}]},

We describe general guidelines for designing JIT analyses. We also present a general recipe for turning static data- flow analyses into JIT analyses through a concept of layered analysis execution illustrated through Cheetah, a JIT taint analysis for Android applications.

After the first six months, the experimental group will be advised to continue the unsupervised home programme until the discharge from the scoliosis clinic, while the control group will be offered the Schroth treatment for six months.

Secondary aims include: 1. To determine the effect of Schroth exercises at 6 months on secondary outcomes including quality-of-life, spinal appearance, objective posture and spinal muscle endurance measurements. 2. To determine the efficacy of 6 months of Schroth therapy offered to control participants after completing 6 months in the standard-of care group (using subjects as their own controls) and 3. To determine if the effects of the 6 months supervised Schroth exercise program can be maintained after supervised therapy is terminated.

A research assistant trained in programming used a customized computer program to combine synonymous names of single individuals and separate identical names of different individuals. From this database I generated variables for presence of authors with institutional affiliations in high, middle, or low income countries (World Bank 2016); presence of authors from mega-biodiverse countries (Mittermeier 1997); and whether or not the paper was published in a highly ranked journal. I assigned an income variable using four-categories of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita levels from the World Bank (upper income, >=$12,476; upper middle income, $4,036 to $12,475; lower middle income $1,026 to $4,035; and low income, ≤$1,025).

We also excluded a small number of articles in which DNA barcoding referred to activities other than the differentiation of species using a standardized short DNA sequence. For example, we excluded articles in which “DNA barcoding” described methods used to track an individual animal from farm to market. We developed a priori codes foR content analysis of each article based on descriptions of the iBOL Project and DNA barcoding from the iBOL website and other publications, including: article characteristics, iBOL missions and working groups, barcoding science, and genetic resource sharing.

There has been a lack of comprehensive indices for measuring overall SES in Canada. Here, a more comprehensive SES index is developed aiming to support future studies exploring health outcomes related to environmental pollution in Canada.  Methods: SES variables (n=22, Census Canada 2006) were selected based on: cultural identities, housing characteristics, variables identified in Canadian environmental injustice studies and a previous deprivation index (Pampalon index). Principal component analysis with a single varimax rotation (factor loadings=¦60¦) was performed on SES variables for 52974 census dissemination areas (DA). The final index was created by averaging the factor scores per DA according to the three components retained. The index was validated by examining its association with preterm birth (gestational age<37 weeks), term low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g), small for gestational age (SGA, <10 percentile of birth weight for gestational age) and PM2.5 (particulate matter=2.5 µm) exposures in Edmonton, Alberta (1999–2008).  Results: Index values exhibited a relatively normal distribution (median=0.11, mean=0.0, SD=0.58) across Canada. Values in Alberta tended to be higher than in Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories and Nunavut (Pearson chi-square p<0.001 across provinces). Lower quintiles of our index and the Pampalon’s index confirmed know associations with a higher prevalence of LBW, SGA, preterm birth and PM2.5 exposure. Results with our index exhibited greater statistical significance and a more consistent gradient of PM2.5 levels and prevalence of pregnancy outcomes.  Conclusions: Our index reflects more dimensions of SES than an earlier index and it performed superiorly in capturing gradients in prevalence of pregnancy outcomes. It can be used for future research involving environmental pollution and health in Canada.

With growing numbers of such children in our society, especially in our inner cities, this research is timely and has the promise of offering a cost effective and efficient way to address this social issue. This pilot study is desighed to precede Phase 1 of a 2-Phase study-- to compare two readily available community-based early intervention programs designed to improve menta health outcomes for at risk infants and their caregivers.

The same data is available in separate csv files and all data files are included in one zip file, except for a read me file wihcih is in txt format.. \"Read me\" contains descriptions of all column headers and data. It provides units of measurement for each. \"Bulk density and LOI\" contains the bulk density and loss-on-ignition values of peat samples. Bulk density was used with measured carbon content to calculate carbon stocks. LOI was used to aid in identifying transitions between peatland developmental stages. Peat was first dried at 110°C to calculate bulk density and then combusted at 550°C to determine LOI. Both bulk density and LOi were determined according to Chambers et al (2011). \"Carbon content\" contains the measured carbon content of peat samples. Measurements were determined using a Eurovector EA 3000 Elemental Analyzer (HEKAtech, Wegberg, Germany) from a homogenized sample. A site average (45%) carbon content was used with bulk density measurements to calculate carbon stocks. \"FTIR and C:N\" contains Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and molar C:N ratios from peat samples. We analyzed samples for FTIR on an Agilent 660 FT-IR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Calculated molar C:N ratios, were determined using a Eurovector EA 3000 Elemental Analyzer (HEKAtech, Wegberg, Germany) from a homogenized sample. The mean carbon content of peat was 45 ± 3.6% (n = 45). \"Radiocarbon\" contains the lab ID, uncalibrated age, fraction modern, calibrated 1-sigma age, Bacon model age, material dated, and stratigraphic significance for peat samples across all eight cores. Peat samples were dated using 14C analysis with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at the A. E. Lalonde AMS Laboratory, Ottawa. Bacon model age represents age-depth models that were estimated using the BAcon software (Blaauw and Christeny 2011) \"Plant macrofossils\" contains measurements from a number of depths across all cores. It contains estimates of % presence of Sphagnum, brown moss, sedge, ligneous matter, and ericaceous rootlets using five ranges (≤ 1%, 1 – 10%, > 10 – 50%, > 50 – 90%, and > 90%) of percentage of peat volume acquired from the mean of five different estimates per 1 cm section. Plant needles and leaves are reported as individuals per cm3. Along with bulk density, LOI,and radiocarbon dates, plant macrofossils were used to identify the main transitions between macrofossil assemblages, peatland stages, and permafrost history at the study site."],"keywords":["Earth and Environmental Sciences","Peat","Carbon","Permafrost","Biogeochemistry"],"citation":[{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"Chambers, F.

Nutritional intake during gestation is known to impact health outcomes for progeny. Correlational evidence in humans suggests that increased fruit consumption of pregnant mothers enhances infant cognitive development. Moreover, wild-type Drosophila supplemented with a combination of orange and tomato juice showed robust enhancements in performance on an associative olfactory memory task. The current study aimed to experimentally test the effects of prenatal fruit juice exposure in a non-human, mammalian model of learning and memory. Methods. Across three separate birth cohorts, pregnant rats were given access to diluted tomato and orange juice (N = 2 per cohort), with control rats (N = 2 per cohort) receiving only water, in addition to standard rodent chow, throughout the duration of gestation, ending at parturition. Following weaning, male offspring were tested for learning and memory in a spatial version of the circular water maze and an auditory cued fear-conditioning task. Results. All pregnant rats increased fluid and food intake over the gestational period. Fruit juice-fed pregnant rats had increased fluid intake compared to control pregnant rats. When testing progeny, there were no effects of prenatal fruit juice on spatial learning, while it appeared to impair learning in fear conditioning relative to controls. However, we measured significant enhancements in both spatial memory and conditioned fear memory in the prenatal fruit-juice group compared to controls. Measures of vigilance, in response to the conditioned cue, were increased in prenatal fruit treated rats compared to controls, suggesting less generalized, and more adaptive anxiety-related behaviours. Discussion. Our results corroborate the human and Drosophila findings of prenatal fruit effects on behaviour, specifically that prenatal fruit juice exposure may be beneficial for early-life memory consolidation in rats."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","gestational diet","memory","consolidation","cognition"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset","text":"CC0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"August Run Data.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":450,"description":"Raw data from our third cohort of animals","@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/W21DVN","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/W21DVN","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/10401"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"January Run Data.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":379,"description":"Raw data from our first cohort of animals","@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/DW5QPP","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/DW5QPP","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/10402"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"March Run Data.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":262,"description":"Raw data from our second cohort of animals","@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/M9SDNR","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/M9SDNR","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/10400"}]},

Approaches using biomarkers, fossils, and phylogenomics have provided some hints of the types\r\nof animals that may have been present during the Neoproterozoic, but extant animals are our best modern links to the\r\ntheoretical ancestors of animals. Neoproterozoic oceans were low energy habitats, with low oxygen concentrations and\r\nsparse food availability for the first animals. We examined tolerance of extant ctenophores and sponges—as representatives of extant lineages of the earliest known metazoan groups—to feeding and oxygen use. A review of respiration rates\r\nin species across several phyla suggests that suspension feeders in general have a wide range of metabolic rates, but\r\nsponges have some of the highest of invertebrates and ctenophores some of the lowest. Our own studies on the\r\nmetabolism of two groups of deep water sponges show that sponges have different approaches to deal with the cost\r\nof filtration and low food availability. We also confirmed that deep water sponges tolerate periods of hypoxia, but at the\r\ncost of filtration, indicating that normal feeding is energetically expensive. Predictions of oxygen levels in the\r\nNeoproterozoic suggest the last common ancestor of multicellular animals was unlikely to have filtered like modern\r\nsponges.

Among the genes present in\r\nporiferans are those fundamental to the sensory and nervous systems of other animals. Sponges are dynamic\r\nand sensitive animals and it is intuitive to link these genes to behaviour. The proposal that ctenophores are the\r\nearliest diverging metazoan has led to the question of whether sponges possess a ‘pre-nervous’ system or have\r\nundergone nervous system loss. Both lines of thought generally assume that the last common ancestor of\r\nsponges and eumetazoans possessed the genetic modules that underlie sensory abilities. By corollary extant\r\nsponges may possess a sensory cell homologous to one present in the last common ancestor, a hypothesis that\r\nhas been studied by gene expression. We have performed a meta-analysis of all gene expression studies\r\npublished to date to explore whether gene expression is indicative of a feature's sensory function. In sponges we\r\nfind that eumetazoan sensory-neural markers are not particularly expressed in structures with known sensory\r\nfunctions. Instead it is common for these genes to be expressed in cells with no known or uncharacterized\r\nsensory function. Indeed, many sensory-neural markers so far studied are expressed during development,\r\nperhaps because many are transcription factors. This suggests that the genetic signal of a sponge sensory cell is\r\ndissimilar enough to be unrecognizable when compared to a bilaterian sensory or neural cell. It is possible that\r\nsensory-neural markers have as yet unknown functions in sponge cells, such as assembling an immunological\r\nsynapse in the larval globular cell. Furthermore, the expression of sensory-neural markers in non-sensory cells,\r\nsuch as adult and larval epithelial cells, suggest that these cells may have uncharacterized sensory functions.\r\nWhile this does not rule out the co-option of ancestral sensory modules in later evolving groups, a distinct\r\ngenetic foundation may underlie the sponge sensory system.","@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/1T7ZWG/GJYYQK","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/1T7ZWG/GJYYQK","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/10427"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Trophic ecology of glass sponge reefs in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":3112942,"description":"Sponges link the microbial loop with benthic communities by feeding on bacteria.

The absence ofclassical animal traits (nerves, digestive tract, and muscles) makes spongeschallenging for non-specialists to work with and has delayed getting highquality genomic data compared to other invertebrates. Yet analyses of spongegenomes and transcriptomes currently available have radically changed ourunderstanding of animal evolution. Sponges are of prime evolutionaryimportance as one of the best candidates to form the sister group of all otheranimals, and genomic data are essential to understand the mechanisms thatcontrol animal evolution and diversity.

In sponges, one of the earliest diverging animal groups, Wnt\r\npathway genes have diverse expression patterns in different groups including along the anterior-posterior axis of\r\ntwo sponge larvae, and in the osculum and ostia of others. We studied the function of Wnt signaling and body\r\npolarity formation through expression, knockdown, and larval manipulation in several freshwater sponge species.\r\nResults: Sponge Wnts fall into sponge-specific and sponge-class specific subfamilies of Wnt proteins. Notably Wnt\r\ngenes were not found in transcriptomes of the glass sponge Aphrocallistes vastus. Wnt and its signaling genes were\r\nexpressed in archaeocytes of the mesohyl throughout developing freshwater sponges. Osculum formation was\r\nenhanced by GSK3 knockdown, and Wnt antagonists inhibited both osculum development and regeneration. Using\r\ndye tracking we found that the posterior poles of freshwater sponge larvae give rise to tissue that will form the\r\nosculum following metamorphosis.\r\nConclusions: Together the data indicate that while components of canonical Wnt signaling may be used in\r\ndevelopment and maintenance of osculum tissue, it is likely that Wnt signaling itself occurs between individual\r\ncells rather than whole tissues or structures in freshwater sponges.","@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/1T7ZWG/37WGUT","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/1T7ZWG/37WGUT","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/10424"}]},

The aim of this study was to determine which screening tool is able to identify children with malnutrition on admission to hospital. Methods: A nurse administered 2 pediatric nutrition screening tools, Screening Tool for Risk on Nutritional Status and Growth (STRONGkids) and Pediatric Nutrition Screening Tool (PNST) to patients admitted to medicine and surgery units (n = 165). The Subjective Global Nutritional Assessment (SGNA) was then completed by a dietitian, blinded to the results of the screens. Sensitivity, specificity, and ? were calculated for both screening tools against the SGNA. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assessed alternate cutoffs for each tool. Length of hospital stay (LOS) was used to assess prospective validity. Results: Using the recommended cutoffs, the sensitivity of STRONGkids was 89%, specificity 35%, and ? 0.483. The sensitivity of PNST was 58%, specificity 88%, and ? 0.601. Using adjusted cutoffs, PNST's sensitivity improved to 87%, specificity 71%, and ? 0.681, and STRONGkids specificity improved to 61%, sensitivity 80%, and ? 0.5. Children identified at nutrition risk had significantly longer LOS (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study showed neither tool was appropriate for clinical use based on published cutoffs.

Details on data collection procedures, re-sampling, defined Hudson Bay break-up period, source of sea ice data, and definition of study area are identified in: Brooke A. Biddlecombe, Erin M. Bayne, Nicholas J. Lunn, David McGeachy, & Andrew E. Derocher. 2020. Comparing sea ice habitat fragmentation metrics using integrated step selection analysis.

Animals were genotyped using Illumina BovineSNP50 v2 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., CA, USA) at Delta Genomics, Edmonton, AB, Canada. Quality control has been done for the data. After quality control, 45,266 SNPs on 29 bovine autosomes for 475 individuals remained and were used for this study. The data are in Plink format and the missing genotypes have not been imputed.","Abstract of the study: Metabolites, substrates or products of metabolic processes, are involved in many biological functions, such as energy metabolism, signaling, stimulatory and inhibitory effects on enzymes and immunological defense. Metabolomic phenotypes are a combination of genetic and environmental effects and metabolome-genome-wide association studies (mGWAS) investigate the relationship between these phenotypes and genetic variants. The objectives of this study were to estimate heritability and perform mGWAS and functional enrichment analyses for a set of plasma metabolites in Canadian crossbred beef cattle. Thirty-three plasma metabolites and 45,266 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available for 475 animals. Genomic heritability for all metabolites was estimated using genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) including genomic breed composition as covariates in the model. A single-step GBLUP implemented in BLUPF90 programs was used to determine SNP P values and the proportion of genetic variance explained by SNP windows containing 10 consecutive SNPs. The top 10 SNP windows that explained the largest genetic variation for each metabolite were selected and mapped to identify candidate genes. Functional enrichment analyses were performed on metabolites and their candidate genes using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Eleven metabolites showed low to moderate heritability that ranged from 0.09±0.13 to 0.36±0.15, while heritability estimates for 22 metabolites were zero or negligible. This result indicates that while variation in 11 metabolites had a genetic basis, the majority are largely influenced by environment. Three significant SNP associations were detected for betaine (rs109862186), L-alanine (rs81117935) and L-lactic acid (rs42009425) based on Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (FWER < 0.05). The SNP rs81117935 was found to be located within Catenin Alpha 2 gene (CTNNA2) showing a possible association with the regulation of L-alanine concentration. Other candidate genes were identified based on additive genetic variance explained by SNP windows of 10 consecutive SNPs. The observed heritability estimates and the candidate genes and networks identified in this study serve as baseline information for research into the utilization of plasma metabolites for genetic improvement of crossbred beef cattle."],"keywords":["Agricultural Sciences"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset","text":"CC0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"genotype.map","fileFormat":"application/octet-stream","contentSize":1360673,"description":"Plink map file","@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/8X1YZC/LKETNV","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/8X1YZC/LKETNV","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/11402"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"genotype.ped","fileFormat":"application/octet-stream","contentSize":64515483,"description":"Plink ped file","@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/8X1YZC/R8WKI0","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/8X1YZC/R8WKI0","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/11403"}]},

A quota sample of 4645 adults (18+ years), randomly drawn from an online research panel and stratified to match age and sex distributions of adults within and across Canadian provinces, was recruited in June 2018. Participants completed survey items assessing support for harm reduction for people who use drugs (PWUD) and for seven harm reduction interventions. Additional items assessed exposure to media coverage on harm reduction, and scales assessing stigma toward PWUD (α = .72), personal familiarity with PWUD (α = .84), and disease model beliefs about addiction (α = 0.79). Most (64%) Canadians supported harm reduction (provincial estimates = 60% - 73%). Five of seven interventions received majority support, including: outreach (79%), naloxone (72%), drug checking (70%), needle distribution (60%) and supervised drug consumption (55%). Low-threshold opioid agonist treatment and safe inhalation interventions received less support (49% and 44%). Our social exposure model, adjusted for respondent sex, household income, political views, and education, exhibited good fit and accounted for 17% of variance in public support for harm reduction. Personal familiarity with PWUD and disease model beliefs about addiction were directly associated with support (βs = .07 and -0.10, respectively), and indirectly influenced public support via stigmatized attitudes toward PWUD (βs = 0.01 and -0.01, respectively). Strategies to increase support for harm reduction could problematize certain disease model beliefs (e.g., “There are only two possibilities for an alcoholic or drug addict – permanent abstinence or death”) and creating opportunities to reduce social distance between PWUD, the public, and policy makers."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Harm reduction, public opinion, Canada, structural equation model"],"citation":[{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"T.

For the purposes of this project, the following inclusion criteria were used:  Canadian: a minimum of one-third of the core editorial board is affiliated with an eligible Canadian post-secondary institution. We used this as the primary criteria and not whether or not the journal title is owned by a Canadian not-for-profit organization. As we are interested primarily in labour, limiting it based on the editorial board was natural for this study. Independent: A journal is not affiliated with a commercial publisher (e.g. Springer, Elsevier, Sage, etc.). Non-profits, like Érudit and University of Toronto Press, were included in the project. Scholarly: defined as a peer-reviewed academic publication that disseminates the results of original scholarship. We have excluded additional student-run journals as per the SSHRC guidelines as well. Active: The journal has published in the last 3 years.   The second list is of the journals that we removed from our original data collection that did not meet the above criteria when reviewed.

Evaluating current implementation efforts and identifying current research gaps may inform future implementation. This scoping review explores studies implementing cancer-specific exercise programs to determine their pragmatic characteristics and evaluate potential for translation into practice. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using five databases (up to July 2020) to identify implementation studies that used qualitative or quantitative methods. Program pragmatism was evaluated using the PRECIS/RE-AIM tool. Results: 14 articles were included for review. While programs were moderately pragmatic (average: 3.4; range: 2.8-4.2), variability was observed between scoring domains. Programs scored higher (more pragmatic) in domains typical for effectiveness studies, including participant eligibility, follow-up intensity, primary trial outcome, and analysis of primary outcome. In contrast, programs scored lower (less pragmatic) in domains aligned with implementation science, including intervention flexibility, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Limited information was reported regarding program fidelity, adaptations, and maintenance/sustainability. Conclusion: Researchers should consider the pragmatism of interventions, the nuances of program adoption and implementation at the setting level, and the transition and integration of programming into the healthcare system. Future studies may benefit from the inclusion of decision-makers and implementation experts and shifting focus towards flexible programming."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Oncology"],"citation":[{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"Purdy GM, Sobierajski FM, Dolgoy ND, McNeely ML.

We assessed the evidence for dual-colonization of aspen by ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi at two soil depths across 27 stands across nearly 1500 km spanning boreal and parkland biomes. Given the increase in arbuscular mycorrhizas with temperature and evapotranspiration and the opposite for ectomycorrhizas, we hypothesized that AM fungi would increase, and ectomycorrhizal fungi decrease in abundance with decreasing moisture availability. Second, simultaneous with our regional-scale survey, we examined some ecosystem correlates of putative shifts in the dominance of mycorrhizal type in aspen. We measured leaf traits connected to nutrient economic strategies and decomposition, and pools of carbon and nitrogen in soils of aspen forests. Studies have found that leaves from ectomycorrhizal (EM) tree species decompose slower than those from AM tree species and that mycorrhizal tree type predicts soil C and nutrient dynamics. The mechanism, however, underlying the distinct effects of EM and AM trees on soil organic matter is unclear. Namely, it may not be AM fungi per se, but rather the activity of microbes upon competitive release in the absence of EM fungi that influences soil organic matter dynamics in AM stands. Thus, we hypothesized that variation in EM fungal abundance rather than that of AM fungi may influence soil carbon and nutrient cycling.","None"],"keywords":["Earth and Environmental Sciences","mycorrhizal ecology","biogeochemistry"],"citation":[{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"Justine Karst, James Franklin, Andrea Simeon, Ashley Light, Jonathan A.

This data was collected annually (end of June/early July) from 34 lakes at the Utikuma Region Study Area in the Boreal Plains of Western Canada from 2012 to 2019. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) concentrations were measured on a Shimadzu 5000A TOC analyser using the high temperature combustion method at the Biogeochemical Analytical Service Laboratory, University of Alberta (BASL). Absorbance (A254) data were measured Varian Cary 100 from 2012 to 2015 and an Ocean Optics UV-Vis spectrophotometer from 2016 to 2019. Fe (Total Iron) was measured at BASL using a Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific ICAP6300). Specific Ultra-Violet Absorbance was calculated using DOC concentration, and absorbance corrected for Iron. Chlorophyll a concentrations were measured at BASL using a Fluorophotometer (Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorophotometer). An Autotitrator (Man-Tech PC-Titrate with conductivity probe) was used to obtain pH values for each sample at BASL or pH was measured in the field using a calibrated Myron pH pen. Isotopic signatures (δ18O and δ2H) were determined using a Los Gatos isotope analyser from 2012 to 2013 and a Picarro Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy L2130-i isotope analyser from 2014 to 2018 at BASL. Electrical conductivity was measured in the field using either a calibrated temperature level conductivity meter or a calibrated Myron EC pen Lake depth was obtained from measurements at a permanent reference location at the same time as chemistry sampling, and measurements taken from the lake centre in 2012. The difference between the lake centre and reference location in 2012 was applied to other years to obtain lake depth."],"keywords":["Earth and Environmental Sciences","DOC, SUVA254, boreal lake, carbon"],"citation":[{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"Poulin, B.

As a model of both sleep-like neurophysiological activity and the downstream peripheral function urethane is used to model a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. In this present study, we recorded respiration rate and heart rate concurrently with local field potentials from the neocortex and hippocampus to determine the stability of peripheral physiological functions within and between brain-states under urethane anesthesia. Our data shows electroencephalographic characteristics and breathing rate are remarkable stable over long-term recordings within minor reductions in heart rate on the same time scale.   File Description: All files are .dat files extract via MatLab from the raw data recording EEG (electroencephalogram) and physiological signals. The spectral analysis was accomplished using a series of 6-second long, Hanning-windowed samples with a 2-second overlap using Welch’s periodogram method. The first vertical column shows frequency from 0-500 Hz with a resolution of 0.05 Hz. Each subsequent column (starting on column 2) shows the average power (mV^2) of the corresponding row frequency (based on column 1) during a 10 second interval (ie the second column shows average power of all frequencies for the first 10 seconds of the experiment, the third column shows average power during the next 10 seconds, ect.). Four signals were recorded, they are: cortical EEG (CTX), hippocampal EEG (HPC), breathing rate (BR) and heart rate (HR). EEG was recorded via bipolar recording electrodes, the HR was recorded via a pulse transducer, and a thermocouple wire was used to record BR (NOTE: not all experiments have all 4 signals recorded). The files are named in the following fashion: experiment number-recording signal. For example, 1-CTX is the first experiments cortical EEG. Experiments are numbered in the order they were analyzed in and have no significant meaning."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Urethane; Sleep; Anesthesia"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset","text":"CC0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1-BR.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":210161014,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17633"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1-CTX.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":210161014,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17622"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1-HPC.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":210161014,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17636"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1-HR.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":210161014,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17631"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"2-CTX.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":214411439,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17620"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"2-HPC.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":214411439,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17635"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"2-HR.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":214411439,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17625"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"3-BR.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":269666964,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17623"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"3-CTX.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":269666964,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17621"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"3-HPC.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":269666964,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17630"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"3-HR.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":269666964,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17632"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"4-BR.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":151335132,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17637"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"4-CTX.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":151335132,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17626"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"4-HPC.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":151335132,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17634"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"4-HR.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":151335132,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17624"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"5-BR.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":191119110,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17628"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"5-CTX.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":191119110,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17629"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"5-HPC.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":191119110,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17627"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"5-HR.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":191119110,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17619"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"6-BR.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":139773976,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17617"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"6-CTX.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":139773976,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17618"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"6-HPC.dat","fileFormat":"text/x-fixed-field","contentSize":139773976,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/17616"}]},
