        <description descriptionType="Abstract">These are WhatsApp mobile instant messaging chats between refugee and non-refugee learners in one 2018 summer term York University undergraduate course offered through the Borderless Higher Education for Refugees Program. The learners are attributed to a country of location while studying, a gender, a final grade, and a chat group which was composed for the purposes of supporting a group presentation. Refugee learners were based in Kenya and Thailand, while none refugees were based in Canada. More learners were in the groups than were participants in the study. Non-participants' data and chats were removed from the groups. The chat messages are attributed to a learner, a date and time, and then coded for the indicators of social presence as described by the Community of Inquiry Framework.</description>
