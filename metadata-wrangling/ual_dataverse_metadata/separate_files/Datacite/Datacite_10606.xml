        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The 1993 Graduand Survey was undertaken to assist the University of Alberta in its on-going efforts to improve the quality of education received by students. Most of the 1993 survey questions were repeated from the 1992 Graduand Survey, since the objective is to develop an over-time data base that will allow a systematic monitoring of the University's efforts to achieve its teaching goals.</description>
