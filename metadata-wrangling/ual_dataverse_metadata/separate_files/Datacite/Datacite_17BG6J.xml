        <description descriptionType="Abstract">Telemetry data: 39 adult female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in Western Hudson Bay were immobilized via remote injection and fitted with satellite-linked GPS collars in 2012-2017. Collars were programmed to retrieve location data every 4 hours. Locations with biologically impossible movement (i.e. speed > 30 km/h) were removed and the data were re-sampled using consecutive bursts of 3 or more locations in 4 hour intervals to correct for missing locations. Locations are specific to the sea ice break-up period in Hudson Bay, and are separated into early and late break-up. This data set includes a generic ID for each individual, latitude, longitude, and time/date of each location, as well as the number of each burst that was retained after re-sampling. Sea ice data: Sea ice cover raster files for the entire Arctic were attained from NSIDC for all days in 2013-2018. Raster resolution is 6.25 x 6.25 km, and pixel values reflect percentage of sea ice concentration multiplied by 2. Sea ice data was clipped to the study area in Hudson Bay, and only days within the break-up period in each year were retained. File name reflects date "YYYMMDD-HB". Details on data collection procedures, re-sampling, defined Hudson Bay break-up period, source of sea ice data, and definition of study area are identified in: Brooke A. Biddlecombe, Erin M. Bayne, Nicholas J. Lunn, David McGeachy, & Andrew E. Derocher. 2020. Comparing sea ice habitat fragmentation metrics using integrated step selection analysis. Ecology and Evolution.</description>
