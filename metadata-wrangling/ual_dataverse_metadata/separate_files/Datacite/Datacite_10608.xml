        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The University of Alberta's program of exit surveys reflects its commitment to excellence in teaching and to systematic evaluation of its performance. The Graduand Surveys provide an annual assessment of the University, from the perspective of its most recent graduates, which can assist faculties, departments, and administrative units attempting to improve the educational experience for students. In addition, comparisons of results from consecutive exit surveys can help track the success of efforts to improve the University's teaching practices and service provision.</description>
