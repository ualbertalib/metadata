        <description descriptionType="Abstract">These covariate raster TIFFs were used as input data in generalized linear models (GLMs), which were developed to estimate cougar habitat and prey selection at multiple spatial scales in west-central Alberta, Canada. The study area for which these raster TIFFs were developed was in west-central Alberta, bounded to the west by Jasper National Park; to the north by Hinton, Alberta; to the south by Cadomin, Alberta; and to the east by Obed, Alberta. These raster TIFFs are being published in support of a multi-scale cougar predation analysis conducted by M Beale, S Widmeyer, and M Boyce. The manuscript associated with these data is currently being reviewed and will be included under 'Related Publications' upon acceptance.</description>
