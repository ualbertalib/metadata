        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The dataset was drawn from an online survey conducted between December 2018 to March 2019 involving 401 rural (agricultural) landowners in the Province of Alberta (Canada), using an online panel from the market research provider Kynetec (located in Guelph, Canada). Landowners were invited to participate in a survey about what rural Albertan landowners think of local energy infrastructure development and wind turbines in particular. The study received human ethics research approval at the University of Alberta. Funding for this study was provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council under the project "Imagination, expectation and deliberation: Pathways to wind energy landscape transitions in Alberta" (#435-2017-0281).</description>
