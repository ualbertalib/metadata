        <description descriptionType="Abstract">For the ninth annual Edmonton Area Study "Public Attitudes to Education" was chosen as the special topic. Questions under this topic related to the respondent's attitudes, assessment and experience with the educational system. As in the past, faculty members and outside agencies submitted a variety of questions which may or may not have been related to the special topic (See Appendix). In addition, the questionnaire contained a few replicated questions from previous EAS studies.</description>
