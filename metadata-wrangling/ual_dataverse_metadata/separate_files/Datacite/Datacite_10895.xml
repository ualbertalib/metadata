        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The study's objective was to examine whether triage nurses, trained in the use of a medical directive that taught recognition and treatment of radial head subluxation, could successfully reduce radial head subluxation at a rate similar to physicians. Given the practical constraints at the time of emergency department triage, this study was designed as a cluster randomized trial where the unit of randomization was a day and the patients on any given day were assigned to the nurse or physician arm for the entire day.</description>
