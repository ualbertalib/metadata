        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The 1989 All Alberta Study (AAS) was the third in an annual series administered by the Department of Sociology, University of Alberta, through its research facility, the Population Research Laboratory (PRL)--the following topics are addressed in the 1989 survey: demographic characteristics, marriage and family, health, crime and policing, aging, professional groups, saving and investing, landfill site, retirement, Canadian defence, political party preference, abortion, television viewing, and travel. This random sample survey of households in the province of Alberta has enabled academic researchers, local community agencies, and government departments to explore a broad spectrum of social issues in an on-going research framework in Alberta.</description>
