        <description descriptionType="Abstract">GFPcro BSC-40 cells were transfected with linearized pmCherry-cro plasmid 4 hours prior to infecting with VACV-pE/L-mCherry(t) at MOI = 5. Images were collected immediately after initiating the infection and the appearance of new GFPcro labeled DNA was used to track factory development, while mCherry fluorescence was used to detect plasmid-by-virus recombination. Images were collected every 5 minutes up to 10 h post infection.</description>
