        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The 1996 Alberta Survey (AS) was the eleventh annual provincial survey administered by the Population Research Laboratory (PRL), the survey research arm of the Department of Sociology at the University of Alberta. This random sample survey of households in the province of Alberta has enabled academic researchers, government departments, non-profit organizations, and the private sector to explore a wide range of public policy issues in an on-going research framework. Owing to the large number of questions submitted by researchers and organizations, the omnibus Alberta Survey was conducted during two time periods in 1996. Independent samples were drawn and separate questionnaires were administered by telephone interviewers.</description>
