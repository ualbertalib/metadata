        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The 1995 Alberta Survey (AS) was the ninth annual provincial survey administered by the Department of Sociology, University of Alberta, through its research facility, the Population Research Laboratory (PRL)--major topics for this particular survey included sociodemographic characteristics, health/health related issues, provincial government budget cuts, crime in Edmonton, and the economy in Alberta. This random sample survey of households in the province of Alberta has enabled academic research ers, local community agencies, and government departments to explore a broad spectrum of social issues in an on-going research framework. Owing to the large number of questions submitted by researchers and organizations, the 1995 Alberta Survey was conducted in three segments. Three independent samples were drawn and administered separate questionnaires.</description>
