        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The Department of Sociology, University of Alberta, conducts the AAS and EAS Studies through its research facility, th e Population Research Laboratory (PRL)--this year's topics include: demographics, health, smoking, abortion attitudes, the Alberta Economy, family violence, crime, police, employment, and television viewing. Over the years, the project has afforded University researchers and local community agencies an opportunity to investigate and explore social issues of importance to Albertans in an on-going research framework. For the past ten studies, the annual survey project conducted by the Population Research Laboratory has been confined to the corporate boundaries of the City of Edmonton (Edmonton Area Study, EAS). However, for this eleventh year, an expanded Study was undertaken to include all of Alberta comprising both face-to-face and telephone interviewing.</description>
