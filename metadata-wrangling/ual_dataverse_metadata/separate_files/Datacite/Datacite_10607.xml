        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The 1994 Graduand Survey was undertaken to assist the University of Alberta in its on-going efforts to improve the quality of education received by students. most of the 1994 survey questions were repeated from the 1992 and 1993 Graduand Surveys, since a primary goal of these 'exit surveys' is to develop an over-time data base that will allow a systematic monitoring of the University's efforts to achieve its teaching goals.</description>
