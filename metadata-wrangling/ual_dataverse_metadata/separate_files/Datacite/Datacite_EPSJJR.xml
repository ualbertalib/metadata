        <description descriptionType="Abstract">This data set contains a list of active, Canadian independent, scholarly journals compiled as a part of the "Documenting labour in Canadian academic publishing" research study. The data was collected between October 2019 - April 2020, and reviewed and updated in July-August 2020.  For the purposes of this project, the following inclusion criteria were used:  Canadian: a minimum of one-third of the core editorial board is affiliated with an eligible Canadian post-secondary institution. We used this as the primary criteria and not whether or not the journal title is owned by a Canadian not-for-profit organization. As we are interested primarily in labour, limiting it based on the editorial board was natural for this study. Independent: A journal is not affiliated with a commercial publisher (e.g. Springer, Elsevier, Sage, etc.). Non-profits, like Ã‰rudit and University of Toronto Press, were included in the project. Scholarly: defined as a peer-reviewed academic publication that disseminates the results of original scholarship. We have excluded additional student-run journals as per the SSHRC guidelines as well. Active: The journal has published in the last 3 years.   The second list is of the journals that we removed from our original data collection that did not meet the above criteria when reviewed.  For more information on the project you can see the presentation slides from the Library Publishing Forum when the initial results were discussed: https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/presentations/7w62fd646?locale=en and a forthcoming article in the Journal of Electronic Publishing (May 2020)</description>
