        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The 2016 Alberta Mentoring Partnership survey is a computer-assisted telephone survey of 1208 Albertan adults designed to assess mentoring behaviours, attitudes and experiences. It is a portion of the 2016 Alberta Survey B conducted by the Population Research Lab, and was commissioned by the Alberta Mentoring Partnership (AMP) in collaboration with PolicyWise for Children & Families. Questions were pilot tested by the AMP Research and Evaluation committee. Topics included past mentoring experience, the influence of this past mentorship, current mentoring and willingness to mentor in the near future. This version includes variables re-categorized by PolicyWise staff in the making of its associated report “Results of the 2016 Alberta Mentoring Partnership Survey”. These metadata can also be found on SAGE's searchable metadata website: http://sagemetadata.policywise.com/nada/index.php/catalog/9</description>
