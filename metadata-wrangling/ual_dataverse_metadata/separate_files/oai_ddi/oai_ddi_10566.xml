This random sample survey of households in the province of Alberta has enabled academic researchers, local community agencies, and non-profit organizations to explore a broad spectrum of social issues in an on-going research framework in Alberta.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="1988-02">1988-02</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="1988-03">1988-03</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="1988-02-05">1988-02-05</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="1988-03">1988-03</collDate><dataKind>Microdata</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Alberta</geogCover><geogUnit>Province</geogUnit><anlyUnit>Individual</anlyUnit><universe>The 1988 Edmonton population universe was designated as all persons 18 years of age or older who at the time of the survey were living in a dwelling unit that was enumerated during the City of Edmonton Civic Census in the spring of 1987. The population universe designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta outside of the City of Edmonton that could be contacted by direct-dialing. From this population, two samples were drawn to cover the area: the first one represented the City of Calgary, and the second represented the remainder of the region.</universe></sumDscr></stdyInfo><method><dataColl><timeMeth>Cross-sectional</timeMeth><dataCollector>Population Research Laboratory, Department of Sociology, University of Alberta.</dataCollector><frequenc>One-time</frequenc><sampProc>FACE-TO-FACE SAMPLE SELECTION - Edmonton As in previous Edmonton Area Studies, the sampling frame consisted of a computerized list of addresses compiled by the City of Edmonton from their most current enumeration (1987). From the computer tape, a simple random sample of 620 addresses for personal interviewing was selected. Nursing homes, military and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the one hour interview. Interviewers were instructed to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents within their allotment of interviews. As adult males are generally more difficult to contact, the following selection procedure guidelines were set for the interviewers to assist them in obtaining their quotas. a. The dwelling unit must be the person's usual place of residence and he/she must be 18 years of age or older. b. If an adult male answers the door and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. c. If an adult female answers the door and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male. If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female. d. If an adult female answers the door and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent. The final sex breakdown of the sample, using the above procedures, was 49.1% male and 50.9% female. TELEPHONE SAMPLE SELECTION - Calgary The three-digit prefixes of the exchanges in Calgary were assembled to generate seven-digit telephone numbers. This was done in two stages: First, an exchange was randomly selected, then a four-digit random number between 0000 and 9999 was selected and appended to the three-digit number of the exchange. This process was repeated to obtain as many telephone numbers as needed. Any duplicates were discarded. The telephone numbers were then checked against the most recent edition of the "Calgary Numerical and Street Address Directory" to eliminate businesses and numbers in non-existent telephone banks. TELEPHONE SAMPLE SELECTION - Other Alberta Areas The three-dig&#xd;
it exchange prefixes were not used for selection for "Other Alberta Areas" since no "reverse directory" was available for these areas to screen out the large number of non-working numbers that would be generated. Therefore, a different approach was implemented to reduce the occurrence of non-working numbers. Over the past two years the PRL has developed a computer file of telephone numbers from these areas from Alberta Government Telephones (AGT) directories. This file represented 13 percent of the total telephone numbers in the sampling area at the time of survey. The file has been updated by selecting random pages from newly issued directories, and recording a fixed percentage of the total number of columns of telephone numbers in a computer file. By stripping off the last two digits of each telephone number and eliminating any duplicates, a new file of five-digit working banks of telephone numbers was created. These working banks were then added to the previously existing bank file, and duplicates were again eliminated. This new file was then used for randomly generating the actual telephone numbers for the study. The sample of telephone numbers was generated by selecting with replacement a simple random sample of five-digit banks, and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each of them. All duplicated numbers were discarded. As with the face-to-face interviewers, the telephone interviewers were given instructions to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents. Again, as adult males are generally more difficult to contact, the selection procedure guidelines were exactly the same as they were to the face-to-face interviewing.</sampProc><sources/><collMode>Face-to-face and telephone interviews.</collMode><resInstru>Survey</resInstru><weight>The weighting factors used for the 1988 survey are as follows: Edmonton .660709, Calgary .925702, and Other Alberta 1.427409.</weight><cleanOps>The raw data file exists in card image format and is stored on magnetic tape.
