Questions asked related to the respondent's residential history, factors considered in choosing the city and present residence as a place to live, present views of the city and future residential plans. As in the past faculty members and outside agencies submitted a variety of questions to make up the composite amalgam questionnaire. In addition, the questionnaire contained a number of replicated questions from previous EAS studies.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="1981-02">1981-02</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="1981-03">1981-03</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="1981-02">1981-02</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="1981-03">1981-03</collDate><dataKind>Microdata</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Alberta</geogCover><geogUnit>Province</geogUnit><universe>Population The 1981 Edmonton Area Study population universe was designated as all dwelling units that were enumerated during the City of Edmonton's annual civic census in the spring of 1980. Sampling As in the previous two studies the Edmonton Area Study used as its sampling frame a computerized list of addresses compiled by the City of Edmonton from their most recent enumera&#xd;
tion (1980). From the computer tape a simple random sample of 534 addresses for personal interviewing was selected. Nursing homes and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. The household was the primary sampling unit. Within the household one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the one hour interview. A person was eligible to be the respondent if the dwelling was his usual place of residence and he was 18 years of age and older. Interviewers were instructed with their allotment of interviews to try to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents. As adult males are generally more difficult to contact set guideline selection procedures were given to the interviewers to assist them in obtaining their quotas.</universe></sumDscr></stdyInfo><method><dataColl><sources/></dataColl><anlyInfo/></method><dataAccs><setAvail/><useStmt/></dataAccs><othrStdyMat/></stdyDscr><otherMat ID="f4856" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4856" level="datafile"><labl>1981EdmontonAreaSurvey_Codebook.pdf</labl><txt>Questionnaire and Codebook</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">application/pdf</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f4858" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4858" level="datafile"><labl>1981EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab</labl><txt>Data File</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">text/tab-separated-values</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f4857" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4857" level="datafile"><labl>1981EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf</labl><txt>Methodology Report</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">application/pdf</notes></otherMat></codeBook>
