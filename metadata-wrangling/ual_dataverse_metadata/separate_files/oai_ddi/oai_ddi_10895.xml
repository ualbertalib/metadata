and treatment of radial head subluxation, could successfully reduce radial head subluxation at a rate similar to physicians. Given the practical constraints at  the time of emergency department triage, this study was designed as a cluster randomized trial where the unit of randomization was a day and the patients on any given day were assigned to the nurse or physician arm for the entire day.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="2007-09">2007-09</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="2010-12">2010-12</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="2009-10">2009-10</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="2010-12">2010-12</collDate><dataKind>Clinical data</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Ottawa</geogCover><geogCover>Ontario</geogCover><anlyUnit>Individual</anlyUnit><universe>Children up to 6 years old with a physical exam consistent with radial head subluxation (RHS) which includes not using the affected limb, holding the elbow in extension or slight flexion, forearm in pronation, and patient is distressed only on elbow movement.

We have conservatively estimated a physician success at reduction of 90%. Using a 90% success rate, a 10 %, non-inferiority margin, a type I error=0.05, and power of 80%, 112 patients are needed in each study arm, with a total target of 224 study participants.

Patient age, sex, arm injured, time and mechanism of injury were prospectively collected on all patients. Nurse initiated treatment: The triage nurse recorded the time of the attempt, outcome (success/failure) of reduction attempt, and if relevant, time of normal arm usage, for each reduction attempt. If the patient used the arm normally the physician recorded their discharge assessment. If the patient did not use their arm normally, the physician recorded their training level, time, method, and outcome (success/failure) of each reduction attempt as well as time of normal arm usage. Physician initiated treatment: The physician recorded their level of training, time, method and outcome of each reduction attempt, as well as time of normal arm usage. Other measures: Final diagnosis, discharge time, follow-up recommended, investigations ordered and their results (such as x-rays) were abstracted from the ED chart by the study coordinator. As well a copy of every patient's ED chart was kept in the ED for 4 days after a child's discharge and the study coordinator reviewed these to determine how many patients had a final diagnosis of pulled elbow and were enrolled in the study and how many were missed at triage.</collSitu><actMin>Daily chart reviews ensured that all relevant patients were captured.</actMin><conOps>Data collection sheets were compared to charts daily to ensure accuracy and consistency.</conOps></dataColl><anlyInfo/></method><dataAccs><setAvail><accsPlac>Data is located at the CHEO Research Institute and on Dr. Dixon's hard drive.</accsPlac></setAvail><useStmt><conditions>Access to deidentified data may be permitted for external researchers, with limitations.
