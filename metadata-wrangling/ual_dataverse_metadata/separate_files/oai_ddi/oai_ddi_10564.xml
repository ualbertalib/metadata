This random sample survey of households in the province of Alberta has enabled academic researchers, local community agencies, and government departments to explore a broad spectrum of social issues in an on-going research framework in Alberta.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="1989-02">1989-02</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="1989-02">1989-02</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="1989-02-05">1989-02-05</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="1989-02-28">1989-02-28</collDate><dataKind>Microdata</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Alberta</geogCover><geogUnit>Province</geogUnit><anlyUnit>Individual</anlyUnit><universe>The 1989 Edmonton population universe was designated as all persons 18 years of age or older who at the time of the survey were living in a dwelling unit that was enumerated during the City of Edmonton Civic Census in the spring of 1987. The population universe designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta outside of the City of Edmonton that could be contacted by direct-dialing. From this population, two samples were drawn to cover the area: the first one represented the City of Calgary, and the second represented the remainder of the region.</universe></sumDscr></stdyInfo><method><dataColl><timeMeth>Cross-sectional.</timeMeth><dataCollector>Population Research Laboratory, Department of Sociology, University of Alberta</dataCollector><frequenc>One-time data collection</frequenc><sampProc>As in previous Edmonton Area Studies, the sampling frame consisted of a computerized list of addresses compiled by the City of Edmonton from their most current enumeration (1987). From the computer tape, a simple random sample of 620 addresses was selected for personal interviewing. Nursing homes, military and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the one hour interview. Interviewers were instructed to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents within their allotment of interviews. As adult males are generally more difficult to contact, the following selection procedure guidelines were set for the interviewers to assist them in obtaining their quotas. The dwelling unit must be the person's usual place of residence and he/she must be 18 years of age or older. If an adult male answers the door and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. If an adult female answers the door and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male. If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female. For the past three studies, the PRL has developed computer files of working five-digit telephone banks covering the whole of Alberta. The samples of telephone numbers for Calgary and Other Alberta Areas were generated from these files by selecting, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected. All duplicate numbers were discarded. As with the face-to-face interviewers, the telephone interviewers were given instructions to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents. Again, as adult males are generally more difficult to contact, the selection procedur&#xd;
e guidelines were exactly the same as they were with the face-to-face interviewing.</sampProc><sources/><collMode>Telephone and face-to-face interviews.</collMode><resInstru>Survey</resInstru><actMin>A random sample of completed interviews (15%) were verified through a series of checks which included re-contacting respondents by telephone. Any significant discrepancies or irregularities were investigated and rectified. The telephone data collection took four weeks, with 69% of the interviewing being completed during the first two weeks. The average interviewer completed 62 interviews. Fifteen percent of the completed interviews were verified.
