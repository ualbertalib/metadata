The PRL specializes in the gathering, analysis, and presentation of data about demographic, social and public issues.  The PRL research team provide&#xd;
s expert consultation and implementation of quantitative and qualitative research methods, project design, sample design, web-based, paper-based and telephone surveys, field site testing, data analysis and report writing. The PRL follows scientifically rigorous and transparent methods in each phase of a research project. Research Coordinators are members of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and use best practices when conducting all types of research.The PRL has particular expertise in conducting computer-assisted telephone interviews (referred to as CATI surveys). When conducting telephone surveys, all calls are displayed as being from the “U of A PRL,” a procedure that assures recipients that the call is not from a telemarketer, and thus helps increase response rates. The PRL maintains a complement of highly skilled telephone interviewers and supervisors who are thoroughly trained in FOIPP requirements, respondent selection procedures, questionnaire instructions, and neutral probing. A subset of interviewers are specially trained to convince otherwise reluctant respondents to participate in the study, a practice that increases response rates and lowers selection bias. PRL staff monitors data collection on a daily basis to allow any necessary adjustments to the volume and timing of calls and respondent selection criteria   The Population Research Laboratory (PRL) administered the 2012 Alberta Survey. This survey of households across the province of Alberta continues to enable academic researchers, government departments, and non-profit organizations to explore a wide range of topics in a structured research framework and environment. Sponsors’ research questions are asked together with demographic questions in a telephone interview of Alberta households.   This data consists of the information from 1210 Alberta residence, interviewed between July 3, 2012 and July 18, 2012. The amount of responses indicates that the response rate, as calculated percentages representing the number of people who participated in the survey divided by the number selected in the eligible sample, was 33.6% for survey A.    The subject areas included in the 2012 Alberta Survey B includes socio-demographic and background variables such as: household composition, age, gender, marital status, highest level of education, household income, religion, ethnic background, place of birth, employment status, home ownership, political party support and perceptions of financial status. In addition, this survey includes Albertan's opinions regarding the physical activity and China's role in Canada's economy.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="2012-07">2012-07</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="2012-07">2012-07</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="2012-07-03">2012-07-03</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="2012-07-18">2012-07-18</collDate><dataKind>Microdata</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Alberta</geogCover><geogUnit>Province</geogUnit><anlyUnit>Individuals</anlyUnit><universe>This data consists of information collected from 1210 respondents (607 female and 603 male). over the age of 18.

CATI interviewers collected data at the University of Alberta. Interviews were conducted between the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Mondays through Fridays; 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturdays; and between 2:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on Sundays.Additionally, the intended time to administer each survey was less than 30 minutes, but the average time spent administering the survey was 20 minutes.</timeMeth><sampProc>The Albert Survey A instrument had three components: (1) a standardized introduction; (2) questions that reflected the specific research interests of the University researchers and external sponsors participating in the study; and (3) demographic questions. The demographic section was replicated from 2011 Alberta Survey questionnaires.    The main feature of the sampling design was a two-stage selection process: first, based on a selection of households, and second, the selection of a respondent within each household. The Alberta Survey aimed for a total sample size of 1200 households across Alberta, with a minimum of 400 respondents in Metropolitan Edmonton, 400 in Metropolitan Calgary, and 400 from the remainder of the province (other Alberta). The target population was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit that could be contacted by direct dialling.   The PRL used a Random-Digit Dialling (RDD) approach to ensure that respondents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory. The PRL has developed a database of eight-digit telephone banks covering the Edmonton and Calgary metropolitan areas, as well as the remainder of the province. The 2012 Alberta Survey sample was generated from these databases by using a computer program to select, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected. Duplicate telephone numbers were purged from the computer list. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent.   Nine sponsors submitted questions for the Alberta Survey in 2012. The PRL created two separate questionnaires, Survey A and Survey B, to maintain an average interview length of less than 30 minutes. Survey A and B questionnaires consisted of different topics for various sponsors. The PRL administered surveys A and B during the same time period using identical procedures. The PRL Research Analyst checked the randomly generated contact telephone numbers before calling to ensure no telephone number would be contacted by both surveys. Moreover, data was collected through a electronic questionanaire which allowed the interviewers to key responses directly into the computers. This ensured that conintually monitoring of the closed-eneded responses was possible. Ten percent of the respondents were randomly selected and re-contacted by the telephone supervisor for interviewing validation (n=120). A respondent within each household was selected on the basis of gender using the following selection guidelines to ensure an equal selection of male and female participants.   Some considerations when selecting the individuals interviewed:   a. He/she must be 18 years of age or older.  b. If an adult male answers the phone and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent.  c. If an adult female answers the phone and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male. If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female.  d. If an adult female answers the phone and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent.  e. If the quota for females is full and a female answers the phone, provided the household has an eligible male, make an appointment to interview the male.   The final sample of 1,210 respondents consisted of 607 females and 603 males.   In terms of sample error, this study is based on a sample of adults in Alberta rather than the total population of adults in Al&#xd;
berta. All of the descriptive statistics, such as means and percentages, which are calculated using the sample data, could be subject to sampling error. The sampling error is a measure of the validity of the descriptive statistics that are observed in a sample. The estimated sampling error, at the 95% confidence level, for an area sample of 1,210 households assuming a 50/50 binomial percentage distribution is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Survey estimates for the sub-sample of 400 are estimated to be within plus or minus 5.0 percentage points, at the 95% confidence level.</sampProc><sources/><collMode>Questionnaire administered through 30- station CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing) system installed on a local area network at the Population Research Laboratory. At the end of the interviewing period, verbatim responses were coded into numeric responses with the coding frames that were either developed by the PRL in previous years or provided by the sponsor. The open-ended codes were then merged with the main SPSS data file for additional cleaning and labelling.</collMode><weight>The sample sizes of completed interviews obtained for Metropolitan Edmonton, Metropolitan Calgary, and Other Alberta are not always proportional to the current Alberta population they are meant to represent.
