In addition to the general theme, a "special topics" section annually features a focus on a particular subtheme. This year the special focus was on family life.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="1980">1980</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="1980">1980</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="1980">1980</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="1980">1980</collDate><dataKind>Microdata</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Alberta</geogCover><geogUnit>Province</geogUnit><universe>Sampling Design Population The 1980 Edmonton Area Study (EAS) population universe was designated as all dwelling units that were enumerated during the City of Edmonton's annual civic census in the spring of 1979. Sampling Frame The 1980 EAS used as a sampling frame a computerized list of addresses compiled by the City of Edmonton from their 1979 civic census. From the computer tape a simple random sample of 560 addresses for personal face to face interviewing was selected by means of a special computer program written for this purpose. Nursing homes and student residences were deleted from the sample. The household was the primary sampling unit. Within the household one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the one hour interview. A person was eligible to be the respondent if (1) the dwelling was his usual place of residence; and (2) the person was 18 years of age and older. Interviewers were instructed with their allotment of interviews to try to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents by using the following guidelines: 1. Request an interview with an adult male who answers the door and meets the eligibility requirements. 2. If an adult female answers the door and there is also an adult male present and both meet eligibility requirements, request an interview with the adult male. If he is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, request an interview with her. 3. If an adult female who is eligible to be the respondent answers the door and there is no adult male present, request an interview with her. The experience of past EAS projects indicated that adult males were more difficult to contact, therefore this selection procedure was implemented. The final distribution of respondent's sex indicated 51.2% were male and 48.8% were female.</universe></sumDscr></stdyInfo><method><dataColl><sources/></dataColl><anlyInfo/></method><dataAccs><setAvail/><useStmt/></dataAccs><othrStdyMat/></stdyDscr><otherMat ID="f4853" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4853" level="datafile"><labl>1980EdmontonAreaSurvey_Codebook.pdf</labl><txt>Questionnaire and Codebook</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">application/pdf</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f4868" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4868" level="datafile"><labl>1980EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data_couple.tab</labl><txt>Data File</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">text/tab-separated-values</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f4855" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4855" level="datafile"><labl>1980EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab</labl><txt>Data File</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">text/tab-separated-values</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f4854" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4854" level="datafile"><labl>1980EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf</labl><txt>Methodology Report</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">application/pdf</notes></otherMat></codeBook>
