Questions under this topic related to the respondent's job history, work characteristics, workplace and work safety. As in the past, faculty members and outside agencies submitted a variety of questions which may or may not have been related to the special topic. In addition, the questionnaire contained a number of replicated questions from previous EAS studies.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="1983-02">1983-02</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="1983-02">1983-02</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="1983-02">1983-02</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="1983-02">1983-02</collDate><dataKind>Microdata</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Alberta</geogCover><geogUnit>Province</geogUnit><universe>Population The 1983 Edmonton Area Study population universe was designated as all persons 18 years of age and older who at the time of the survey were in a dwelling unit that was enumerated during The City of Edmonton Civic Census in the spring of 1982. Sampling As in the previous four studies the 1983 Edmonton Area Study used as its sampling frame a computerized list of addresses compiled by the City of Edmonton from their most recent enumeration (1982). From the computer tape a simple random s&#xd;
ample of 547 addresses for personal interviewing was selected. Nursing homes and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. Within the household one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the one hour interview. Interviewers were instructed to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents within their allotment of interviews. As adult males are generally more difficult to contact, selection procedure guidelines were set for the interviewers to assist them in obtaining their quotas. The sex breakdown of the sample was 54% male and 46% female.</universe></sumDscr></stdyInfo><method><dataColl><sources/></dataColl><anlyInfo/></method><dataAccs><setAvail/><useStmt/></dataAccs><othrStdyMat/></stdyDscr><otherMat ID="f4862" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4862" level="datafile"><labl>1983EdmontonAreaSurvey_Codebook.pdf</labl><txt>Questionnaire and Codebook</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">application/pdf</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f4864" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4864" level="datafile"><labl>1983EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab</labl><txt>Data File</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">text/tab-separated-values</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f4863" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4863" level="datafile"><labl>1983EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf</labl><txt>Methodology Report</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">application/pdf</notes></otherMat></codeBook>
