It is a portion of the 2013 Alberta Survey (doi:10.7939/DVN/10573) conducted by the Population Research Lab, and commissioned by PolicyWise for Children&#xd;
&amp; Families (formerly the Alberta Centre for Child, Family and Community Research).  Eight questions about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) were derived from the original ACE checklist administered through Kaiser Permanente. Questions were modified to reflect the Alberta, Canada environment, the emerging literature on child development, and to be acceptable for a telephone survey. Question modifications included deleting a question about having a parent incarcerated, and adding a question on&#xd;
living with a household member with a chronic medical condition. Questions were pilot tested. Three questions covered abuse, and the remaining five focused on aspects of household risk that can increase dysfunction.&#xd;
