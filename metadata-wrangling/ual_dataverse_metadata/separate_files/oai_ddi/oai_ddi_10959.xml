A 24-hour telephone follow-up assessed for headache recurrence.</frequenc><sampProc>This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial. The treating physician informed patients of the trial at the time a clinical decision was made to treat migraine with an intravenous medication. Patients and parents who gave verbal consent were informed and screened by the research coordinator. Those patients who met inclusion/exclusion criteria, who assented to the study, and whose parents signed consent, were enrolled and randomized to one of two groups: (1) Intravenous metoclopramide with intravenous placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) and (2) Intravenous metoclopramide with intravenous ketorolac. Patient randomization was supported by a web-based randomization system. Patients were allocated using permuted block randomization with variable block sizes at each site. The target number of study participants was 50; the actual number of study participants was 56. Sample size calculations were based on the primary outcome and a two-sided, two-sample t-test for the comparison of group means using PASS analysis software. A sample size of 25 per group achieves 90% power to detect a difference between group means of about 2 cm (1.96 cm), assuming the standard deviation (SD) is 2.1 cm in each group and a two-sided Type I Error of 0.05.</sampProc><sources><dataSrc>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R)</dataSrc></sources><collMode>Pen and paper face-to-face interview; Telephone interview</collMode><collSitu>The emergency research coordinator (RC) at each site was responsible for administering the headache severity measurement tools and other study data collection forms. A short-form standardized score was used to assess for akathisia at the 2 hour time points. The RC recorded the use of rescue medication following the 1-hour assessment while the patient remained in the Emergency Department. A telephone follow-up at 24 hours by a research staff member assessed each patient's headache status and secondary outcome measures.</collSitu><conOps>To conform to CONSORT reporting requirements, a Refused, Missed and Other exclusions (RMO) database was developed. Minimal data was obtained such as time of day, sex, age and Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) level in order to compare the enrolled and non-enrolled patients for clear biases. Paper data collection forms (DCF) are the primary instruments. The research coordinator at the Emergency Department and at the 24-hour follow-up will complete the DCFs and these will be stored in a locked cabinet and office. Data, linked only by study id, will be collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture (EDC) tools hosted by the Women and Children's Health Research Institute, Clinical Research Informatics Core. A random 10% sample of DCFs will be verified for accuracy of data entry. Identifying information about study subjects will be kept confidential and separate from the electronic database. All persons with access to the data will have training in health information privacy and have signed privacy agreements.</conOps></dataColl><anlyInfo/></method><dataAccs><setAvail/><useStmt><conditions>Access to deidentified data may be permitted for external researchers, with limitations.
