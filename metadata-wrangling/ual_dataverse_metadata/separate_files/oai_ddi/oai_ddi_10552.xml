This omnibus style survey of households in the province of Alberta has enabled academic researchers, government departments, non profit organizations, and the pri&#xd;
vate sector to explore a wide range of research topics in a structured research framework.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="1997-11">1997-11</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="1998-01">1998-01</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="1997-11-20">1997-11-20</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="1998-01-03">1998-01-03</collDate><dataKind>Microdata</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Alberta</geogCover><geogUnit>Province</geogUnit><anlyUnit>Individual</anlyUnit><universe>The targeted population designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta that could be contacted by direct dialing.

Province of Alberta delineated into three areas for telephone interviewing. (1) City of Edmonton. (2) City of Calgary. (3) Remainder of the Province (Other Alberta). b. Two stage selection process. (1) Selection of households. (2) Selection of respondent within each household, To permit the analysis of each area as a separate entity, a minimum sample size of 400 or more for each area of the province was deemed necessary. The targetted population designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta that could be contacted by direct dialing. From this population, three samples were drawn to cover the Alberta: the City of Edmonton (EAS) 1, the City of Calgary, and the rest of the province. A random digit dialing approach was used to ensure that respondents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory. For the past ten years, the PRL has developed and updated a database of five digit telephone banks (i.e. 403 xxx xx) covering all of Alberta. The 1997 area samples were drawn from the telephone database by using a computer program to select, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected. All duplicate telephone numbers were purged from the computer generated list.  Nursing homes and collective dwellings were also deleted from the sample.2  Within the household  one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the twenty minute interview. 1 The Edmonton sample is referred to as the Edmonton Area Study (EAS). Prior to the inception of the Alberta Survey  in 1987, only  the City of Edmonton was annually surveyed. 2  Fifty one percent of the selected numbers represented valid residential households (see Table 2). A respondent was selected within each household on the basis of gender using the following selection guidelines to ensure an equal selection of male and female participants.3 a. The dwelling unit must be the person's usual place of residence and he/she must be 18     years of age or older. b. If an adult male answers the phone and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. c. If an adult female answers the phone and there is an adult male present who is willing to     be interviewed, interview the male. If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the     female is willing, interview the female. d. If an adult female answers the phone and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent.</sampProc><sources/><collMode>Telephone Interviews</collMode><weight>The weighting factors used for the 1997 survey are as follows: Edmonton: 0.711543 Calgary:0.881084 Other Alberta: 1.409404.</weight></dataColl><anlyInfo/></method><dataAccs><setAvail/><useStmt/></dataAccs><othrStdyMat/></stdyDscr><otherMat ID="f4778" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4778" level="datafile"><labl>1997AlbertaSurvey_Codebook.pdf</labl><txt>Questionnaire and Codebook</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">application/pdf</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f4779" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4779" level="datafile"><labl>1997AlbertaSurvey_Data.tab</labl><txt>Data File</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">text/tab-separated-values</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f4799" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4799" level="datafile"><labl>1997AlbertaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf</labl><txt>Methodology Report</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">application/pdf</notes></otherMat></codeBook>
