structured research framework and environment.

The comparison clearly showed that the sample was representative. A similar comparison was made for the Edmonton Area Study in the following tables. In these tables the index of dissimilarity in each table is less than 10%. This indicates that the EAS sample can be regarded as representative.</sampProc><sources/><collMode>Face-to-Face Interviews</collMode><resInstru>Questionnaire</resInstru><cleanOps>The data was cleaned using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) edit program.
