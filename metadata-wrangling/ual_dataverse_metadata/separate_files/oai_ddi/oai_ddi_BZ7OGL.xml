A quota sample of 4645 adults (18+ years), randomly drawn from an online research panel and stratified to match age and sex distributions of adults within and across Canadian provinces, was recruited in June 2018. Participants completed survey items assessing support for harm reduction for people who use drugs (PWUD) and for seven harm reduction interventions. Additional items assessed exposure to media coverage on harm reduction, and scales assessing stigma toward PWUD (α = .72), personal familiarity with PWUD (α = .84), and disease model beliefs about addiction (α = 0.79). Most (64%) Canadians supported harm reduction (provincial estimates = 60% - 73%). Five of seven interventions received majority support, including: outreach (79%), naloxone (72%), drug checking (70%), needle distribution (60%) and supervised drug consumption (55%). Low-threshold opioid agonist treatment and safe inhalation interventions received less support (49% and 44%). Our social exposure model, adjusted for respondent sex, household income, political views, and education, exhibited good fit and accounted for 17% of variance in public support for harm reduction. Personal familiarity with PWUD and disease model beliefs about addiction were directly associated with support (βs = .07 and -0.10, respectively), and indirectly influenced public support via stigmatized attitudes toward PWUD (βs = 0.01 and -0.01, respectively). Strategies to increase support for harm reduction could problematize certain disease model beliefs (e.g., “There are only two possibilities for an alcoholic or drug addict – permanent abstinence or death”) and creating opportunities to reduce social distance between PWUD, the public, and policy makers.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="2018-05-31">2018-05-31</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="2018-06-25">2018-06-25</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="2018-05-31">2018-05-31</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="2018-06-25">2018-06-25</collDate><dataKind>Survey</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba], Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland</geogCover><geogUnit>Province</geogUnit><anlyUnit>Individual</anlyUnit><universe>Canadian, 18+ years old, Ipsos Canadian Online Panel</universe></sumDscr></stdyInfo><method><dataColl><timeMeth>Panel</timeMeth><sampProc>Randomly drawn sample, booster sample</sampProc><targetSampleSize><sampleSize>4645</sampleSize></targetSampleSize><sources/><collMode>Online survey</collMode><resInstru>Structured survey</resInstru><collSitu>Participants were recruited from an online research panel (Ipsos Canadian Online Panel), and the survey methods were designed to produce generalizable estimates of public opinion toward harm reduction at both national and provincial levels using a two-phased sampling procedure. In phase 1, randomly-drawn Canadian adult panel members were invited to participate until a quota sample of 2002 respondents matching the age and sex distributions of Canadian adults (18+ years) residing in each major region of Canada (i.e., BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan/Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland was obtained. In phase 2, a booster sample of 2643 respondents was recruited to oversample individual provinces, i.e., to provide representative estimates for each Canadian province; sampling proceeded until a quota sample matching the age and sex distributions of Canadian adults residing in each of the 10 Canadian provinces was recruited. National and provincial quotas within age and sex strata were based on the 2016 Canadian Census.</collSitu><weight>In order to provide accurate parameter estimates and to avoid errors in calculating variances, survey weights were converted to normalized (relative) weights for each respondent. Relative weights were calculated by dividing the survey weight of a respondent by the mean of all survey weights.</weight></dataColl><anlyInfo><respRate>NA</respRate></anlyInfo></method><dataAccs><notes type="DVN:TOU" level="dv">CC0 Waiver</notes><setAvail/><useStmt/></dataAccs><othrStdyMat><relPubl><citation><biblCit>T.
