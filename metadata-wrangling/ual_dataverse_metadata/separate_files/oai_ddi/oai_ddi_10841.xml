The results from this study could be important for many children receiving medical care, as distraction is safe and the use of iPads is enjoyable for many children.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="2015-10">2015-10</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="2016-12">2016-12</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="2015-10">2015-10</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="2016-10">2016-10</collDate><dataKind>Questionnaire data; Observational data; Audiovisual data; Clinical data</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Edmonton</geogCover><geogCover>Alberta</geogCover><anlyUnit>Individuals</anlyUnit><universe>Patients between 6 and 11 years old who require IV placement at a pediatric emergency department.</universe></sumDscr></stdyInfo><method><dataColl><frequenc>All data is collected just before IV placement, at the time of IV placement, and immediately after IV placement.</frequenc><sampProc>Sample size calculations were conducted using a two-tailed, two-sample Mann-Whitney test for the primary outcome of child-reported pain based on data from our previous trial of music as a distractor for young children undergoing IV insertions. To detect a difference of 2 points on the FPS-R (which is considered clinically important) given a Type I error of 0.05 and 80% power, 40 patients per group is required. We also performed sample size calculations using a two-tailed, two sample t-test, for our other primary outcome of observed behavioural distress using data from our previous trial (i.e., SD=2.77). To detect a large effect size of 0.6 (which we observed in the previous trial) given a Type I error of 0.05 and 80% power, 35 patients per group is required. Recruiting 80 patients overall allows sufficient power to find a difference in both primary outcomes if a difference truly exists.</sampProc><targetSampleSize><sampleSize>80</sampleSize></targetSampleSize><sources><dataSrc>Observed Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised (OSBD-R);  Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R); State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S, Form Y)</dataSrc></sources><collMode>Face-to-face interview; Self-administered questionnaire: Paper;  Observation; Recording; Psychological measurements and tests</collMode><collSitu>Half of the participating children will be given an iPad to use during intravenous placement in addition to standard of care. Children and parents will be able to select their choice of distraction from a selection of games and videos, and they can change their selection as desired during the course of the procedure. The control group will receive standard care, which generally includes the use of topical anesthetic cream. Extra pain score measurements from the child and their caregiver, immediately before and after the intravenous placement, will be collected. The procedure and the child will also be video-taped in order to code the behavioural distress scores afterwards. In addition, parents and health care professionals will also be asked about their satisfaction.</collSitu><conOps>Paper copies will be in a locked filing cabinet in the research assistant's office located within the ED until the end of the study.
