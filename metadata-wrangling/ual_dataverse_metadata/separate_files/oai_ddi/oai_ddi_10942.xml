Scientists know much less, however, about the relationship between prenatal nutrition and health (for the mother and child).  The Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study is a longitudinal, prospective cohort in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada designed to investigate the relationship between maternal nutrient intake/status before, during and after gestation and a) maternal mood, b) birth and obstetric outcomes, and c) infant neurodevelopment.  The data for approximately 5000 participants (2200 pregnant women, their offspring and many of their partners) includes information about maternal nutrition, anthropometric, biological, and mental health data at multiple points in pregnancy and the postpartum period, as well as obstetric, birth, health and neurodevelopment outcomes of these pregnancies and infants. Data from the APrON cohort can be used to answer questions related to prenatal nutrition, health and well-being and how they can impact neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes from infancy to childhood.  Anchor participants were women over 16 years who can understand and answer questions in English, are pregnant for less than 27 weeks and are living in or near Calgary or Edmonton were eligible for recruitment into this study. Associated participants are the biological fathers and offspring resulting from study pregnancies.   At this date this deposit of APrON data includes only the anthropometric measurements and questionnaires of survey mothers at the time of pregnancy and immediately post-partum.&#xd;
