This survey of households across the province of Alberta continues to enable academic researchers, government departments, and non-profit organizations to explore a wide range of topics in a structured research framework and environment. Sponsorsâ€™ research questions are asked together with demographic questions in a telephone interview of Alberta households.

The Alberta Survey A aimed for a total sample size of 1,200 households across Alberta, with a minimum of 400 respondents in Metropolitan Edmonton, 400 in Metropolitan Calgary, and 400 from the remainder of the province (other Alberta). The target population are persons 18 years of age or older. The PRL used a Random-Digit Dialling (RDD) approach for landlines to ensure that respondents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory. The PRL has developed a database of eight-digit telephone banks covering the Edmonton and Calgary metropolitan areas, as well as the remainder of the province. By area, the identified working banks are randomly selected with replacement and a randomly generated set of two digits between 00-99 is appended to each selection. Duplicate telephone numbers were purged from the computer list. Businesses and government exchanges were excluded. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent. In 2016, the sampling frames of telephone numbers included both land lines and cell phones. Cell phone listings were randomly generated by an outside vendor. When a cell phone was reached and the person preferred not to continue for personal, privacy and/or cost reasons, the interview was terminated.</sampProc><sources/><resInstru>Survey</resInstru><weight>The sample sizes of completed interviews obtained for Metropolitan Edmonton, Metropolitan Calgary, and Other Alberta are not always proportional to the current Alberta population they are meant to represent. Therefore, statistical weights were calculated for the 2016 Alberta Survey A sample data using population estimates for 2015.</weight></dataColl><anlyInfo><respRate>Response rates are calculated percentages representing the number of people who participated in the survey divided by the number selected in the eligible sample. The response rate for 2016 Alberta Survey A was 21.1%. The method used in this study is calculated as the number of completed interviews divided by the number of completed interviews, refusals, incompletes, and language problems.</respRate><EstSmpErr>This study is based on a sample of adults in Alberta rather than the total population of adults in Alberta. All of the descriptive statistics, such as means and percentages, which are calculated using the sample data, are subject to sampling error. The sampling error is a measure of the validity of the descriptive statistics that are observed in a sample. The estimated sampling error, at the 95% confidence level, for an area sample of 1,215 households assuming a 50/50 binomial percentage distribution is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Survey estimates for the subsample of 400 are estimated to be within plus or minus 5.0 percentage points, at the 95% confidence level.</EstSmpErr></anlyInfo></method><dataAccs><notes type="DVN:TOU" level="dv">CC0 Waiver</notes><setAvail/><useStmt/></dataAccs><othrStdyMat/></stdyDscr><otherMat ID="f8870" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/8870" level="datafile"><labl>2016AlbertaSurveyAMethodologyReport.pdf</labl><txt>Methodology Report</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">application/pdf</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f8872" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/8872" level="datafile"><labl>2016AlbertaSurveyAPublicRelease.tab</labl><txt>Data File </txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">text/tab-separated-values</notes></otherMat><otherMat ID="f8871" URI="https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/8871" level="datafile"><labl>2016ASAPublicReleaseCodebook.pdf</labl><txt>Questionnaire and Codebook</txt><notes level="file" type="DATAVERSE:CONTENTTYPE" subject="Content/MIME Type">application/pdf</notes></otherMat></codeBook>
