From the computer tape, a simple random sample of 620 addresses was selected for personal interviewing. Nursing homes, military and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the one hour interview. Interviewers were instructed to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents within their allotment of interviews. As adult males are generally more difficult to contact, the following selection procedure guidelines were set for the interviewers to assist them in obtaining their quotas. The dwelling unit must be the person's usual place of residence and he/she must be 18 years of age or older. If an adult male answers the door and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. If an adult female answers the door and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male. If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female. For the past three studies, the PRL has developed computer files of working five-digit telephone banks covering the whole of Alberta. The samples of telephone numbers for Calgary and Other Alberta Areas were generated from these files by selecting, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected. All duplicate numbers were discarded. As with the face-to-face interviewers, the telephone interviewers were given instructions to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents. Again, as adult males are generally more difficult to contact, the selection procedur\r\ne guidelines were exactly the same as they were with the face-to-face interviewing."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Telephone and face-to-face interviews."},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Survey"},{"typeName":"actionsToMinimizeLoss","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A random sample of completed interviews (15%) were verified through a series of checks which included re-contacting respondents by telephone.
