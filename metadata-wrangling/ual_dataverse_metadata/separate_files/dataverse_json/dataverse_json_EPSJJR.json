We used this as the primary criteria and not whether or not the journal title is owned by a Canadian not-for-profit organization. As we are interested primarily in labour, limiting it based on the editorial board was natural for this study.</il><br>\r\n<il><b>Independent</b>: A journal is not affiliated with a commercial publisher (e.g. Springer, Elsevier, Sage, etc.). Non-profits, like Ã‰rudit and University of Toronto Press, were included in the project.</il><br>\r\n<il><b>Scholarly</b>:  defined as a peer-reviewed academic publication that disseminates the results of original scholarship. We have excluded additional student-run journals as per the SSHRC guidelines as well.</il>\r\n<il><b>Active</b>: The journal has published in the last 3 years.</il><br>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second list is of the journals that we removed from our original data collection that did not meet the above criteria when reviewed. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFor more information on the project you can see the presentation slides from the Library Publishing Forum when the initial results were discussed: <a href=\"https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/presentations/7w62fd646?locale=en\">https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/presentations/7w62fd646?locale=en</a> and a forthcoming article in the <i>Journal of Electronic Publishing</i> (May 2020)"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Arts and Humanities","Other"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Scholarly Publishing"}}]},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"productionPlace","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Canada"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Severson, Sarah"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2021-02-03"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-10-01"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2020-04-28"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Codebook that describes the codes for the main list of journals.
