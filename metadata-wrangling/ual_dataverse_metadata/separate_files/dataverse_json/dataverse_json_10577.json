This year the study was expanded with a larger interview schedule and mo\r\nre respondents (341 in 1977 versus 452 in 1978). As this is an amalgam survey, faculty members in the Department of Sociology were canvassed for submissions. There was a strong interest in the study and a broad range of topics were covered (see Appendix A). A concern which was carried over from the 1977 study was that we be able to develop a longitudinal picture of the \"quality of life\" in Edmonton and assess changes that take place in Edmontonians' evaluation of their daily lives. Some questions relating to social well-being asked last year were repeated on this year's study. The comparison of these findings is presented later in this discussion. From last year's study we found that we had put a heavy reliance on attitudinal measures but had spent little time gathering information on behavioural measures. As a result, questions relating to time budgets, social networks, residential mobility and life events were included. In addition, we added measures of objective living conditions (e.g. size of dwelling) and improved our measures of such things as income (this year we included questions on investments and transfer payments, as well as total household income); ethnic background; education; and so on. These measures should provide a much more comprehensive picture of the characteristics of our respondents. An innovation in this year's study was the addition of a \"special topics\" section which allows for a detailed analysis of a specific area of interest. This year's special topic related to \"urban values and included questions on residential characteristics, neighbourhoods, attitudes toward urban growth, and citizen participation strategies."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1978-07"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Arts

In a family household the respondent was usually the husband or the wife. In a non-family household any person over 18 could qualify. A two stage sampling design was used with enumeration areas as the first stage unit. These areas were first stratified according to income to comprise 71 strata (see Figure 1). Excluded enumeration areas were those labelled as hospitals, nurses' residences, nursing homes and military establishments, and those designated as \"new areas\". One enumeration area was selected from each stratum with probability according to size. This resulted in 10% of the city's enumeration areas being selected. From each of the selected enumeration areas a random sample of households was taken from the telephone directory. Statistics Canada, in drawing up their enumeration areas, design them to meet a uniform size requirement. Since 1971 the population growth of the City of Edmonton, particularly in the suburbs, has been enormous, with the result that certain enumeration areas are not of comparable size to the rest. These high growth areas, which could not be stratified by income, were segregated and designated a separate stratum ('new areas'). The number of interviews allocated was proportional to the size of this stratum relative to the current population of the city. Respondents were chosen on a quota basis. The interviewer asked for the male head of the household for the first third of assigned households. Thereafter either a male or a female head was chosen. This procedure was to obtain an approximately equal number of male and female respondents. The main features of the design are as follows: (a) Stratification of enumeration areas by income to reduce sampling error through increased precision. (b) Selection of enumeration areas with probability proportional to size. The clustering effects of these areas may contribute to sampling error. (c) Random selection of households from each selected enumeration area. (d) Selection of respondents so as to obtain an equal number of males and females."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Face-to-Face Interviews"},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Survey"},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The final response rate was 80%."}]}},"files":[{"description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","label":"1978EdmontonAreaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":1351,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":4846,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"1978EdmontonAreaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":387576,"description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","storageIdentifier":"file://6010","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"c7eaaea881c67e4317e0a4fb56a93688","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"c7eaaea881c67e4317e0a4fb56a93688"},"creationDate":"2015-09-10"}},{"description":"Data File","label":"1978EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":1351,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":4848,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"1978EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":394722,"description":"Data File","storageIdentifier":"file://6012","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-por","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Portable","UNF":"UNF:5:oykzdBtjJHfGKr9e4S10Yg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e8c2495df5c9eb00bb0f395be6cde985","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e8c2495df5c9eb00bb0f395be6cde985"},"creationDate":"2015-09-10"}},{"description":"Methodology Report","label":"1978EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":1351,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":4847,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"1978EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":115289,"description":"Methodology Report","storageIdentifier":"file://6011","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"87b2a99aa04548f9635a516e6515ea25","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"87b2a99aa04548f9635a516e6515ea25"},"creationDate":"2015-09-10"}}],"citation":"Population Research Laboratory, 2015, \"Edmonton Area Survey, 1978\", https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/10577, UAL Dataverse, V5"}}
