This study is intended to help understand women's prenatal care experiences in Calgary and identify barriers and facilitators to accessing care.   AOB/F data covers subject areas including: a) Maternal Prenatal Health (e.g., prenatal care, maternal gestation); b) Pregnancy History (e.g., previous pregnancies, previous preterm birth); c) Pre-pregnancy (e.g., pregnancy planning advice received, contraception use, pregnancy intention); d) Health Care Services (e.g., utilization of services for mother and baby); e) Food, Exercise and Housing (e.g., nutrition, housing, neighbourhood safety and cohesion); f) Lifestyle (e.g., T-ACE Screen for alcohol consumption risk, smoking, drugs); g) Social Support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Scale, partner/relationship satisfaction); h) Mental Health (e.g., Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Spielberger State Anxiety Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, optimism [Life Orientation Te\r\nst-Revised]); i) Life Events (e.g., previous mental health, abuse); j) Sociodemographic Outcomes (e.g., age, marital status, education, ethnicity, work status); k) Birth Outcomes - maternal and
