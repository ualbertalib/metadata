Province of Alberta was delineated into three areas for telephone interviewing. (1) Edmonton Metropolitan Area (2) Calgary Metropolitan Area (3) Remainder of the Province (Other Alberta). b. Two-stage selection process. (1) Selection of households. (2) Selection of respondent within each household. To permit the analysis of each area as a separate entity, a minimum sample size of 400 or more for each area of the province was instituted. The target population designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta that could be contacted by direct dialling.  From this population, three samples were drawn to cover Alberta: Edmonton Metropolitan Area, Calgary Metropolitan Area, and the rest of the province. A random-digit dialling approach was used to ensure that respondents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory.  The PRL has developed a database of five-digit telephone banks (e.g. 403/780-xxx-xx) covering all of Alberta.  The database is updated regularly and used for generating the survey sample. The 2002 Alberta Survey sample was drawn from a provincial database by using a computer program to select, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected.  All duplicate telephone numbers were purged from the computer-generated list.  Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent. The mean length of the interview was 23 minutes. A respondent within each household was selected on the basis of gender using the following selection guidelines to ensure an equal selection of male and female participants. a. He/she must be 18 years of age or older. b. If an adult male answers the phone and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. c.\tIf an adult female answers the phone and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male.  If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female. d. If an adult female answers the phone and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Telephone Interviews"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The weighting factors used for the 2002 survey are as follows: Edmonton 0.953003 Calgary 0.984343 Other Alberta 1.063083."}]}},"files":[{"description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","label":"2002AlbertaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":1288,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":4764,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"2002AlbertaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":425002,"description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","storageIdentifier":"file://5927","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"df7b48c7f8c57341997d67bf6dfaf1d7","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"df7b48c7f8c57341997d67bf6dfaf1d7"},"creationDate":"2015-09-03"}},{"description":"Data File","label":"2002AlbertaSurvey_Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":1288,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":4766,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"2002AlbertaSurvey_Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":412092,"description":"Data File","storageIdentifier":"file://5929","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Binary","UNF":"UNF:5:fWy7tb80G6s9lHlgmBGHUQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6df496bf7c24b05c7ee12c4735aca89c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6df496bf7c24b05c7ee12c4735aca89c"},"creationDate":"2015-09-03"}},{"description":"Methodology Report","label":"2002AlbertaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":1288,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":4765,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"2002AlbertaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":359360,"description":"Methodology Report","storageIdentifier":"file://5928","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3e3c6019d65e11cb0451d0e48c2727b1","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3e3c6019d65e11cb0451d0e48c2727b1"},"creationDate":"2015-09-03"}}],"citation":"Population Research Laboratory, 2015, \"Alberta Survey, 2002\", https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/10547, UAL Dataverse, V6"}}
