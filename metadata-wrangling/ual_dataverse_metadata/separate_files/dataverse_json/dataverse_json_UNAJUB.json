first, based on a selection of households, and second, the selection of a respondent within each household. The Alberta Survey B aimed for a total sample size of 1,200 households across Alberta, with a minimum of 400 respondents in Metropolitan Edmonton, 400 in Metropolitan Calgary, and 400 from the remainder of the province (other Alberta). The target population are persons 18 years of age or older. The PRL used a Random-Digit Dialling (RDD) approach for landlines to ensure that respondents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory. The PRL has developed a database of eight-digit telephone banks covering the Edmonton and Calgary metropolitan areas, as well as the remainder of the province. By area, the identified working banks are randomly selected with replacement and a randomly generated set of two digits between 00-99 is appended to each selection. Duplicate telephone numbers were purged from the computer list. Businesses and government exchanges were excluded. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent. In 2016, the sampling frames of telephone numbers included both land lines and cell phones. Cell phone listings were randomly generated by an outside vendor. When a cell phone was reached and the person preferred not to continue for personal, privacy and/or cost reasons, the interview was terminated."},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Survey"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The sample sizes of completed interviews obtained for Metropolitan Edmonton, Metropolitan Calgary, and Other Alberta are not always proportional to the current Alberta population they are meant to represent.

All of the descriptive statistics, such as means and percentages, which are calculated using the sample data, are subject to sampling error.

The estimated sampling error, at the 95% confidence level, for an area sample of 1,208 households assuming a 50/50 binomial percentage distribution is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.
