Those patients who met inclusion/exclusion criteria, who assented to the study, and whose parents signed consent, were enrolled and randomized to one of two groups: (1) Intravenous metoclopramide with intravenous placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) and (2) Intravenous metoclopramide with intravenous ketorolac. Patient randomization was supported by a web-based randomization system. Patients were allocated using permuted block randomization with variable block sizes at each site. The target number of study participants was 50; the actual number of study participants was 56. Sample size calculations were based on the primary outcome and a two-sided, two-sample t-test for the comparison of group means using PASS analysis software. A sample size of 25 per group achieves 90% power to detect a difference between group means of about 2 cm (1.96 cm), assuming the standard deviation (SD) is 2.1 cm in each group and a two-sided Type I Error of 0.05."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Pen and paper face-to-face interview; Telephone interview"},{"typeName":"dataCollectionSituation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The emergency research coordinator (RC) at each site was responsible for administering the headache severity measurement tools and other study data collection forms.

Paper data collection forms (DCF) are the primary instruments. The research coordinator at the Emergency Department and at the 24-hour follow-up will complete the DCFs and these will be stored in a locked cabinet and office. Data, linked only by study id, will be collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture (EDC) tools hosted by the Women and Children's Health Research Institute, Clinical Research Informatics Core. A random 10% sample of DCFs will be verified for accuracy of data entry. Identifying information about study subjects will be kept confidential and separate from the electronic database.
