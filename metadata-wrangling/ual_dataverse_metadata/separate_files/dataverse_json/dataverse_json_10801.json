Eight questions about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) were derived from the original ACE checklist administered through Kaiser Permanente. Questions were modified to reflect the Alberta, Canada environment, the emerging literature on child development, and to be acceptable for a telephone survey. Question modifications included deleting a question about having a parent incarcerated, and adding a question on\r\nliving with a household member with a chronic medical condition. Questions were pilot tested. Three questions covered abuse, and the remaining five focused on aspects of household risk that can increase dysfunction.\r\n<br><br><strong>These metadata are also available through SAGE's searchable metadata website:<br>\r\nhttp://sagemetadata.policywise.com/nada/index.php/catalog/3</strong>"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Adverse experience"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Childhood experience"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Health"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Stress"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Life change events"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LCSH"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Childhood and Youth"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LCSH"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Population Research Lab"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Department of Sociology, University of Alberta"},"producerAbbreviation":{"typeName":"producerAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PRL"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.prl.ualberta.ca/"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"},{"typeName":"productionPlace","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Edmonton, Alberta"},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PolicyWise for Children & Families"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Secondary Analysis to Generate Evidence"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PolicyWise for Children & Families"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"SAGE"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.policywise.com/initiatives/sage"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-05-25"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-06-18"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-07-23"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Computer-assisted telephone survey"]},{"typeName":"software","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"softwareName":{"typeName":"softwareName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"SPSS"}}]},{"typeName":"relatedMaterial","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Parent Survey: Alberta Survey 2013 (doi: 10.7939/DVN/10573)"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Canada"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Edmonton, Alberta; Calgary, Alberta; Other parts of Alberta"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Individual"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Individuals over 18 years of age who could be contacted by direct dialing.
