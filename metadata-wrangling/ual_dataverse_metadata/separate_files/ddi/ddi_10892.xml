The investigators are interested to see if those patients with documented middle ear effusions, as determined by tympanometry, have higher rates of eventual antibiotic usage than those with normal tympanometry results. If there is a significant disparity between those with a positive tympanogram and those without the investigators may be able to identify a group that will benefit from antibiotics and a group that would not need treatment.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="2013-10">2013-10</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="2017-06">2017-06</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="2013-10">2013-10</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="2016-10">2016-10</collDate><dataKind>Questionnaire data; Administrative data; Clinical data</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Edmonton</geogCover><geogCover>Alberta</geogCover><anlyUnit>Individuals</anlyUnit><universe>All children, aged 6 months to 16 years with clinically diagnosed Otitis Media presenting to the Pediatric Emergency Department at Stollery Children's Hospital who will be treated with the standard delayed ant&#xd;

A logistic regression will be performed using antibiotic use in 7 days as the dependent variable. Given 4 independent variables, the investigators need at least 40 (80 would be ideal) subjects who fill the antibiotic prescription. Enrolling 137 patients would give an alpha and beta each of 0.05, and would allow investigators to do Chi Squared test looking at a two by two table of Antibiotic (Yes or No) vs Tympanometry Graph (Type B vs other).</sampProc><targetSampleSize><sampleSize>137</sampleSize></targetSampleSize><sources><dataSrc>Acute Otitis Media-Severity of Symptom Scale (AOM-SOS)</dataSrc></sources><collMode>Face-to-face interview; Telephone interview; Physical measurements and tests; Database review</collMode><actMin>Study participants are phoned at day 3 and day 8.</actMin><conOps>Data validation is built into the REDCap data collection form</conOps><cleanOps>Once the analysis is ready to be done, the names, health care numbers and phone numbers will be stripped from the files.
