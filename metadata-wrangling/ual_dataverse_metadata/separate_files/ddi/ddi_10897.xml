If this dysfunction is allowed to progress, the kidneys may be damaged irreversibly. Hence, it is important to recognize this early and to monitor it frequently.  The tests that are available to do this have several problems. One is serum creatinine level is not very accurate, has many problems and has been shown to overestimate kidney function in children like you with transplantation. It also takes time to increase thus delaying the diagnosis.  Another test, the gold standard GFR-renal scan, uses radioisotope, is time consuming, and requires intravenous access, thus is used once a year.  Serum cystatin C is a protein that is naturally present in the blood of everyone. This research study tested if measuring serum cystatin C is an accurate way to measure kidney function by comparing it to GFR- renal scan.</abstract><sumDscr><timePrd cycle="P1" event="start" date="2010-09">2010-09</timePrd><timePrd cycle="P1" event="end" date="2013-06">2013-06</timePrd><collDate cycle="P1" event="start" date="2010-03">2010-03</collDate><collDate cycle="P1" event="end" date="2012-07">2012-07</collDate><dataKind>Biosamples; Clinical data</dataKind><nation>Canada</nation><geogCover>Edmonton</geogCover><geogCover>Alberta</geogCover><anlyUnit>Individuals</anlyUnit><universe>Pediatric patients between 2 and 17 years who have had a liver or heart transplant.</universe></sumDscr></stdyInfo><method><dataColl><frequenc>Data was collected once.</frequenc><sampProc>The target number of study participants was 60; the actual number of study participants was 59.</sampProc><targetSampleSize><sampleSize>59</sampleSize></targetSampleSize><sources/><collMode>Physical measurements and tests; Chart review</collMode><collSitu>Study participants had routine blood work and a GFR renal scan. During the routine blood work, additional blood was drawn and analyzed for serum cystatin C using the Siemens N Latex cystatin C assay, automated on the Siemens BN system (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products, Marburg, Germany). The method is a fully automated, particle-enhanced, nephelometric immunoassay. Serum creatinine measurement was analyzed using the Beckman Coulter, Synchron enzymatic method. Charts of children enrolled in the study were assessed to obtain demographic data and laboratory data. Of the 62 children enrolled in this study, 59 (31 female, 28 male) were included in the final analysis. Two were excluded from analysis as they were unable to complete the GFR renal scan due to inability to initiate and maintain venous access for isotope injection and blood sampling. One was excluded due to loss of the collected sample.</collSitu></dataColl><anlyInfo/></method><dataAccs><setAvail/><useStmt><conditions>Access to the data is limited to selected members of the research team.</conditions></useStmt></dataAccs><othrStdyMat><relPubl><citation><titlStmt><IDNo agency="doi">10.1111/petr.12381.</IDNo></titlStmt><biblCit>Gowrishankar M, VanderPluym C, Robert C, Bamforth F, Gilmour S, Senthilselvan A.
