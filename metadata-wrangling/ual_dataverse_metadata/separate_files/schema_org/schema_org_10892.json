The investigators are interested to see if those patients with documented middle ear effusions, as determined by tympanometry, have higher rates of eventual antibiotic usage than those with normal tympanometry results. If there is a significant disparity between those with a positive tympanogram and those without the investigators may be able to identify a group that will benefit from antibiotics and a group that would not need treatment."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","tympanometry","otitis media","antibiotics","observational studies","cohort studies","pediatrics","acoustic impedance tests","treatment","acute otitis media"],"temporalCoverage":["2013-10/2017-06"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Department of Pediatrics SEED Funding Grant"}],"spatialCoverage":["Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"]}
