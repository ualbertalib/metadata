It is a follow up of the 2008 Benchmark Survey (doi:10.7939/DVN/10810), providing both an update/refresh of previous findings and the opportunity to ask additional questions. The original survey in 2008 was adapted from \"What Grown-Ups Know About Child Development: A National Benchmark Study\". Not all questions in the 2008 survey were repeated in this 2013 survey, and many more questions were added. Participants were individuals who at the time of the survey were 18 years of age or older and residents of Alberta, who could be contacted by direct dialing of residential numbers, and who had had interaction with a child under the age of 14 years in the past 6 months. Subjects areas covered include:1. Understanding of child development 2. Opinions about child-related issues such as breastfeeding and child care 3. Use of parenting supports 4. Parenting confidence 5. Children's physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep habits 6.
