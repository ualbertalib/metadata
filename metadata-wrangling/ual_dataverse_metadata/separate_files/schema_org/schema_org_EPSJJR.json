The data was collected between October 2019 - April 2020, and reviewed and updated in July-August 2020.  For the purposes of this project, the following inclusion criteria were used:  Canadian: a minimum of one-third of the core editorial board is affiliated with an eligible Canadian post-secondary institution. We used this as the primary criteria and not whether or not the journal title is owned by a Canadian not-for-profit organization. As we are interested primarily in labour, limiting it based on the editorial board was natural for this study. Independent: A journal is not affiliated with a commercial publisher (e.g. Springer, Elsevier, Sage, etc.). Non-profits, like Ã‰rudit and University of Toronto Press, were included in the project. Scholarly: defined as a peer-reviewed academic publication that disseminates the results of original scholarship. We have excluded additional student-run journals as per the SSHRC guidelines as well. Active: The journal has published in the last 3 years.   The second list is of the journals that we removed from our original data collection that did not meet the above criteria when reviewed.
