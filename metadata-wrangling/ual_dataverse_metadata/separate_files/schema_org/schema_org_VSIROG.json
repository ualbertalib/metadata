We traced roots from boles and confirmed their identity to be aspen by taste-testing. Sampled roots were put on ice after collection and transported to the University of Alberta the same day and stored at -20 °C prior to processing. Aspen roots were thawed and washed free of adhering soil. Fine roots (< 1 mm in diameter) were retained, cut into 1 cm fragments, mixed thoroughly in a dish of water, and subsampled for DNA sequencing of AM and EM fungal communities using Illumina. The ITS1 and SSU regions of fungal rDNA were separately amplified in two-step PCRs using primers ITS1F - ITS2 and WANDA - AML2, respectively. James Franklin performed benchwork and Joseph Birch performed bioinformatics."],"keywords":["Other"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset","text":"CC0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"ITS1_ASVs-1.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":542443,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16784"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"ITS1_ASVs_metadata.txt","fileFormat":"text/plain","contentSize":2412,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16781"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"ITS1_ASVs.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":601099,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16778"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"SSU_ASVs-1.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":698596,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16779"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"SSU_ASVs_metadata.txt","fileFormat":"text/plain","contentSize":2477,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16782"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"SSU_ASVs.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":758212,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16780"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Subsample_codes_for_ITS1_SSU.txt","fileFormat":"text/plain","contentSize":766,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16783"}]}
