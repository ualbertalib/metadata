This random sample survey of households in the province of Alberta has enabled academic research ers, local community agencies, and government departments to explore a broad spectrum of social issues in an on-going research framework. Owing to the large number of questions submitted by researchers and organizations, the 1995 Alberta Survey was conducted in three segments. Three independent samples were drawn and administered separate questionnaires."],"keywords":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences","Public opinion--Alberta","Social surveys--Alberta","Alberta--Social conditions--Statistics","Alberta--Economic conditions--Statistics","demographics","health","hantavirus","medical research","environmental health","euthanasia","education","employment","unions","crime","economy","budget cuts"],"temporalCoverage":["1995-02/1995-04"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"spatialCoverage":["Canada","Alberta"],"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1995aAlbertaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":566748,"description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4780"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1995aAlbertaSurvey_Data.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":645066,"description":"Data File","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4781"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1995aAlbertaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":209096,"description":"Methodology Report","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4801"}]}
