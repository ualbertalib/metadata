This random sample survey of households in the province of Alberta has enabled academic researchers, government departments, non-profit organizations, and the private sector to explore a wide range of public policy issues in an on-going research framework. Owing to the large number of questions submitted by researchers and organizations, the omnibus Alberta Survey was conducted during two time periods in 1996. Independent samples were drawn and separate questionnaires were administered by telephone interviewers."],"keywords":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences","Public opinion -- Alberta","Social surveys -- Alberta","Alberta -- Social conditions -- Statistics","Alberta -- Economic conditions -- Statistics","sociodemographics","physical activity","exercise","Edmonton","municipal government","smoking","tobacco","bad breath","crime","victimization","social anxiety","reproductive health","palliative care","cancer","HIV","AIDS","condoms","disability"],"temporalCoverage":["1996-12/1997-01"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"spatialCoverage":["Canada","Alberta"],"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1996bAlbertaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":491851,"description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4832"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1996bAlbertaSurvey_Data.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":713112,"description":"Data File","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4833"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1996bAlbertaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":237585,"description":"Methodology Report","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4831"}]}
