With growing numbers of such children in our society, especially in our inner cities, this research is timely and has the promise of offering a cost effective and efficient way to address this social issue. This pilot study is desighed to precede Phase 1 of a 2-Phase study-- to compare two readily available community-based early intervention programs designed to improve menta health outcomes for at risk infants and their caregivers. Two intervention groups will receive regular home visits and/or telephone supervision by either advanced clinical practitioners (ACP) or by volunteer foster grandmothers and these will be compared with a control group receiving normally available postpartum care. Phase 1 interventions will begin at birth and continue throughout the infants' first 18 months of life. Phase 2 will focus on the infants' development through 3 years of age."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences","psychosocial risk","intervention","mental health","infants","low resource mothers"],"temporalCoverage":["1996-04-01/1997-12-30"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset","text":"CC0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"S10_PsychosocialRisk_full_metadata_v1.0.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":750535}]}
