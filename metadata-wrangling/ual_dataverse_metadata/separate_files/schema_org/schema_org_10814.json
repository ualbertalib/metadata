Despite this, 33% of Canadians believe that mental health problems are rare, and 42% of Canadians would not want to reveal that they had a mental illness. The What Albertans Know About Youth Mental Health 2010 Survey is a computer-assisted telephone survey of Alberta adults conducted in 2010 by the Population Research Lab as part of the 2010 Alberta Survey (doi:10.7939/DVN/10008). Questions commissioned by PolicyWise for Children & Families (formerly the Alberta Centre for Child, Family and Community Research) aimed to better understand public knowledge and attitudes towards youth and mental health in the hopes of informing strategies to improve mental health literacy.
