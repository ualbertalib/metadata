Unlike traditional static analysis tools, a JIT analysis tool presents warnings to code developers over time, providing the most relevant results quickly, and computing less relevant results incrementally later. We describe general guidelines for designing JIT analyses. We also present a general recipe for turning static data- flow analyses into JIT analyses through a concept of layered analysis execution illustrated through Cheetah, a JIT taint analysis for Android applications. Our empirical evaluation of Cheetah on real-world applications shows that our approach returns warnings quickly enough to avoid disrupting a developerâ€™s workflow, a finding confirmed by developers in our user study."],"keywords":["static analysis","just-in-time","taint analysis","android","analysis tools"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"jit.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":584309,"description":"Just-in-Time Static Analysis","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/6728"}]}
