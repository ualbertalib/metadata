The search, conducted in January 2015, yielded 3557 scientific journal publications from 2003-2014. I, and a research assistant, extracted variables for each article including: publication source; publication year; number of citations; and author names and institutional affiliations. A research assistant trained in programming used a customized computer program to combine synonymous names of single individuals and separate identical names of different individuals. From this database I generated variables for presence of authors with institutional affiliations in high, middle, or low income countries (World Bank 2016); presence of authors from mega-biodiverse countries (Mittermeier 1997); and whether or not the paper was published in a highly ranked journal. I assigned an income variable using four-categories of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita levels from the World Bank (upper income, >=$12,476; upper middle income, $4,036 to $12,475; lower middle income $1,026 to $4,035; and low income, â‰¤$1,025). I used InCites Journal Citation Reports (Thomson Reuters 2016) to identify the top 10 ranking journals in each field category relevant to DNA barcoding."],"keywords":["Social Sciences","DNA barcoding","bibliometric analysis"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset","text":"CC0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"DNA barcoding publications.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":7703697,"@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/WVRWMV/7SO5KR","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/WVRWMV/7SO5KR","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/8774"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Geary Bubela 2019 Governance of a global genetic resource commons for non-commercial research A case-study of the DNA barcode commons.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":2062332,"description":"Paper published using some of the data in the dataset","@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/WVRWMV/X88ETG","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/WVRWMV/X88ETG","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/10465"}]}
