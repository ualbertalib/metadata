Given the practical constraints at the time of emergency department triage, this study was designed as a cluster randomized trial where the unit of randomization was a day and the patients on any given day were assigned to the nurse or physician arm for the entire day."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","nurse treatment","emergency departments","dislocations","wounds and injuries","pediatrics","randomized controlled trial","radial head subluxation","pulled elbow"],"citation":[{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"Dixon A, Clarkin C, Barrowman N, Correll R, Osmond MH, Plint AC.
