As well, the survey aimed to obtain information about Albertans' beliefs about child care and children's issues, where parents obtained information about child development, and what parenting strategies they used. Individuals living in Alberta and over the age of 18 were eligible if they had contact with a child under the age of 14 within 6 months and had a phone that could be accessed by random direct dialing.
