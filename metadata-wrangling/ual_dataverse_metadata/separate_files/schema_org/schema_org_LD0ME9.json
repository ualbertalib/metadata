We traced roots from boles and confirmed their identity to be aspen by taste-testing. Sampled roots were put on ice after collection and transported to the University of Alberta the same day and stored at -20 °C prior to processing. Aspen roots were thawed and washed free of adhering soil. Fine roots (< 1 mm in diameter) were retained, cut into 1 cm fragments, mixed thoroughly in a dish of water, and subsampled for scoring roots for mycorrhizal colonization. Justine Karst scored roots for ectomycorrhizal colonization and James Franklin scored roots for arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization."],"keywords":["Other"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset","text":"CC0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Mycorrhizal colonization-1.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":2386,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16765"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Mycorrhizal colonization_metadata.txt","fileFormat":"text/plain","contentSize":701,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16763"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Mycorrhizal colonization.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":1661,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16764"}]}
