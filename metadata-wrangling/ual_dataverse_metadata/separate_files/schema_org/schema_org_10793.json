This study is intended to help understand women's prenatal care experiences in Calgary and identify barriers and facilitators to accessing care. AOB/F data covers subject areas including: a) Maternal Prenatal Health (e.g., prenatal care, maternal gestation); b) Pregnancy History (e.g., previous pregnancies, previous preterm birth); c) Pre-pregnancy (e.g., pregnancy planning advice received, contraception use, pregnancy intention); d) Health Care Services (e.g., utilization of services for mother and baby); e) Food, Exercise and Housing (e.g., nutrition, housing, neighbourhood safety and cohesion); f) Lifestyle (e.g., T-ACE Screen for alcohol consumption risk, smoking, drugs); g) Social Support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Scale, partner/relationship satisfaction); h) Mental Health (e.g., Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Spielberger State Anxiety Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, optimism [Life Orientation Te st-Revised]); i) Life Events (e.g., previous mental health, abuse); j) Sociodemographic Outcomes (e.g., age, marital status, education, ethnicity, work status); k) Birth Outcomes - maternal and delivery (e.g. site of birth, delivery type, medication, delivery support); l) Birth Outcomes -infant (e.g., sex, birth weight, gestational age); m) Baby Health/Development (e.g., doctor, check-up, vaccinations); n) Parenting/ Postpartum Experiences (e.g. Parenting Morale Index, breastfeeding [Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale], community service utilization)   Searchable metadata can also be found on the SAGE metadata website: http://sagemetadata.policywise.com/nada/index.php/catalog/1"],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Pregnancy","Prenatal influences","Prenatal care","Maternal health services","Child health services - utilization"],"temporalCoverage":["2007-11/2013-12"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alberta Innovates"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alberta Innovates; Alberta Health Services; Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation; Alberta Health"}],"spatialCoverage":["Canada","Calgary and Area, Alberta"],"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"S01_AOB_metadata_full_v06.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":5695100,"description":"This file includes all element level metadata.","@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/10793/KSVIZX","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/10793/KSVIZX"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"S01_AOB_metadata_noelement_v06.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":643972,"description":"This file includes only study and dataset level metadata (no element level metadata).","@id":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/10793/BBAHHP","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/10793/BBAHHP"}]}
