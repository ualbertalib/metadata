We recruited consecutive infants with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) to undergo ventilatory response testing using exposure to a hypoxic (15% O(2) ) gas mixture during sleep. This population is at high risk of SDB because of smaller airway caliber and abnormal palatal muscle attachments predisposing them to airway obstruction of ranging severity from birth."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","oxygen desaturation","intermittent hypoxia","minute ventilation","infant","cohort studies","pediatrics","cleft palate","cleft lip","hypoxic ventilatory response"],"citation":[{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"MacLean, JE, Tan, S, Fitzgerald, DA and Waters, KA (2013), Assessing ventilatory control in infants at high risk of sleep disordered breathing: A study of infants with cleft lip and/or palate.
