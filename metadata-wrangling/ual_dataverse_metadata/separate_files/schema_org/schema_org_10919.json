CHD patients will be divided into subgroups, based on their cardiac anatomy, to try and identify a level of risk of ciliary dyskinesia within the subgroup of CHD. Each of these sub groups' nNO levels will be compared between groups and against age matched control infants wit hout CHD."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","congenital heart defects","heart diseases","cardiovascular abnormalities","cardiovascular diseases","congenital abnormalities","nitric oxide","infants","pediatrics","congenital heart diseases","primary ciliary dyskinesia"],"temporalCoverage":["2015-09/2016-10"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI)"}],"spatialCoverage":["Canada","Edmonton, Alberta"],"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Ryerson_Nitric_Oxide_consent.doc","fileFormat":"application/msword","contentSize":44544,"description":"Parent information sheet and consent form for Nasal Nitric Oxide Levels in Infants With and Without Congenital Heart Disease","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/6834"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Ryerson_Nitric_Oxide_protocol_May262015.docx","fileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","contentSize":16430,"description":"Protocol information for Nasal Nitric Oxide Levels in Infants With and Without Congenital Heart Disease","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/6835"}]}
