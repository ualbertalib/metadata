The Provincial Heart Health Surveys were conducted as part of the Canadian Heart Health Initiative and have been a collaborative effort among provincial departments of health, Health Canada and The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. The origin of the collaborative approach to cardiovascular disease prevention (CVD) lies in a report prepared by the Federal Provincial Working Group on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Control. The Canadian Heart Health Database consists of two sets of integrated data: core information collected by all ten provincial surveys, and family history information collected by only four provinces â€” Quebec, Ontario Saskatchewan and Alberta. The objective of the surveys was to estimate at the provincial level, the prevalence of CVD risk factors, the knowledge and awareness levels of CVD causes, the consequences of CVD, and the associated risk factors and lifestyle behaviours."],"keywords":["alcohol","blood pressure","cardiovascular disease","cholesterol","diabetes","diet","exercise","health","heart disease","medications","smoking","tobacco","weight loss"],"temporalCoverage":["1986/1992"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"spatialCoverage":["Canada","Canada, Provinces"],"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"CHH_ABSurvey.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":456397,"description":"Alberta Survey","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/5798"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"CHH_AtlanticSurvey.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":404244,"description":"Atlantic Survey","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/5799"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"CHH_BCSurvey.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":387407,"description":"B.C.
