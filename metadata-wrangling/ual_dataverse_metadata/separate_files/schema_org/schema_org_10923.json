The goal of the RCT is to compare: 1) a walking training program with the Lokomat robotic device (LOK), 2) a functional physical therapy program (fPT) that includes activities to enhance balance/co-ordination/endurance and advanced motor skills conducted over 'real ground', 3) a combined Lokomat + functional physical therapy (LOK+fPT) program, and 4) a regular maintenance therapy condition (CONT). The qualitative part of the study will consist of interviews of children and parents after they have finished the study intervention."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","brain diseases","central nervous system diseases","exercise","motor skills","randomized controlled trial","mixed methods studies","qualitative research","pediatrics","rehabilitation","cerebral palsy","robot assisted gait training","physical therapy"],"citation":[{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"Wiart L, Rosychuk RJ, Wright FV.
