Questions were compiled and to them were added specific quality of life questions used in the Michigan Quality of Life Survey (1974) and the National Opinion Research Council Surveys. The basic demographic questions and their format were taken from \"Survey Research\", a book compiled by the Canada Council's Task Force on Survey Research (Survey Research: Report of Consultative Group on Survey Research, The Canada Council, 1976). Through this replication of questions, we are in a position to compare results obtained in Edmonton with those found in other centers. In the Edmonton Area Study, an attempt is made to provide subjective data that ultimately can be compared against objective data to establish an overall view of well-being in various \"life domains\" of the inhabitants of Edmonton."],"keywords":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences","Public opinion -- Alberta","Social surveys -- Alberta","Alberta -- Social conditions -- Statistics","Alberta -- Economic conditions -- Statistics","demographics","accomodations","personal safety","recreational facilities","social contacts","social behaviour","criminology","police","community","courts","civil rights","vicimization","employment","occupation","job satisfaction","family","child rearing","finances","gun control","wire tapping","death penalty","birth control information","abortion","working women","swine flu","immunization","quality of life"],"temporalCoverage":["1977-02/1977-02"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"spatialCoverage":["Canada","City of Edmonton"],"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1977EdmontonAreaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":281566,"description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4843"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1977EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":152321,"description":"Data File","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4845"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"1977EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":266997,"description":"Methodology Report","contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4844"}]}
