This study will help to develop educational tools for improving knowledge regarding pregnancy and IBD. Pre- and post- intervention reproductive knowledge was compared using the CCPKnow (Crohn's and Colitis Pregnancy Knowle dge) survey. Patient factors (age, reproductive history, IBD history, medications, education, marital status, clinic/specialist access) and preferences for knowledge translation method were measured and assessed. If a patient was randomized to the interactive group, the effectiveness of videos, slides, sets, PDFs, and mini quizzes were compared. Usage was also tracked, including time spent on modules and components of modules, number of times accessed."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Crohn's disease","pregnancy","ulcerative colitis","knowledge translation","infant","maternal health","patient education","inflammatory bowel diseases","patient knowledge"],"temporalCoverage":["2014/2016"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions (AIHS)"}],"spatialCoverage":["Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"],"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Huang Improving Knowledge Presentation April 2016.pdf","fileFormat":"application/pdf","contentSize":471073,"description":"\"The World Wide Web Continues to be Highly Utilized by Pregnancy and IBD Patients\" poster presentation.
