The learners are attributed to a country of location while studying, a gender, a final grade, and a chat group which was composed for the purposes of supporting a group presentation. Refugee learners were based in Kenya and Thailand, while none refugees were based in Canada. More learners were in the groups than were participants in the study. Non-participants' data and chats were removed from the groups. The chat messages are attributed to a learner, a date and time, and then coded for the indicators of social presence as described by the Community of Inquiry Framework."],"keywords":["Social Sciences","social presence","refugee","mobile instant messaging","grade","higher education in emergencies","Community of Inquiry"],"citation":[{"@type":"CreativeWork","text":"MacIsaac, P.
