From each tree, we collected two increment cores with a 4.3 mm increment borer at a height of 1.3 m. We sanded mounted increment cores with progressively finer sandpaper up to 1200 grit and scanned them at 2400 DPI. Joseph Birch measured the width of annual growth rings of cored trees and cross-dated the measurements. These data are also posted with the International Tree Ring Database."],"keywords":["Other"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset","text":"CC0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Tree cores-1.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":3728,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16775"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Tree cores_metadata.txt","fileFormat":"text/plain","contentSize":760,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16776"},{"@type":"DataDownload","name":"Tree cores.tab","fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","contentSize":3258,"contentUrl":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/16774"}]}
