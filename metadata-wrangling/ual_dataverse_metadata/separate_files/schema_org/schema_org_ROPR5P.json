The objectives of the survey were: 1. to describe synthesis review service models provided by Canadian academic libraries; 2. to understand the strengths, and challenges (and, where possible, solutions) of these models. A targeted sample of Canadian academic librarians was recruited via email distribution through discussion lists of the Canadian Health Libraries Association/Association des bibliothéques de la santé du Canada (CANMEDLIB), the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada Libraries Group (AFMCLIB), and the CARL Librarian Research Institute (LibrarianResCanL) listservs .
