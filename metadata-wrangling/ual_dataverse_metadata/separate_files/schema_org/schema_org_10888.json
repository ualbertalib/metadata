The objectives of this study were to determine (a) if food portion size estimation accuracy differs when using a two dimensional (2D) PSMA (actual-size photos called Portion Size Cards) compared to a 3D PSMA (Portion Size Kit) and (b) whether differences exist in the short-term usefulness of and satisfaction with these PSMAs in a sample of parents of overweight children and youth."],"keywords":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","parents","portion size estimation","portion size","overweight","pediatrics","randomized controlled trial","nutrition assessment","pediatric obesity"],"temporalCoverage":["2010-04/2014-01"],"license":{"@type":"Dataset"},"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UAL Dataverse","url":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"UAL Dataverse"},"spatialCoverage":["Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"]}
