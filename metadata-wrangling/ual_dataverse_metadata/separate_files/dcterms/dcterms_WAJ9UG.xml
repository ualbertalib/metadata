The survey was conducted from May 3, 2018 to May 22, 2018. The purpose and objectives of the survey were to understand the state of local music collections across Canada. Specifically, to 1) identify where collections of local music are held, what music(s) they document, and what evidentiary value they possess; and 2) to understand the perceived value of collecting local music, and record local music collection management practices currently used by public institutions to determine areas where practices may be improved.&#xd;
&#xd;
A targeted sample of Canadian libraries thought to potentially contain local music collections were recruited via email distribution. The data are de-identified responses to the survey. </dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Arts and Humanities</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Social Sciences</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Music libraries--Collection development</dcterms:subject><dcterms:language>English</dcterms:language><dcterms:language>French</dcterms:language><dcterms:contributor>Doi, Carolyn</dcterms:contributor><dcterms:dateSubmitted>2018-09-05</dcterms:dateSubmitted><dcterms:temporal>2018-05-22</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:temporal>2018-05-03</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:temporal>2018-05-22</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:type>Survey data</dcterms:type><dcterms:license>CC0</dcterms:license><dcterms:rights>CC0 Waiver</dcterms:rights></metadata>
