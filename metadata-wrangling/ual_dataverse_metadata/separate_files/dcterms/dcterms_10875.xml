Images were collected immediately after initiating the infection and the appearance of new GFPcro labeled DNA was used to track factory development, while mCherry fluorescence was used to detect plasmid-by-virus recombination. Images were collected every 5 minutes up to 10 h post infection.</dcterms:description><dcterms:date>2016</dcterms:date><dcterms:dateSubmitted>2016-09-13</dcterms:dateSubmitted><dcterms:license>NONE</dcterms:license></metadata>
