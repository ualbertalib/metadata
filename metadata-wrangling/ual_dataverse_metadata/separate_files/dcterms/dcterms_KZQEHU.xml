We traced roots from boles and confirmed their identity to be aspen by taste-testing. Sampled roots were put on ice after collection and transported to the University of Alberta the same day and stored at -20 °C prior to processing. Aspen roots were thawed and washed free of adhering soil. Fine roots (&lt; 1 mm in diameter) were retained, cut into 1 cm fragments, mixed thoroughly in a dish of water, and subsampled. Joshua Wasyliw categorized 100 ectomycorrhizal root tips into exploration types based on the presence of extramatrical hyphae.</dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Other</dcterms:subject><dcterms:contributor>Karst, Justine</dcterms:contributor><dcterms:dateSubmitted>2021-03-18</dcterms:dateSubmitted><dcterms:license>CC0</dcterms:license><dcterms:rights>CC0 Waiver</dcterms:rights></metadata>
