This study is intended to help understand women's prenatal care experiences in Calgary and identify barriers and facilitators to accessing care.   AOB/F data covers subject areas including: a) Maternal Prenatal Health (e.g., prenatal care, maternal gestation); b) Pregnancy History (e.g., previous pregnancies, previous preterm birth); c) Pre-pregnancy (e.g., pregnancy planning advice received, contraception use, pregnancy intention); d) Health Care Services (e.g., utilization of services for mother and baby); e) Food, Exercise and Housing (e.g., nutrition, housing, neighbourhood safety and cohesion); f) Lifestyle (e.g., T-ACE Screen for alcohol consumption risk, smoking, drugs); g) Social Support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Scale, partner/relationship satisfaction); h) Mental Health (e.g., Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Spielberger State Anxiety Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, optimism [Life Orientation Te&#xd;
st-Revised]); i) Life Events (e.g., previous mental health, abuse); j) Sociodemographic Outcomes (e.g., age, marital status, education, ethnicity, work status); k) Birth Outcomes - maternal and delivery (e.g. site of birth, delivery type, medication, delivery support); l) Birth Outcomes -infant (e.g., sex, birth weight, gestational age); m) Baby Health/Development (e.g., doctor, check-up, vaccinations); n) Parenting/ Postpartum Experiences (e.g. Parenting Morale Index, breastfeeding [Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale], community service utilization)&#xd;
