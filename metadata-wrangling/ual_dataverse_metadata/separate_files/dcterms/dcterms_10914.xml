Combined with standard care, the Schroth intervention group will receive five individual training sessions, followed by weekly group classes and daily home exercises for 6 months. After the first six months, the experimental group will be advised to continue the unsupervised home programme until the discharge from the scoliosis clinic, while the control group will be offered the Schroth treatment for six months. The primary aim is to compare the effect of a 6 month 'Schroth exercise program combined with standard-of-care' to 'standard-of-care alone' on scoliosis curve severity measured using the Cobb angle. Secondary aims include: 1. To determine the effect of Schroth exercises at 6 months on secondary outcomes including quality-of-life, spinal appearance, objective posture and spinal muscle endurance measurements. 2. To determine the efficacy of 6 months of Schroth therapy offered to control participants after completing 6 months in the standard-of care group (using subjects as  their own controls) and 3. To determine if the effects of the 6 months supervised Schroth exercise program can be maintained after supervised therapy is terminated. At Hopital Ste-Justine, the effect of Global Postural Re-education will also be examined because Global Postural Re-education exercises were offered routinely to patients at that institution prior to the trial.</dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>adolescent</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>posture</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>spinal curvatures</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>physical therapy</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>quality of life</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>muscle endurance</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>exercise</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>radiography</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>randomized controlled trial</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>scoliosis</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>adolescent idiopathic scoliosis</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>schroth exercises</dcterms:subject><dcterms:isReferencedBy>Schreiber S, Parent EC, Moez EK, et al.
