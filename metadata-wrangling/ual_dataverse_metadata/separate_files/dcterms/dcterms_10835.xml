These data were aggregated from observations made from 1890 to 2015 in order to map the spread of the insect throughout its invaded range in eastern North America.  Detection year data are organized by country, province/state, and county for a total of 389 records with references to their original  reporting literature.</dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Beech bark disease</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Cryptococcus fagisuga</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Neoectria</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Range expansion</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Invasive insects</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Forest health</dcterms:subject><dcterms:isReferencedBy>Cale JA, Garrison-Johnston MT, Teale SA, Castello JD.
