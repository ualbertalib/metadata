With growing numbers of such children in our society, especially in our inner cities, this research is timely and has the promise of offering a cost effective and efficient way to address this social issue.&#xd;

This pilot study is desighed to precede Phase 1 of a 2-Phase study-- to compare two readily available community-based early intervention programs designed to improve menta health outcomes for at risk infants and their caregivers. Two intervention groups will receive regular home visits and/or telephone supervision by either advanced clinical practitioners (ACP) or by volunteer foster grandmothers and these will be compared with a control group receiving normally available postpartum care. Phase 1 interventions will begin at birth and continue throughout the infants' first 18 months of life. Phase 2 will focus on the infants' development through 3 years of age.</dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Social Sciences</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>psychosocial risk</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>intervention</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>mental health</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>infants</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>low resource mothers</dcterms:subject><dcterms:contributor>PolicyWise, SAGE</dcterms:contributor><dcterms:dateSubmitted>2018-06-14</dcterms:dateSubmitted><dcterms:temporal>1996-04-01</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:temporal>1997-12-30</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:temporal>1996-04-01</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:temporal>1997-12-30</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:license>CC0</dcterms:license><dcterms:rights>CC0 Waiver</dcterms:rights></metadata>
