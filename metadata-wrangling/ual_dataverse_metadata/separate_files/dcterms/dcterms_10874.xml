Two different cells are tracked here from the time of factory development: one infected by an actively recombining virus, and another presumed to be infected with a "pre-recombined" virus. The appearance of mCherry expression in the cell infected with the pre-recombined virus mimics that seen in cells infected with the pE/L-mCherry-cro virus (Video 1), while the actively recombining virus produces a mCherry-cro signal late in infection.</dcterms:description><dcterms:date>2016</dcterms:date><dcterms:dateSubmitted>2016-09-13</dcterms:dateSubmitted><dcterms:license>NONE</dcterms:license></metadata>
