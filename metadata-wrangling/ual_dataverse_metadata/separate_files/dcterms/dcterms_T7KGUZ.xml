Landowners were invited to participate in a survey about what rural Albertan landowners think of local energy infrastructure development and wind turbines in particular. The study received human ethics research approval at the University of Alberta. Funding for this study was provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council under the project "Imagination, expectation and deliberation: Pathways to wind energy landscape transitions in Alberta" (#435-2017-0281).</dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Social Sciences</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>energy transition, wind turbines, landowners, attitudes, values, norms, preferences</dcterms:subject><dcterms:contributor>Parkins, John</dcterms:contributor><dcterms:dateSubmitted>2021-01-25</dcterms:dateSubmitted><dcterms:license>CC0</dcterms:license><dcterms:rights>CC0 Waiver</dcterms:rights></metadata>
