The study area for which these raster TIFFs were developed was in west-central Alberta, bounded to the west by Jasper National Park; to the north by Hinton, Alberta; to the south by Cadomin, Alberta; and to the east by Obed, Alberta. These raster TIFFs are being published in support of a multi-scale cougar predation analysis conducted by M Beale, S Widmeyer, and M Boyce. The manuscript associated with these data is currently being reviewed and will be included under 'Related Publications' upon acceptance.</dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Other</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Covariate data</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Rasters</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>TIFF</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Landcover</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>Puma concolor</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>west-central Alberta</dcterms:subject><dcterms:contributor>Boyce, Mark</dcterms:contributor><dcterms:dateSubmitted>2021-08-24</dcterms:dateSubmitted><dcterms:temporal>2018</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:temporal>2018</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:license>CC0</dcterms:license><dcterms:rights>CC0 Waiver</dcterms:rights></metadata>
