The goal of the RCT is to compare: 1) a walking training program with the Lokomat robotic device (LOK), 2) a functional physical therapy program (fPT) that includes activities to enhance balance/co-ordination/endurance and advanced motor skills conducted over 'real ground', 3) a combined Lokomat + functional physical therapy (LOK+fPT) program, and 4) a regular maintenance therapy condition (CONT). The qualitative part of the study will consist of interviews of children and parents after they have finished the study intervention.</dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>brain diseases</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>central nervous system diseases</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>exercise</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>motor skills</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>randomized controlled trial</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>mixed methods studies</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>qualitative research</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>pediatrics</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>rehabilitation</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>cerebral palsy</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>robot assisted gait training</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>physical therapy</dcterms:subject><dcterms:isReferencedBy>Wiart L, Rosychuk RJ, Wright FV.
