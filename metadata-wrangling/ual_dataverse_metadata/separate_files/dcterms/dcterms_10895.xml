and treatment of radial head subluxation, could successfully reduce radial head subluxation at a rate similar to physicians. Given the practical constraints at  the time of emergency department triage, this study was designed as a cluster randomized trial where the unit of randomization was a day and the patients on any given day were assigned to the nurse or physician arm for the entire day.</dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>nurse treatment</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>emergency departments</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>dislocations</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>wounds and injuries</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>pediatrics</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>randomized controlled trial</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>radial head subluxation</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>pulled elbow</dcterms:subject><dcterms:isReferencedBy>Dixon A, Clarkin C, Barrowman N, Correll R, Osmond MH, Plint AC.
