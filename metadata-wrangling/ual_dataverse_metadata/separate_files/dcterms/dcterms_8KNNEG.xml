We traced roots from boles and confirmed their identity to be aspen by taste-testing. Sampled roots were put on ice after collection and transported to the University of Alberta the same day and stored at -20 °C prior to processing. Aspen roots were thawed and washed free of adhering soil. Fine roots (&lt; 1 mm in diameter) were retained, cut into 1 cm fragments, mixed thoroughly in a dish of water, and subsampled for DNA sequencing. Those sequences identified as ectomycorrhizal were then assigned to exploration types based on Agerer (2006). James Franklin performed the benchwork for sequencing, Joseph Birch performed the bioinformatics, and Josh Wasyliw assigned the amplicon sequence variants into exploration types.</dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Other</dcterms:subject><dcterms:contributor>Karst, Justine</dcterms:contributor><dcterms:dateSubmitted>2021-03-18</dcterms:dateSubmitted><dcterms:license>CC0</dcterms:license><dcterms:rights>CC0 Waiver</dcterms:rights></metadata>
