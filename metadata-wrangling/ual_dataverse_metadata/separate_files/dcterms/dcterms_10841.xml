The results from this study could be important for many children receiving medical care, as distraction is safe and the use of iPads is enjoyable for many children.</dcterms:description><dcterms:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>distress</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>iPad</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>pain</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>healthcare interventions</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>children</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>pediatrics</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>randomized controlled trial</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>distraction</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>pain management</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>emergency departments</dcterms:subject><dcterms:date>2015</dcterms:date><dcterms:temporal>2015-10</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:temporal>2016-12</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:temporal>2015-10</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:temporal>2016-10</dcterms:temporal><dcterms:type>Questionnaire data; Observational data; Audiovisual data; Clinical data</dcterms:type><dcterms:source>Observed Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised (OSBD-R);  Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R); State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S, Form Y)</dcterms:source><dcterms:spatial>Alberta</dcterms:spatial><dcterms:spatial>Edmonton</dcterms:spatial><dcterms:spatial>Canada</dcterms:spatial><dcterms:license>NONE</dcterms:license><dcterms:rights>Video recording equipment will capture the patient's facial expressions and body movements, in order to apply an ob
