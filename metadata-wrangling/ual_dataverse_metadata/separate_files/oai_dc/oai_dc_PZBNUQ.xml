Frazil and flocs were generated in a frazil tank at the University of Alberta cold room facility. Images of suspended frazil/flocs were taken using cross-polarized light.  </dc:description><dc:subject>Earth and Environmental Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering</dc:subject><dc:subject>frazil particles</dc:subject><dc:subject>frazil flocs</dc:subject><dc:subject>salinities</dc:subject><dc:contributor>Ghobrial, Tadros</dc:contributor></oai_dc:dc>
