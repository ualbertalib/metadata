We traced roots from boles and confirmed their identity to be aspen by taste-testing. Sampled roots were put on ice after collection and transported to the University of Alberta the same day and stored at -20 °C prior to processing. Aspen roots were thawed and washed free of adhering soil. Fine roots (&lt; 1 mm in diameter) were retained, cut into 1 cm fragments, mixed thoroughly in a dish of water, and subsampled for scoring roots for mycorrhizal colonization. Justine Karst scored roots for ectomycorrhizal colonization and James Franklin scored roots for arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization.</dc:description><dc:subject>Other</dc:subject><dc:contributor>Karst, Justine</dc:contributor></oai_dc:dc>
