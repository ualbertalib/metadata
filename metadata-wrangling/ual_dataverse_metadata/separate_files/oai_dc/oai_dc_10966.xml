It is a portion of the 2016 Alberta Survey B conducted by the Population Research Lab, and was commissioned by the Alberta Mentoring Partnership (AMP) in collaboration with PolicyWise for Children&#xd;
&amp; Families.  Questions were pilot tested by the AMP Research and Evaluation committee. Topics included past mentoring experience, the influence of this past mentorship, current mentoring and willingness to mentor in the near future.
