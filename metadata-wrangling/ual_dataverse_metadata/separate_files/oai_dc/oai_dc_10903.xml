It looks at changes in cytokines and the immune profile during pregnancy in women with IBD, comparing longitudinal changes by IBD disease types and disease activity, and comparing this to healthy volunteers. As well, outcomes, like preterm delivery, are tracked.</dc:description><dc:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>Crohn's disease</dc:subject><dc:subject>pregnancy</dc:subject><dc:subject>ulcerative colitis</dc:subject><dc:subject>cohort studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>infant</dc:subject><dc:subject>biomarkers</dc:subject><dc:subject>cytokines</dc:subject><dc:subject>inflammatory bowel diseases</dc:subject><dc:subject>immunology</dc:subject><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:relation>Effects of Maternal IBD and IBD Breast Milk on Neonatal Gut Microbiome and Intestinal Inflammation</dc:relation><dc:relation>Elevated Fecal Calprotectin in the Second or Third Trimester of Pregnancy Predicts Preterm Delivery in Women with IBD</dc:relation><dc:type>Clinical data; Biosamples; Questionnaire data</dc:type></oai_dc:dc>
