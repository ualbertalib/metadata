The objectives of this study were to determine (a) if food portion size estimation accuracy differs when using a two dimensional (2D) PSMA (actual-size photos called Portion Size Cards) compared to a 3D PSMA (Portion Size Kit) and (b) whether differences exist in the short-term usefulness of and satisfaction with these PSMAs in a sample of parents of overweight children and youth.</dc:description><dc:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>parents</dc:subject><dc:subject>portion size estimation</dc:subject><dc:subject>portion size</dc:subject><dc:subject>overweight</dc:subject><dc:subject>pediatrics</dc:subject><dc:subject>randomized controlled trial</dc:subject><dc:subject>nutrition assessment</dc:subject><dc:subject>pediatric obesity</dc:subject><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Survey data</dc:type></oai_dc:dc>
