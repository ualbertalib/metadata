This includes seven data tables and four figures. &lt;br> &lt;br>Table S1: Summary of glass morphology and mineralogy for tephra of interest. Information is unavailable in some cases where no samples of the tephra were accessible and characteristics were not reported in publications. &lt;br>&lt;br> Table S2: Individual EPMA glass shard analyses included in this study. &lt;br>&lt;br> Table S3: Secondary standard data accompanying glass analyses. &lt;br>&lt;br> Table S4: Published average major-element geochemical data included in this study. &lt;br>&lt;br> Table S5: Radiocarbon dates reviewed within this study listed by associated tephra. Non-radiocarbon dates are listed separately. Dating methods: Con = conventional 14C dating; AMS = accelerator mass spectrometery; Benzene LSC = Benzene liquid scintillation counting; nd = not defined. &lt;br>&lt;br> Table S6: Non-radiocarbon dates reviewed within this study. &lt;br>&lt;br> Table S7: Summary statistics for dates associated with tephra layers reviewed within this paper. &lt;br>&lt;br> Figures S1-S4: OxCal model set-up, examples given for Dawson tephra (S1-S2) and Oshetna tephra (S3-S4).</dc:description><dc:subject>Earth and Environmental Sciences</dc:subject><dc:contributor>Davies, Lauren</dc:contributor></oai_dc:dc>
