Two different cells are tracked here from the time of factory development: one infected by an actively recombining virus, and another presumed to be infected with a "pre-recombined" virus. The appearance of mCherry expression in the cell infected with the pre-recombined virus mimics that seen in cells infected with the pE/L-mCherry-cro virus (Video 1), while the actively recombining virus produces a mCherry-cro signal late in infection.</dc:description><dc:date>2016</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>
