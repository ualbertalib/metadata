This random sample survey of households in the province of Alberta has enabled academic researchers, local community agencies, and government departments to explore a broad spectrum of social issues in an on-going research framework. Owing to the large number of questions submitted by researchers and organizations, the 1995 Alberta Survey was conducted in two se&#xd;
