The SBIRT was entitled RIPPLE - the Resource Information Program for Parents on Lifestyle and Education. Parents of children were recruited from a primary care clinic and invited to participate in the SBIRT on a study-designated tablet. The SBIRT was brief (~15 minutes) and parents completed it while they awaited their child's upcoming pediatrician appointment. The SBIRT (i) screened for children's weight status using children's measured height and weight, (ii) randomly assigned parents to one-of-four brief interventions (two on nutrition, two on physical activity) or an eHealth control group, and (iii) provided parents with a menu of resources (i.e., online handouts, information on community services) to help prevent obesity in children.</dc:description><dc:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>obesity prevention</dc:subject><dc:subject>pediatrics</dc:subject><dc:subject>parents</dc:subject><dc:subject>ehealth</dc:subject><dc:subject>internet</dc:subject><dc:subject>nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>exercise</dc:subject><dc:subject>sedentary behavior</dc:subject><dc:subject>randomized controlled trial</dc:subject><dc:subject>pediatric obesity</dc:subject><dc:subject>primary health care</dc:subject><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Questionnaire data; Clinical data; Anthropometric data</dc:type><dc:source>Modified version of survey was based on the following study: Campbell M, Benton JM, Werk L.
