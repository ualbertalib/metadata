and treatment of radial head subluxation, could successfully reduce radial head subluxation at a rate similar to physicians. Given the practical constraints at  the time of emergency department triage, this study was designed as a cluster randomized trial where the unit of randomization was a day and the patients on any given day were assigned to the nurse or physician arm for the entire day.</dc:description><dc:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>nurse treatment</dc:subject><dc:subject>emergency departments</dc:subject><dc:subject>dislocations</dc:subject><dc:subject>wounds and injuries</dc:subject><dc:subject>pediatrics</dc:subject><dc:subject>randomized controlled trial</dc:subject><dc:subject>radial head subluxation</dc:subject><dc:subject>pulled elbow</dc:subject><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Clinical data</dc:type></oai_dc:dc>
