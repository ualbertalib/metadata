The data was collected between October 2019 - April 2020, and reviewed and updated in July-August 2020. &#xd;
&lt;br>&lt;br>&#xd;
For the purposes of this project, the following inclusion criteria were used: &#xd;
&lt;ol>&#xd;
&lt;il>&lt;b>Canadian&lt;/b>: a minimum of one-third of the core editorial board is affiliated with an eligible Canadian post-secondary institution. We used this as the primary criteria and not whether or not the journal title is owned by a Canadian not-for-profit organization. As we are interested primarily in labour, limiting it based on the editorial board was natural for this study.&lt;/il>&lt;br>&#xd;
&lt;il>&lt;b>Independent&lt;/b>: A journal is not affiliated with a commercial publisher (e.g. Springer, Elsevier, Sage, etc.). Non-profits, like Ã‰rudit and University of Toronto Press, were included in the project.&lt;/il>&lt;br>&#xd;
&lt;il>&lt;b>Scholarly&lt;/b>:  defined as a peer-reviewed academic publication that disseminates the results of original scholarship. We have excluded additional student-run journals as per the SSHRC guidelines as well.&lt;/il>&#xd;
&lt;il>&lt;b>Active&lt;/b>: The journal has published in the last 3 years.&lt;/il>&lt;br>&#xd;
&lt;/ol>&#xd;
&lt;br>&#xd;
The second list is of the journals that we removed from our original data collection that did not meet the above criteria when reviewed. &#xd;
&lt;br>&lt;br>&#xd;
