The learners are attributed to a country of location while studying, a gender, a final grade, and a chat group which was composed for the purposes of supporting a group presentation. Refugee learners were based in Kenya and Thailand, while none refugees were based in Canada. More learners were in the groups than were participants in the study. Non-participants' data and chats were removed from the groups. The chat messages are attributed to a learner, a date and time, and then coded for the indicators of social presence as described by the Community of Inquiry Framework.</dc:description><dc:subject>Social Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>social presence</dc:subject><dc:subject>refugee</dc:subject><dc:subject>mobile instant messaging</dc:subject><dc:subject>grade</dc:subject><dc:subject>higher education in emergencies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Community of Inquiry</dc:subject><dc:contributor>MacIsaac, Peggy Lynn</dc:contributor></oai_dc:dc>
