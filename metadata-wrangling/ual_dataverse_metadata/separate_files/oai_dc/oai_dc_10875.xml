Images were collected immediately after initiating the infection and the appearance of new GFPcro labeled DNA was used to track factory development, while mCherry fluorescence was used to detect plasmid-by-virus recombination. Images were collected every 5 minutes up to 10 h post infection.</dc:description><dc:date>2016</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>
