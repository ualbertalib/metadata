by librarians at the University Library, University of Saskatchewan from May 2-16,&#xd;
2018. The objectives of the survey were: 1. to describe synthesis review service&#xd;
models provided by Canadian academic libraries; 2. to understand the strengths,&#xd;
and challenges (and, where possible, solutions) of these models. A targeted sample&#xd;
of Canadian academic librarians was recruited via email distribution through&#xd;
discussion lists of the Canadian Health Libraries Association/Association des&#xd;
bibliothéques de la santé du Canada (CANMEDLIB), the Association of Faculties of&#xd;
Medicine of Canada Libraries Group (AFMCLIB), and the CARL Librarian Research&#xd;
Institute (LibrarianResCanL) listservs . The data are de-identified responses to the&#xd;
survey.</dc:description><dc:subject>Computer and Information Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>Systematic reviews (Medical research)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public services (Libraries)</dc:subject><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:language>French</dc:language><dc:contributor>Doi, Carolyn</dc:contributor><dc:type>Survey data</dc:type></oai_dc:dc>
