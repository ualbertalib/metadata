The study area for which these raster TIFFs were developed was in west-central Alberta, bounded to the west by Jasper National Park; to the north by Hinton, Alberta; to the south by Cadomin, Alberta; and to the east by Obed, Alberta. These raster TIFFs are being published in support of a multi-scale cougar predation analysis conducted by M Beale, S Widmeyer, and M Boyce. The manuscript associated with these data is currently being reviewed and will be included under 'Related Publications' upon acceptance.</dc:description><dc:subject>Other</dc:subject><dc:subject>Covariate data</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rasters</dc:subject><dc:subject>TIFF</dc:subject><dc:subject>Landcover</dc:subject><dc:subject>Puma concolor</dc:subject><dc:subject>west-central Alberta</dc:subject><dc:contributor>Boyce, Mark</dc:contributor></oai_dc:dc>
