The investigators tested the hypothesis that parental involvement in the child's transfer, with the option of peer support, will result in measurable reductions in medication errors, unplanned nutritional and feeding management, and parental anxiety after transfer as compared to the control group.</dc:description><dc:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>family centered care</dc:subject><dc:subject>bedside transfer rounds</dc:subject><dc:subject>pediatric cardiac intensive care</dc:subject><dc:subject>intensive care units, pediatric</dc:subject><dc:subject>pediatrics</dc:subject><dc:subject>randomized controlled trial</dc:subject><dc:subject>parental anxiety</dc:subject><dc:subject>children's safety</dc:subject><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Questionnaire data</dc:type><dc:source>Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</dc:source></oai_dc:dc>
