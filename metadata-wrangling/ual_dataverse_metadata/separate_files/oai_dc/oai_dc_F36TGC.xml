These approaches su er from intrinsic limitations due to the incompleteness of the KGs. In this paper we investigate an alternative solution, which lever- ages the patterns that occur on the schemas of a large corpus of Wikipedia tables. Our experimental evaluation, which used DBpedia as reference KG, demonstrates the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art solutions and reveals that we can extract more than 1.7M of facts with an estimated accuracy of 0.81 even from tables that do not expose any fact on the KG.</dc:description><dc:subject>Computer and Information Science</dc:subject><dc:contributor>Cannaviccio, Matteo</dc:contributor></oai_dc:dc>
