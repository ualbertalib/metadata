Questions under this topic related to the respondent's attitudes and perceptions of crime, the criminal justice system, and victimization. As in the past, faculty members and outside agencies submitted a variety of questions which may or may not have been related to the special topic (See Appendix). In addition, the questionnaire contained a number of replicated questions from previous EAS studies.</dc:description><dc:subject>Arts and Humanities</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>demographics</dc:subject><dc:subject>reaction to crime</dc:subject><dc:subject>dispute resolution</dc:subject><dc:subject>social attitudes</dc:subject><dc:subject>social behaviour</dc:subject><dc:subject>social contacts</dc:subject><dc:subject>community perceptions</dc:subject><dc:subject>social standings</dc:subject><dc:subject>alienation</dc:subject><dc:subject>urban residential mobility</dc:subject><dc:subject>quality of life</dc:subject><dc:subject>alcohol</dc:subject><dc:subject>tobacco</dc:subject><dc:subject>personal health</dc:subject><dc:subject>medical care</dc:subject><dc:subject>abortion</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sunday shopping</dc:subject><dc:subject>voting behaviour</dc:subject><dc:date>1984-07</dc:date><dc:type>Microdata</dc:type></oai_dc:dc>
