The map was georeferenced and the annexation boundaries digitized within the ArcGIS 10.1 software environment.  Annexations post-1974 were derived from available GIS data outlining the current city boundary of Edmonton, coinciding with the 1982 annexation. The layers can also be explored using CartoDB - &lt;a href=" http://wyman10.tumblr
