Adolescents will be randomly assigned to either 8 weeks of Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with telephone and e-mail support (the Breathe program), or a control (minimal intervention) group with 8 weeks of access to a static webpage with general anxiety resources and information. The pilot RCT will (1) define a minimal clinically important difference, as defined by adolescents, for the primary outcome measure, (2) determine a sample size for a full-scale RCT, (3) estimate recruitment and retention rates to determine the number of study sites needed, (4) measure intervention acceptability to inform critical intervention changes, (5) determine the use of co-interventions, and (6) conduct a cost-consequence analysis to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis for a full-scale RCT.</dc:description><dc:subject>Medicine, Health and Life Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>cognitive behavior therapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>adolescent</dc:subject><dc:subject>mental health</dc:subject><dc:subject>internet</dc:subject><dc:subject>intervention</dc:subject><dc:subject>randomized controlled trial</dc:subject><dc:subject>ehealth</dc:subject><dc:subject>anxiety</dc:subject><dc:subject>etherapy</dc:subject><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Questionnaire data; Usage tracking data</dc:type><dc:source>Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children</dc:source></oai_dc:dc>
