If this dysfunction is allowed to progress, the kidneys may be damaged irreversibly. Hence, it is important to recognize this early and to monitor it frequently.  The tests that are available to do this have several problems. One is serum creatinine level is not very accurate, has many problems and has been shown to overestimate kidney function in children like you with transplantation. It also takes time to increase thus delaying the diagnosis.  Another test, the gold standard GFR-renal scan, uses radioisotope, is time consuming, and requires intravenous access, thus is used once a year.  Serum cystatin C is a protein that is naturally present in the blood of everyone. This research study tested if measuring serum cystatin C is an accurate way to measure kidney function by comparing it to GFR- renal scan."},"Grant Information":{"grantNumber:Grant Agency":"Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI)"},"citation:Date of Collection":{"dateOfCollection:Start":"2010-03","dateOfCollection:End":"2012-07"},"citation:Contact":{"datasetContact:Name":"Gowrishankar, Manjula","datasetContact:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","datasetContact:E-mail":"manjula@ualberta.ca"},"Software":[{"software:Name":"Stata"},{"software:Name":"REDCap"}],"Time Period Covered":{"timePeriodCovered:Start":"2010-09","timePeriodCovered:End":"2013-06"},"Related Publication":{"Citation":"Gowrishankar M, VanderPluym C, Robert C, Bamforth F, Gilmour S, Senthilselvan A.

During the routine blood work, additional blood was drawn and analyzed for serum cystatin C using the Siemens N Latex cystatin C assay, automated on the Siemens BN system (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products, Marburg, Germany). The method is a fully automated, particle-enhanced, nephelometric immunoassay. Serum creatinine measurement was analyzed using the Beckman Coulter, Synchron enzymatic method. Charts of children enrolled in the study were assessed to obtain demographic data and laboratory data. Of the 62 children enrolled in this study, 59 (31 female, 28 male) were included in the final analysis. Two were excluded from analysis as they were unable to complete the GFR renal scan due to inability to initiate and maintain venous access for isotope injection and blood sampling. One was excluded due to loss of the collected sample.","citation:Production Date":"2010","socialscience:Frequency":"Data was collected once.","socialscience:Collection Mode":"Physical measurements and tests; Chart review","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"The target number of study participants was 60; the actual number of study participants was 59.","biomedical:Design Type":"Cross Sectional","Kind of Data":"Biosamples; Clinical data","Title":"Value of Serum Cystatin C in Estimating Renal Function in Children with Non-renal Solid Organ Transplantation","citation:Production Place":"Edmonton, Alberta","socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individuals","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10897","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"2.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"Value of Serum Cystatin C in Estimating Renal Function in Children with Non-renal Solid Organ Transplantation","schema:dateModified":"Fri May 26 15:00:19 MDT 2017","dvcore:conditions":"Access to the data is limited to selected members of the research team.","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI)","ore:aggregates":[],"schema:hasPart":[]},"@context":{"Alternative Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/alternative","Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Citation":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/bibliographicCitation","Grant Information":"https://schema.org/sponsor","ID Number":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/ResourceIdentifier","ID Type":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/ResourceIdentifierScheme","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Related Publication":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/isReferencedBy","Software":"https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasGeneratedBy","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","URL":"https://schema.org/distribution","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","biomedical":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/biomedical#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","grantNumber":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/grantNumber#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","software":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/software#","targetSampleSize":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience/targetSampleSize#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#"}}
