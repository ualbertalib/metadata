From this population, three samples were drawn to cover the province: the City of Edmonton (EAS), the City of Calgary, and the remainder of the region.","Deposit Date":"2015-09-03","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"SAMPLING DESIGN Main Features of Design: a.\tProvince of Alberta delineated into three areas for telephone interviewing. (1) City of Edmonton. (2) City of Calgary. (3) Remainder of the Province (Other Alberta). b. Two-stage selection process. (1) Selection of households. (2) Selection of respondent within each household. To permit the analysis of each area as a separate entity, a minimum sample size of 400 or more for each area of the province was deemed necessary. The population universe designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta that could be contacted by direct-dialing.  From this population, three samples were drawn to cover the province:  the City of Edmonton (EAS) , the City of Calgary, and the remainder of the region. A random-digit dialing approach was used to ensure that respondents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory.  For the past ten studies, the PRL has developed and updated a database of five-digit telephone banks (i.e. 403-xxx-xx) covering all of Alberta. The 1996 area samples were drawn from this database by using a computer program to select, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected.  All duplicate telephone numbers were purged from the computer-  generated list.   Nursing homes and collective dwellings were also deleted from the sample.  Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the thirty-minute interview. A respondent was selected within each household on the basis of gender using the following selection guidelines to ensure an equal selection of male and female participants . a. The dwelling unit must be the person's usual place of residence and he/she must be 18 years of age or older. b. If an adult male answers the phone and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. c.\tIf an adult female answers the phone and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male.  If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female. d. If an adult female answers the phone and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent.","Subject":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences"],"geospatial:Geographic Unit":"Province","socialscience:Weighting":"The weighting factors used for the 1996A Alberta Survey are as follows: Edmonton 0.760049, Calgary 0.864472,  Other Albera 1.37741.","Kind of Data":"Microdata","socialscience:Collection Mode":"Telephone Interviews","citation:Production Date":"1996-06","citation:Distribution Date":"1996-06","socialscience:Time Method":"Cross-Sectional.","Title":"Alberta Survey, 1996A","socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individual","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10545","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"6.1","schema:datePublished":"2015-09-04","schema:name":"Alberta Survey, 1996A","schema:dateModified":"Wed Feb 28 15:32:54 MST 2018","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Alberta Survey","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","schema:name":"1996aAlbertaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1283,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4758","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4758","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":443008,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://5921","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"2ec38fcd370c00400256c5c67e61497f"}},{"schema:description":"Data File","schema:name":"1996aAlbertaSurvey_Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1283,"dvcore:categories":["Data"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4757","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4757","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":472021,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://5920","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Binary","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:5:8beqEhCTpbVPVq2GYIiJQw==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"b7f279b22b4369897d1c7264dc4d065d"}},{"schema:description":"Methodology Report","schema:name":"1996aAlbertaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1283,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4759","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4759","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":226318,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://5922","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"699ce019672f7f100cbb39284d97a815"}}],"schema:hasPart":["https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4758","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4757","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4759"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","distributor":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/distributor#","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","otherId":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/otherId#","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#","topicClassification":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/topicClassification#"}}
