Given the practical constraints at  the time of emergency department triage, this study was designed as a cluster randomized trial where the unit of randomization was a day and the patients on any given day were assigned to the nurse or physician arm for the entire day."},"socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individual","biomedical:Design Type":"Randomized Controlled Trial","Kind of Data":"Clinical data","Subject":"Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","socialscience:Frequency":"Data was collected daily, and charts were reviewed the next day.","Title":"Reduction of Radial Head Subluxation in Children Via a Nurse Initiated Pathway: A Clustered Randomized Control Trial","Alternative Title":"Nurse Reduction of Pulled Elbow","socialscience:Control Operations":"Data collection sheets were compared to charts daily to ensure accuracy and consistency.","socialscience:Collection Mode":"Observation","citation:Production Date":"2007","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"Studies have shown that RHS spontaneously reduces in 8% to 16% of cases, that success rates at first reduction attempts are 74%-90%, and that at discharge, 99% have been reduced. We have conservatively estimated a physician success at reduction of 90%. Using a 90% success rate, a 10 %, non-inferiority margin, a type I error=0.05, and power of 80%, 112 patients are needed in each study arm, with a total target of 224 study participants. The actual number of study participants was 245.","socialscience:Characteristics of Data Collection Situation":"Baseline Assessment: Once a patient was identified by the triage nurse as a possible RHS elbow a 'pulled elbow study form' was attached to the patient's ED chart. Patient age, sex, arm injured, time and mechanism of injury were prospectively collected on all patients. Nurse initiated treatment: The triage nurse recorded the time of the attempt, outcome (success/failure) of reduction attempt, and if relevant, time of normal arm usage, for each reduction attempt. If the patient used the arm normally the physician recorded their discharge assessment. If the patient did not use their arm normally, the physician recorded their training level, time, method, and outcome (success/failure) of each reduction attempt as well as time of normal arm usage. Physician initiated treatment: The physician recorded their level of training, time, method and outcome of each reduction attempt, as well as time of normal arm usage. Other measures: Final diagnosis, discharge time, follow-up recommended, investigations ordered and their results (such as x-rays) were abstracted from the ED chart by the study coordinator. As well a copy of every patient's ED chart was kept in the ED for 4 days after a child's discharge and the study coordinator reviewed these to determine how many patients had a final diagnosis of pulled elbow and were enrolled in the study and how many were missed at triage.","socialscience:Universe":"Children up to 6 years old with a physical exam consistent with radial head subluxation (RHS) which includes not using the affected limb, holding the elbow in extension or slight flexion, forearm in pronation, and patient is distressed only on elbow movement. Injury must have happened within the preceding 12 hours.","citation:Production Place":"Ottawa, Ontario","socialscience:Actions to Minimize Losses":"Daily chart reviews ensured that all relevant patients were captured.","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10895","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"3.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"Reduction of Radial Head Subluxation in Children Via a Nurse Initiated Pathway: A Clustered Randomized Control Trial","schema:dateModified":"Fri May 26 14:53:18 MDT 2017","dvcore:conditions":"Access to deidentified data may be permitted for external researchers, with limitations.
