The investigators tested the hypothesis that parental involvement in the child's transfer, with the option of peer support, will result in measurable reductions in medication errors, unplanned nutritional and feeding management, and parental anxiety after transfer as compared to the control group."},"citation:Producer":{"producer:Name":"Adatia, Ian","producer:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","producer:URL":"https://www.ualberta.ca/medicine/about/faculty/development/mentoring/clinical-mentors/ian-adatia"},"Author":[{"author:Name":"Adatia, Ian","author:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","Identifier Scheme":"ORCID","Identifier":"0000-0001-7669-6444"},{"author:Name":"Anand, Vijay","author:Affiliation":"University of Alberta"}],"citation:Other ID":{"otherId:Agency":"ClinicalTrials.gov","otherId:Identifier":"NCT01883739"},"citation:Date of Collection":{"dateOfCollection:Start":"2013-06","dateOfCollection:End":"2014-07"},"citation:Contact":{"datasetContact:Name":"Adatia, Ian","datasetContact:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","datasetContact:E-mail":"iadatia@ualberta.ca"},"socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individuals","Kind of Data":"Questionnaire data","citation:Production Date":"2013","socialscience:Universe":"Parents of cardiac children aged 1 day to 17 years admitted to the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (PCICU) at Stollery Children's Hospital.","Title":"Randomised Controlled Trial to Investigate the Effect of Parental Presence at Intensive Care Unit to Ward Transfer Bedside Rounds on Parental Anxiety and Children's Safety","biomedical:Design Type":"Randomized Controlled Trial","Subject":"Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Data Sources":"Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory","socialscience:Collection Mode":"Observation; Psychological measurements and tests","citation:Production Place":"Edmonton, Alberta","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10838","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"1.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"Randomised Controlled Trial to Investigate the Effect of Parental Presence at Intensive Care Unit to Ward Transfer Bedside Rounds on Parental Anxiety and Children's Safety","schema:dateModified":"Fri May 26 10:30:32 MDT 2017","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI)","ore:aggregates":[],"schema:hasPart":[]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Data Sources":"https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasDerivedFrom","Grant Information":"https://schema.org/sponsor","Identifier":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/AgentIdentifier","Identifier Scheme":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/AgentIdentifierScheme","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","biomedical":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/biomedical#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","grantNumber":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/grantNumber#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","otherId":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/otherId#","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#"}}
