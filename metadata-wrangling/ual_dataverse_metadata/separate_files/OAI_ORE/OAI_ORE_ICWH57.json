The target population are persons 18 years of age or older. The PRL used a Random-Digit Dialling (RDD) approach for landlines to ensure that respondents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory. The PRL has developed a database of eight-digit telephone banks covering the Edmonton and Calgary metropolitan areas, as well as the remainder of the province. By area, the identified working banks are randomly selected with replacement and a randomly generated set of two digits between 00-99 is appended to each selection. Duplicate telephone numbers were purged from the computer list. Businesses and government exchanges were excluded. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent. In 2016, the sampling frames of telephone numbers included both land lines and cell phones. Cell phone listings were randomly generated by an outside vendor. When a cell phone was reached and the person preferred not to continue for personal, privacy and/or cost reasons, the interview was terminated.","Author":{"author:Name":"Population Research Laboratory (Department of Sociology, University of Alberta) "},"citation:Contact":{"datasetContact:Name":"Digital Initiatives Unit","datasetContact:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","datasetContact:E-mail":"data@ualberta.ca"},"socialscience:Type of Research Instrument":"Survey","citation:Description":{"dsDescription:Text":"The Population Research Laboratory (PRL) administered the 2016 Alberta Survey A.

All of the descriptive statistics, such as means and percentages, which are calculated using the sample data, are subject to sampling error. The sampling error is a measure of the validity of the descriptive statistics that are observed in a sample. The estimated sampling error, at the 95% confidence level, for an area sample of 1,215 households assuming a 50/50 binomial percentage distribution is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Survey estimates for the subsample of 400 are estimated to be within plus or minus 5.0 percentage points, at the 95% confidence level.","citation:Topic Classification":[{"topicClassification:Term":"Public opinion -- Alberta "},{"topicClassification:Term":"Social surveys -- Alberta "},{"topicClassification:Term":"Alberta -- Social conditions -- Statistics "},{"topicClassification:Term":"Alberta -- Economic conditions -- Statistics "}],"citation:Notes":"Is a part of the Alberta Survey Dataverse.
