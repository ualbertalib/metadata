Sampling As in the previous two studies the Edmonton Area Study used as its sampling frame a computerized list of addresses compiled by the City of Edmonton from their most recent enumera\r\ntion (1980). From the computer tape a simple random sample of 534 addresses for personal interviewing was selected. Nursing homes and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. The household was the primary sampling unit. Within the household one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the one hour interview. A person was eligible to be the respondent if the dwelling was his usual place of residence and he was 18 years of age and older. Interviewers were instructed with their allotment of interviews to try to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents. As adult males are generally more difficult to contact set guideline selection procedures were given to the interviewers to assist them in obtaining their quotas.","Kind of Data":"Microdata","geospatial:Geographic Unit":"Province","citation:Production Date":"1981-07","citation:Distribution Date":"1981-07","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10580","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"3.1","schema:datePublished":"2015-09-10","schema:name":"Edmonton Area Survey, 1981","schema:dateModified":"Mon Mar 12 14:05:05 MDT 2018","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Alberta Survey","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","schema:name":"1981EdmontonAreaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1353,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4856","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4856","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":476731,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6025","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"c3432a238e063e0ccc2ac0ebdedd1684"}},{"schema:description":"Data File","schema:name":"1981EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1353,"dvcore:categories":["Data"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4858","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4858","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":459071,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6027","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-por","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Portable","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:5:6O5gW+QqtMCX6/EgF2QSNQ==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"76d0ced68d4de1d72c0e927845aaaa7d"}},{"schema:description":"Methodology Report","schema:name":"1981EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1353,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4857","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4857","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":74045,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6026","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"f5a77efa23ae6b2918d1a3964f47fd8c"}}],"schema:hasPart":["https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4856","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4858","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4857"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","distributor":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/distributor#","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#","topicClassification":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/topicClassification#"}}
