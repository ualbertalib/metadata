CHD patients will be divided into subgroups, based on their cardiac anatomy, to try and identify a level of risk of ciliary dyskinesia within the subgroup of CHD. Each of these sub groups' nNO levels will be compared between groups and against age matched control infants wit\r\nhout CHD."},"Author":[{"author:Name":"Ryerson, Lindsay","author:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","Identifier Scheme":"ORCID","Identifier":"0000-0002-4919-1309"},{"author:Name":"Amirav, Israel","author:Affiliation":"University of Alberta"},{"author:Name":"Bates, Angela"},{"author:Name":"Mackie, Andrew","author:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","Identifier Scheme":"ORCID","Identifier":"0000-0001-6126-1130"},{"author:Name":"Leonard, Heather","author:Affiliation":"University of Alberta"}],"citation:Contact":{"datasetContact:Name":"Ryerson, Lindsay","datasetContact:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","datasetContact:E-mail":"ryerson@ualberta.ca"},"Time Period Covered":{"timePeriodCovered:Start":"2015-09","timePeriodCovered:End":"2016-10"},"Software":{"software:Name":"PASW Statistics","software:Version":"19"},"citation:Date of Collection":{"dateOfCollection:Start":"2015-12","dateOfCollection:End":"2016-10"},"socialscience:Actions to Minimize Losses":"Two samples will be taken five minutes apart, to assess for test-retest reproducibility, with results for each patient being averaged over the two samples.","socialscience:Characteristics of Data Collection Situation":"A member of the research team will ask the parent to measure the child's nasal NO level. The child's hospital number and age will be collected. For nNO assessment, an inert NO sampling line with a disposable foam olive will be placed into one of the subject's nostrils while the contralateral nostril is left open. Air will be sampled at a constant rate of 0.3 Liters/min from the nose by a chemiluminescent analyzer which provides measurement of the nNO level in parts per billion (ppb).  All nNO measurements will be performed with the subjects supine. Measurements will be obtained using a nasal nitric oxide analyzer (CLD 88 sp).","Kind of Data":"Clinical data","citation:Production Place":"Edmonton, Alberta","Title":"Nasal Nitric Oxide Levels in
