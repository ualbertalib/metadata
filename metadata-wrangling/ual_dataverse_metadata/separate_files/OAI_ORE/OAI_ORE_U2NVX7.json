We first sampled 9-10 individual trees from each of 40 pine families from a progeny trial and characterized monoterpene profiles of each family. We then grouped these families in four chemotypically different clusters (or chemotypes) using cluster analysis and selected representative families from each cluster. Next, we tested beetle-fungal responses in plant-based media amended with synthetic monoterpene profiles that emulated the selected families. Our objective was to determine how the constitutive monoterpene profiles of mature lodgepole pine trees affect host acceptance by MPB and growth of G. clavigera.","dsDescription:Date":"2021-05-12"},"Subject":["Chemistry","Earth and Environmental Sciences","Other"],"citation:Keyword":{"keyword:Term":"chemotypes, beetle behaviour, mycelial growth"},"Related Publication":{"Citation":"Ullah A, Klutsch J, Erbilgin, N. 2021.
