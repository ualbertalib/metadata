The SBIRT was entitled RIPPLE - the Resource Information Program for Parents on Lifestyle and Education. Parents of children were recruited from a primary care clinic and invited to participate in the SBIRT on a study-designated tablet. The SBIRT was brief (~15 minutes) and parents completed it while they awaited their child's upcoming pediatrician appointment. The SBIRT (i) screened for children's weight status using children's measured height and weight, (ii) randomly assigned parents to one-of-four brief interventions (two on nutrition, two on physical activity) or an eHealth control group, and (iii) provided parents with a menu of resources (i.e., online handouts, information on community services) to help prevent obesity in children."},"citation:Date of Collection":{"dateOfCollection:Start":"2015-07","dateOfCollection:End":"2015-10"},"Software":[{"software:Name":"SPSS","software:Version":"22"},{"software:Name":"Microsoft Excel"}],"citation:Contact":{"datasetContact:Name":"Ball, Geoff","datasetContact:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","datasetContact:E-mail":"gdball@ualberta.ca"},"citation:Producer":{"producer:Name":"Ball, Geoff","producer:Affiliation":"University of Alberta"},"Time Period Covered":{"timePeriodCovered:Start":"2014-10","timePeriodCovered:End":"2015-12"},"citation:Other ID":{"otherId:Agency":"ClinicalTrials.gov","otherId:Identifier":"NCT02330588"},"Grant Information":{"grantNumber:Grant Agency":"Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions (AIHS); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR);Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)"},"citation:Related Material":"Avis JLS, Holt NL, Maximova K, van Mierlo T, Fournier R, Padwal R, Cave AL, Martz P, Ball GDC.

Specifically, parents assigned to the brief nutrition-based intervention received questions that queried concern about their child's weight and intention to change their child's dietary habits, and parents assigned to the brief physical activity-based intervention received questions that queried concern about their child's weight and intention to change their child's physical activity habits; parents assigned to the control group (Heads Up!) received both sets of questions. As a token of appreciation and to encourage parents to complete the 1-month follow-up measure, parents were given a Can $25 gift card to a local business (eg, grocery store).","Kind of Data":"Questionnaire data; Clinical data; Anthropometric data","citation:Production Place":"Edmonton, Alberta","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"The target number of study participants was 200; the actual number of study participants was 226.
