The learners are attributed to a country of location while studying, a gender, a final grade, and a chat group which was composed for the purposes of supporting a group presentation. Refugee learners were based in Kenya and Thailand, while none refugees were based in Canada. More learners were in the groups than were participants in the study. Non-participants' data and chats were removed from the groups. The chat messages are attributed to a learner, a date and time, and then coded for the indicators of social presence as described by the Community of Inquiry Framework.","dsDescription:Date":"2021-06-07"},"Subject":"Social Sciences","citation:Keyword":[{"keyword:Term":"social presence"},{"keyword:Term":"refugee"},{"keyword:Term":"mobile instant messaging"},{"keyword:Term":"grade"},{"keyword:Term":"higher education in emergencies"},{"keyword:Term":"Community of Inquiry"}],"Related Publication":{"Citation":"MacIsaac, P.
