This survey of households across the province of Alberta continues to enable academic researchers, government departments, and non-profit organizations to explore a wide range of topics in a structured research framework and environment. Sponsorsâ€™ research questions are asked together with demographic questions in a telephone interview of Alberta households.","dsDescription:Date":"2015-08-31"},"citation:Contact":{"datasetContact:Name":"Digital Inititatives","datasetContact:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","datasetContact:E-mail":"data@ualberta.ca"},"citation:Producer":{"producer:Name":"Population Research Laboratory","producer:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","producer:Abbreviation":"PRL"},"Deposit Date":"2016-08-24","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"The main feature of the sampling design was a two-stage selection process: first, based on a selection of households, and second, the selection of a respondent within each household. The Alberta Survey B aimed for a total sample size of 1,200 households across Alberta, with a minimum of 400 respondents in Metropolitan Edmonton, 400 i\r\nn Metropolitan Calgary, and 400 from the remainder of the province (other Alberta). The target population are persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, are living in a dwelling unit that could be contacted by direct dialling. The PRL used a Random-Digit Dialling (RDD) approach to ensure that respondents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory. The PRL has developed a database of eight-digit telephone banks covering the Edmonton and Calgary metropolitan areas, as well as the remainder of the province. By area, the identified working banks are randomly selected with replacement and a randomly generated set of two digits between 00-99 is appended to each selection. Duplicate telephone numbers were purged from the computer list. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent.","citation:Production Date":"2015-08-31","socialscience:Type of Research Instrument":"Survey","socialscience:Estimates of Sampling Error":"This study is based on a sample of adults in Alberta rather than the total population of adults in Alberta. All of the descriptive statistics, such as means and percentages, which are calculated using the sample data, could be subject to sampling error. The sampling error is a measure of the validity of the descriptive statistics that are observed in a sample. The estimated sampling error, at the 95% confidence level, for an area sample of 1,211 households assuming a 50/50 binomial percentage distribution is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Survey estimates for the subsample of 400 are estimated to be within plus or minus 5.0 percentage points, at the 95% confidence level.","Kind of Data":"Microdata","geospatial:Geographic Unit":"Province","Subject":"Arts and Humanities","socialscience:Weighting":"The sample sizes of completed interviews obtained for Metropolitan Edmonton, Metropolitan Calgary, and Other Alberta are not always proportional to the current Alberta population they are meant to represent. Therefore, statistical weights were calculated for the Alberta Survey B 2015 sample data using population estimates for 2014.","socialscience:Response Rate":"Response rates are calculated percentages representing the number of people who participated in the survey divided by the number selected in the eligible sample. The response rate for 2015 Alberta Survey B was 19.6%. The method used in this study is calculated as the number of completed interviews divided by the number of completed interviews, refusals, incompletes, and language problems.","citation:Distribution Date":"2015-08-31","Title":"Alberta Survey, 2015B","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10858","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"1.1","schema:datePublished":"2016-08-24","schema:name":"Alberta Survey, 2015B","schema:dateModified":"Mon Mar 12 12:42:23 MDT 2018","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Alberta Survey","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Methodology Report","schema:name":"2015AlbertaSurveyBMethodologyReport.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1274,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=6725","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/6725","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":125221,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://21511","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"813ef22a59aa3fb1a83aa16f1ec14613"}},{"schema:description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","schema:name":"2015ASBQuestionnaireCodebookPublicRelease.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1274,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=6724","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/6724","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":138956,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://21510","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"c4881a8ed76c5ae2135df862b491f265"}},{"schema:description":"Data File","schema:name":"ASB2015BPublicRelease.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1274,"dvcore:categories":["Data"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=6726","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/6726","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":242088,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://21512","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Binary","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:5:6OYDYiIRyOi+s4WBkJhg9g==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"a4835e0f7cba606de055420a5a616e0b"}}],"schema:hasPart":["https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=6725","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=6724","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=6726"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","distributor":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/distributor#","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#","topicClassification":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/topicClassification#"}}
