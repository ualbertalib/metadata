It is a portion of the 2013 Alberta Survey (doi:10.7939/DVN/10573) conducted by the Population Research Lab, and commissioned by PolicyWise for Children\r\n& Families (formerly the Alberta Centre for Child, Family and Community Research).  Eight questions about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) were derived from the original ACE checklist administered through Kaiser Permanente. Questions were modified to reflect the Alberta, Canada environment, the emerging literature on child development, and to be acceptable for a telephone survey. Question modifications included deleting a question about having a parent incarcerated, and adding a question on\r\nliving with a household member with a chronic medical condition. Questions were pilot tested. Three questions covered abuse, and the remaining five focused on aspects of household risk that can increase dysfunction.\r\n<br><br><strong>These metadata are also available through SAGE's searchable metadata website:<br>\r\nhttp://sagemetadata.policywise.com/nada/index.php/catalog/3</strong>"},"Software":{"software:Name":"SPSS"},"citation:Related Material":"Parent Survey: Alberta Survey 2013 (doi: 10.7939/DVN/10573)","Deposit Date":"2016-05-25","socialscience:Type of Research Instrument":"Structured","socialscience:Weighting":"Use \"wtx\" variable to correctly weight results to 2013 Alberta Population","citation:Production Date":"2013","Kind of Data":"Computer-assisted telephone survey","socialscience:Response Rate":"20.9%","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"Random-digit dialling was used to ensure respondents had an equal chance of being contacted whether or not they were listed in a telephone directory.
