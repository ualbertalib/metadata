Pre-operative variables include ventilation (days), cardiac diagnosis, presence of aortic atresia with mitral stenosis, presence of left or right atrial isomerism, presence of common atrioventricular (AV) valve, presence of more than mild AV valve regurgitation, highest plasma lactate, lowest arterial pH, lowest base deficit, lowest PaO2, peak VIS, and presence of non cardiac anomalies.    Operative variables include weight, age at time of Norwood procedure, CPB time, aortic cross clamp (ACC) time, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) time, regional cerebral perfusion (RCP), additional CPB run, and MUF time.    Post-operative variables include total daily fluid intake (ml/kg/day), daily urine output (ml/kg/day), daily mean ultrafiltration (ml/kg/day), daily chest tube output (ml/kg/day), daily net fluid balance (ml/kg/day), duration of PD (hours), change in PD dialysis solution, change in PD cycle time, time to sternal closure (hours), chest re-opening, post-operative CPR, post-operative ECLS, peak VIS on post-operative day one, peak VIS on post-operative days two to five, highest plasma lactate on post-operative day one, highest plasma lactate on post-operative days two to five, time to plasma lactate ? 2mmol/L, VO2 every four hours for the first 24 hours and then every eight hours for hours 25-72,    SaO2 every four hours for the first 24 hours and then every eight hours for hours 25-72,  SvO2 every four hours for the first 24 hours and then every eight hours for hours 25-72, lowest SvO2 on post-operative day 1 (normal SvO2 in a single ventricle population ? 40%), lowest SvO2 on post-operative days two to five , lowest arterial pH on post-operative day one, lowest arterial pH on post-operative days two to five, lowest base deficit on post-operative day one, lowest base deficit on post-operative days two to five, lowest PaO2 on post-operative day one, lowest PaO2 on post-operative days two to five, time to first extubation, ventilator days, death in PICU, death in hospital, hospital LOS, control group receipt of clinically indicated PD catheter, red blood cell transfusion, complications of PD including small bowel obstruction, peritonitis, bowel perforation, omental herniation, hypokalemia requiring treatment and hyperglycemia requiring insulin infusion at 18-24 month follow-up.","Title":"Prophylactic Peritoneal Dialysis Decreases Time to Achieve a Negative Fluid Balance After the Norwood Procedure","Kind of Data":"Clinical data; Mass spectrometer data; Medical records","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"There were 22 study participants.
