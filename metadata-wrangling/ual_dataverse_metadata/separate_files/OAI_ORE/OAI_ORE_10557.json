Main features of Design: a. Province of Alberta delineated into three areas for telephone interviewing. (1) City of Edmonton. (2) City of Calgary. (3) Remainder of the Province (Other Alberta). b. Two-stage selection process. (1) Selection of households. (2) Selection of respondent within each household. To permit the analysis of each area as a separate entity a minimum sample size of 400 or more for each area of the province was deemed necessary. The population universe designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta that could be contacted by direct-dialing. From this population, three samples were drawn to cover the province: the City of Edmonton (EAS) , the City of Calgary, and the remainder of the region. For the past six studies, the PRL has annually developed and updated computer files of five-digit telephone banks covering all of Alberta. The samples were drawn from these files by selecting, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected. All duplicate numbers were discarded. Nursing homes and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the thirty-three minute interview. A respondent was selected within each household on the basis of gender using the following selection guidelines to ensure an equal selection of male and female participants. a. The dwelling unit must be the person's usual place of residence and he/she must be 18 years of age or older. b. If an adult male answers the phone and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. c. If an adult female answers the phone and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male. If the male is no\r\nt willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female. d. If an adult female answers the phone and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent. 2. Death Anxiety Experiment (Edmonton sample only) A set of questions were submitted to the Study to estimate the effects of \"Death Anxiety\" on the tolerance of subjects to extend civil liberties to persons with extreme social and political views. The questions 27 and 28 were used to manipulate \"Death Anxiety\". These were administered immediately before the dependent measures (Questions 29 to 31) to one half of the Edmonton sample and immediately after the dependent measures to the other half of the sample. Question 7, with three statements on free speech, acted as a control variable to assess the effect of the experimental manipulation.","socialscience:Time Method":"Cross-sectional","geospatial:Geographic Unit":"Province","socialscience:Cleaning Operations":"The data cleaning process included wild code, discrepant value, and consistency checks.","socialscience:Control Operations":"Twenty-three percent of the respondents were re-contacted by the supervisors for interviewing validation.","citation:Production Date":"1992-06","socialscience:Response Rate":"The response rate for the whole sample was 76%","Deposit Date":"2015-09-04","socialscience:Frequency":"One-time collection.","Title":"Alberta Survey, 1992","socialscience:Data Collector":"Population Research Laboratory, Department of Sociology, University of Alberta","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10557","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"6.1","schema:datePublished":"2015-09-08","schema:name":"Alberta Survey, 1992","schema:dateModified":"Wed Feb 28 15:20:17 MST 2018","dvcore:confidentialityDeclaration":"None required","dvcore:specialPermissions":"None required","dvcore:restrictions":"None","dvcore:citationRequirements":"Cite All Alberta Survey 1992","dvcore:depositorRequirements":"None","dvcore:conditions":"No attempt should be made to disclose individuals in the study nor link records through study with other files.","dvcore:disclaimer":"None","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false,"dvcore:originalArchive":"Data Library, University of Alberta","dvcore:availabilityStatus":"Available","dvcore:contactForAccess":"Chuck Humphrey, Data Librarian, University of Alberta.
