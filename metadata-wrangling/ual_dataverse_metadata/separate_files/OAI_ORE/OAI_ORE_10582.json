Questions under this topic related to the respondent's job history, work characteristics, workplace and work safety. As in the past, faculty members and outside agencies submitted a variety of questions which may or may not have been related to the special topic. In addition, the questionnaire contained a number of replicated questions from previous EAS studies.","dsDescription:Date":"1983-07"},"citation:Date of Collection":{"dateOfCollection:Start":"1983-02","dateOfCollection:End":"1983-02"},"citation:Distributor":{"distributor:Name":"Digital Initiatives","distributor:Affiliation":"University of Alberta Libraries","distributor:Abbreviation":"DI","distributor:URL":"https://www.library.ualberta.ca/digital-initiatives"},"geospatial:Geographic Unit":"Province","citation:Distribution Date":"1983-07","socialscience:Universe":"Population The 1983 Edmonton Area Study population universe was designated as all persons 18 years of age and older who at the time of the survey were in a dwelling unit that was enumerated during The City of Edmonton Civic Census in the spring of 1982. Sampling As in the previous four studies the 1983 Edmonton Area Study used as its sampling frame a computerized list of addresses compiled by the City of Edmonton from their most recent enumeration (1982). From the computer tape a simple random s\r\nample of 547 addresses for personal interviewing was selected. Nursing homes and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. Within the household one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the one hour interview. Interviewers were instructed to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents within their allotment of interviews. As adult males are generally more difficult to contact, selection procedure guidelines were set for the interviewers to assist them in obtaining their quotas. The sex breakdown of the sample was 54% male and 46% female.","Kind of Data":"Microdata","Deposit Date":"2015-09-10","citation:Production Date":"1983-07","Title":"Edmonton Area Survey, 1983","Subject":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences"],"@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10582","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"3.1","schema:datePublished":"2015-09-10","schema:name":"Edmonton Area Survey, 1983","schema:dateModified":"Mon Mar 12 14:19:47 MDT 2018","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Alberta Survey","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","schema:name":"1983EdmontonAreaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1355,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4862","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4862","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":415788,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6031","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"5e239932925c6e71c33a2311c79040f9"}},{"schema:description":"Data File","schema:name":"1983EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1355,"dvcore:categories":["Data"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4864","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4864","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":354570,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6033","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-por","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Portable","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:5:EvL11QLckq9Y9p5AHBA4Tg==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"2b471edeab7985e9c8a935f8d4e3ad12"}},{"schema:description":"Methodology Report","schema:name":"1983EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1355,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4863","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4863","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":66239,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6032","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"ba3205caadc70f53a8bc37e4bef3cfdb"}}],"schema:hasPart":["https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4862","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4864","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4863"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","distributor":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/distributor#","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#","topicClassification":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/topicClassification#"}}
