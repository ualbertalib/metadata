The subject then estimated the portion sizes (volumes) of the rubber food models using either 2D or 3D Portion Size Measurement Aids (PSMAs).  After the initial interview\r\n, subjects were given either 2D or 3D PSMAs to take home with them to use in a real-world setting. After 2-4 weeks, the researcher team contacted the subjects to complete a brief telephone interview to determine parental satisfaction and usefulness regarding the 2D or 3D PSMAs.","socialscience:Universe":"Primary caregivers of children or youth attending a clinical appointment for weight management.
