It is a follow up of the 2008 Benchmark Survey (doi:10.7939/DVN/10810), providing both an update/refresh of previous findings and the opportunity to ask additional questions. The original survey in 2008 was adapted from \"What Grown-Ups Know About Child Development: A National Benchmark Study\". Not all questions in the 2008 survey were repeated in this 2013 survey, and many more questions were added.  Participants were individuals who at the time of the survey were 18 years of age or older and residents of Alberta, who could be contacted by direct dialing of residential numbers, and who had had interaction with a child under the age of 14 years in the past 6 months.  Subjects areas covered include:<br>1. Understanding of child development <br>2. Opinions about child-related issues such as breastfeeding and child care <br>3. Use of parenting supports <br>4. Parenting confidence <br>5. Children's physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep habits <br>6.

Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent, based on the following selection guidelines: 1. The respondent must be 18 years of age or older and a resident of Alberta; 2. The respondent must have had interaction with a child under 14 years of age in the past six months; 3. If there is more than one eligible respondent in the home when the interviewer calls, the person with the most recent birthday was interviewed; 4. If the quota was full for a given gender the interviewer asked for the qualifying person in the household of the opposite gender, with the most recent birthday","socialscience:Time Method":"Cross-sectional","Title":"The 2nd Provincial Benchmark Survey 2013: What Albertans Know About Child Development","socialscience:Collection Mode":"Computer-assisted telephone survey","citation:Production Date":"2013","socialscience:Data Collector":"Population Research Lab","socialscience:Type of Research Instrument":"Structured","Deposit Date":"2016-06-09","socialscience:Response Rate":"25.2%","socialscience:Other Forms of Data Appraisal":"Survey took, on average, 31 minutes to complete (excluding introductory and screening questions)","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10812","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"3.4","schema:datePublished":"2016-06-09","schema:name":"The 2nd Provincial Benchmark Survey 2013: What Albertans Know About Child Development","schema:dateModified":"Mon Sep 09 09:12:25 MDT 2019","dvcore:confidentialityDeclaration":"Yes, a confidentiality declaration is signed as part of the SAGE data access agreement","dvcore:restrictions":"This dataset is subject to Level 2 access at SAGE (access using Analytic Environment)","dvcore:citationRequirements":"-Data must be cited in any publication or report using study bibliographic citation; -Data producer(s) must receive co-authorship on any publication or report where scientifically appropriate; -The following acknowledgement is required in all manuscripts: “We are extremely grateful to all the participants who took part in this study and the whole Benchmark\r\nteam investigators, and the Research Population Laboratory.
