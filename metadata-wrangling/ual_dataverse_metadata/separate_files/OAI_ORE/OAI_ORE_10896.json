Our estimate for the development of moderate to severe episodes of acute gastroenteritis in the controls is based on data collected as part of two evaluations of the MVS in nearly 750 children in U.S. and Canadian emergency departments. Approximately 25% of eligible children had scores consistent with moderate to severe disease. Employing a baseline probability of 25% in the controls, the required sample size to compare proportions between two groups is 670. Based on previous work, a 10% loss to follow-up, 5% drop out, and 2.5% drop in probabilities was assumed. Adjustment for O'Brien-Fleming monitoring boundaries requires a further 2% increase. Thus, the final sample size required is 886.","Data Sources":"Modified Vesikari Score","socialscience:Characteristics of Data Collection Situation":"Informed consent will be obtained from each participant's legally authorized guardian prior to enrollment into the study. Once consent is provided, the first dose will be administered. The sachet's contents will be sprinkled into 30 mL of oral rehydration solution (ORS). Caregivers will receive instructions on study drug administration, completion of study forms, what and how much fluid to drink, criteria for seeing a health care practitioner.    All patients will take one sachet every 12 hours for 5 days, at meal time, even once symptoms have resolved. The dose will be repeated once should vomiting occur within 15 minutes of medication administration. Children who are hospitalized will continue as per study protocol. Daily Telephone/Electronic Survey Communication: At the first visit, caregivers will be asked their preferred method of communication (electronic or telephone). Caregivers will be contacted daily by the identified method until both the diarrhea and vomiting have resolved. A standardized collection form will be employed. Detailed questioning will follow positive responses. Data regarding revisits, intravenous hydration, hospitalization, and microbiology testing will be verified by reviewing each hospital's medical record database. Provincial databases and Canadian Institute for Health Information databases will also be empl\r\noyed to verify future health care provider use.","Deposit Date":"2016-09-29","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10896","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"3.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"Impact of Emergency Department Probiotic Treatment of Pediatric Gastroenteritis: Randomized Controlled Trial","schema:dateModified":"Fri May 26 14:58:07 MDT 2017","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false,"dvcore:availabilityStatus":"Data is not available because the study is still recruiting."},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI)","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Data dictionary for Impact of Emergency Department Probiotic Treatment of Pediatric Gastroenteritis: Randomized Controlled Trial REDCap project.
