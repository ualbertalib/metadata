The full text was retrieved for all potentially relevant articles; each was evaluated independently for eligibility by two reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion between the reviewers to establish the final list of studies to be included in the scoping review.","socialscience:Characteristics of Data Collection Situation":"The following databases were searched:  Ovid Medline; Ovid Embase;  PubMed; CINAHL via EbscoHOST;  Wiley Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment Database, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database). Grey literature, such as conference proceedings, theses and dissertations, unpublished trials, regulatory agencies and manufacturers reports, were also searched.    An information specialist working for the Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence (ARCHE) at the University of Alberta collaborated with investigators to design a search strategy with terms for NIV and children from newborn to age 18. The search strategy was developed for Ovid Medline with a validated child search filter and this filter was translated for the other databases. Two reviewers  independently screened titles and abstracts for  inclusion, followed by full-text screening of potentially relevant articles to determine final inclusion. Data synthesis was performed at three levels: (1) an analysis of the number, publication type, publication year, and country of publication of the studies; (2) a summary of the study designs, outcomes measures used; (3) a thematic analysis of included studies by subgroups. Results of searches were imported into an EndNote library, and duplicates were removed. Two exact copies of the EndNote library were created for independent screening by two reviewers. Data extraction was completed by one reviewer using a pre-designed standardized form and entered into a Microsoft Excel database. Data extraction was verified by a second reviewer for a sample of 20% of the studies.","socialscience:Frequency":"Data was collected November 2014 and May 2016.","Title":"Long-term Non-invasive Ventilation Therapies in Children: A Scoping Review","socialscience:Universe":"Eligible studies must contain information on NIV use defined as the administration of breathing support delivered through a non-invasive interface which is most commonly a nasal or face mask but also a mouth piece or abdominal belt. Studies reporting results for children from newborn to age 18 years will be included. Studies which included children and young adults were included if the mean age of the subjects was 18 or younger. Studies that include adults and children will be included if data for children is reported separately. Original studies published from 1990 onward will be considered for inclusion including randomized and non-randomized clinical trials, controlled before-after studies, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal observational studies, retrospective cohorts, qualitative and mixed methods research and case series with three or more cases.","socialscience:Cleaning Operations":"Exact duplicate records retrieved from database searches were removed in EndNote. To avoid double counting in the instance of the same data set published in more than one publication, only one article per data set was retained.","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10890","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"2.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"Long-term Non-invasive Ventilation Therapies in Children: A Scoping Review","schema:dateModified":"Fri May 26 10:48:04 MDT 2017","dvcore:restrictions":"Copyright restrictions on full text published manuscripts used for data extraction and contained in EndNote libraries apply.","dvcore:citationRequirements":"Dataverse citation required in all articles, publications or other reporting of the data results.","dvcore:conditions":"Access to data may be permitted for external researchers, with limitations.
