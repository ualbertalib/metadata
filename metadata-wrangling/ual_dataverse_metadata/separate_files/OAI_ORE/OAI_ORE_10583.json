Questions under this topic related to the respondent's attitudes and perceptions of crime, the criminal justice system, and victimization. As in the past, faculty members and outside agencies submitted a variety of questions which may or may not have been related to the special topic (See Appendix). In addition, the questionnaire contained a number of replicated questions from previous EAS studies.","dsDescription:Date":"1984-07"},"citation:Distribution Date":"1984-07","Title":"Edmonton Area Survey, 1984","geospatial:Geographic Unit":"Province","Kind of Data":"Microdata","Deposit Date":"2015-09-10","citation:Production Date":"1984-07","Subject":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences"],"socialscience:Universe":"Population The 1984 Edmonton Area Study population universe was designated as all persons 18 years of age and older who at the time of the survey were in a dwelling unit that was enumerated during The City of Edmonton Civic Census in the spring of 1983. Sampling As in the previous five studies the 1984 Edmonton Area Study used as its sampling frame a computerized list of addresses compiled by the City of Edmonton from their most recent enumeration (1983). From the computer tape a simple random sample of 560 addresses for personal interviewing was selected. Nursing homes and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. Within the household one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the one hour interview. Interviewers were instructed to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents within their allotment of interviews. As adult males are generally more difficult to contact, the following selection procedure guidelines were set for the interviewers to assist them in obtaining their quotas. a. The dwelling unit must be the person's usual place of residence and he/she must be 18 years of age or older. b. If an adult male answers the door and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. c. If an adult female answers the door and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male. If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female. d. If an adult female answers the door and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent. Less than 5% of the first eligible persons from whom an interview was requested, refused. Fifty-two percent of these persons were female and 48% male. Their median age was estimated to be 43 years. The final sex breakdown of the sample, using the above procedures, was 51% male and 49% female.","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10583","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"3.1","schema:datePublished":"2015-09-10","schema:name":"Edmonton Area Survey, 1984","schema:dateModified":"Mon Mar 12 14:24:47 MDT 2018","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Alberta Survey","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","schema:name":"1984EdmontonAlbertaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1356,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4865","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4865","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":410987,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6034","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"6e5a23b9ea394af3533402747de2e7eb"}},{"schema:description":"Data File","schema:name":"1984EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1356,"dvcore:categories":["Data"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4867","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4867","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":382036,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6036","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-por","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Portable","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:5:nXBpxuBQi3XgiGlOEAdqrQ==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"b5048cec288ba351a11bd1834e4361bc"}},{"schema:description":"Methodology Report","schema:name":"1984EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1356,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4866","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4866","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":72579,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6035","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"9b4f3257763b835dba8833f98acd87c4"}}],"schema:hasPart":["https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4865","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4867","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4866"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","distributor":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/distributor#","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#","topicClassification":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/topicClassification#"}}
