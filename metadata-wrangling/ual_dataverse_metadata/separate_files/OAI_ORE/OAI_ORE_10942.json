Scientists know much less, however, about the relationship between prenatal nutrition and health (for the mother and child).  The Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study is a longitudinal, prospective cohort in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada designed to investigate the relationship between maternal nutrient intake/status before, during and after gestation and a) maternal mood, b) birth and obstetric outcomes, and c) infant neurodevelopment.  The data for approximately 5000 participants (2200 pregnant women, their offspring and many of their partners) includes information about maternal nutrition, anthropometric, biological, and mental health data at multiple points in pregnancy and the postpartum period, as well as obstetric, birth, health and neurodevelopment outcomes of these pregnancies and infants. Data from the APrON cohort can be used to answer questions related to prenatal nutrition, health and well-being and how they can impact neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes from infancy to childhood.  Anchor participants were women over 16 years who can understand and answer questions in English, are pregnant for less than 27 weeks and are living in or near Calgary or Edmonton were eligible for recruitment into this study. Associated participants are the biological fathers and offspring resulting from study pregnancies.   At this date this deposit of APrON data includes only the anthropometric measurements and questionnaires of survey mothers at the time of pregnancy and immediately post-partum.\r\n<br><br><strong>These metadata can also be found on SAGE's searchable metadata website:<br>\r\nhttp://sagemetadata.policywise.com/nada/index.php/catalog/10</strong>"},"citation:Producer":{"producer:Name":"Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition Team","producer:Affiliation":"University of Calgary","producer:Abbreviation":"APrON team","producer:URL":"http://www.apronstudy.ca/"},"Time Period Covered":{"timePeriodCovered:Start":"2009","timePeriodCovered:End":"2013"},"citation:Date of Collection":{"dateOfCollection:Start":"2009","dateOfCollection:End":"2013"},"Grant Information":{"grantNumber:Grant Agency":"Alberta Innovates Health Solutions"},"citation:Production Place":"Alberta, Canada","socialscience:Other Forms of Data Appraisal":"There is an over-representation of Caucasian mothers with higher socio-economic status compared to the Canadian population","Subject":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"],"socialscience:Universe":"Pregnant women over 16 years who can understand and answer questions in English and are living in or near Calgary or Edmonton.","Kind of Data":"Questionnaire; Anthropometric Measurements","socialscience:Response Rate":"Variable depending on questionnaire","socialscience:Weighting":"None","socialscience:Collection Mode":"Questionnaire; Anthropometric measurement","Deposit Date":"2016-08-29","socialscience:Time Method":"Longitudinal","socialscience:Type of Research Instrument":"Structured","socialscience:Cleaning Operations":"-Removal of duplicate participant data; -Blank cells coded with appropriate values; -Values checked for consistency; -Illogical values were checked with original hard copies of questionnaires.","Title":"Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON)","citation:Subtitle":"APrON","citation:Distribution Date":"2016","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10942","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"6.1","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-17","schema:name":"Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON)","schema:dateModified":"Mon Sep 09 09:09:51 MDT 2019","dvcore:termsOfUse":"Data must be cited in any publication or report using data bibliographic citation; \r\nData producer(s) must receive co-authorship on any publication or report where scientifically appropriate (as per publication authorship guidelines)","dvcore:restrictions":"APrON data is accessed via SAGE Analytic Environment only.
