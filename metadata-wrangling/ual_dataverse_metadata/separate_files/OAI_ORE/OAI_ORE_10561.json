Province of Alberta delineated into three areas for telephone interviewing. (1)City of Edmonton. (2)City of Calgary. (3)Remainder of the Province (Other Alberta). b.Two-stage selection process. (1)Selection of households. (2)Selection of respondent within each household. To permit the analysis of each area as a separate entity a minimum sample size of 400 or more for each area of the province was deemed necessary. The population universe designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta that could be contacted by direct-dialing. From this population, three samples were drawn to cover the areas: the City of Edmonton (EAS) , the City of Calgary, and the remainder of the region. For the past five studies, the PRL has annually developed and updated computer files of five-digit telephone banks covering all of Alberta. The samples were drawn from these files by selecting, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected. All duplicate numbers were discarded. Nursing homes and temporary residences were screened from the sample. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the forty minute interview. A respondent was selected within each household on the basis of gender using the following selection guidelines to ensure an equal selection of male and female participants . a. The dwelling unit must be the person's usual place of residence and he/she must be 18 years of age or older. b. If an adult male answers the phone and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. c. If an adult female answers the phone and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, int\r\nerview the male. If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female. d. If an adult female answers the phone and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent.","Subject":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences"],"socialscience:Response Rate":"The 1991 response rate for Calgary was 73.7%, for Edmonton 71.1% and 77.9% for the rest of Alberta","socialscience:Cleaning Operations":"The data were tabulated and cleaned using the OSIRIS and SPSSx statistical packages, and special programs developed by the PRL.
