The data was collected between October 2019 - April 2020, and reviewed and updated in July-August 2020. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFor the purposes of this project, the following inclusion criteria were used: \r\n<ol>\r\n<il><b>Canadian</b>: a minimum of one-third of the core editorial board is affiliated with an eligible Canadian post-secondary institution. We used this as the primary criteria and not whether or not the journal title is owned by a Canadian not-for-profit organization. As we are interested primarily in labour, limiting it based on the editorial board was natural for this study.</il><br>\r\n<il><b>Independent</b>: A journal is not affiliated with a commercial publisher (e.g. Springer, Elsevier, Sage, etc.). Non-profits, like Ã‰rudit and University of Toronto Press, were included in the project.</il><br>\r\n<il><b>Scholarly</b>:  defined as a peer-reviewed academic publication that disseminates the results of original scholarship. We have excluded additional student-run journals as per the SSHRC guidelines as well.</il>\r\n<il><b>Active</b>: The journal has published in the last 3 years.</il><br>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second list is of the journals that we removed from our original data collection that did not meet the above criteria when reviewed. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFor more information on the project you can see the presentation slides from the Library Publishing Forum when the initial results were discussed: <a href=\"https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/presentations/7w62fd646?locale=en\">https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/presentations/7w62fd646?locale=en</a> and a forthcoming article in the <i>Journal of Electronic Publishing</i> (May 2020)"},"Subject":["Arts and Humanities","Other"],"citation:Keyword":{"keyword:Term":"Scholarly Publishing"},"Language":"English","citation:Production Place":"Canada","citation:Depositor":"Severson, Sarah","Deposit Date":"2021-02-03","citation:Date of Collection":{"dateOfCollection:Start":"2019-10-01","dateOfCollection:End":"2020-04-28"},"@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/EPSJJR","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"2.0","schema:datePublished":"2021-04-29","schema:name":"List of Canadian independent, scholarly journals (2020)","schema:dateModified":"2021-10-01 14:48:50.219","dvcore:termsOfUse":"This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License CC BY 4.0.","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"UAlberta Research Data Collection","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Codebook that describes the codes for the main list of journals.
