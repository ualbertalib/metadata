They filled out a 'MyHealth Passport' with information about their health. The study nurse also completed a log and field notes to document any difficulties that were encountered during the intervention and the participant's reaction, level of engagement, questions and body language. Adolescents in the control group received standard of care. They saw a nurse only to measure weight, height, and blood pressure and relied on their cardiologist for information about their heart condition.    All adolescents completed three short questionnaires at the start of the study, and completed them again 1 month later and 6 months later. The follow-up questionnaires were either mailed to participants or done via the internet.    Medical charts were reviewed only for information about participants' heart condition, such as the name of the heart condition, cardiac operations or procedures, cardiac medications, cardiology clinic notes, and inpatient notes for cardiac problems. A nursing log and text and email follow-up of the transition intervention will also be analysed. Upon completing the study questionnaires at the 1 month and 6 month intervals participants were sent a $25 gift certificate.","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10906","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"2.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"The CHAPTER I Study: Evaluation of Novel Transition Interventions for Youth With Congenital Heart Disease","schema:dateModified":"Fri May 26 15:23:04 MDT 2017","dvcore:conditions":"Access to deidentified data may be permitted for external researchers, with limitations.
