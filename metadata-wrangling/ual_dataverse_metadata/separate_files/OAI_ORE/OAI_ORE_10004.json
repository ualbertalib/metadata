The PRL specializes in the gathering, analysis, and presentation of data about demographic, social and public issues.    The PRL research team provides expert consultation and implementation of quantitative and qualitative research methods, project design, sample design, web-based, paper-based and telephone surveys, field site testing, data analysis and report writing. The PRL follows scientifically rigorous and transparent methods in each phase of a research project. Research Coordinators are members of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and use best practices when conducting all types of research.    The PRL has particular expertise in conducting computer-assisted telephone interviews (referred to as CATI surveys). When conducting telephone surveys, all calls are displayed as being from the \"U of A PRL\", a procedure that assures recipients that the call is not from a telemarketer, and thus helps increase response rates. The PRL maintains a complement of highly skilled telephone interviewers and supervisors who are thoroughly trained in FOIPP requirements, respondent selection procedures, questionnaire instructions, and neutral probing. A subset of interviewers are specially trained to convince otherwise reluctant respondents to participate in the study, a practice that increases response rates and lowers selection bias. PRL staff monitors data collection on a daily basis to allow any necessary adjustments to the volume and timing of calls and respondent selection criteria.    The Population Research Laboratory (PRL) administered the 2012 Alberta Survey B. This survey of households across the province of Alberta continues to enable academic researchers, government departments, and non-profit organizations to explore a wide range of topics in a structured research framework and environment. Sponsors' research questions are asked together with demographic questions in a telephone interview of Alberta households.    This data consists of the information from 1207 Alberta residence, interviewed between June 5, 2012 and June 27, 2012. The amount of responses indicates that the response rate, as calculated percentages representing the number of people who participated in the survey divided by the number selected in the eligible sample, was 27.6% for survey B.    The subject ares included in the 2012 Alberta Survey B includes socio-demographic and background variables such as: household composition, age, gender, marital status, highest level of education, household income, religion, ethnic background, place of birth, employment status, home ownership, political party support and perceptions of financial status. In addition, the topics of public health and injury control, tobacco reduction, activity limitations and personal directives, unions, politics and health.","dsDescription:Date":"2012-08-31"},"Time Period Covered":{"timePeriodCovered:Start":"2012-07","timePeriodCovered:End":"2012-07"},"citation:Contact":{"datasetContact:Name":"Digital Initaitives","datasetContact:Affiliation":"University of Alberta Libraries","datasetContact:E-mail":"data@ualberta.ca"},"citation:Date of Collection":{"dateOfCollection:Start":"2012-07-03","dateOfCollection:End":"2012-07-18"},"citation:Producer":{"producer:Name":"Population Research Laboratory","producer:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","producer:Abbreviation":"PRL"},"Author":{"author:Name":"Population Research Laboratory","author:Affiliation":"Department of Sociology, University of Alberta"},"citation:Other ID":{"otherId:Identifier":"AAS2012B"},"socialscience:Universe":"This data consists of information collected from 1207 respondents (604 female and 603 male) over the age of 18.

The open-ended codes were then merged with the main SPSS data file for additional cleaning and labelling.","Title":"Alberta Survey, 2012B","socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individuals","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"The main feature of the sampling design was a two-stage selection process: first, based on a selection of households, and second, the selection of a respondent within each household.   The Alberta Survey B aimed for a total sample size of 1200 households across Alberta, with a minimum of 400 respondents in Metropolitan Edmonton, 400 in Metropolitan Calgary, and 400 from the remainder of the province (other Alberta). The target population was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit that could be contacted by direct dialling.    The PRL used a Random-Digit Dialling (RDD) approach to ensure that respondents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory. The PRL has developed a database of eight-digit telephone banks covering the Edmonton and Calgary metropolitan areas, as well as the remainder of the province. The 2012 Alberta Survey B sample was generated from these databases by using a computer program to select, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected. Duplicate telephone numbers were purged from the computer list. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent. A respondent within each household was selected on the basis of gender using the following selection guidelines to ensure an equal selection of male and female participants.    Some considerations when selecting the individuals interviewed:   a. He/she must be 18 years of age or older.   b. If an adult male answers the phone and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent.   c. If an adult female answers the phone and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male. If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female.   d. If an adult female answers the phone and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent.   e. If the quota for females is full and a female answers the phone, provided the household has an eligible male, make an appointment to interview the male.    The final sample of 1,207 respondents consisted of 604 females and 603 males.   In terms of sampling error, this study is based on a sample of adults in Alberta rather than the total population of adults in Alberta. All of the descriptive statistics, such as means and percentages, which are calculated using the sample data, could be subject to sampling error. The sampling error is a measure of the validity of the descriptive statistics that are observed in a sample. The estimated sampling error, at the 95% confidence level, for an area sample of 1,207 households assuming a 50/50 binomial percentage distribution is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Survey estimates for the subsample of 400 are estimated to be within plus or minus 5.0 percentage points, at the 95% confidence level.","Subject":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences"],"socialscience:Time Method":"The main data collection began on June 5, 2012 and was completed on June 27, 2012.
