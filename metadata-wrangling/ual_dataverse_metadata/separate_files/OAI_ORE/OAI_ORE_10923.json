The goal of the RCT is to compare: 1) a walking training program with the Lokomat robotic device (LOK), 2) a functional physical therapy program (fPT) that includes activities to enhance balance/co-ordination/endurance and advanced motor skills conducted over 'real ground', 3) a combined Lokomat + functional physical therapy (LOK+fPT) program, and 4) a regular maintenance therapy condition (CONT).

An additional 16 participants will be recruited to accommodate an estimated 10 % drop out rate (144/.9) for a total of 160. The 10 % drop out rate was based on the current 7 % drop out rate in the feasibility trial conducted at Holland Bloorview. Sample size calculations were based on pre- to post-intervention change on the primary outcome (Gross Motor Function Measure-66) (GMFM-66) and a two-factor factorial design (F tests). PASS software was used to calculate sample size.     Qualitative: Target sample size: 18 RCT participant child-parent dyads (6 dyads from each site) and 3 parents from each site who declined participation in the RCT. The estimated sample size is based on theoretical understanding of the complexity and variability of the data.","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10923","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"3.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Robotic
