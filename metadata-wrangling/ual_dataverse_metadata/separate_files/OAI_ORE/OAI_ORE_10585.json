Define the criteria for food security in the identified target communities 2. Describe the level of food security among the designated target populations and identify the barriers which prevent them from obtaining nutritious, high quality foods. 3. Inform the Edmonton public and key stakeholders in the food industry of the survey results, and engage them in discussion to produce proposals for action that redress the barriers to food security. 4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies, processes and outcomes of the project with respect to developing healthy public policy and community action.  Key objectives for the survey: 1. to find out who is experiencing food insecurity in Edmonton and how many people are having difficulty getting enough healthy affordable food. 2. To find out why these people are experiencing food insecurity and to identify the barriers to food security. 3. To identify existing coping strategies of low income people--strategies that help to reduce their experience of food insecurity. 4. To identify potential solutions as seen by those people experiencing food insecurity. 5. To gather information that has programming implications or that suggests needed policy changes for joint action by the community, business and government to address the issues of food security in Edmonton.","dsDescription:Date":"1992-05"},"Time Period Covered":{"timePeriodCovered:Start":"1990-11","timePeriodCovered:End":"1990-12"},"citation:Distributor":{"distributor:Name":"Digital Initiatives","distributor:Affiliation":"University of Alberta Libraries","distributor:Abbreviation":"DI","distributor:URL":"https://www.library.ualberta.ca/digital-initiatives"},"geospatial:Geographic Coverage":[{"geographicCoverage:Country / Nation":"Canada"},{"geographicCoverage:Other":"City of Edmonton"}],"Deposit Date":"2015-09-14","Subject":"Social Sciences","citation:Production Date":"1992-05","Title":"Edmonton Food Policy Council Study, 1990","socialscience:Universe":"Four hundred and sixty low-income Edmontonians in families with children under aged 18 or singles. Low income was defined by the low income cutoff of Statistics Canada where more than 58.5% of income is spent on food, clothing, and shelter.  A conscious effort was made to identify respondents from all parts of the city. Non-government agencies provided many referrals for the inner city and the northeast sector where there is high incidence of low-income residents. Subsidized housing complexes, Edmonton Community and Family Services, and Alberta Family and Social Services District Offices for Income Security were used to provide respondents in the North, West, and South. These areas are noticeably lacking in social service agencies as compared with the inner city and the Northeast.","geospatial:Geographic Unit":"City of Edmonton","citation:Distribution Date":"1992-05","Kind of Data":"Microdata","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10585","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"2.1","schema:datePublished":"2015-09-15","schema:name":"Edmonton Food Policy Council Study, 1990","schema:dateModified":"Fri Mar 16 10:53:10 MDT 2018","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Edmonton Food Policy Council","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","schema:name":"1990EdmontonFoodPolicyCouncil_Codebook.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1265,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4877","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4877","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":1956192,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6048","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"b0b40ed4846b44bba1e27af2eec1104a"}},{"schema:description":"Data File","schema:name":"1990EdmontonFoodPolicyCouncil_Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1265,"dvcore:categories":["Data"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4869","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4869","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":477765,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6039","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-por","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Portable","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:5:v1Me/pUGSlUuFMZUpoRq6Q==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"fec0883a80d0c19e49361131e9d97e02"}},{"schema:description":"Methodology Report and Findings","schema:name":"1990EdmontonFoodPolicyCouncil_Report.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1265,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4878","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4878","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":3252002,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6049","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"aec66ebb643c13c9265879ba98954bea"}}],"schema:hasPart":["https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4877","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4869","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4878"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","distributor":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/distributor#","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#","topicClassification":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/topicClassification#"}}
