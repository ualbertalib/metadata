The investigators are interested to see if those patients with documented middle ear effusions, as determined by tympanometry, have higher rates of eventual antibiotic usage than those with normal tympanometry results. If there is a significant disparity between those with a positive tympanogram and those without the investigators may be able to identify a group that will benefit from antibiotics and a group that would not need treatment."},"socialscience:Target Sample Size":{"targetSampleSize:Actual":"137"},"citation:Contact":{"datasetContact:Name":"Craig, William","datasetContact:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","datasetContact:E-mail":"wcraig@ualberta.ca"},"Time Period Covered":{"timePeriodCovered:Start":"2013-10","timePeriodCovered:End":"2017-06"},"citation:Other ID":{"otherId:Agency":"ClinicalTrials.gov","otherId:Identifier":"NCT01941381"},"Grant Information":{"grantNumber:Grant Agency":"Department of Pediatrics SEED Funding Grant"},"socialscience:Universe":"All children, aged 6 months to 16 years with clinically diagnosed Otitis Media presenting to the Pediatric Emergency Department at Stollery Children's Hospital who will be treated with the standard delayed ant\r\nibiotic strategy.","Title":"Does Tympanometry Predict Antibiotic Usage in Acute Otitis Media?","Deposit Date":"2016-09-27","socialscience:Actions to Minimize Losses":"Study participants are phoned at day 3 and day 8.","socialscience:Collection Mode":"Face-to-face interview; Telephone interview; Physical measurements and tests; Database review","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"Convenience Sample: All patients diagnosed with Otitis Media will be approached for study enrollment within the hours a research assistant is available.
