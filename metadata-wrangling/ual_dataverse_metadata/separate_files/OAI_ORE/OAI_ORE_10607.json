This sampling bias was taken into account by comparing responses by gender.","Title":"University of Alberta Graduand Survey, 1994","citation:Distribution Date":"1994-12","Kind of Data":"Microdata","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10607","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"2.0","schema:datePublished":"2015-10-13","schema:name":"University of Alberta Graduand Survey, 1994","schema:dateModified":"Tue Oct 13 10:41:06 MDT 2015","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"University of Alberta Graduand Survey","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Data File","schema:name":"1994GraduandSurvey_Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":1,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":380,"dvcore:categories":["Data"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=5755","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/5755","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":450347,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6957","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Binary","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:5:z04odraeZLUA0tXN1cFxdA==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"34447b423bcec4f8e0dbe32733613a53"}},{"schema:description":"Sampling Report and Questionnaire","schema:name":"1994GraduandSurvey_Report.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":1,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":380,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=5784","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/5784","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":3562068,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6988","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"5be92fba0b0989cf54557dbf5d34a503"}}],"schema:hasPart":["https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=5755","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=5784"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","distributor":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/distributor#","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","topicClassification":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/topicClassification#"}}
