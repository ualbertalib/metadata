MBSR programs consist of instruction in a variety of mindfulness meditations including body scan, sitting meditation, mindful yoga, and discussion of these practices. The purpose of this study was to develop and conduct a pilot mixed-methods randomized controlled trial (RCT), combining clinical outcomes, qualitative interviews, and brain imaging to assess the impact of the intervention on children with mental health challenges."},"citation:Production Date":"2011","Subject":"Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","citation:Production Place":"Edmonton, Alberta","Kind of Data":"Interview data; Brain imaging data; Survey data","socialscience:Collection Mode":"Face-to-face interview; Physical measurements and tests; Psychological measurements and tests","Data Sources":"Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2); Child Acceptance and Mindfulness Measure (CAMM); Emotion regulation in childhood and adolescence (ERQ-CA); Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)","Title":"Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction for Pediatric Mental Health","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"There were 85 study participants.","socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individuals","socialscience:Universe":"Adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 who are residents of the inpatient treatment facility for adolescents with serious mental health issues.","socialscience:Frequency":"Data was collected at baseline, and after 10 weeks, 12 weeks and 3 months.","biomedical:Design Type":"Randomized Controlled Trial","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10920","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"1.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction for Pediatric Mental Health","schema:dateModified":"Mon May 29 13:32:06 MDT 2017","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI)","ore:aggregates":[],"schema:hasPart":[]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Data Sources":"https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasDerivedFrom","Identifier":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/AgentIdentifier","Identifier Scheme":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/AgentIdentifierScheme","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","biomedical":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/biomedical#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","otherId":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/otherId#","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#"}}
