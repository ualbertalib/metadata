Questions under this topic related to the degree of the respondent's participation in various cultural and leisure activities within the city. As in the past, faculty members and outside agencies submitted a variety of questions covering topics such as, personal health and environmental issues in Alberta. In addition, the questionnaire contained a number of replicated questions from previous EAS studies.","dsDescription:Date":"1982-09"},"citation:Distribution Date":"1982-09","citation:Production Date":"1982-09","Title":"Edmonton Area Survey, 1982","geospatial:Geographic Unit":"Province","Deposit Date":"2015-09-10","Subject":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences"],"Kind of Data":"Microdata","socialscience:Universe":"Population The 1982 Edmonton Area Study population universe was designated as all persons 18 years of age and older, who at the time of the survey were in a dwelling unit that was enumerated during the City of Edmonton's annual civic census in the spring of 1981. Sampling As in the previous three studies, the 1982 Edmonton Area Study used as its sampling frame a computerized list of addresses compiled by the City of Edmonton from their most recent enumeration (1981). From the computer tape a simple random sample of 667 addresses for personal interviewing was selected. Nursing homes and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. Within the household one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the one hour interview. Interviewers were instructed to obtain an equal number of male and female respondents within their allotment of interviews. As adult males are generally more difficult to contact, selection procedure guidelines were set for the interviewers to assist them in obtaining their quotas. The final sample sex breakdown was 47.3% male and 52.7% female.","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10581","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"3.1","schema:datePublished":"2015-09-10","schema:name":"Edmonton Area Survey, 1982","schema:dateModified":"Mon Mar 12 14:17:21 MDT 2018","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Alberta Survey","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","schema:name":"1982EdmontonAreaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1354,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4859","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4859","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":477063,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6028","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"72e8b587dda7997e19342bb809bb8392"}},{"schema:description":"Data File","schema:name":"1982EdmontonAreaSurvey_Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1354,"dvcore:categories":["Data"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4861","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4861","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":474742,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6030","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-por","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Portable","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:5:5SdgraOaYz+HVFvtz1TwsQ==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"d445d5f99db2646905ae01afd1a7a387"}},{"schema:description":"Methodology Report","schema:name":"1982EdmontonAreaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1354,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4860","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4860","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":94910,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://6029","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"496698aa0b1fda2da4b38913fc99f4bd"}}],"schema:hasPart":["https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4859","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4861","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4860"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","distributor":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/distributor#","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#","topicClassification":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/topicClassification#"}}
