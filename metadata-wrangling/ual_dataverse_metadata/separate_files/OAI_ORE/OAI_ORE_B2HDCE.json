With growing numbers of such children in our society, especially in our inner cities, this research is timely and has the promise of offering a cost effective and efficient way to address this social issue.\r\n\r\nThis pilot study is desighed to precede Phase 1 of a 2-Phase study-- to compare two readily available community-based early intervention programs designed to improve menta health outcomes for at risk infants and their caregivers. Two intervention groups will receive regular home visits and/or telephone supervision by either advanced clinical practitioners (ACP) or by volunteer foster grandmothers and these will be compared with a control group receiving normally available postpartum care. Phase 1 interventions will begin at birth and continue throughout the infants' first 18 months of life. Phase 2 will focus on the infants' development through 3 years of age.","dsDescription:Date":"2014-08-27"},"citation:Date of Collection":{"dateOfCollection:Start":"1996-04-01","dateOfCollection:End":"1997-12-30"},"Title":"Infants at Psychosocial Risk","Subject":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"],"Deposit Date":"2018-06-14","citation:Depositor":"PolicyWise, SAGE","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/B2HDCE","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"1.4","schema:datePublished":"2018-06-22","schema:name":"Infants at Psychosocial Risk","schema:dateModified":"Fri Jun 22 10:39:30 MDT 2018","schema:license":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Secondary Analysis to Generate Evidence (SAGE)","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:name":"S10_PsychosocialRisk_full_metadata_v1.0.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":1,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1390,"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=9063","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/9063","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":750535,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://1642840f065-0e67e41a94fd","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"08b505f456bba7b07794668a2847fdbb"}}],"schema:hasPart":["https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=9063"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","schema":"http://schema.org/","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#"}}
