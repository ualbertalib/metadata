This random sample survey of households in the province of Alberta has enabled academic research\r\ners, local community agencies, and government departments to explore a broad spectrum of social issues in an on-going research framework. Owing to the large number of questions submitted by researchers and organizations, the 1995 Alberta Survey was conducted in three segments. Three independent samples were drawn and administered separate questionnaires.","dsDescription:Date":"1995"},"geospatial:Geographic Unit":"Province","socialscience:Time Method":"Cross-sectional.","citation:Production Place":"Population Research Laboratory, Department of Sociology, University of Alberta.","Kind of Data":"Survey Data.","citation:Distribution Date":"1995-06","socialscience:Type of Research Instrument":"Survey","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"SAMPLING DESIGN Main Features of Design: a. Province of Alberta delineated into three areas for telephone interviewing. (1) City of Edmonton. (2) City of Calgary. (3) Remainder of the Province (Other Alberta). b. Two-stage selection process. (1) Selection of households. (2) Selection of respondent within each household. To permit the analysis of each area as a separate entity a minimum sample size of 400 or more for each area of the province was deemed necessary. The population universe designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta that could be contacted by direct-dialing. From this population, three samples were drawn to cover the province: the City of Edmonton (EAS) , the City of Calgary, and the remainder of the region. For the past nine studies, the PRL has annually developed and updated a database of five-digit telephone banks covering all of Alberta. The 1995 area samples were drawn from this database by selecting, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected. All duplicate numbers were discarded. Nursing homes and temporary residences were deleted from the sample. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the thirty-five minute interview. A respondent was selected within each household on the basis of gender using the following selection guidelines to ensure an equal selection of male and female participants. a. The dwelling unit must be the person's usual place of residence and he/she must be 18 years of age or older. b. If an adult male answers the phone and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. c. If an adult female answers the phone and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male. If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, interview the female. d. If an adult female answers the phone and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent.","socialscience:Weighting":"The weighting factors used for the 1995 survey are as follows: Edmonton: .769245 Calgary: .839148 Other Alberta: 1.403448","Title":"Alberta Survey, 1995A","socialscience:Frequency":"One-time data collection.","socialscience:Universe":"The population universe designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta that could be contacted by direct-dialing.

Before administering the questionnaire the interviewer advised the respondents that their participation was voluntary, their responses would be kept completely confidential and they could stop the interview at any time. Seventeen percent of the respondents were re-contacted by the supervisors for interviewing validation. No significant discrepancies or irregularities were found. A team of six experienced interviewers made call backs to reluctant householders to explain further the purpose of the survey and to request an interview again. The conversion efforts increased the overall response rate by approximately twelve percent. Forty-three percent of the householders called back agreed to do an interview . Because of the high number of householders who agree to an interview on a subsequent call, this re-contacting procedure for reluctant householders is essential to obtaining good response rates and quality data.
