We recruited consecutive infants with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) to undergo ventilatory response testing using exposure to a hypoxic (15% O(2) ) gas mixture during sleep. This population is at high risk of SDB because of smaller airway caliber and abnormal palatal muscle attachments predisposing them to airway obstruction of ranging severity from birth."},"socialscience:Target Sample Size":{"targetSampleSize:Actual":"22"},"Author":[{"author:Name":"MacLean, Joanna","author:Affiliation":"University of Alberta","Identifier Scheme":"ORCID","Identifier":"0000-0001-7994-9910"},{"author:Name":"Tan, Sara","author:Affiliation":"University of Sydney"},{"author:Name":"Fitzgerald, Dominic","author:Affiliation":"University of Sydney"},{"author:Name":"Waters, Karen","author:Affiliation":"University of Sydney","Identifier Scheme":"ORCID","Identifier":"0000-0001-8699-2175"}],"Time Period Covered":{"timePeriodCovered:Start":"2007-08","timePeriodCovered:End":"2009-02"},"Grant Information":{"grantNumber:Grant Agency":"Foundation for Children"},"citation:Producer":{"producer:Name":"MacLean, Joanna","producer:Affiliation":"University of Alberta"},"Related Publication":{"Citation":"MacLean, JE, Tan, S, Fitzgerald, DA and Waters, KA (2013), Assessing ventilatory control in infants at high risk of sleep disordered breathing: A study of infants with cleft lip and/or palate.
