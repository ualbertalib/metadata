This study will help to develop educational tools for improving knowledge regarding pregnancy and IBD. Pre- and post- intervention reproductive knowledge was compared using the CCPKnow (Crohn's and Colitis Pregnancy Knowle\r\ndge) survey. Patient factors (age, reproductive history, IBD history, medications, education, marital status, clinic/specialist access) and preferences for knowledge translation method were measured and assessed. If a patient was randomized to the interactive group, the effectiveness of videos, slides, sets, PDFs, and mini quizzes were compared. Usage was also tracked, including time spent on modules and components of modules,  number of times accessed."},"Grant Information":{"grantNumber:Grant Agency":"Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions (AIHS)"},"Time Period Covered":{"timePeriodCovered:Start":"2014","timePeriodCovered:End":"2016"},"socialscience:Frequency":"Data collected at baseline, 2 months, and 8 months.","citation:Production Date":"2014","Title":"Improving Knowledge Regarding Pregnancy and Inflammatory Bowel Disease","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"The target sample size was 100 study participants; the actual sample size was 80 study participants.","socialscience:Universe":"Adults (both females and males) who have IBD and their partners.","socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individuals","socialscience:Response Rate":"80%","citation:Related Material":"Huang VW, Chang H-J, Kroeker KI, et al.
