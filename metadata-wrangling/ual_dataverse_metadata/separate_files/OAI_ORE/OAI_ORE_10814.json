Despite this, 33% of Canadians believe that mental health problems are rare, and 42% of Canadians would not want to reveal that they had a mental illness.  The What Albertans Know About Youth Mental Health 2010 Survey is a computer-assisted telephone survey of Alberta adults conducted in 2010 by the Population Research Lab as part of the 2010 Alberta Survey (doi:10.7939/DVN/10008). Questions commissioned by PolicyWise for Children\r\n& Families (formerly the Alberta Centre for Child, Family and Community Research) aimed to better understand public knowledge and attitudes towards youth and mental health in the hopes of informing strategies to improve mental health literacy.\r\n\r\n<strong><br><br>These metadata can also be found on SAGE's searchable metadata website:<br>\r\nhttp://sagemetadata.policywise.com/nada/index.php/catalog/8</strong>"},"citation:Keyword":[{"keyword:Term":"Youth"},{"keyword:Term":"Mental Health"}],"Time Period Covered":{"timePeriodCovered:Start":"2010","timePeriodCovered:End":"2010"},"geospatial:Geographic Coverage":[{"geographicCoverage:Country / Nation":"Canada"},{"geographicCoverage:Other":"Calgary, Alberta; Edmonton, Alberta; Rest of Alberta"}],"Software":{"software:Name":"SPSS"},"citation:Producer":{"producer:Name":"Population Research Lab","producer:Affiliation":"Department of Sociology, University of Alberta","producer:Abbreviation":"PRL","producer:URL":"http://www.prl.ualberta.ca/"},"citation:Date of Collection":{"dateOfCollection:Start":"2010-05-27","dateOfCollection:End":"2010-07-16"},"citation:Distributor":{"distributor:Name":"Secondary Analysis to Generate Evidence","distributor:Affiliation":"PolicyWise for Children & Families","distributor:Abbreviation":"SAGE","distributor:URL":"http://www.policywise.com/initiatives/sage"},"citation:Contact":{"datasetContact:Name":"Secondary Analysis to Generate Evidence","datasetContact:Affiliation":"PolicyWise for Children & Families","datasetContact:E-mail":"data@policywise.com"},"socialscience:Universe":"Individuals over 18 years of age whose residence can be reached by random direct-dialing","citation:Production Date":"2010","citation:Production Place":"Edmonton, Alberta","socialscience:Weighting":"'wtx' used to weight responses against Statistics Canada population estimates","socialscience:Characteristics of Data Collection Situation":"Overarching survey (Alberta Survey 2010) took, on average, 40 minutes to complete (excluding introductory and screening questions)","socialscience:Cleaning Operations":"Automatic routing of questions and built-in checks for inconsistencies and out-of-range codes.
