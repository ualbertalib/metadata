The primary outcome assessment was the mean change from baseline on the visual analog scale (VAS) at 30 minutes. In addition, other pain assessment scales were used to assess their correlation including the five-faces pain scale and the four-level pain scale (ie, none, mild, moderate, and severe). Secondary outcome measures included pain-free status at 30 minutes, headache relief calculated as a change from baseline of greater than or equal to 33%, headache relief calculated as a 50% change from baseline, meaningful headache relief defined as a change from baseline of 30?mm or more, nausea as assessed using the VAS, return to the ED, hospital admission, patient satisfaction, and adverse events. All participants received standard care chosen by the treating ED physician following the initial IV fluid assessment phase. Prior to discharge, the participants were asked about the level of satisfaction with their overall treatment. Participants were also followed up by telephone at 24 hours to assess for adverse events, return to ED, and satisfaction with treatment.","socialscience:Universe":"Patients between 5 and 17 years presenting to the Emergency Department  with a diagnosis of acute migraine in whom intravenous treatment was planned based on standard care.","socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individuals","biomedical:Design Type":"Randomized Controlled Trial","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10915","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"2.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"Single-blind, Placebo-challenge Study of Intravenous Fluid Hydration in the Management of Pediatric Migraine in the Emergency Department","schema:dateModified":"Mon May 29 13:44:55 MDT 2017","dvcore:conditions":"Access to deidentified data may be permitted for external researchers, with limitations.
