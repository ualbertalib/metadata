The Population Research Laboratory uses the index of dissimilarity 10 for age distributions to provide a measure of sample representativeness.   The Statistics Canada 1996 Census Age Profile in Alberta is used for comparison with the 2000 Alberta Survey sample. The profile is broken down by the following age groups: 18 - 24 years, 25 - 34 years, 35 - 44 years, 45 - 54 years, 55 - 64 years, and over 65.   Respondents to the 2000 Alberta Survey were asked their age in years, and the results were grouped according to the Statistics Canada 1996 Census Age Profile groupings.   The index of dissimilarity for the total sample is 3.0, while the index of dissimilarity for the Calgary sub-sample is 3.25, and the index of dissimilarity for the Edmonton sub-sample is 5.55. A difference of 10 or less indicates that there is a similar distribution in the samples with less than 10 percent variation overall. Thus, the indexes of dissimilarity for the total sample and the sub-samples demonstrate that the samples reflect the populations from which they were drawn on this dimension.","socialscience:Weighting":"The weighting factors used for the 2000 survey are as follows: Edmonton .711537 Calgary .883280 Other Alberta 1.405904","geospatial:Geographic Unit":"Province","Subject":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences"],"citation:Production Date":"2000-12","citation:Production Place":"Population Research Laboratory, Department of Sociology, University of Alberta","socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individual","socialscience:Time Method":"Cross-Sectional","citation:Distribution Date":"2000-12","socialscience:Collection Mode":"Telephone interview","socialscience:Type of Research Instrument":"Structured, with a small number of open-ended questions.

The latter set of questions was replicated from previous Alberta Survey questionnaires. The questionnaire was pre-tested by trained interviewers on a total of 30 randomly selected Edmonton households.

All questions and survey instructions were reviewed and approved by a University Research Ethics Committee before administration to the general public.;","Kind of Data":"Survey data","socialscience:Characteristics of Data Collection Situation":"If the interviewers were unsuccessful in establishing contact on their first call, a minimum of fifteen call-back attempts were made before declaring a telephone number as \"no contact.\"","Title":"Alberta Survey, 2000","socialscience:Cleaning Operations":"The data were tabulated and cleaned using the SPSS for Windows 9 statistical package.

(1) City of Edmonton. (2) City of Calgary. (3) Remainder of the Province (Other Alberta). Two-stage selection process. (1) Selection of households. (2) Selection of respondent within each household. To permit the analysis of each area as a separate entity, a minimum sample size of 400 or more for each area of the province was instituted. The target population designated for telephone interviewing was all persons 18 years of age or older who, at the time of the survey, were living in a dwelling unit in Alberta that could be contacted by direct dialling. From this population, three samples were drawn to cover Alberta: the City of Edmonton (EAS)1, the City of Calgary, and the rest of the province. A random-digit dialling approach was used to ensure that respondents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory. The PRL has developed a database of five-digit telephone banks (e.g. 403/780-xxx-xx) covering all of Alberta. The database is updated regularly and used for generating the survey sample. The 2000 Alberta Survey sample was drawn from a provincial database by using a computer program to select, with replacement, a simple random sample of banks for each area and appending a random number between 00 and 99 to each number selected. All duplicate telephone numbers were purged from the computer-generated list. Nursing homes and collective dwellings were also deleted from the sample. Within the household, one eligible person was selected as the respondent for the twenty-minute interview. A respondent within each household was selected on the basis of gender using the following selection guidelines to ensure an equal selection of male and female participants. a. The dwelling unit must be the person's usual place of residence and he/she must be 18 years of age or older. b. If an adult male answers the phone and is willing to be interviewed, he is the respondent. c. If an adult female answers the phone and there is an adult male present who is willing to be interviewed, interview the male. If the male is not willing to be interviewed, and the female is willing, inte\r\nrview the female. d. If an adult female answers the phone and there is no adult male present, choose her as the respondent.","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10551","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"4.2","schema:datePublished":"2015-09-08","schema:name":"Alberta Survey, 2000","schema:dateModified":"Fri Mar 02 10:45:10 MST 2018","dvcore:confidentialityDeclaration":"None required","dvcore:specialPermissions":"None required.","dvcore:restrictions":"None","dvcore:citationRequirements":"Please cite All Alberta Survey 2000.","dvcore:depositorRequirements":"None","dvcore:conditions":"No attempt should be made to disclose individuals in the study nor link records through study with other files.","dvcore:disclaimer":"None Required.","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false,"dvcore:dataAccessPlace":"Data Library, University of Alberta","dvcore:availabilityStatus":"Available","dvcore:studyCompletion":"Data is complete"},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Alberta Survey","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Questionnaire and Codebook","schema:name":"2000AlbertaSurvey_Codebook.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1289,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4777","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4777","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":411828,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://5940","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"b1b2013947805ffd2a70ec4652a00b49"}},{"schema:description":"Data File","schema:name":"2000AlbertaSurvey_Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1289,"dvcore:categories":["Data"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4776","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4776","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":642835,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://5939","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"SPSS Binary","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:5:BHJllh0Bz1WjBEwk+D9d6g==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"bdc13e3868352b18ba676edd5226883b"}},{"schema:description":"Methodology Report","schema:name":"2000AlbertaSurvey_SamplingReport.pdf","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1289,"dvcore:categories":["Documentation"],"@id":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4798","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/4798","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"application/pdf","dvcore:filesize":62455,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://5962","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"be78995ecd8fb7a8328fce8722fe3b44"}}],"schema:hasPart":["https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4777","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4776","https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=4798"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","distributor":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/distributor#","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","otherId":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/otherId#","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","series":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/series#","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#","topicClassification":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/topicClassification#"}}
