Nutritional intake during gestation is known to impact health outcomes for\r\nprogeny. Correlational evidence in humans suggests that increased fruit consumption\r\nof pregnant mothers enhances infant cognitive development. Moreover, wild-type\r\nDrosophila supplemented with a combination of orange and tomato juice showed\r\nrobust enhancements in performance on an associative olfactory memory task. The\r\ncurrent study aimed to experimentally test the effects of prenatal fruit juice exposure in\r\na non-human, mammalian model of learning and memory. \r\n\r\nMethods. Across three separate birth cohorts, pregnant rats were given access to\r\ndiluted tomato and orange juice (N = 2 per cohort), with control rats (N = 2 per cohort)\r\nreceiving only water, in addition to standard rodent chow, throughout the duration of\r\ngestation, ending at parturition. Following weaning, male offspring were tested for\r\nlearning and memory in a spatial version of the circular water maze and an auditory cued fear-conditioning task.\r\n\r\nResults. All pregnant rats increased fluid and food intake over the gestational period.\r\nFruit juice-fed pregnant rats had increased fluid intake compared to control pregnant\r\nrats. When testing progeny, there were no effects of prenatal fruit juice on spatial\r\nlearning, while it appeared to  impair learning in fear conditioning relative to controls.\r\nHowever, we measured significant enhancements in both spatial memory and\r\nconditioned fear memory in the prenatal fruit-juice group compared to controls.\r\nMeasures of vigilance, in response to the conditioned cue, were increased in prenatal\r\nfruit treated rats compared to controls, suggesting less generalized, and more adaptive\r\nanxiety-related behaviours.\r\n\r\nDiscussion.  Our results corroborate the human and Drosophila findings of prenatal\r\nfruit effects on behaviour, specifically that prenatal fruit juice exposure may be\r\nbeneficial for early-life memory consolidation in rats.","dsDescription:Date":"2019-12-19"},"citation:Keyword":[{"keyword:Term":"gestational diet"},{"keyword:Term":"memory"},{"keyword:Term":"consolidation"},{"keyword:Term":"cognition"}],"Title":"Prenatal fruit juice exposure enhances memory consolidation in male post-weanling Sprague-Dawley rats","citation:Depositor":"Ward-Flanagan, Rachel","Subject":"Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Deposit Date":"2019-12-19","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"1.0","schema:datePublished":"2019-12-19","schema:name":"Prenatal fruit juice exposure enhances memory consolidation in male post-weanling Sprague-Dawley rats","schema:dateModified":"Thu Dec 19 10:32:09 MST 2019","schema:license":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Prenatal fruit juice exposure enhances memory consolidation in male post-weanling Sprague-Dawley rats","ore:aggregates":[{"schema:description":"Raw data from our third cohort of animals","schema:name":"August Run Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1525,"@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/W21DVN","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/:persistentId?persistentId=doi:10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/W21DVN","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":450,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://16f1f32b32f-1b39675d1f4c","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel Spreadsheet","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:6:2Y898brHW8mlhMJ9L9Q4XQ==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"766e5bfe3f0959523620956584b256d9"}},{"schema:description":"Raw data from our first cohort of animals","schema:name":"January Run Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1525,"@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/DW5QPP","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/:persistentId?persistentId=doi:10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/DW5QPP","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":379,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://16f1f3367cf-eb9f3c0f820e","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel Spreadsheet","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:6:4olddNHMJWk3bSVl3Abshw==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"cc9b57e9ab9e9bb09cba228d669d82a9"}},{"schema:description":"Raw data from our second cohort of animals","schema:name":"March Run Data.tab","dvcore:restricted":false,"schema:version":2,"dvcore:datasetVersionId":1525,"@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/M9SDNR","schema:sameAs":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/api/access/datafile/:persistentId?persistentId=doi:10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/M9SDNR","@type":"ore:AggregatedResource","schema:fileFormat":"text/tab-separated-values","dvcore:filesize":262,"dvcore:storageIdentifier":"file://16f1f336a49-337d57c7b8fe","dvcore:originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","dvcore:originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel Spreadsheet","dvcore:UNF":"UNF:6:3Bt4lK59WM0KJFY2j5Jfiw==","dvcore:rootDataFileId":-1,"dvcore:checksum":{"@type":"MD5","@value":"269ef19ecb5de3ee2d0583b75ea25d64"}}],"schema:hasPart":["doi:10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/W21DVN","doi:10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/DW5QPP","doi:10.7939/DVN/4VN1X0/M9SDNR"]},"@context":{"Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Deposit Date":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","schema":"http://schema.org/"}}
