Fasting labs will be obtained immediately following dietary intervention. These labs will include total and active ghrelin. Changes in subjective hunger will be assessed by an appetite and hyperphagia questionnaire validated for PWS children. Analysis of improvements in insulin sensitivity and inflammatory cytokine profile will include measurements of adiponectin, GLP-1, glucose, insulin, AST, ALT, insulin sensitivity and a detailed profile ('metabolomics') of amino acids, fatty acids, acylcarnitines, and adipocytokines on the day prior to and immediately following dietary intervention. Changes in satiety, improvements in insulin sensitivity, and improvement in inflammatory cytokine profile are measured during the 72 hour dietary intervention.","socialscience:Universe":"Children aged 5 years to 17 years with a diagnosis of Prader Willi syndrome confirmed by chromosome analysis.","socialscience:Frequency":"Data is collected daily over the four days of the clinical visit.","Kind of Data":"Biosamples; Questionnaire data; Interview data; Clinical data; Anthropometric data","socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individuals","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"13 study participants will be recruited through convenience sample.","citation:Production Place":"Edmonton, Alberta; Durham, North Carolina","citation:Production Date":"2014","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10899","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"2.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"Evidence-Based Approach to Dietary Management of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS)","schema:dateModified":"Fri May 26 15:03:27 MDT 2017","dvcore:restrictions":"Given the small population size and risk of reidentification, no direct access will be provided to the data.","dvcore:conditions":"Access to the data is limited to selected members of the research team.","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false,"dvcore:availabilityStatus":"Data is not available because the study is still recruiting."},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI)","ore:aggregates":[],"schema:hasPart":[]},"@context":{"Alternative Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/alternative","Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Grant Information":"https://schema.org/sponsor","Identifier":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/AgentIdentifier","Identifier Scheme":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/AgentIdentifierScheme","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Software":"https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasGeneratedBy","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","grantNumber":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/grantNumber#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","otherId":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/otherId#","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","software":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/software#","targetSampleSize":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience/targetSampleSize#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#"}}
