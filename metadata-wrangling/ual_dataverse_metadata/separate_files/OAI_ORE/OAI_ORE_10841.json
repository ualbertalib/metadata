To detect a difference of 2 points on the FPS-R (which is considered clinically important) given a Type I error of 0.05 and 80% power, 40 patients per group is required. We also performed sample size calculations using a two-tailed, two sample t-test, for our other primary outcome of observed behavioural distress using data from our previous trial (i.e., SD=2.77). To detect a large effect size of 0.6 (which we observed in the previous trial) given a Type I error of 0.05 and 80% power, 35 patients per group is required. Recruiting 80 patients overall allows sufficient power to find a difference in both primary outcomes if a difference truly exists.","biomedical:Design Type":"Randomized Controlled Trial","socialscience:Characteristics of Data Collection Situation":"Half of the participating children will be given an iPad to use during intravenous placement in addition to standard of care. Children and parents will be able to select their choice of distraction from a selection of games and videos, and they can change their selection as desired during the course of the procedure. The control group will receive standard care, which generally includes the use of topical anesthetic cream. Extra pain score measurements from the child and their caregiver, immediately before and after the intravenous placement, will be collected. The procedure and the child will also be video-taped in order to code the behavioural distress scores afterwards. In addition, parents and health care professionals will also be asked about their satisfaction.","socialscience:Cleaning Operations":"All of the  data is rechecked by the study coordinator.","socialscience:Other Forms of Data Appraisal":"OSBD is subject to interpretation since it is an indirect behavioral measure of perceived distress.","socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individuals","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10841","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"3.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Children Undergoing Intravenous Placement in the Pediatric Emergency Department: Distraction to Reduce Pain and Distress","schema:dateModified":"Fri May 26 10:36:09 MDT 2017","dvcore:restrictions":"Video recording equipment will capture the patient's facial expressions and body movements, in order to apply an ob\nservational distress tool (OSBD), so as to measure the distress experienced by the child.
