From the computer tape a simple random sample of 584 addresses was selected by means of a special computer program written for this purpose. The household was therefore the primary sampling unit (PSU). This was the second time that the Population Research Laboratory (PRL) had drawn a sample from this tape. In an earlier study the same tape was used to obtain a sample of 1,873 addresses. Following the completion of that study, the distribution of households by size, age groups of the respondents and household tenure, obtained from the sample were compared with those of the 1976 Federal Census. The comparison clearly showed that the sample was representative. A similar comparison was made for the Edmonton Area Study in the following tables. In these tables the index of dissimilarity in each table is less than 10%. This indicates that the EAS sample can be regarded as representative.","Title":"Edmonton Area Survey, 1979","socialscience:Universe":"In contrast to the previous EAS surveys that used samples drawn from the latest editions of the Edmonton Telephones’ Numerical Street Address Directory, this year’s study used as a sampling frame a computerized list of addresses compiled by the City of Edmonton from their annual civic census (1978).
