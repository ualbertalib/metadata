Women were randomized to get either vaginal progesterone gel or a placebo gel daily from study entry until 35 6/7 weeks. Women entered the study between 16 - 20 6/7 weeks. Data was collected on the women and their infants to see if the active medication prolongs pregnancy. Women and their babies were followed up until 28 days after delivery. An independent study nurse not directly involved in the patients' care and blind to group of allocation extracted the outcome data from hospital records. Women were asked to complete medication diaries confirming their use of the study medication and were asked to return their diaries and unused applicators to the study nurse at the end of the study.","Title":"Pilot Randomized Trial of Vaginal Progesterone to Prevent Preterm Birth in Multiple Pregnancy","socialscience:Sampling Procedure":"The sample size calculation conducted before the start of the study, assuming a 10 % dropout rate and 85 % power, estimated that a sample of 100 subjects (50 per group) needed to be recruited to achieve a sample of 90 patients with full follow-up. However, we experienced no losses to follow-up after recruiting 75 % of the planned sample. The study team therefore revised the sample size estimate, assuming a more usual power of 80 % two-sided significance level of 0.05, and dropout rate of zero. The revised sample size estimate of 80 (40 per group) was accepted by the study team in September 2010, and the trial was stopped in October 2010. A total of 84 patients participated in the study.","Alternative Title":"Vaginal Progesterone Versus Placebo in Multiple Pregnancy","socialscience:Universe":"Women with multiple pregnancies.","socialscience:Unit of Analysis":"Individuals","socialscience:Frequency":"Data was collected at baseline (during pregnancy), during delivery, at birth, and at discharge.","Kind of Data":"Clinical data; Qualitative data","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10917","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"2.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"Pilot Randomized Trial of Vaginal Progesterone to Prevent Preterm Birth in Multiple Pregnancy","schema:dateModified":"Mon May 29 13:41:29 MDT 2017","dvcore:fileTermsOfAccess":{"dvcore:fileRequestAccess":false},"schema:includedInDataCatalog":"Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI)","ore:aggregates":[],"schema:hasPart":[]},"@context":{"Alternative Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/alternative","Author":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator","Citation":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/bibliographicCitation","Grant Information":"https://schema.org/sponsor","ID Number":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/ResourceIdentifier","ID Type":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/ResourceIdentifierScheme","Identifier":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/AgentIdentifier","Identifier Scheme":"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/AgentIdentifierScheme","Kind of Data":"http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery#kindOfData","Related Publication":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/isReferencedBy","Subject":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject","Time Period Covered":"https://schema.org/temporalCoverage","Title":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title","URL":"https://schema.org/distribution","author":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/author#","biomedical":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/biomedical#","citation":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/","datasetContact":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/datasetContact#","dateOfCollection":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dateOfCollection#","dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","dsDescription":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/dsDescription#","dvcore":"https://dataverse.org/schema/core#","geographicCoverage":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial/geographicCoverage#","geospatial":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/geospatial#","grantNumber":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/grantNumber#","keyword":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/keyword#","ore":"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/","otherId":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/otherId#","producer":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/producer#","schema":"http://schema.org/","socialscience":"https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/schema/socialscience#","timePeriodCovered":"https://dataverse.org/schema/citation/timePeriodCovered#"}}
