They will be encouraged to contact the RN at a study email address or by text messaging with follow-up questions. Adolescents in the control group will received standard of care. They will see a nurse only to measure weight, height, and blood pressure and relied on their cardiologist for information about their heart condition.    Youth will complete the MyHeart Scale and the TRANSITION-Q Questionnaire in the clinic area at enrollment for the 'usual care' group, and prior to intervention for the 'intervention' group. Both groups will repeat the questionnaires 1 month and 6 months post enrollment.    Medical charts will be reviewed only for information about participants' heart condition, such as date of birth, CHD diagnosis, names and dates of cardiac surgical procedures and cardiac catheterizations, current use of cardiac medications (Y/N), history of missed appointments (Y/N), and cardiologist's name. As well, nursing logs and texts and emails between nurses and study participants will be collected and analysed.","@id":"doi:10.7939/DVN/10908","@type":["ore:Aggregation","schema:Dataset"],"schema:version":"2.2","schema:datePublished":"2016-10-21","schema:name":"The CHAPTER III Study of Young Adolescents: Congenital Heart Adolescents Participating in Transition Evaluation Research","schema:dateModified":"Fri May 26 15:29:51 MDT 2017","dvcore:conditions":"Access to deidentified data may be permitted for external researchers, with limitations.
