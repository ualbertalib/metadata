The omnibus survey of households in the province of Alberta continues to enable academic researchers, government departments, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector to explore a wide range of research topics in a structured research framework and environment.</description><description descriptionType="SeriesInformation">The All Alberta Survey is conducted annually by the Population Research Centre at the University of Alberta. It is designed to provide information regarding the characteristics of Albertans. All members of the Albertan population who can be contacted by direct dialling are sampled. Prior to 1987, only Edmontonians were included in this survey.</description><description descriptionType="Other">Subject: survey instrument Type: Information Notes: THE SURVEY INSTRUMENT The survey instrument consisted of three components: 1. a standardized introduction; 2. questions which reflected the specific research interests of the University researchers and outside agencies participating in the study; 3. demographic questions; 4. The latter set of questions was replicated from previous Alberta Survey questionnaires. The questionnaire was pre-tested by trained interviewers on a total of 30 randomly selected Edmonton households. Interviewer comments or potential sources of non-sampling errors 5 and pre-test frequency distributions were reviewed by the clients before modifications were made to the 2000 Alberta Survey questionnaire. All questions and survey instructions were reviewed and approved by a University Research Ethics Committee before administration to the general public.;</description></descriptions><geoLocations><geoLocation><geoLocationPlace>Population Research Laboratory, Department of Sociology, University of Alberta</geoLocationPlace></geoLocation></geoLocations></resource>
