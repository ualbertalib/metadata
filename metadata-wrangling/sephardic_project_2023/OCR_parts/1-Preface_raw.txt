People talk of the experience of travel as 
culturally enriching. Others do their travelling by 
reading a variety of books that transport them to 
the four corners of the earth and to the far reaches 
of outer space. When valuable books and 
manuscripts, heretofore unknown, begin to travel 
then history is made and the details of a previous 
age are discovered. 


The acquisition of the Bension manuscripts 
and texts for the University of Alberta by the Harry 
R. Cohen Memorial Foundation was an even more 
exciting experience for a number of reasons. This 
was the first time that Hebrew manuscripts had 
ever been discovered in Canada. Secondly, there 
is a dearth of scholarly source material in the field 
of North African Sephardic studies to which a 
good portion of the collection pertains, and yeta 
growing number of universities in France, the 
United States, and Israel are establishing in- 
stitutes which are specializing in the field of 
Sephardic studies. Thirdly, scholars in a variety of 
cognate fields of Jewish study will be able to draw 
upon the scholarly resources which are now 
housed in the Special Collections department of 
the Library of the University of Alberta. This 
collection will bring the University of Alberta into 
the orbit of select libraries and institutions of 
higher learning throughout the world which 
possess unique materials in the field of Jewish 
scholarship and which make these sources 
available for scholarly investigation. Fourthly, the 
collector, who was a scholar in his own right, has 
been rediscovered. 


There is a social aspect to the significance of 
the Bension collection. Exhibitions of specimens 
in the collection have already been held in eastern 
and western Canada. At a recent exhibit which 
was held in Montreal, under the sponsorship of 
the Organisation Sepharade Francophone, 
several thousand Jews of Moroccan extraction 




were in attendance. The Jewish community of 
Morocco once numbered over a quarter-of-a- 
million people. The majority of these people 
presently make their domicile in Israel, but a 
sizeable number migrated to France since they 
are French-speaking, and it is estimated that 
about twenty thousand Moroccan Jews 
emigrated to Quebec. It is therefore quite proper 
that after Israel and France, Canada should 
possess and disseminate materials which will 
preserve the cultural continuity of North African 
Jewry for their descendants who have found 
refuge on Canadian shores. The acquisition and 
dissemination of material from the Bension 
collection by the University of Alberta is a major 
effort in this direction. 


The element of uniqueness should not be 
sacrificed as people of diverse cultural 
backgrounds join together to achieve a united 
society. While there is a natural tendency for 
minorities to assimilate into the mainstream of 
society, sooner or later there arises a quest for 
one’s identity which must be satisfied. An 
exposition of the valuable efforts that were made 
by outstanding Jewish scholars of the Maghreb, 
who have contributed to the dynamic develop- 
ment of communal organization in Morocco for 
hundreds of years, will serve as a source of pride 
to all who would inquire about their heritage. 


A fascinating aspect of the collection is the 
story of how the Bension collection arrived at the 
Library of the University of Alberta. The collector, 
Ariel Bension, passed away suddenly in Paris 
at the age of fifty-two, in 1932. His collection 
came into the possession of his second wife, née 
Ida Siegler, who lived in Montreal where she had 
served as a Hebrew teacher prior to their mar- 
riage. Before Ida Bension passed away in 1952 
she sold the collection to a book dealer. There 
is evidence that the collection contained more 




ix 




Preface 




Preface 




items than at present. Some of these works were 
probably sold by Ida Bension separately. At one 
time the collection was supposed to have con- 
tained thirty letters composed by the illustrious 
scientist Albert Einstein on the subject of Zion- 
ism. These were presumably sold at an earlier 
date. Since Ariel Bension was an important 
emissary for the World Zionist Organization, it 
is logical to deduce that he possessed corre- 
spondence of this nature. 


A noted Montreal collector, Mr. Saul 
Muhlstock, who was an acquaintance of the late 
Ida Bension, subsequently acquired the collec- 
tion from the book dealer to whom she sold it. In 
the spring of 1973, Mr. L.E.S. Gutteridge of the 
Library of the University of Alberta was contacted 
by a book dealer who was supposedly acting for 
Mr. Muhlstock. The latter was prepared to sell the 
collection to a Canadian institution of higher 
education. | was lecturing in the Department of 
Religious Studies at the University of Alberta 
when | was asked to assess the value of the 
Bension collection for scholarly research. | was 
surprised to find that, indeed, a treasure trove of 
manuscripts and texts were before me, especially 
since this was the first collection of Hebrew 
manuscripts ever to be discovered in Canada. The 
result of my findings are incorporated in part IV of 
this work. 


A meeting was held in the Cameron Library 
Board Room, at the University of Alberta, on 
Monday, June 25, 1973. Among those in atten- 
dance were Messrs. Sam Goldsmith, Sam Greene 
and Tom Mayson, Q.C., representing the Harry R. 
Cohen Memorial Foundation; Messrs. L.E.S. 
Gutteridge and Bruce Peel, representing the 
Library of the University of Alberta; members of 
the University Committee on Scholarly Ac- 
quisitions and myself, Saul Aranov. At the 
conclusion of this meeting, the Harry R. Cohen 




x 




Memorial Foundation of Edmonton, Alberta, had 
acquired the Ariel Bension Sephardic 
Manuscripts and Texts for the Library of the 
University of Alberta. This is the initial acquisition 
and showpiece of the Harry R. Cohen Memorial 
Collection at the University of Alberta. 


| express my gratitude to the trustees of the 
Harry R. Cohen Memorial Foundation for their 
munificent benefaction and their interest in 
establishing a collection of Hebraica and Judaica 
at the Library of the University of Alberta. Their 
sponsorship will be instrumental in helping to 
establish Jewish scholarship in Canadaonamore 
sound basis. Their effort is agenuine testament to 
the character of Harry R. Cohen, who was truly a 
high priest in the temple of philanthropy and 
culture in the general and Jewish communities of 
Edmonton, Alberta throughout his lifetime. 


| am particularly indebted -to Messrs. Sam 
Goldsmith and Sam Greene who have made the 
publication of this catalogue possible by their 
benevolence. | also express to them my 
everlasting gratitude for the many kindnesses that 
they showed me during the past years. | shall 
always cherish the support of this project by Dr. 
Henry Kreisel, who served as Vice-President 
(Academic) at the University of Alberta, at the 
time of purchase and who initially suggested that | 
should study the Bension collection. 


Thanks are especially due to Mr. Bruce Peel, 
Librarian to the University of Alberta. His 
foresight in desiring to make the acquisition 
available for the Library at the University of 
Alberta will always be remembered in gratitude. | 
also wish to thank Mr. L.E.S. Gutteridge for his 
guidance in matters pertaining to the publishing 
of this work as well as for his efforts in making 
available to me works that were generally 
inaccessible. Mrs. Helen Cramer was devoted in 
her efforts to type the drafts for this volume and | 




appreciate her dedication. 


In the course of the preparation of this 
catalogue my mother, Sarah M. Aranov, went to 
her eternal reward. It is in humility that | 
memorialize her for my physical being and for the 
sacrifices she endured while | pursued my 
studies. My maternal grandfather, Reverend Zisel 
Gedalia Goodkin, a lover of humanity, taught me 
to appreciate the contributions of the diverse 
cultures that make up the landscape of mankind. 
Any abilities that | possess | owe to his pedagogic 
powers while my imperfections are my own. 


| am indebted many times over to my revered 
father-in-law, the scholarly Rabbi Shlomo Amor, 
of Tivon, Israel, for introducing me to Sephardic 
culture and for his many comments that went into 




Preface 




the preparation of this volume; also for the gift of 
his daughter, Dina, that princess of patience, who 
endured until this work was brought to comple- 
tion. Finally, | dedicate this volume to my children 
Noam, Shalhevet and Sarit Aviva and to all of 
their generation who are the products of Ash- 
kenazi and Sephardi culture. Learn to cherish 
your origins and to fuse them into something 
beautiful for God and mankind. 


| give thanks to the Almighty who helped me 
bring this work to completion.

The collector was known as Dr. Ariel Bension. 
The name Ariel was derived from the original 
given name of the collector, Judah, and the family 
name Bension was derived by him from the 
second of the two given names of his father, R. 
Joshua Sion Halevi. The original name of the col- 
lector was Judah Levi. 


Ariel Bension was born in Jerusalem in the 
year 1880. His father was the Rabbi and Mystic, 
Joshua Sion Halevi and his mother Mazal Tob, the 
daughter of R. Solomon Ezekiel Yahuda. R. 
Joshua Sion had migrated from Fez, Morocco to 
the Holy Land while he was yet a youngster. His 
ancestry dates back to the Ben Hasdai family that 
was known in Barcelona, Spain in the twelfth 
century. R. Joshua Sion was a devotee of the 
mystical group at Jerusalem known as the Holy 
Community of Beth-El. Ariel Bension informs us, 
on page 245 of his work The Zohar in Moslem and 
Christian Spain, that the Beth-El community was 
“founded by the descendants of some of the 
exiles from Spain; at first small but loosely held 
together, lacking cohesion and unity. As time 
went on, however, and under the guidance of 
devoted leaders, the group was transformed into a 
co-ordinated body possessing both authority and 
strength. Dominated by what may be called the 
categorical imperative of Ha-Ari’s teachings, the 
prayers were made with Kavanoth-inner medita- 
tion... At first it had been the custom to carry 
meditation in a deep silence—the meditation on 
a single word, sometimes lasting for fifteen 
minutes. But with the introduction of the musical 
interludes the Kavanoth began to be performed 
during the intoning of a melody that was at the 
same time suggestive of the form which the 
meditation was to take. So true are these tunes in 
searching out and expressing the emotions of 
souls dwelling on the mystic meaning of the 
prayer, that even the listener, uninitiated though 




he may be, feels himself transported into the 
realms of thought, where dwell those who 
commune with the Infinite.” This mystical com- 
munal atmosphere exerted a lasting influence on 
Bension throughout his life as is evident in his 
later literary activity. 


The collector was educated by his father in the 
academy called “Qasad-El,” which was establish- 
ed by his maternal grandfather. He was also 
educated at the institute called “Tifereth 
Jerusalem” and at “Beth-El,” Bension acquired 
a wide knowledge of Talmud, Codes, and in 
mystical studies. At the age of fifteen he wrote 
a story entitled ‘“Hanolad Be-Qedusha’—“He 
Who Was Born in Holiness,” which was published 
in a series of five instalments in the publication 
known as Ha-Yehudi, in London. 


Bension spent some time with his father’s 
relatives in Algiers before he continued on his 
journey to western Europe, where he studied at 
universities in Germany and Switzerland. He 
pursued courses in history, philosophy, literature, 
and Asiatic philology. He was granted a doctoral 
degree in philosophy and semitic languages at 
the University of Berne and then he returned to 
the Holy Land. Subsequently he married Rachel, 
the daughter of Rahamim Mizrahi. After his first 
wife’s demise he married Ida Siegler of Montreal. 
It was due to this second marriage that the 
Canada connection was established so that the 
Bension manuscripts and _ texts eventually 
became the first collection of Hebrew 
manuscripts ever to be discovered in Canada. The 
young Ariel Bension was the first Sephardi of the 
Holy Land who is known to have pursued studies 
in the universities of western Europe. Bension 
served as Rabbi to the Jewish community of 
Betulia, Serbia for one year before the advent of 
the First World War. He worked in the service of 
the Zionist Organization from the beginning of

the year 1920. Afterwards he served as an 
emissary for the Keren Ha-Yesod until the end of 
his life. He was especially active in this capacity in 
the Sephardic communities of Iraq, India, In- 
do-China, North Africa, Spain, Portugal, South 
America, and Egypt among other communities. 
He was successful in acquiring an ideological and 
financial commitment for the future building of 
the Land of Israel from the Jewish members of the 
aforementioned communities. Bension was also 
successful in gaining sympathy and esteem for 
the nationhood of Israel and for the Zionist cause 
from figures of prominence in the world political 
arena and from men of letters in many of the 
countries which he visited. The Indian poet 
Tagore was numbered among those sym- 
pathizers influenced by Bension. 


Ariel Bension was also active on behalf of the 
Jewish Sephardic Organization in his travels 
throughout the diaspora. He co-ordinated the 
Sephardic organization’s efforts together with 
those of other Jewish organizations that worked 
for the national aspirations of the Jewish people. 
Bension commenced these activities at the as- 
sembly of the Eleventh Zionist Congress which 
was held in Vienna. On that occasion he was 
chosen as the honorary secretary of the Execu- 
tive that was given the task of assembling an inter- 
national conference which would bring the 
Jewish nationalistic idea to reality. He partic- 
ipated in the Fifteenth Zionist Congress as a 
representative of the Jews of Argentina. Between 
his travels he engaged in communal activities in 
the Holy Land. Bension participated in the 
founding of the Rabbinic Academy “Mahzikei Ha- 
Torah,” in Jerusalem. Bension also was responsi- 
ble for the redemption of land in Netanya, Israel. 
The Bension quarter of the town was named for 
him. 


Ariel Bension published articles of a scholarly 




Xiv 




nature in publications such as Hasfirah, Ha-Or, 
Ha-Herut, and Ha-Olam, in his student days and 
thereafter, in Hebrew, German, and English. 
Special attention was paid to his article on the 
mysticism of Maeterlinck, in the publication 
Ha-Olam, in 1914. He also wrote on “The Seph- 
ardi Hassidism in the Land of Israel,” “On the 
question of the Arabs and the Jews,” which was 
written in English, “An Essay on Yemen,” and 
“Echoes of the Inquisition” among other articles. 


Bension’s books include Hatunat Ha-Mavet— 
Marriage with Death, which appeared in Hebrew 
and German and served as an introduction to his 
work “Raphael,” which remained unpublished. He 
also wrote the following books which were 
published, Sar Shalom Sharabi, in Hebrew and in 
English, and The Zohar in Moslem and Christian 
Spain, in English, a portion of which was 
produced in Hebrew, and for which the author 
was elected as a fellow of the “Real Academia de 
la Historia” of Madrid. This last work was 
originally published in London in 1932, and 
reprinted by the Sepher-Hermon Press Inc., New 
York in 1974. Ariel Bension is also mentioned in 
Gershom Scholem’s Major Trends in Jewish 
Mysticism. The scholarly credentials of the col- 
lector of our manuscripts and texts, as well as 
his eclectic interests coupled with his extensive 
travel in behalf of Sephardic Jewry, are sufficient 
in themselves for us to acknowledge that this 
private collection is indeed an extraordinary find 
and that its Sephardic character is manifest. His 
Moroccan ancestry from his father’s side of the 
family also supports the centrality of Moroccan 
material in the collection. It seems evident that we 
possess only a portion of this scholar’s collection 
of manuscripts and texts. It is indeed a tragedy 
that he passed on, in Paris, on the ninth of 
November 1932, at the age of fifty-two. Had he 
been granted a longer life his literary productivity 




would have been even more prolific. Rabbi Dr. 
Ariel Bension was survived by his daughters from 
his first wife, namely Miriam, the wife of Simon 
Sassoon, and Hannah, the wife of Abraham 
Kohen. It is our hope that this volume will again 




An appreciation 




bring the collector, scholar, rabbi, mystic, and 
indefatigable worker for the cause of Zion, to the 
attention of the reading public. We remain 
indebted to him for his collection.

The historical and political background 


The Bension Manuscripts and Texts of the Harry 
R. Cohen Memorial Collection have been desig- 
nated as Sephardic. An explanation of the term 
“Sephardic,” will help the reader comprehend 
the character of the entire collection. The term 
“Sephardic” has generally referred to those Jews 
who hailed from the Iberian peninsula, which 
includes Spain and Portugal, and all countries 
surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, and who 
came under the influence of the traditions of the 
Babylonian rabbinic leaders known as “Geonim” 
during the period of Mohammedan rule of these 
areas. In our age the term “Sephardic” has been 
broadly applied to most Jews hailing from Afro- 
Asian countries. The contemporary application of 
the term “Sephardic” to all Afro-Asian Jews is not 
in the purview of the collection. The Bension 
collection is primarily concerned with the 
literature and personalities of descendants of 
Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before the 
expulsion of 1492, and of Jews who were 
indigenous to North Africa. 


The Mohammedan influence was dominant 
throughout southern Europe and the Maghreb 
from the eighth century until the thirteenth 
century. During this period there was much 
commercial and cultural interaction between the 
populations of Iberia and North Africa. This was 
especially true of the cultural atmosphere that 
pervaded the Jewish communities of both areas. 
This glorious period in Jewish history is 
characterized as the Golden Age of Spanish 
Jewry. Major strides were made in the fields of 
Jewish philology, lexicography, liturgy, poetry, 
philosophy, rabbinic law, and mysticism. 


Many of the illustrious teachers of the Jewish 
people appeared in this period on both sides of 
the Strait of Gibraltar. Among them were Bible 
commentators such as the members of the Ibn 




Ezra family; grammarians such as Rabbi Judah 
ibn Kuraish of Tahert, Rabbi Dunash ben Labrat 
of Fez, Rabbi Judah Hayudj of Fez, and Rabbi 
Menahem ben Saruk of Tortosa, Spain; poet- 
philosophers such as Bahya ibn Pakuda, 
Solomon ibn Gabirol, and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi; 
and then there were the legal interpreters and 
codifiers such as Rabbi Isaac Alfasi of Fez, Rabbi 
Moses ben Maimon known as Maimonides, Rabbi 
Moses ben Nahman known as Nahmanides, and 
Rabbi Solomon ben Adret of Spain. Often, as was 
the case in the Middle Ages, each scholar was a 
master in several fields of endeavor. Thus 
Maimonides was a philosopher and an eminent 
jurist, while his income was derived from practice 
of the medical profession. Nahmanides was an 
astute commentator of the Bible while he was also 
known as an outstanding legal commentator and 
leader of a major mystical school in Gerona, 
Spain. 


Moorish rulers of Spain encouraged a liberal 
atmosphere in the intellectual exchange of ideas 
and served as patrons of the arts and sciences of 
their day. In fact, the “lingua franca” of the 
scholarly world from the tenth through the 
thirteenth centuries was the Arabic language. The 
master works of such luminaries as Saadya Gaon, 
Bahya ibn Pakuda, Maimonides, and other Jewish 
writers, which originally appeared in Arabic, had 
to be translated into Hebrew in order that they 
could be accessible to a wider reading public in 
the thirteenth century. 


The adjoining provinces of Languedoc and 
Provence, the home of Provengal Jewry in 
southeastern France, served as adjacent allies to 
Spanish Jewry in the pursuit of Jewish culture. 
This district in southern France, whose in- 
habitants were the happiest of those under 
Christian rule in Europe, was also a bridge 
between the intellectual Jewish currents of

Introduction 




Historical background 




northern and southern Europe. The Provence, 
blessed with a perpetual spring season, was the 
haven of a multitude of Jewish scholars who 
established schools where philosophical texts 
were translated into Hebrew in such centers as 
Beaucaire and Narbonne. Prominent among 
Provengal scholars were members of the Tibbon 
family who were translators of philosophical 
texts, the Kimhi family of grammarians and Bible 
commentators, the philosopher-translator Shem 
Tob ibn Palgera, and the Talmudic commentators 
Rabbi Abraham b. David of Posquieres and Rabbi 
Zerahia Halevi. 


The Provence was the major battleground in 
the “Hundred Years’ War” of culture that ensued 
between the liberal religious pro-philosophical 
group referred to as the Maimunists (Jewish 
Rationalists), and the conservative, religious anti- 
philosophical anti-Maimunists. The philosophical 
camp viewed the study of philosophy as a natural 
ally to traditional Jewish study and piety while the 
anti-Maimonidean camp viewed philosophical 
study as a foreign element that was inimical to the 
preservation of traditional Jewish study and 
values. The battles which began after the death of 
Maimonides, in 1204, were not resolved because 
the Jews were expelled from the Provence and all 
of France in 1306. Many of those who were 
expelled made their way to Spain and North 
Africa. 


At the close of the thirteenth century a new 
influx of scholars from northern Europe, which 
was under Christian influence, began to converge 
on the cultural centers of Spain. Some were 
driven from the Rhineland by the Rindfleish 
massacres of 1298, which uprooted over a 
hundred Jewish communities. In 1290, the sixteen 
thousand Jews of England were the first of their 
people on the European continent to be the 
victims of an official edict of expulsion. Most of 




2 




them made their way to northern France. Every 
possible calumny that could be charged against 
the Jews was perpetrated in the thirteenth century 
under the crusading Pope Innocent III, such as 
the ritual blood libel. Jews were made to wear 
special badges, marking them as pariahs in 
Christian society. It is true that occasionally anti- 
Papist Christian rulers favored the Jews. Subse- 
quently Jews came to Andalusia from northern 
France where they had been victimized by the 
pogroms that were current during the period of 
the Crusades. These newcomers from the north 
who came to Spain were known as Ashkenazim. 
An overwhelming number of northerners moved 
eastwards to the provinces of Bohemia, Moravia, 
and Silesia in central Europe and eventually 
penetrated eastern Europe. The theory is 
prevalent that those who are descended from 
most east European Jews are the children of the 
early Jewish settlers of the Rhineland and 
northern France. 


The Ashkenazi traditions of the northern 
Europeans who came to Spain were markedly 
different from those of the Sephardim of the 
Iberian Peninsula. The origins for Ashkenazi 
traditions, excluding those practices that were 
added during the period of domicile in northern 
Europe, have been traced to the Holy Land. 
During the period after the destruction of the 
Second Temple in 70 C.E. many Jews journeyed 
to Italy. After living in Italian communities for 
hundreds of years the Jews were invited by 
Christian noblemen of northern Europe during 
the tenth century, to settle in northern France and 
the Rhineland and to help establish centers of 




‘trade. More often than not they migrated in the 




farm of nuclear communities. Thus, the 
Ashkenazi traditions are traced to Israel while the 
Sephardi traditions are traced to the great 
Talmudic academies of Sura and Pumbedita in 




Babylonia, today known as Iraq. 


Despite the differences in traditions, the 
Hebrew language served as a common bond 
between Jews throughout Europe. The following 
incident will demonstrate that indeed this was the 
case. When Rabbi Asher b. Yehiel, the famous 
student of Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, arrived in 
Toledo, Spain at the beginning of the fourteenth 
century, he was immediately accepted as a 
rabbinic leader. There he led a Talmudic academy 
and delivered his lectures in the Hebrew language 
which was comprehensible to all his students. We 
can assume that the overwhelming number of 
students were Sephardim. Rabbi Asher was 
representative of those Ashkenazi scholars who 
entered the Sephardic world because of expul- 
sion from northern Europe. 


At this point in our cultural travelogue the 
historical significance of the Bension Sephardic 
Manuscripts and Texts begins to become ap- 
parent. The collection contains a manuscript 
volume of the Responsa of the aforementioned 
Rabbi Asher b. Yehiel. Responsa are the answers 
that a rabbinic scholar gives to Jewish legal 
questions that have been addressed to him by 
individuals, communities, or other rabbinic 
scholars who may be seeking his guidance. 


Although Rabbi Asher was educated in the 
Rhineland by Ashkenazi masters, he became the 
adopted teacher of the Sephardim in Toledo, 
Spain. He served as a vital cultural link between 
the Talmudical traditions of the Franco-German 
schools of the Tosaphists, those who added their 
comments to the Talmudic texts from the twelfth 
until the fourteenth centuries, and the Talmudical 
academies in Spain. It appears that his principles 
of Talmudic interpretation were compatible with 
those of the Sephardim. The collection contains 
an early manuscript volume of the Responsa of 
Rabbi Solomon ibn Adret of Barcelona, who was 




Historical background 




acknowledged as the greatest halakhic authority 
in Spain in the early part of the fourteenth cen- 
tury, and a comtemporary of Rabbi Asher b. 
Yehiel. The great Sephardi codifier of the six- 
teenth century was Rabbi Joseph Caro. He stated 
that in all his halakhic decisions he was guided by 
three luminaries of Jewish law, namely, Rabbi 
Isaac Alfasi, Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, and Rabbi 
Asher b. Yehiel. Thus we note that Rabbi Asher’s 
absorption into the spectrum of Sephardic culture 
was complete. 


Rabbi Asher’s son, Rabbi Jacob, was 
representative of tne first generation of children 
of Ashkenazi parents from northern Europe who 
came to settle in Spain, and who were subse- 
quently influenced by the teachings of Spanish 
Jewry. Rabbi Jacob Bal Ha-Turim, as he was 
called because of his codification of Jewish law in 
four books called Rows-“Turim,” cites the rulings 
of the Sephardic rabbis such as Rabbi Solomon 
ibn Adret side by side with the rulings of his father, 
Rabbi Asher, and other northern European 
Ashkenazi Talmudic authorities. The collection 
contains a late fifteenth century printed edition 
of Rabbi Jacob’s “Tur” Shulhan Arukh—Code 
of Jewish Law. Rabbi Jacob passed on in 1340. 
A famous halakhic work on Jewish liturgy which 
was produced by his contemporary, Rabbi David 
Abudarham, is also included in the collection in 
a printed edition of the late fifteenth century. 


We mentioned earlier that the Jews of France 
were expelled in 1306. On several occasions they 
were invited to return to France and shortly 
thereafter they were again expelled. A similar 
opportunity was offered to the Jews by the 
German principalities. However, a more dis- 
astrous fate was to greet the Jews in German 
lands than even that visited upon them during 
the Rindfleish persecutions. A band of ruffians 
massacred many Jewish communities in the

Historical background 




Armlieder persecution of 1336-1338. In the next 
decade the Black Death plague was blamed upon 
the Jews who, according to rumor, were acting in 
consort with the Moslems to poison the wells of 
Christian Europe. The fourteenth century has 
been regarded as the blackest in the history of 
northern European Jewry. 


Unlike their co-religionists of northern Europe 
the Jews of the Iberian peninsula passed the 
fourteenth century in relative tranquility. 
However, suddenly the sky fell in on Spanish 
Jewry in 1391. We will briefly outline the events 
that led to the debacle of 1391 which did not reach 
its climax for the Jews of Spain until the issuance 
of the edict of expulsion in 1492, and for the Jews 
of Portugal in the year 1497. 


While the Mohammedans controlled Spain for 
about three centuries, they did not exercise any 
uniform control, which was characteristic of the 
political history of this period. They were divided 
into a number of smaller states perpetually 
quarreling amongst themselves. The _ ruling 
Almoravid dynasty was toppled by the fanatical 
Almohads (both were of Berber origin) of North 
Africa in the middle of the twelfth century and this 
contributed to a further weakening of the political 
hold of Islam in Iberia. The Almohads’ invasion 
caused repercussions in the Jewish communities. 
Maimonides left Spain for North Africa and the 
Kimhi family moved from Spain to the Provence. 
We can conclude that other Jews also left Spain at 
this time. The Christians who held some parts of 
northern Spain seized the opportunity to go on 
the offensive which became known as the 
Reconquista, in the first decade of the thirteenth 
century. 


By the second decade of the thirteenth century 
only the kingdom of Granada was under Moorish 
control. The majority of Jews who lived in Aragon, 
Castile, Leon, Portugal, and Navarre were now 




4 




under Christian domination and they faced the 
full brunt of anti-Jewish legislation and the 
prejudices that Christians promulgated and 
perpetuated wherever they ruled in Europe. In this 
age of turmoil it became increasingly difficult for 
rulers to allow for a climate of free intellectual 
exchanges. The splendor of the golden age of 
Spanish Jewry began to dim. 


The economic factor of the growth of a 
merchant class in the cities became a new force 
for the rulers to contend with. Christian 
merchants viewed Jewish merchants and 
tradesmen as competitors and the former sought 
favored status at the expense of the Jews. 
Occasionally the kings sought the support of the 
townspeople as a check against the nobility. 
Furthermore, the kings used the Jews as tax 
farmers and treasurers to secure funds that were 
needed by them to live opulently and to conduct 
military campaigns. This gave the Christian 
element further reason for disliking the Jews. The 
convergence of all these factors served to cause 
the first outbreaks against the Jews in 1391. 
Ferrand Martinez, the father confessor to the 
Queen-Mother of young King Henry VII, began to 
stir up mobs against the Jews from city to city. 
The Jewish communities of Seville, Cordoba, and 
Toledo, amongst others, were almost annihilated. 
Many individuals were given the choice between 
baptism or death. A significant number chose 
baptism hoping thereby to live as Jews in secret 
while protecting their positions which had been 
secured over hundreds of years of settlement. 
While some chose martyrdom rather than to 
submit to baptism, others were able to flee to 
North Africa. Some Jews who arrived in the 
Maghreb had already lived as Christians. Upon 
their arrival, Rabbinic tribunals sought methods 
by which the unfortunates could be restored to 
their people. Rabbi Isaac bar Sheshet and Rabbi 




Simeon b. Zemah Duran, of Algiers were among 
those rabbis who dealt with this problem at the 
end of the fourteenth century. 


The New Christians were a source of great 
disturbance as they rose in privilege and in 
importance. Thus, the Inquisition was instituted 
to ferret out those who were regarded as insincere 
Christians. In order to facilitate their work the 
Christian clergy requested the rulers to remove 
Jews and Mohammedans from the kingdom. The 
edict of expulsion issued in Spain in 1492, forced 
the Jews to leave their wealth behind while they 
had to seek domicile in new lands. Jewish 
notables interceded with Ferdinand and Isabella, 
but to no avail. 


Isaac Abrabanel, an advisor to the rulers of 
Spain and Portugal, left for Italy upon expulsion. 
While Italy was more favorably disposed to the 
Jews than the other western European powers 
heretofore mentioned, the various duchies and 
the Papal States subsequently instituted in- 
quisitions and expulsions. One of the reasons that 
Jewish notables left for Italy as a place of refuge 
was that the Italian princes required their finan- 
cial expertise. Many others turned to the rapidly 
expanding Turkish empire. Large Sephardic 
communities were established by the Meg6ra- 
shim—those expelled were thus designated— 
in Salonika and Constantinople. Eventually some 
used this route as a stepping stone to settlement 
in the Holy Land. 


A major portion of over 150,000 Jewish 
emigrés made their way to the shores of North 
Africa. Entire communities of the Megérashim 
transplanted themselves to Fez, Debdou, Meknés, 
Tangiers, Tetuan, Salé, Safi, Tunis, Algiers, 
Tripoli, and a host of other communities along the 
shores of the Maghreb. Often ransom had to be 
paid for the Jews who were carried across the 
Strait of Gibraltar when their vessels were 




Historical background 




accosted by pirates who abounded in those 
waters. While some Muslim communities 
perpetrated rape and pillage against these 
unfortunates when they were thrust upon their 
shores, the overwhelming number of North 
African communities were very happy to receive 
these new settlers. It should be noted that asevere 
famine prevailed in Morocco in 1492. The Sultans 
looked upon these newcomers as a constructive 
adjunct to the native Jewish population. The 
economic and political sophistication of the 
industrious newcomers was looked upon as a real 
asset to the future development of North Africa. 


While admittedly there were some marked 
differences in outlook between the Megérashim 
and the native Jewish population known as 
Toshavim, there were also similarities. The Jews 
of Spain and North Africa shared many religious 
traditions drawn from a common Sephardic 
heritage that was nurtured in a Moslem environ- 
ment in Spain and in the Maghreb. Students from 
North Africa frequented the rabbinic academies 
of Spain and liaison was established between 
Jewish families on both sides of the Strait of 
Gibraltar. It was natural for Spanish Jewry to flee 
to a place like Morocco because of the 
geographic proximity and a common sharing of 
traditions. 


In the following years Castilian Jewry did 
succeed, in great measure, in preserving the 
distinct customs and halakhic traditions that they 
brought with them from Spain by establishing 
their own synagogues and by living in accordance 
with their traditions. In fact, in many communal 
matters the Castilians were able to win over the 
native born North African Jews to their ways of 
thinking and practices. In other matters a friction 
continued to persist between both Jewish groups. 


A new spirit of cultural and commercial 
rejuvenation was infused into the indigenous 




5 




Historical background 




Jewish communities by the newcomers. While we 
may be certain that the emigrés from Spain could 
not take their gold and silver with them they were 
able to transport their spiritual treasures, their 
scholars, and their literature. This was especially 
the case in the area of philosophical literature. 
While the philosophical traditions of Aristotle and 
the Neo-Platonic school had finally received wide 
acceptance on the European continent at the end 
of the thirteenth century by Jewish and Christian 
scholastic circles, they were not popularized in 
North Africa, where a more conservative religious 
atmosphere prevailed. It remained for the 
Megorashim to disseminate philosophical texts 
and studies. Among the manuscripts in the 
Bension collection there is acopy of Maimonides’ 
“Moreh’—Guide of the Perplexed; also there are 
two manuscripts of aphoristic literature which 
were popularized by philosophic writers. 


While many refugees settled in North Africa, 
not all remained there. In the early sixteenth 
century, we find the Maghreb becoming a way 
station to the Holy Land. One of the many 
celebrated personalities who came to Fez and 
subsequently journeyed to Palestine was Rabbi 
Jacob Berab. He studied in Spain with the famous 
Rabbi Isaac Aboab who was the author of the 
popular homiletic work Menorat ha-Ma’or. In the 
collection there is an early printed edition of this 
work. Rabbi Berab sought refuge at Tlemcen and 
later he became rabbi at Fez. After disseminating 
Torah learning in Morocco for a number of years 
he arrived in Safed in 1534. Rabbi Jacob Berab 
was also regarded as a teacher of Rabbi Joseph 
Caro, the celebrated author of the Shulhan 
Arukh—Code of Jewish Law. Other famous 
scholars who journeyed from Spain to Morocco 
and then eastward at this time were Abraham 
Zacuto and Rabbi David ibn Abi Zimra; the latter 
finally settled in Egypt.

We would be guilty of presenting an un- 
balanced historical picture if we viewed the 
conditions under which the Jews in the Maghreb 
lived as having been appreciably more satisfac- 
tory than the conditions of their settlement in 
Spain until the end of the fifteenth century. Two 
factors which undoubtedly contributed to the 
decision of the family of Maimonides to leave 
Cordoba for Fez in North Africa in c. 1150 was the 
religious policy of the ascendant Almohad 
movement, which did not tolerate the existence of . 
non-Muslims and discouraged the study of 
philosophy as inimical to the true interests of 
Islam. During the reign of Abu Ya’Qub Yusuf 
(1165-84) the resurgence of Almohad fanaticism 
in Fez resulted in a new wave of forced conver- 
sions. Those who refused to be converted were 
put to death. At this time Maimonides left Fez for 
the Middle East. It is apparent that many families 
departed Morocco for Spain and the Provence 
when conditions became unbearable. Members 
of the ibn Danan family are representative of 
those Moroccan Jews who crisscrossed the Strait 
of Gibraltar as the exigencies of the times no 
doubt required. A further deterioration in the con- 
dition of Moroccan Jewry took place during the 
reign of al-Mansur (1184-1199) when he imposed 
upon the Jews, whether or not they were 
converted, the wearing of a distinctive badge 
called the Shikla because he questioned their 
sincerity to live by the rule of Islam. During the 
reign of al-Ma’mun (1227-1232) the Jews were 
permitted domicile in Morocco. However, shortly 
after, they were massacred at Marrakesh. Only 
when the Merivid dynasty replaced the Almohads 
in 1269 did Jews come to settle in Morocco in 
appreciable numbers. During the reign of the 
Almohads Jews sought refuge in the Christian 
territories of southern Europe and in the East. The 
Jews were favorably received by Christian rulers 




in northern Spain, in the territories of Aragon, 
Catalonia, and in Majorca. 


The Jews of Morocco enjoyed relatively good 
conditions during the reign of the Merinid Sultans 
from 1269 to 1438. The Jewish ambassadors of 
the Christian kings of Spain were well received 
and native Jews were taken into the service of the 
sultans. The Moroccan Jews played a prominent 
role in the Sahara gold trade and in the exchanges 
with Christian countries. An indication of the 
tranquility of this period was the appearance of a 
Moroccan Jewish philosopher Judah ben Nissim 
ibn Malka who was active in the second half of the 
fourteenth century. 


In the fifteenth century, as the Merinid dynasty 
began its decline, the Jews began to suffer. For 
the first time in Moroccan history the institution of 
what European Jewry was to refer to as a“‘ghetto” 
was introduced to the Jews of Fez, as they were 
enclosed in the walls of the mellah, in 1438. In the 
political upheaval that marked the fall of the 
Merinid dynasty, in 1465, many Jews were 
murdered or forcibly converted. Some families 
fled to Spain only to return to Morocco a 
generation later because of the general expulsion 
of Spanish Jewry. When Muhammad al-Shaykh 
al-Wattasi came to power in 1471, he permitted 
the Jews who were forcibly converted to return to 
Judaism. He was the founder of the Wattasid 
dynasty that ruled the territories around Fez and 
he was the ruler who welcomed those who were 
subsequently expelled from Spain and Portugal. 


The Portuguese began capturing port cities 
along the North African coast in 1415 with their 
taking of Ceuta. By the beginning of the sixteenth 
century Portugal occupied part of the Moroccan 
coast on the Atlantic Ocean, while Spain con- 
quered cities off the Moroccan coast on the 
Mediterranean at the end of the first decade of the 
sixteenth century. Surprisingly, the Portuguese 




Historical background 




employed the Jews who were expelled from their 
lands as negotiators and political emissaries to 
the Muslim rulers. Other Jews who lived under the 
Wattasids of Fez and the sharifs of Marrakesh 
were the principal negotiators of the peace 
settlements between the Muslims and the Por- 
tuguese. Even more astonishing was the fact that 
Spanish and Portuguese Jewish exiles were 
engaged by the Moroccan rulers as ambassadors 
to the courts of Iberia. These Jews apparently 
prevailed upon a number of their co-religionists 
who had earlier publicly opted out of Judaism 
while remaining Jews in secret in order to remain 
as New Christians in Spain and Portugal, to settle 
in Morocco where they could return to Judaism. 


The New Christians who were known by a 
variety of appellations such as Morranos, Conver- 
sos, Anusim, and Chuetas came to Morocco in the 
sixteenth century from the Iberian Peninsula, the 
Azores, and the Canary Islands, and some may 
even have returned from the Americas. Centers 
for reconversion to Judaism were established in 
the major cities of Morocco. 


The first Sherifian dynasty known as the Sa‘dis 
ascended the throne of Morocco by conquering 
Marrakesh in 1525 and Fez in 1549. The Sa’dis 
defeated the Portuguese army in 1578 and from 
that time Portuguese influence began to decline 
in North Africa. The Netherlands became the hub 
of commerce in northern Europe and the city 
states of Italy played that role on the Mediterra- 
nean. Moroccan Jewry served the Sa’di dynasty in 
both centers of the commercial world. Samuel 
Pallache, a Jew, arrived in the Netherlands and 
signed the first alliance pact between Morocco 
and Christian Holland. 




The cultural background 
as revealed in the manuscripts 
Among the masters of mystical literature in Spain 




ri 




Cultural background 




during the thirteenth century were Nahmanides 
and his contemporaries, Abraham Abulafia, 
Shem-Tob ibn Gaon, Joseph Gikatilla, Moses de 
Leon, and Nahmanides’ student, Rabbi Solomon 
ibn Adret. This coterie of scholars represented 
the Jewish esoteric tradition which stood in 
opposition to the Maimonidean rational philo- 
sophical system and its adherents. In the Col- 
lection there is a fragment of a manuscript of the 
classical commentary of Nahmanides on the 
Decalogue Ms. 301. The author presented his 
rational insights alongside his mystical interpre- 
tations of the biblical texts. 


The Zohar, Book of Splendor, was traditionally 
associated with the mystical teachings of Rabbi 
Simeon Bar Y ohai of the second century. This text 
continues to be part of the trilogy that is venerated 
by Moroccan Jewry: namely the Bible, Talmud, 
and Zohar. The Zohar and its associated literature 
were brought from Spain to Morocco. The forced 
geographic movement of thousands of Jews from 
Spain at the end of the fifteenth century began to 
spawn a number of dynamic systems and 
movements in Judaism. Such a revolution took 
place in Jewish Mysticism, but it did not achieve 
its full expression until the appearance of Rabbi 
Isaac Luria in the mystical community of Safed, in 
the Holy Land, after the second half of the 
sixteenth century. His system became known as 
Ari Kabbalism or Lurianic Kabbalism. 


The dynamic concepts of spiritual exile and 
redemption of the soul took on new dimensions 
because of the recent mass physical exile that the 
Jews had to endure under the Spanish expulsion. 
An age of suffering was considered preamble to 
the final redemption. The chief exponent and 
literary figure of Lurianic Kabbala was Rabbi 
Hayyim Vital who had lived in North Africa and 
eventually sat at the Ari’s feet in Safed. Rabbi 
Hayyim Vital was among the unwitting popu- 




8 




larizers who made Kabbalism go public. In 
previous centuries only the select initiates could 
delve into this esoteric wisdom. The need for 
Tikkun—self improvement—was so urgent and 
the time so propitious, that the secrets had to be 
made available to every Jew. It was a matter 
greater than physical survival; it was a matter of 
salvation. The collection contains a manuscript 
copy of Hayyim Vital’s classical work called Etz 
Hayyim—the Tree of Life. 


The social phenomenon that accompanied the 
rampant mystical manifestations was the 
Messianic movement. The communities of North 
Africa were vulnerable to the Messianic tides that 
swept Europe during the days of Shabbetai Zevi. 
Long after the Messianic fervor had subsided on 
the European continent its embers were kept 
burning by its devotees in the Maghreb. Un- 
doubtedly the mystical literature of Spain and the 
new esoteric expression of Lurianic Kabbalism 
had fired the imagination of the Jewish masses. 
Among several of the documents in the Bension 
Collection that contain mystical elements, the 
manuscript numbered 46 in the “Yalkut Roiim” 
volume is of special interest. The author of this 
text uses the biblical passage “Blot out the 
memory of Amalek” (Deut. 25:19) to demonstrate 
his view that the year 1688 is significant for 
Messianic events. The Holy Name of God is 
computated together with the Hebrew terms 
“Timhe” and “Zekhr’” and the term “Yimlokh”—He 
will reign. The implication is that the enemies of 
Israel will be blotted out and God will manifest His 
glory in the year 1688. 


The tradition that Elijah the prophet revealed 
himself to saintly scholars is noted in Ms.85. 
Examples of mystical elements that appear in 
poems and prayers are found in the collection. A 
poem by R. Jacob Ibn Zur, on the Ten Sephirot 
and the Holy Names of God, appears in Ms. 84. 




A mystical prayer for protection when travelling in 
a dangerous area under siege is recorded in 
Ms.177. \t reads as follows: “May the names of 
Sandalphon and Uriel strive to save me from the 
enemy and from those who lie in wait forme on my 
journey.” Another prayer, which is supplicatory in 
nature and which possesses mystical elements, 
appears in Ms.241. After mentioning the merit of 
the scholars, saints, matriarchs, and patriarchs, 
the author adds “for the sake of the Ofanim and 
Seraphim, Hashmalim, Tarshishim and the Holy 
Hayydt, may you separate from me, your servant, 
the son of your maidservant, all those who would 
despise me and harm me.” 


A new figure appeared in the Maghreb who 
was responsible for the dissemination of the new 
mystical studies. He soon became an institution; 
he was cailed the Haham Kollel. He was a rabbi 
well versed in Kabbala, who journeyed forth as an 
emissary from the Kabbalistic centers of Safed, 
Tiberias, and Jerusalem to collect donations for 
their maintenance. He lectured on mystical 
themes, he provided the latest news that he 
amassed during his travels, he played an impor- 
tant role in stimulating the Hebrew book trade, 
and he brought glowing reports about the 
religious centers in the Holy Land, thus keeping 
the Messianic hope alive in the far flung com- 
munities. 


The Haham Kollel was a vital force for in- 
jecting Zionistic fervor into Moroccan Jewry. This 
Zionism, which was based more on religious than 
on secular motives, prepared the Moroccans 
psychologically for mass migration to Israel. 
Unlike the European Jews who had experienceda 
major holocaust, the stimulus for North African 
Jewish aliyah was based on Messianic yearnings. 


If a Haham Kollel died during his journeying 
he would be regarded as a saint and his burial site 
would become a place for religious pilgrimage. 




Cultural background 




These pilgrimages to the graves of the saints 
throughout Morocco as well as the daily recitals 
of Zohar were, in some communities, regarded as 
ways to ward off the evil forces and demons 
known as Jinns, to restore health, and to help the 
Moroccan meet the daily adversities of mellah 
existence. Talismans and amulets were also 
popular as protection from the “evil eye.” The text 
of an amulet which was intended to protect one 
from plagues appears pasted on to Ms.18. Similar 
practices won wide-spread appeal among large 
segments of east European Jewry until the advent 
of the twentieth century. Practical Kabbala was 
more pronounced, while the theoretical studies of 
speculative mysticism, which characterized the 
Spanish schools of Kabbala, were being pursued 
with zeal because of the influence of the new 
school of Lurianic Kabbala. In Ms.269, R. Raphael 
Moses Elbaz asks R. Solomon Ibn Zur to extend 
aid to R. Mordecai Elbaz. Among the latter’s 
virtues it is noted that he “devotes himself to 
Torah study constantly and especially to the 
study of Zohar.” In Ms.220, R. Menahem Serero 
informs R. Jacob Ibn Zur that R. Habib Toledano 
is sending R. Jacob a copy of a mystical work 
called Sefer Zerubbabel. R. Menahem says that he 
would appreciate R. Jacob’s comments after he 
has read the work. R. Menahem notes that this 
work was composed by the author of Pirkei 
Haikhalét, the Talmudic master R. Ishmael 
Kohen-Gadél. 


A providential aid to the perpetuation of 
Jewish literature at the time of the expulsion was 
the invention of printing. A golden age of Hebrew 
printing was attained in Italy in the first half of the 
sixteenth century, thanks to the efforts of the 
Soncino family, Samuel Latif, and Samuel 
Zarefati. Non-Jewish printers in Italy, such as 
Daniel Bomberg, engaged Jewish scholars to aid 
in choosing the best of the available manuscripts 




9 




Cultural background 




as the basis for the printed text. Turkey, in 
Constantinople and Salonika, took second place 
in the Hebrew printing field after Italy. In Portugal, 
Eliezer Toledano had published Hebraic and 
rabbinic works before the edict of expulsion. 
The art of printing was brought to North Africa 
by the Spanish and Portuguese emigrés. The 
main location for the publishing of Hebrew books 
in Morocco was at Fez during the second decade 
of the sixteenth century. A Hebrew printing 
establishment was founded at Tunis in the third 
quarter of the eighteenth century and at Oran, 
Algiers in the middle of the nineteenth century. It 
was not until the end of the first quarter of the 
seventeenth century that Hebrew books were 
published at Amsterdam. The early printed works 
of the Bension collection that have been identified 
came from Ferrara, Lisbon, and Amsterdam. 
It is perhaps understandable why the works of 
Jewish scholars in Morocco were published in 
Amsterdam. They obviously had contacted the 
Sephardim who were prominent in the publishing 
industry in the Jewish community in Amsterdam. 
Among the leaders in the Hebrew printing field in 
Amsterdam was Manasseh Ben Israel. The 
principal centers of Hebrew publishing moved 
from southern Europe to central and eastern 
Europe by the middle of the eighteenth century. 
Another intellectual “spin-off” resulting from 
the Spanish expulsion was the development of an 
historical sensitivity as Sephardic scholars of the 
post-expulsion period began to write chronicles 
about the unfortunate events they had experienc- 
ed as eye witnesses. These scholars analyzed the 
calamitous events which had brought down the 
curtain ona thousand years or more of domicile in 
Spain. They memorialized the martyrs and left a 
record of the accomplishments of their co- 
religionists of earlier periods until their own time 
for posterity. Among these historians were 




10 




Abraham Zacuto, who wrote the Sefer Yuhasin 
which listed those personalities who brought 
glory to Spanish Jewry; Yehudah Ibn Verga who 
moralized about the reasons for the calamity in 
his work Shevet Yehudah; and the work Emek ha- 
Bakha, ‘Valley of Weeping,’ which was composed 
by Joseph Ha-Kohen. 


The historical method of the Sephardim was 
perpetuated and given greater depth of expres- 
sion by Moroccan Jewry. The repeated attacks 
upon the mellahs gave impetus to record the 
events that led to the martyrdom of co-religionists 
and the pillage of synagogues. The instability of 
the political situation in Morocco during the years 
1640-1680 had its repercussions in the misfor- 
tunes that befell the Jewish communities. At Fez, 
Bu-Begir, acting in behalf of the ruler who was a 
religious fanatic, ordered the complete destruc- 
tion of all synagogues and schools of the Jews of 
that city. Among the synagogues that were 
destroyed are the following: the synagogue of the 
Meg6rashim, the Atazi synagogue, and the 
synagogue of R. Isaac Abirgil, as well as the syn- 
agogue of the Toshavim. Only two were spared, 
the synagogues named after R. Saadya Rabuh 
and R. Jacob Roti. The same policy was promul- 
gated in Tetuan among other communities. 


One historical-legal document in the collec- 
tion, Ms.43, gives an account of the pillage of the 
synagogue of the Toshavim in the mellah of Fez, 
in the year 1647. R. Isaac Sarfati was instrumental 
in preventing the complete destruction of the 
synagogue by paying a ransom to the attackers. 
The document is signed by the leaders of the 
Jewish community since it involved the sale of 
synagogue ritual vestments which were purchas- 
ed by R. Isaac Sarfati. The latter served as the 
Nagid—political leader of the Jewish community 
of Fez—during the middle of the seventeenth 
century. The leading religious figure of this period 




was R. Saadya ibn Danan who supported the 
efforts of the aforementioned R. Isaac in im- 
plementing communal legislation against those 
who informed on the Jewish community to the 
governmental authorities. Another figure of this 
period (c. 1649) who appears in Mss.141 and 144 
is R. Ezra di Paridosh, who was a celebrated 
scribe gifted in the use of metaphor. His signature 
appears on two dowries composed at Marrakesh 
in 1649. 


Other personalities of this period who appear 
in Mss. 194 and 199 are the rabbis of Tetuan, 
Hananiah Arubash, Jacob Halevi, and Isaac 
Abudarham. R. Immanuel b. Menahem Serero (c. 
1610-1680) of Fez, who was empowered by Isaac 
ibn Maman to act for him in matters pertaining to 
the estate of his late brother Moses ibn Maman, 
according to Ms.199, was appointed a judge 
during the lifetime of his paternal uncle, the 
famous Saul b. David Serero. These documents, 
which were composed in 1647, concern the estate 
of the late brother of Isaac ibn Maman. The 
aforementioned R. Jacob Halevi was known as a 
Kabbalist; he was author of a book on responsa 
called “Beit Yaakov,” and a writer of elegies and 
liturgical pieces. 


Rabbi Jacob b. Joseph b. Danan of Fez was 
active as a scribe during the ministration of R. 
Saul Serero (c. 1606). Rabbi Jacob was subse- 
quently elevated to a judgeship in the rabbinic 
court of Fez. He composed a work on Jewish law 
which was quoted by subsequent scholars. R. 
Jacob ibn Danan signed a legal document, 
Ms.172. This document is especially interesting 
since it obliges one to reflect on the legal status of 
the Jew in relation to his Mohammedan counter- 
part. 


The Charter of Omar, which was formulated in 
the ninth century and codified by Al-Mawardi, 
gave Jews the legal status of Dhimmi Ahl el Kitab, 




Cultural background 




protegés of Muslim society. Among the advan- 
tages offered to the Christians and Jews, who 
were regarded as “people of the Book’—the 
Bible, were the right to live and the declaration of 
their property as inviolable. These rights were not 
always available to the Jews of Europe under 
Christian canon law. However, even in Islamic 
society there were limitations; Jews and 
Christians were not permitted to own a horse, 
which was regarded as a noble beast. A donkey, 
which was a lowly beast of burden, presented no 
problems of ownership. A mule as an article of 
transaction could pose a problem since it was part 
horse. Therefore, when Gideon ibn Sa’id Ha- 
Kohen purchased a mule from Yahya b. Abraham 
ibn Arwah for one hundred and eighty uqiot in 
1624, a clause had to be inserted stating that both 
parties agreed that if a Muslim should initiate a 
claim for the mule in a Muslim court and he won 
his claim, then Yahya, the vendor, would restore 
to Gideon, the purchaser, sixty ugiot, which was 
one-third of the original price. If Gideon won the 
case the loss that he might incur in payment for 
his legal defense might accrue to the total price of 
the animal plus an additional twenty ugiot. If the 
court expenses should exceed this amount then 
Yahya would be liable to pay half of any additional 
amount. 


R. Saul Serero, who was active in the early part 
of the seventeenth century, served more than fifty 
years as a rabbi in Fez. His ministration extended 
from 1602 to 1655. After the demise of R. Samuel 
ibn Danan, R. Saul Serero was the Chief Rabbi of 
Fez for the next thirty years. A rabbi of Algiers, 
R.S. Zror, said of him that he was unique in his 
generation and the law was always decided in 
accord with his opinion. He is known for his 
halakhic work called “Urim Ve-Thumim.” In it he 
informs the reader that his name was changed, 
because of illness, to Samuel.

Cultural background 




Chronicles were composed by the leading 
scholars of the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries. Specimens composed by R. Saul b. 
David Serero and R. Samuel b. Saul ibn Danan 
are noted in Ms. 87. In the latter's chronicle a 
statement is attributed to the Talmudic sage 
Hanina b. Dosa which justifies the function of the 
chronicler; namely, that the tribulations of Israel 
should be recorded as well as the miracles. Every 
aspect of human existence was considered by the 
chroniclers to be a part of some divine plan and 
was accorded historical importance. Even such 
minute details as the formation of clouds in daily 
weather reports, especially during periods of 
famine and drought, were not considered too 
mundane to be recorded. 


R. Saul b. David Serero writes in Ms.87 abouta 
famine that transpired between 1604 and 1606 at 
Fez, which took the lives of about three thousand 
souls, including that of R. Jacob ibn Attar. A 
lamentation was composed on the twentieth day 
of Adar 1606. During the second decade of the 
seventeenth century an incident is reported 
concerning one called Hamdun whose sons were 
killed by brigands. Hamdun wanted to blame the 
Jews and pour his wrath upon them. R. Saul 
Serero reported the incident to the king’s officials 
as well as to the Nagid, R. Jacob Roti, who 
accompanied the king. After many bribes were 
paid safety was assured. The movements of the 
royal retinue are also meticulously recorded. 


On another occasion, R. Saul Serero states 
that brigands, about ten of them, tried to enter his 
home through a window, but his brother David 
saw them and the brigands started shooting 
arrows. R. Saul and his brother thereupon threw 
stones at them until they fled. Conditions were so 
bad at Fez that R. Saul Serero moved to Sefrou. He 
also reported the upheavals of the community in 
Tafilalet where the majority of Jews suffered 




12 




death, pillage, and starvation during a siege. 
Others were sold into slavery and the synagogues 
were destroyed. The Nagid was either hanged 
or crucified. The death of King Mulay Abdallah 
is reported. An earthquake was noted to have 
occurred on the twenty-second of lyar 1625. 
Samuel b. Saul ibn Danan, writing on Thurs- 
day, the tenth of Tevet 1724, reports a famine that 
lasted for three years, from 1721 to 1724, anda 
drought that continued for four years. The price of 
wheat was quoted at one hundred and thirty-five 
ugiot. A circuit of fasts was meticulously observ- 
ed. A great penitential convocation took place in 
1723 at the communities of Meknés, Salé, and 
Sefrou, as Torah scrolls were brought forth. 
Subsequently, rain fell for three days, whereupon 
the price of barley was reduced and wheat was 
quoted at sixty ugiot. The chronicler reports that 
the misfortune at Fez was indescribable. 
Another chronicler of the seventeenth century 
was the illustrious scholar R. Saadya ibn Danan 
who is noted in Ms.258. The copyist of R. Saadya’s 
chronicle was Immanuel b. R. Joshua Serero, in 
the month of Heshvan 1724. Some of the excerpts 
are given as follows, “I have it in my grandfather 
R. Samuel ibn Danan’s hand that the Castilian 
expulsion was in 1497. Lest | forget the date | have 
recorded it here. Also he [R. Saadya’s grand- 
father] recorded that the expulsion that occurred 
to the Toshavim of the old city of Fez took place in 
1438. The mellah suffered an expulsion in 1465.” 
Another excerpt from Saadya ibn Danan reports 
an earthquake to have taken place at Fez on the 
seventh of Adar || 1636. As a result of the panic 
that followed, people grabbed weapons and 
attacked one another in confusion. A solar eclipse 
was recorded and the amount of sunlight was 
measured. Stars were seen in the afternoon on the 
twenty-eighth of Nisan 1630. A great quake was 
felt on an early morning in 1624, whereupon a 




great number of houses and towers were 
demolished in the old city of Fez and about three 
thousand, five hundred people were killed. More 
people were injured after the quake because of 
the weakened conditions of the houses. It was 
regarded as a miracle that not one Jew was killed 
although their houses were demolished, especial- 
ly as their houses were not so well constructed as 
the houses of the non-Jews. A reason is given for 
recording this event. “To make known to future 
generations the magnitude of this miracle that 
occurred.” The author is Saadya b. Abraham b. 
Samuel ibn Danan. 


Additional natural occurrences are reported. 
On Wednesday, the eve of Shavuot 1624, the sky 
darkened and small creatures, the upper portion 
of their bodies appearing to be like locusts and 
the bottom like worms, fell from the sky. Simul- 
taneously, a storm of large (hail) stones also 
fell. The weight of one stone was given as four 
uqiot. People who were in the marketplace were 
injured by the falling stones. One stone came 
through the window of R. Moses Almosni’s house 
and broke a vessel. It was reported that a lion 
entered the Giza gate of the old city of Fez and 
killed one donkey and took another with him. “It is 
not known whether this is true but most of the 
non-Jews Say that it transpired.” 


An almanac type of forecasting is offered for 
the cities of Morocco based on when the New 
Year falls. Brigands will abound and wars will be 
fought. The end of the year will be appreciably 
better than the early part of the year. Plentiful rain 
will reduce the price of wheat. The day on which 
the New Year will occur will affect weather 
conditions, health conditions, and whether dif- 
ficulties will be encountered with the crops. 


The chronicler, lmmanuel Monsano of Fez of 
the eighteenth century, appears as the author of 
Ms.275. He commences his chronicle with the 




Cultural background 




usual lament about how unfortunate are the times 
in which he lives. The excerpts deal with the years 
1738-1760. Reports are given as to the scarcity of 
rain and to details of the fasts and services that 
were held. Then he adds, “The head of the 
academy, and the leading rabbi of the community, 
delivered a lecture. The message stressed that 
denial of rain is directly related to the sin of 
neglecting Torah study, since Torah study leads 
to proper actions.” The speaker apparently also 
stated that another moral lapse that causes the 
rains to cease is gossip and the improper exercise 
of speech. Public violation of the Sabbath laws, 
especially by liquor vendors, is also a factor not to 
be discounted. An enactment was instituted to the 
effect that even if a liquor vendor was seen by only 
one witness to be violating the Sabbath by selling 
his wares then he should pay a fine which would 
be used to help the poor. The scholar noted 
another moral lapse which needed correction. 
Jewish women working in Fez for non-Jews 
remained there day and night and on the Sabbath. 
They should henceforth behave in accordance 
with the code that Jewish women are accustomed 
to live by. It was further decided that an emissary 
should make the women return. If the women 
remained adamant in their refusal then the ruler 
should intervene to oblige them to adhere to the 
enactment. 


The political situation is also described. King 
Mulay La-Muztadi acceded to his throne in the 
month of Tammuz 1738 (at Meknés) and was 
declared king at Fez on Friday the eighth of Av. 
The non-Jew Mahmad ibn Abu ibn Sa’id suffered 
a terrible death at the king’s hands at Meknés. 
There was tranquility in the land during Mulay 
La-Muztadi’s reign. 


Immanuel Monsano reports the following: “On 
Sunday, the sixteenth of Shevet 1740, while we 
were engaged in Torah study we were informed 




13 




Cultural background 




that King Mulay La-Muztadi had fled to Fez. The 
entire city was in an uproar because of the reign of 
terror that would follow, especially for the Jewish 
populace, which was the usual course of events 
during unsettled times. That same day R. Jacob 
Monsonyego was wounded in the arm and head 
and lost much blood. The king fled the city in an 
easterly direction when he saw no relief. Mulay 
Abdallah was then declared king. This is the third 
time that he rules.” 


His supporters went to return the king who 
fled, arriving at Meknés in the month of Tishri 
1740. The Al-Wadaya rebelled against the king for 
two months and refused his offer of amnesty 
because they did not trust him. A prayer is added 
that the Messiah might come. Finally, we learn, 
a reconciliation between the king and the Al- 
Wadaya was effected. 


In the year 1758-59 no rain fell. After the usual 
fasts and prayer services some rain fell. Prayers of 
thanksgiving were then recited. When the rain 
ceased the non-Jews asked the Jews to pray for 
rain. Following the prayer service the people went 
to the cemetery to pray at the graves of the saints. 
Psalms were recited at R. Judah ibn Attar’s tomb. 
R. Elijah Ha-Sarfati gave a lengthy discourse. 
That afternoon R. Saul ibn Danan addressed the 
people. On a subsequent occasion R. Elijah 
addressed the people in the morning and R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur addressed them at the afternoon 
service. 


The city of Fez was conquered by King 
Muhammed ben Mulay-Abdallah on Friday, the 
twenty-sixth of Av 1760. Afterwards acannon was 
brought to the mellah and it was fired in the 
cemetery. The king was curious to see what 
distance the missile would attain. 


In the seventeenth century, Moroccan Jewry 
had settlements in a number of communities in 
the Holy Land, at Jerusalem, Tiberias, Hebron, 




14 




and Safed. In anumber of eastern Mediterranean 
countries such as Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Greece, 
and Turkey, Moroccan nuclear communities 
maintained their own synagogues, customs, and 
rabbinic leaders. It is probable that the North 
African scholar R. Ishmael Ha-Kohen Tanuji, 
author of the text Sefer Ha-Zikkaron which 
appears in the Bension collection, functioned asa 
rabbinic leader to North African Jews in Egypt 
during the first third of the sixteenth century. 


The Algerian scholar R. Hayyim Capusi (1540- 
1631), who is mentioned in Ms.85, is another who 
is representative of the movement of scholars 
from Northwest Africa to the Eastern Mediterra- 
nean. R. Hayyim made his way to Egypt where he 
served in a rabbinic capacity in later years. He 
arrived in Egypt during the sixth decade of the 
sixteenth century. He is referred to as Ba’al Nes, 
the one to whom a miracle had occurred, as a 
result of a controversy which he had with the 
scholar R. Bezalel Ashkenazi, compiler of the 
work Shitah Mekubbezet, concerning a suit fora 
debt. R. Hayyim sided with the defendant in the 
suit. Subsequently, he became blind and an 
aspersion was cast upon him that his blindness 
was due to a bribe he had taken. However, his 
sight was soon restored and R. Hayyim felt that he 
was vindicated in the dispute. The synagogue 
where he prayed received the appellation Ba’al 
Nes. 


The illustrious Moroccan scholar and mystic 
R. Hayyim ibn Attar, author of the celebrated 
commentary on the Pentateuch Or ha-Hayyim, 
left Morocco for the Holy Land at an advanced 
age, in the eighteenth century. He took many 
disciples with him since he was desirous of 
opening an academy there. More disciples were 
added to his venture during his stopover in Italy. 
The unsettled economic and political situation in 
Morocco during the fourth decade of the 




eighteenth century was sufficient reason for R. 
Hayyim ibn Attar to make his exodus. R. Hayyim 
Joseph David Azulai, the prolific author and bio- 
bibliographer of the second half of the eighteenth 
century, studied under R. Hayyim ibn Attar. The 
former was a descendant of R. Abraham Azulai, 
the famous mystical scholar of Marrakesh. R. 
Hayyim Azulai is the author of the oft-quoted bio- 
bibliographical work Shem Ha-Gedolim, which is 
cited in Ms.85. He was the first Jewish scholar to 
study the Hebrew manuscripts of Italy and France 
systematically. 


’ The last dynasty of Sharifs to rule Morocco 
until our own day is that of the Alawids. They rose 
to power in the seventeenth century during a 
period of political chaos which marked the end of 
the dynasty of the Sa’dis. Many chronicles are 
available that report on the activities of this 
dynasty. These rulers are noted in some of the 
chronicles that appear in the Bension collection. 
Mulay al-Rashid, who ruled between 1660 and 
1672, was regarded as the founder of the dynasty. 
He received much support from the Jews and he 
subsequently adopted a favorable attitude toward 
them. Mulay Ismail, the brother of Mulay al- 
Rashid, was viceroy in Meknés while his brother 
ruled from Fez. When his brother died in 
Marrakesh, Ismail, with the help of the Jews, 
secured the sultanate for himself. The Jews fared 
better than even most of the Muslim population 
during Mulay Ismail’s long rule, from 1672 to 1727. 


The situation of the Jews began to deteriorate 
at the end of Mulay Ismail’s reign when his sons 
fought over the ascendancy to the sultanate 
which was based in Meknés. Usually these stormy 
periods were of short duration until a ruler was 
finally installed. However, the thirty years follow- 
ing Mulay Ismail’s death, 1727 to 1757, were 
marked by anarchy and suffering for the entire 
population. A vivid report of these events is noted 




Cultural background 




in a chronicle which appears in Ms.275. This 
disorganized state of affairs gave France and 
Spain a golden opportunity to extend their 
influence in Morocco. The Jews dwelling in the 
towns in the interior began a movement to the big 
cities and the coast because of the lack of 
security. 


There arose a number of rabbinic scholars 
who were prolific authors and who directed the 
religious life of Moroccan Jewry during the period 
that overlapped the reign of the aforementioned 
Mulay Ismail and the period of strife which 
followed, from 1672 to 1757. Itis important to note 
that the religious life of Moroccan Jewry was not 
just confined to attendance at the synagogue on 
the Sabbath or even thrice daily. Rather the 
religious leadership played a decisive role in 
legislating on all aspects of daily life such as 
marriage, divorce, and inheritance as well as 
regulating the production and distribution of all 
food supplies, especially meat products which are 
subject to many dietary laws. The regulation of 
weights and measures and the establishment of 
fair pricing also came under rabbinic scrutiny, as 
is noted in Ms.108. The rabbinic courts were the 
formulators of the proper documentation for 
various legal situations such as certification for 
religious functionaries, bills of divorce, bills of 
debt, and legal forms for a variety of commercial 
transactions. The adjudication of property rights 
between individuals as weil as all that which 
pertained to communal property rights came 
under their scrutiny. Occasionally enactments 
were made for the material and spiritual wellbeing 
of the inhabitants of the various communities. 


Often as a result of persecutions and exorbi- 
tant taxes many rabbinic leaders of the various 
communities were obliged to leave. This resulted 
in an absence of rabbinic leadership to serve in 
the rabbinic courts and to educate young men 




15 




Cultural background 




who would be able to meet the future needs of the 
Jewish community. Some communities were 
fortunate in having distinguished scholars who 
stayed on and supervised activities at the rabbinic 
courts while they single-handedly directed 
studies at rabbinic academies. Communities 
which were in dire need of rabbinic leaders would 
often send pleas to larger communities to senda 
scholar of note to settle in their community. Thus, 
the responsibility for the perpetuation of the 
educational system was also the responsibility of 
the rabbinate. 


Dynasties of scholars were nurtured in several 
families. These families are constantly reappear- 
ing in the hundreds of documents of the Bension 
collection, particularly in the “Yalkut Roiim” 
volume. Several of the personalities that were 
especially active in the major Moroccan com- 
munities during the first half of the eighteenth 
century will now be introduced. Among the most 
illustrious rabbinic scholars of Fez were the 
following three: Rabbi Judah ibn Attar, Rabbi 
Jacob b. Reuben Ibn Zur, and R. Samuel ibn 
Elbaz. 




Fez and Meknées— 


seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 


Rabbi Judah ibn Attar lived from 1655 to 1733. He 
was known by the title “Rabbi al-Kabbir,’—The 
Great Rabbi of Fez. R. Judah was a disciple of R. 
Vidal Ha-Sarfati and R. Menahem Serero of Fez. 
He was appointed to serve as judge together with 
his masters in the year 1698. Due to the 
persecutions that took place in Fez he moved to 
Mekneés in 1701. He joined the rabbis Moses 
Toledano ‘and his brother Habib in deciding 
judicial matters before returning to Fez inc. 1704. 
The only judges of the rabbinic court in Fez at this 
time were R. Judah ibn Attar and R. Samuel Ha- 
Sarfati because other scholars had left and had 




16 




not as yet returned to Fez. During his ministration 
as head of the court and as a judge he did not 
receive compensation from the community but he 
was self-employed as a silversmith. He was well 
versed in the customs of Castilian Jewry as well as 
being erudite in all areas of Jewish Law. 
Therefore, all the Moroccan communities turned 
to him with their queries. R. Judah collaborated 
with his younger colleague Jacob Ibn Zur in 
publishing the enactments of the Spanish exiles 
in Fez and in enacting new legislation which 
served as a basis for subsequent development in 
Moroccan Jewish law. In the Bension collection 
Rabbi Judah ibn Attar is noted in over forty-five 
separate documents and texts. R. Judah 
demonstrates great concern for his younger 
colleague, R. Jacob Ibn Zur, and had a high 
regard for R. Jacob’s scholarly attainments. R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur recorded in Ms.85 that the 
prophet Elijah revealed himself to R. Judah ibn 
Attar. 


Rabbi Jacob b. Reuben Ibn Zur (1673-1752), 
appeared to suffer the exigencies of a more 
unsettled life than did his older colleague, R. 
Judah ibn Attar. In spite of his wanderings from 
Fez to Meknés (1720-28) and then to Tetuan 
(1738-40), R. Jacob was able to manifest prolific 
output in many literary directions as well as in 
the field of jurisprudence. Whereas R. Judah 
succeeded in achieving some financial stability, 
R. Jacob was always seeking ways of lessening 
the oppressive financial burden which was his to 
bear. Others usually seemed to be getting the 
better of him in matters of finance. Yet he was 
strong-willed and his temperament was such that 
he would rather suffer than succumb to those who 
attempted to lord it over him. 


An indication that this indeed was the case can 
readily be noted from a very revealing cor- 
respondence in the collection, Ms.227, wherein 




the reason as to why R. Jacob Ibn Zur felt obliged 
to leave Fez, where he enjoyed such prestige, for 
Meknés, is alluded to. R. Judah ibn Attar, who 
is the writer of Ms.227, takes pain to keep R. 
Jacob’s confidence and for this reason his 
essential motive for leaving Fez is not revealed. 
Yet R. Judah notes in a nebulous manner that a 
disorganized state of affairs affecting the Jewish 
community is the cause. 


R. Judah is against R. Jacob’s departure for 
Meknés. However, he refuses to have him write 
to the Nagid of Fez to initiate a process of con- 
ciliation and appeasement. He implies that it is 
the Nagid who should initiate the process of 
reconciliation, since R. Jacob suffers much priva- 
tion because of the situation. He concludes the 
correspondence with his view that because of the 
personalities involved, no real improvement in 
relations will result until R. Jacob confronts the 
Nagid face to face. R. Judah seems to hint that R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur should make some effort to 
confront the Nagid so as to end his exile (at 
Meknés). He writes that he will only intervene in 
the dispute when R. Jacob returns to Fez. 


R. Jacob Ibn Zur knew personal tragedy in the 
untimely death of his two sons who were named 
after his late father, the scholar R. Reuben. The 
Bension collection contains letters of consolation 
in Mss.21 and 37 to R. Jacob on the passing of his 
sons. R. Jacob also suffered the loss of his 
precocious son-in-law, R. Menahem II Serero, at 
the age of twenty-six, which is noted in Ms.35. 


A most revealing correspondence concerning 
this family in later years may be found in the 
collection. It is a response to Aaron Ibn Zur’s 
desire to acquire a family tree, aKtav Yuhasin, on 
the occasion of the forthcoming marriage of his 
daughter. This information was composed in a 
letter on Purim day, 1876 by his brother, who 
desired anonymity. The writer describes the 




Fez and Meknés 




family as having originated in Castile and he 
commences with R. Moses Ibn Zur, who was 
known as Abraham the Hebrew, as the first 
scholar of note who was situated in Morocco. The 
writer regards the disclosure of this information 
as a disturbance of the dead and he asks that the 
letter should be destroyed after the contents are 
revealed, presumably to the groom’s father, 
Mordecai ibn Go. For the entire text see the 
contents of Ms.244. 


R. Jacob Ibn Zur, who was also known by the 
name Yaabez, was the acknowledged Master of 
Jewish law by all the sages of his generation. In 
Ms.19, the leading rabbis of Mekneés speak with 
the highest regard for R. Jacob’s authority. R. 
Mordecai Berdugo states that the custom of 
Castilia remains the final guide for R. Jacob Ibn 
Zur and the former will do nothing until he 
receives permission from R. Jacob Ibn Zur. R. 
Mordecai Berdugo asks R. Jacob Ibn Zur to clarify 
a dispute but he will surely abide by R. Jacob’s 
decision because of the esteem in which he is 
held, see Ms.262. In Ms.117, R. Jacob Toledano 
states that “the scholars of the West relied uponR. 
Jacob Ibn Zur.” See also Mss.118 and 119 where 
R. Mordecai looks to R. Jacob for guidance. In 
Ms.63 the writer states, “that the law is in accord 
with R. Jacob (Ibn Zur) everywhere.” 


R. Jacob was an undisputed master of the 
popular metaphoric style of liturgical poetry of his 
age. He was a prolific composer of poetic 
constructions, several of which appear in the 
Bension collection in Ms.84 while others are 
alluded to in R. Jacob’s correspondence with R. 
Menahem Serero in Ms.105. According to R. 
H.J.D. Azulai, R. Jacob was also accomplished in 
the field of practical Kabbala. One of the poems 
that R. Jacob composed on the mystical theme of 
the ten sephirot and the holy names that are 
related to the sephirot, in twenty-six verses equal 




Ae 




Fez and Meknés 




in number to the Holy Name of the Almighty, 
appears in Ms.84. R, Menahem Serero asks for R. 
Jacob’s comments on a mystical work called 
Sefer Zerubbabel which was composed by the 
author of Pirkei Haikhalét, the Talmudic master, 
R. Ishmael Kohen-Gadol. This correspondence 
appears as Ms.220. |n his prose writings he shows 
an historical sensitivity. He also possessed an 
exhaustive knowledge of the traditions of 
Castilian Jewry. 


Although R. Jacob Ibn Zur never made any 
one community his permanent home he im- 
mediately functioned as the highest authority in 
every community in which he sojourned. While he 
studied under the same masters as did R. Judah 
ibn Attar, namely, the rabbis Vidal Ha-Sarfati, and 
Menahem Serero, he always showed deference to 
his older contemporary. R. Judah was quick to 
capitalize on R. Jacob’s abilities by having him 
serve as ajudge in Fez. Thesignatures of R. Judah 
and R. Jacob that appear together on several 
court documents in the collection are represen- 
tative of this period of R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s activity in 
Fez. (See Mss. 67, 196, 231 and 252.) 


When R. Jacob Ibn Zur moved to Meknés 
much correspondence passed between him and 
his colleague R. Judah ibn Attar. Some letters 
were of a personal nature while others involved 
litigations. (See Mss. 28, 33, 62, 65, 69, 70, 73, 162, 
171, 188, 193, 207, 242, 250 and 257.) R. Jacob Ibn 
Zur had his share of controversies and personality 
Clashes with such figures as R. Jacob ibn Malka, 
R. Jacob Toledano, R. Samuel Azawi, and the 
Nagid of Fez among others. In Ms.35,R.Jacoblbn 
Zur blames R. Jacob Toledano as being the cause 
of his wanderings and of his migration to Tetuan 
because he could not make a living in Meknés 
owing to R. Toledano’s manipulations. 


Towards the end of his life he ordained five of 
his students who subsequently became known as 




18 




the “Court of Five at Fez.” They were (1) Samuel 
Saul b. R. Jacob b. Danan (1700-1766); (2) R 
Ephraim b. Abraham Monsonyego (1710-1780), 
who subsequently served as a judge in Tetuan; (3) 
R. Raphael Obed Ibn Zur (1710-1769), the son of 
R. Jacob Ibn Zur; (4) R. Elijah b. R. Joseph Ha- 
Sarfati (1715- 4805); and (5) R. Matitya b. R. 
Menahem Il Serero, R. Jacob’s grandson. ThusR. 
Jacob Ibn Zur ensured a rabbinic leadership for 
the future generation. He also left many responsa 
in his work called “Mishpat u-Zedakah be- 
Ya’aqov,” which is a good source for history of 
this period. He left much poetry as well. His 
liturgical compositions are sung by Moroccan 
Jewry till this day. Many of his works are still in 
manuscript. R. Jacob Ibn Zur is noted in more 
than sixty documents and correspondences in the 
Bension collection. The pre-eminence of Fez in 
Moroccan Jewish life ended with the death of R. 
Jacob Ibn Zurin 1753. The rabbis of Salé, Hayyim 
Toledano, Aaron the son of Judah Halevi, and 
Jacob Bibas, sent a letter of consolation to R. 
Raphael Obed Ibn Zur on the passing of his father. 
R. Raphael is mentioned as a successor to his 
father in this epistle which appears in Ms. 132. 


R. Samuel ibn Elbaz (1698-1749) was in his 
mid-thirties when he was appointed a judge 
in Fez together with R. Jacob Ibn Zur and R. 
Shalom Edery. His first wife was the grand- 
daughter of R. Nehemia Ha-Kohen, whose sons, 
Moses and Shem Tob, died martyrs’ deaths. 
Subsequently, R. Samuel inherited the authority 
over the synagogue in Fez that had belonged toR. 
Nehemia, established a school there, and in turn 




passed it on to his sons, R. Judah, R. Moses, and 




R. Jacob. R. Samuel Elbaz was shown deference 
by his colleagues on matters pertaining to Jewish 
law. The names of members of this scholarly 
family are noted in thirty-two separate documents 
in the Bension Collection. R. Samuel composed 




many works in the field of Jewish jurisprudence, 
among them decisions that he rendered in re- 
sponsa as well as novellae on several tractates 
of the Talmud. 


R. Samuel b. Abraham Ha-Sarfati (1660-1713), 
who was the cousin of R. Vidal I] Ha-Sarfati (1631- 
1703), was a contemporary of R. Judah ibn Attar 
and served as a judge together with R. Judah at 
Fez. On the seventeenth of Tammuz 1707, the 
rabbis Judah ibn Attar, Samuel Ha-Sarfati, and 
Abraham ibn Danan signed a court document 
affirming Saadya Lahakhusin’s ownership of a 
portion of an upper storey of a house that the 
latter had purchased from a non-Jew named 
Musa. The wife of the Jew David b. Tata o.b.m. 
made a claim against this property. Saadya was 
now protected by the rabbinic tribunal from any 
claims that David’s wife might make. This is the 
subject of Ms. 17. 


On another occasion R. Samuel Ha-Sarfati 
joined R. Judah ibn Attar, R. Vidal Il Ha-Sarfati, R. 
Saadya b. Mimun Aflalo, and R. Isaac Ha-Sarfati 
in attesting to the financial need of R. Isaac 
Melamed who was a scholar of Jerusalem. The 
aforementioned rabbis signed a court document, 
which appears in Ms.192, stating that financial aid 
should be made available to R. lsaac whenever he 
came to Fez. During the period in which this 
document was composed the economic situation 
in Fez was unfavorable for the Jews, while the 
non-Jewish population fared much better. The 
expression “the maidservant inherited the role of 
the mistress,” was used by the rabbis to 
characterize the relations between Muslims and 
Jews and the conditions under which they lived. 
The rabbis pray that the scholar will receive his 
due as economic conditions improve. 


R. Samuel Ha-Sarfati was a co-signer with R. 
Judah ibn Attar, R. Abraham ibn Danan, and R. 
Jacob |bn Zur of acourt document that was drawn 




Fez and Meknés 




up on the seventeenth of Tammuz 1709. On that 
occasion the community of Fez was in need of 
funds so it leased a concession to R. Daniel 
Toledano thereby realizing the necessary funds. 
All the particulars of this transaction are noted in 
Ms.196. 


R. Samuel was a scion of the illustrious Ha- 
Sarfati family which claimed descent from the 
twelfth century Tosafist of Northern France, 
Rabbi Jacob Tam, otherwise known as Rabbenu 
Tam, who was the grandson of the celebrated 
Biblical and Talmudic commentator, Rashi. R. 
Samuel Ha-Sarfati’s paternal grandfather was the 
famous scholar R. Vidal | Ha-Sarfati (1550-1620), 
whose son Issac II (d. 1660) served as the Nagid at 
Fez. R. Vidall was acontemporary of the author of 
the Shulhan Arukh, R. Joseph Caro, according to 
Ms.85. R. Samuel authored many halakhic works 
as well as a text on the aggadic portions of the 
Talmud entitled Petah Ainiiyim. He also wrote an 
exegetical work on the commentaries of Rashi 
and Nahmanides entitled Nimukei Samuel. There 
are more than forty-five citations of the members 
of this illustrious family in the Bension collection, 
with biographical source material available on 
them from the mid-seventeenth century. 
Signatures on legal documents in the collection 
bear the names of many scholars from this 
prestigious family. 


R. Jacob, the son of Joseph ben Malka, served 
as a scribe of the rabbinic tribunal in Fez in the 
year 1717, and was still active as the head of the 
rabbinic court in Tetuan c. 1771. However, his 
irascible nature brought down the ire of his con- 
temporaries who were the leading scholars of 
the age, see Ms.133. Among those who attempted 
to discipline him for his presumption were R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur, R. Shalom Edery, R. Samuel Elbaz, 
and R. Abraham Alel. Even R. Judah ibn Attar did 
not go unscathed from Jacob b. Malka’s barbs. 




19 




Fez and Meknés 




R. Jacob b. Malka is mentioned in several docu- 
ments and correspondences in the Bension col- 
lection. Immanuel Monsano’s letter of consola- 
tion to R. Jacob b. Malka upon the murder of 
his son Samuel in c. 1760 is found in Ms.255. 




R. Samuel b. R. Saul b. Danan (1668-c.1730), 
who served as the chief Ritual Slaughterer in Fez, 
was the composer of a chronicle on the history 
of the Jews of Fez between the sixteenth and 
early eighteenth centuries. This work was called 
Divrei ha-Yamim. The Chronicle Serero which 
is found in Ms.87 includes some chronicles which 
were composed by Samuel b. Saul ibn Danan as 
well as by R. Saul Serero. More than thirty docu- 
ments in the Bension collection note the mem- 
bers of this family, that was indigenous to 
Morocco centuries before the Spanish expulsion. 




The Edery family is mentioned in the Bension 
collection in a dozen different documents. R. 
Shalom Edery, who served as a judge at Fez, was a 
contemporary of R. Judah ibn Attar and R. Jacob 
lbn Zur. He was active between the years 1707 and 
1736. R. Shalom’s signature appears on several 
documents in this collection. 


The Zikhri family was represented in Fez 
during this period by R. Hananiah b. R. Isaiah 
ben Zikhri. R. Hananiah left Fez to settle in Mek- 
nes, where he served as ascribe for the rabbinical 
courts at the beginning of the eighteenth century. 
He was also a composer of liturgical poetry. 
Members of this family are noted in several docu- 
ments of the Bension collection. R. Hananiah b. 
Zikhri and R. Abraham b. David Hasin are the 
signatories to Ms. 113, in a correspondence 
from Meknés to R. Jacob Ibn Zur at Fez, in behalf 
of R. Samuel Maymeran. R. Jacob is asked to 
intercede with R. Shalom Edery to pay more for 
a piece of property even though the sale had been 
consummated a long time before. 




20 




The leading authority of Jewish law at Mek- 
nés during the time that R. Judah ibn Attar was 
active in Fez, was R. Moses Toledano (1643- 
1723). R. Moses inherited the leadership of the 
rabbinic court from his father, R. Hayyim, in the 
year 1680. R. Moses’ younger brother, R. Habib 
(1658-1716), was active as a judge in the year 
1703. Both brothers remained childless. R. 
Habib’s first wife was the daughter of R. Shemaya 
Maymeran. R. Habib’s student, who was regarded 
as the next scholar of prominence in Meknés, 
was R. Moses Berdugo, also known as the Mash- 
bir. He inherited the post of chief of the rabbinic 
court of Meknés upon the death of R. Moses Tole- 
dano, and died in 1731, when he was succeeded 
by R. Moses Adhan. The latter died in the year 
1737. 


The aforementioned brothers Moses and 
Habib Toledano are not the only members of the 
larger Toledano family to be mentioned in twenty- 
two separate documents of the Bension col- 
lection. There were also four other Toledano 
brothers: R. Daniel, R. Barukh, R. Hayyim, and R. 
Jacob, the sons of another R. Moses Toledano 
whose father was R. Barukh. Two of these 
brothers, R. Hayyim and R. Jacob Toledano, are 
mentioned in several documents of the collection. 
R. Hayyim Toledano (1690-1750) was able to 
pursue an intensive Torah education because of a 
bequest that he received from his late uncle 
Hayyim’s estate. He became a judge in 1723 and 
succeeded the late R. Moses Adhan in the 
position of chief judge of the court in Meknés in 
the year 1737. He composed works in the area of 
Jewish law and elegies. 


R. Jacob Toledano surpassed his brother 
Hayyim in prestige and achievement. R. Jacob, 
who was also popularly Known as the Moharit, 
served as the chief judge of the rabbinic court in 
Meknés from the year 1750, as well as being the 




leader of the community. He placed his relatives 
in the most influential positions, incurring the 
wrath of other scholars who became jealous of his 
power which he wielded for over forty years. He 
was the acknowledged halakhic authority from 
1750 until his death in 1771. 


R. Mordecai Berdugo, who was known as 
Harav Hamarbiz, is as often mentioned in this 
collection as is the aforementioned R. Moses Ber- 
dugo, the Mashbir. The latter was R. Mordecai’s 
father-in-law and teacher. R. Judah Berdugo, 
a brother of R. Mordecai, was a colleague of R. 
Hayyim ben Attar, author of the celebrated Bib- 
lical commentary Or ha-Hayyim. R. Mordecai and 
his brother R. Judah served as judges in Meknés. 
R. Mordecai passed away in 1763. The greater 
Berdugo family is noted in this collection in 
twenty-five separate documents and correspond- 
ences. 




Salé— 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 


Some of the outstanding scholars from Salé 
who are mentioned in the collection are R. Joseph 
Saba, R. Mordecai Ha-Kohen, R. Jacob b. R. 
Joseph Bibas, R. Samuel Azawi, and R. Jacob 
ben Shaiya. The first three are signatories to 
the same document, Ms.175, that orginated at 
Salé. R. Mordecai died in the year 1717. R. Jacob 
Bibas was born at Tetuan but eventually left for 
Salé where he was appointed a judge. He married 
a great-granddaughter of R. Vidal II Ha-Sarfati of 
Fez and she bore him two sons, R. Joseph and R. 
Hayyim. There are nine documents in the 
Collection which refer to members of the Bibas 
family. R. Samuel b. Moses Azawi also signed 
Ms.189 with R. Jacob Bibas and R. Joseph Saba 
of Salé. R. Samuel Azawi served as the ritual 
slaughterer and scribe to the rabbinic court of 
Salé and was there appointed to a judgeship 




Sale 




aided by the rabbis of Fez and Meknés. R. Samuel, 
however, manifested an argumentative nature, 
particularly to scholars who were of a higher 
stature than he. The same scholars of Fez and 
Meknes who referred him to the judgeship now 
tried to have him removed, especially R. Jacob lbn 
Zur who bore him particular enmity. 


Moses Ben-Zur, who was a distinguished 
citizen of Salé, was the uncle of R. Jacob Ibn Zur. 
Moses died in the year 1706 and left three sons, 
Shalom, Jacob, and Judah. R. Shalom, who was 
considered a scholar in Salé, wrote and signed 
Ms.129 to R. Jacob Ibn Zur, as well as Ms.256. R. 
Shalom was considered to be the greatest 
grammarian of the West as well as a proficient 
poet. 




Tetuan— 


seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 


R. Hasdai Almosnino was a leading schoiar and 
judge in Tetuan at the beginning of the eighteenth 
century until his demise in 1728. After R. Isaac 
Bibas left Tetuan, R. Hasdai and R. David Ha- 
Kohen (the latter serving as head of the rabbinic 
court until his death in 1708), were the only 
scholars left. After R. David’s death, R. Hasdai 
remained the sole spiritual leader of authority in 
Tetuan. The dearth of scholars to lead the people 
was due to persecution and excessive taxation, 
particularly between the years 1700 and 1705. R. 
Hasdai Almosnino guaranteed spiritual 
leadership for the future in Tetuan by preparing 
the following students to serve as rabbinic judges: 
R. Menahem Anhori, R. Moses b. Zimra, R. 
Abraham Abudarham, and R. Isaac Nah6én. The 
Bension collection contains documents from R. 
Hasdai (Ms. 23) and his student R. Isaac Nahon 
(see Ms. 128). R. Jacob Maragi, who was a resi- 
dent of Tetuan at this time, was a celebrated 
Kabbalist who published commentaries on the 




Zohar.

Sefrou 




Sefrou— 


seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 


Although the city of Sefrou had a smaller Jewish 
population than either Fez or Meknés, it could 
boast a high level of scholarship during the 
eighteenth century due to the efforts of the 
erudite sage, R. Moses b. Hamo. R. Moses was 
active in judicial matters during the last quarter of 
the seventeenth century as can be attested to 
from Ms.197, whereR. Moses corresponds with R. 
Menahem Serero. That same document permits 
us to receive some insight as to the nature of the 
organization and curriculum at R. Moses’ 
Academy in Sefrou. He states, in a postscript to 
Ms.197, that he is presently studying the Talmudic 
Tractate Hullin with his students after the 
morning service. At midnight he has another 
study session with more than twenty advanced 
scholars. R. Moses also corresponded with R. 
Vidal Il Ha-Sarfati and R. Judah Uziel of Fez, 
contemporaries of R. Menahem Serero. R. Moses 
was the undisputed authority in every area of the 
communal life of Sefrou. He also possessed a 
zealous disposition which obliged him to rebuke 
all those who were in violation of the law 
irrespective of their position. Whenever R. Moses 
arrived in Fez for a visit the whole community was 
electrified by his personality and his homiletic 
ability. 


Among R. Moses ben Hamo’s students who 
served as spiritual leaders in the eighteenth 
century were his son R. Yeshua ben Hamo, R. 
Samuel b. Hota, R. David B. Shitrit, R. Meir 
D’Avila, R. Joseph b. Attia, R. Joseph Gabbai, 
R. Mas’ud b. Joseph b. Rabuh, and R. Yahya 
Banon. R. Moses b. Hamo died at an advanced 
age in the year 1707.

Marrakesh and Demnat— 


eighteenth century 


R. Isaac Delouya of Marrakesh, who was highly 
regarded by the rabbis of Fez and Meknes and 
who left many notable students, died in 1711. 
Among his students were R. Solomon Amar of 
Demnat and R. Abraham Azulai of Marrakesh. R. 
Solomon and R. Abraham passed away in the 
same year, 1735. They both composed Halakhic 
works and were proficient in Kabbalism. R. 
Abraham Azulai engaged in Kabbalistic practices 
while he also composed works on Ari Kabbalism. 
Another student of R. |lsaac Delouya, at Demnat, 
was R. Mordecai Attia, who also received instruc- 
tion from R. Solomon Amar. R. Abraham’s student 
R. Jacob Pinto wrote commentaries on the Zohar. 
He is mentioned in Ms.4 of the Bension collection. 
His descendant, the Haham Kollel R. Moses Pinto, 
is mentioned in connection with fund raising for 
the great academy of the Jewish community of 
Tiberias in the Holy Land. There were many 
descendants of Moroccan scholars who served 
the interests of the Sephardi communities after 
they settled in the Holy Land. This epistle, which 
was written in the month of Shevat 1828, is part of 
a collection of letters which are called Kitvei Ha- 
Qodesh (letters from the Holy Land) requesting 
aid for the communities of Safed and Jerusalem 
as well as Tiberias. 


The fourth letter in Ms.4 is particularly 
interesting in as much as it concerns the 
Sephardic communities of Jerusalem who sent 
their emissary on behalf of the members of the 
community of Ashkenazim Midrash Perushim, the 
eastern European community of Jerusalem in 
search of funds in the year 1842. This epistle was 
signed for the Kdllel Ashkenazim Midrash Peru- 
shim at Jerusalem, by Natan the son of Menahem 
MendlI. This may not have been so unusual since 
the Sephardim who had the facility of the Arabic 




language were more successful in establishing 
an economic base than were the Ashkenazim 
who settled in the Holy Land during this period. 
It was also not unusual for Ashkenazi emissaries 
to come to the Moroccan communities for aid. 
This can be noted in the third letter in Ms.4 where 
it mentions funds needed to rehabilitate syna- 
gogues damaged during earthquakes. 




All the communities— 


eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 


During the second half of the eighteenth century 
the members of the “Court of Five at Fez” who 
were ordained by R. Jacob Ibn Zur, namely, R. 
Samuel Saul ibn Danan, R. Ephraim Monsonyego 
who later established himself at Tetuan, R. 
Raphael Obed Ibn Zur, R. Elijah Ha-Sarfati, and 
R. Matitya Serero, were joined in their efforts by 
the scribe of the court, R. Immanuel Monsano, 
who died before 1770. R. |mmanuel appears in his 
official scribal capacity in Ms.121. R. Immanuel 
Monsano is also the author of a chronicle that 
appears in Ms.275. He is noted in several other 
documents and on some occasions together with 
his brother, Abraham Monsano, see Mss. 116 and 
237. Other members of this family that are 
mentioned in the collection are Yehonatan Ish 
Sion the son of Bezalel, Barukh Monsano, and 
David Monsano. 


R. Raphael Obed Ibn Zur, the son of the 
aforementioned R. Jacob Ibn Zur, was called 
Obed by his father when he was a youngster. The 
name Raphael must have been added as a result 
of an illness from which he recovered, Ms.105.He 
received a portion of the income from his father’s 
synagogue at Meknés, which was contested by R. 
Jacob Toledano. Apparently, R. Raphael Obed 
Ibn Zur was no more successful in his business 
ventures than his father had been. R. Raphael 
Obed informs R. Moses ibn Maman, in Ms.190, 




Marakesh and Demnat 




that he suffers a multitude of misfortunes as well 
as economic privation. He lost his possessions 
because he gave capital to entrepreneurs to invest 
for him; his goal in business ventures is not wealth 
but merely the ability to acquire that which would 
permit him to purchase the basic necessities; he is 
destitute and is located at the house of study at 
Mekneés. He had been offered a stipend by that 
community which was available for resident 
scholars and after refusals had finally succumbed 
and taken it, but only as a loan. Eventually, we 
learn, the stipend was reduced because business 
conditions were bad. Raphael Obed refused to 
take any more stipends while he viewed his 
poverty as a sign of Divine chastisement. 


He asks R. Moses Maman to extend a loan of 
two hundred ugiot to help him support his family, 
especially as the holiday season is approaching. 
He offers to compose a bill of debt and to give his 
land in Meknés as collateral. He has his eye on 
another business scheme (not unlike those which 
previously placed him in a situation of adversity) 
which someone would invest and manage for him. 
He expects that he will be able to live off the 
profits. For more bibliographical information on 
these members of the Ibn Zur family, see Ms.35. 


After the passing of R. Raphael Obed, in the 
year 1769, his son, Samuel Ibn Zur, was elected as 
a judge to the court in Fez, in his father’s stead. R. 
Samuel was still active in that capacity in the year 
1782. There is a letter of consolation, Ms.77, 
which was sent by R. Ephraim Monsonyego and 
R. Judah b. Abraham Coriat, both of Tetuan, toR. 
Samuel Ibn Zur on the passing of his father. 
Another letter of consolation, Ms.78, was sent to 
the rabbis Matitya Serero and Samuel Ibn Zur by 
the rabbis Jacob, Solomon, and Moses Toledano 
and R. Solomon Tapiero of Meknés. 


Contemporaneous with the activities of the 
“Court of Five” at Fez was the “Court of Three” at 




23 




All communities 




Mekneés which consisted of R. Solomon b. R. 
Eliezer Toledano, R. Moses b. Daniel Toledano, 
and R. Yekutiel b. R. Mordecai Berdugo. They 
succeeded the eminent R. Jacob Toledano, who 
passed on in 1771. R. Jacob, R. Solomon, and R. 
Moses Toledano were the signatories to the 
aforementioned letter of consolation, Ms.78. 
R. Moses Toledano also sojourned at Salé fora 
time because of the pestilence and famine which 
affected Meknés. He lost his first wife in the 
pestilence and in the ensuing years the rest of his 
family succumbed. R. Hayyim b. R. Judah 
Toledano, who resided in Meknés for atime, was 
an uncle to the aforementioned Moses and 
Solomon. R. Hayyim subsequently moved to Salé 
in 1750, where he served as a judge for thirty 
years. He wrote many Halakhic works and he 
composed a memorial book noting Moroccan 
scholars who passed on between 1714 and 1773. 


Several documents of the Maymeran family 
appear in the Bension Collection. R. Moses 
Maymeran of Meknés and his son Hayyim were 
noted scholars who composed Halakhic works. R. 
Moses was a son-in-law of R. Jacob Toledano. A 
dispute between R. Moses andR. Jacob Toledano 
is noted in Ms.35. R. dayyim was born in 1765 and 
although he passed on at the age of twenty he 
received wide acclaim for his erudition and he 
composed works in several areas of Jewish 
scholarship. 


The Dahan family appears in eighteen docu- 
ments of the collection. The spelling of the name 
may vary, i.e. Dahan, Adhan and Bendahan, and it 
is listed in the Index of Names under Dahan as 
well as Adhan. R. Moses Adhan who served as 
the head of the Rabbinic Tribunal in Meknés until 
1737, was to serve as a conciliator in the dispute 
between the Nagid of Fez and R. Jacob Ibn Zur. 
R. Jacob was in self-imposed exile in Meknés 
because of that clash of personalities, which 




24 




is noted in Ms.227. In the same correspondence 
it is noted that Mas’Ud ibn Adhan, together with 
R. Jacob Aspag and Saadya Lahaboz, wrote to 
Fez to get the notables to persuade R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur to write to the Nagid so that he would 
be able to return to Fez. R. Mimun Adhan is 
mentioned in several documents. In Ms.96 he 
joined R. Jacob Toledano in writing to R. Samuel 
Elbaz concerning a claim made by Isaac ibn 
Haroush against Hayyim ibn Magiruz. In Ms.71 
a note of consolation is added marking the recent 
demise of R. Mimun ibn Adhan in Fez, on Satur- 
day evening, the seventh of Heshvan 1756. 


Two interesting documents in the Bension 
collection which give additional information 
concerning some of the vicissitudes of members 
of the Adhan family are Mss.250 and 251.R. Judah 
ion Attar inquires of R. Jacob Ibn Zur about 
certain deeds belonging to the descendants of 
Isaac and Ephraim ibn Amara which are supposed 
to be in R. Jacob’s possession. These deeds will 
have a bearing on whether the descendants of the 
late Levi ibn Amara will be able to claim a 
courtyard containing a ritual bath or whether it 
will remain in the possession of R. Joseph Adhan 
in the form of a pledge. The latter needs to 
produce the pledge in order to redeem himself 
with its value because he and his two brothers are 
being held by a non-Jew who has confined them 
on his property for more than two weeks. The 
non-Jew also caught the young son with the 
intention of converting him to Islam. They were 
freed by the non-Jew on the condition that cash 
would immediately be made available to him. 
Joseph Adhan is sending his eldest son, Mimun, 
to R. Jacob for the documents since the case 
involves redemption of captives. In Ms.2517, R. 
Judah ibn Attar informs R. Shalom ibn Lakhraif 
that a decision was rendered in favor of R. Joseph 
Adhan. 




The Hasin family was also active in Meknés 
during this period. One of the outstanding mem- 
bers of this family was R. David b. R. Aaron b. 
Kasin who was born c. 1730 and passed on after 
1790. He was the student and son-in-law of R. 
Mordecai Berdugo of the previous generation. 
R. David was famous for his outstanding liturgical 
poems which were published in his liturgical 
work “Tehila Le-David.” R. Abraham b. David 
ibn Hasin of Meknés was a signatory to Mss. 
113, 180 and 187. 


One of the rabbinic leaders of this generation 
in Sefrou, was R. Saul Yeshua Abitboul. He is the 
writer of a letter of consolation and a poem to R. 
Samuel Ibn Zur, on the passing of his father, R. 
Raphael Obed Ibn Zur, which is Ms.208. R. Saul 
Yeshua composed works pertaining to the laws of 
ritual slaughter in accord with Maaravic custom. 
He passed on in the year 1802. In Ms.13 which was 
written in 1871, enactments pertaining to the 
practice of ritual slaughter and the examination of 
the lungs of animals are recorded. These 
enactments were formulated in Sefrou by R. Amor 
Abitboul and R. Amram Elbaz in the year 1847. 
Some of the enactments were that the 
slaughterer’s knife and the lungs of animals must 
be examined by two people, one is insufficient. 
Also ritual slaughterers shall not use their 
occupation as an excuse for not attending 
morning services at the synagogue, since 
henceforth no slaughtering shall commence 
before the conclusion of morning services. The 
Abitboul family perpetuated an unbroken chain of 
leadership at Sefrou throughout this period. The 
members of the Abitboul family are noted in 
several documents of the collection. 


The leading scholar at Salé during this period 
was R. Eliezer b. R. Samuel D’Avila. His father, 
R. Samuel b. R. Moses who was born in Meknés, 
studied under R. Hayyim ibn Attar |, and married 




All communities 




the latter's granddaughter. R. Samuel left Mekneés 
because of the excessive taxes that were levied 
on him and he made his home at Salé. R. Samuel’s 
aspiration to travel to Jerusalem was realized as 
Ms.135 testifies. In that epistle R. Samuel informs 
R. Jacob Ibn Zur that he has purchased several 
books for him and states that they should be paid 
for. R. Eliezer, who was called “Rav Adda,” was 
born in 1714 and he married the daughter of R. 
Elijah Halevi b. Susan of Salé, at age fifteen. 
Although R. Eliezer died at the age of forty-seven, 
in 1761, he was a prolific scholar. Many of his 
works were posthumously published by his son- 
in-law. 


R. Eliezer D’Avila appears in Ms.47, where his 
mother disputes with him over the estate of his 
late father, R. Samuel. R. Eliezer agrees that half 
of the properties should be given to his mother in 
accord with the custom of the enactment of the 
Jews of Castile. However, he claims that he has no 
properties available to give to his mother since 
they were sold to realize money for her 
maintenance and to pay off his father’s debts. 


Another dispute involving the inheritance 
between members of the D’Avila family of an 
earlier generation is recorded in Ms.178. R. 
Mordecai Berdugo wrote to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
concerning this dispute. R. Moses b. Jacob 
D’Avila of Meknés, who was apparently a grand- 
son of the late R. Judah D’Avila, was engaged ina 
litigation with another grandson, named Judah 
D’Avila, over wine barrels that once belonged to 
the late R. Judah D’Avila. R. Mordecai Berdugo 
asks R. Jacob Ibn Zur to endorse either R. 
Mordecai’s decision or R. Jacob Toledano’s 
decision in the same dispute, In Ms.119 R. 
Mordecai Berdugo notes that R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
decided with him against R. Jacob Toledano. 


R. Moses ibn Hamo wrote to R. Menahem 
Serero, in Ms.197, explaining that R. Jacob 




25 




All communities 




D’Avila, who was a party to a dispute, was unable 
to participate in the proceedings because of ill 
health. Therefore, he should not be cited for 
obstructing justice. This R. Jacob D’Avila, who 
had a son called Meir, may also have been the 
father of R. Moses D’Avila who was the grand- 
father of Eliezer b. Samuel D’Avila. 




Among the leading rabbinic scholars of 
Tetuan during the second half of the eighteenth 
century was R. Judah b. R. Abraham Coriat. We 
have already mentioned that R. Judah was a co- 
signer with R. Ephraim Monsonyego of a letter of 
consolation written to R. Samuel Ibn Zur on the 
passing of his father, see Ms.77. Many of the 
literary works produced by R. Judah were 
destroyed in the reign of terror of Al-Yazid in the 
year 1790. R. Judah passed on c. 1788, but his 
son, Isaac, was able to salvage some works which 
he took to the Holy Land. R. Judah is also men- 
tioned in Ms.155 as one of the judges in Tetuan 
together with the rabbis Judah and Solomon 
Abudarham. R. Judah Abudarham passed on 
after 1780. Members of this family of the previous 
generation are noted in Ms.252; namely, R. 
Samuel Abudarham and Joseph Abudarham. The 
subject of that document is Abraham ibn Amara 
who was in trouble with the ruling authorities 
and was obliged to call in bills of debt in order to 
realize money by which he could redeem himself. 
Itis probable that the author of the liturgical work 
Sefer Abudarham (a printed edition appears in the 
Collection) was R. David Abudarham of the 
fourteenth century, a Spanish antecedent of this 
family which resided in Tetuan. 




Another scholar of eminence in Tetuan during 
this period was R. Judah Halevi. He may be 
identified with R. Judah Halevi who was at Salé 
during this period, as may be noted from Mss. 130 




26 




and 132. R. Judah did move about from one 
community to another throughout his lifetime. 
After leaving Tetuan the first time he made his way 
to Algiers where he involved himself in controver- 
sy with the chief of the rabbinic court, R. Jacob b. 
Na’im but he returned to Tetuan and established 
an academy. Then he left Tetuan again with the 
desire to get to the Holy Land and made his way 
there via Gibraltar, where he remained for five 
years and established another academy. He did 
not get to the Holy Land, however. Indeed, in 
1790, he desired to return to Tetuan, but a storm 
brought him to Algiers. This turn of events was 
fortunate, since the persecutions of Al-Yazid’s 
short reign (1790-1792) began soon afterwards. 
R. Judah lost all his possessions that remained in 
Tetuan while he tarried at Algiers. Subsequently, 
he made his way to Livorno, Italy, and then he 
returned to Gibraltar. 


R. Judah Halevi’s family achieved prominence 
at Gibraltar in the generations that followed. Ha- 
Zevi Me’at Devash, who was a book dealer in 
Jerusalem during the third quarter of the 
nineteenth century, informs R. Raphael |bn Zur of 
Fez that the books he had ordered will be sent to 
the Halevi family at Gibraltar once they are 
available. These transactions are recorded in 
Mss.264, 145, and 238. The last two corre- 
spondences mention Moses Halevi as the agent 
for the transactions. R. Judah Halevi’s last journey 
to Gibraltar, where he stayed until his demise, was 
that travelled by many Moroccan Jews after the 
persecutions of 1790; especially by those Jews 
who lived in Tetuan which was in close proximity 
across the Strait of Gibraltar. 




Leading scholars— 


nineteenth century 


R. Samuel Ibn Zur of Fez, who was also known as 
Solomon Samuel, had two sons, R. Jacob Ibn Zur 




and R. Raphael Ibn Zur. The subject of his estate 
after his demise is found in Ms.31. This document 
was composed in Fez, in the month of Heshvan 
1791. At that date Jacob Ibn Zur is reported to bea 
bachelor while Raphael is married and their 
mother is the third party to share in the estate. All 
three are agreed never to dissolve the estate. 
Jacob is given permission to pay for his future 
marital expenses from it. Both sons have made 
available to their mother half of what they each 
received. The remainder of the document 
stipulates how the perpetuation of the estate in 
future generations is to be ensured. 


R. Jacob Ibn Zur, who served as a rabbi at Fez, 
passed on in the year 1850 at about the age of 
seventy years. R. Jacob had a son called R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur (1821-1873). R. Solomon 
Elijah lbn Zur is mentioned in Ms.3, in a letter of 
reconciliation that was sent by Abraham b. Saul 
ibn David ve-Joseph to R. Solomon in the year 
1864. R. Abraham appeals to R. Solomon not to 
let false statements that were made against him 
become a reason for accusing him of taking 
letters of correspondence that belonged to R. 
Solomon Elijah and to the latter’s grandfather R. 
Solomon Samuel for whom he was named. R. 
Abraham also writes that R. Solomon Elijah is 
married to his sister. In the concluding portion of 
this epistle, Abraham discusses a litigation in 
which he is involved. It appears that R. Jacob, the 
father of R. Solomon Elijah, refuses to adjudicate 
because R. Jacob is wroth with Abraham. Finally, 
R. Jacob Serero is obliged to decide the matter. R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur, the brother of R. Jacob Ibn Zur, 
also had a son called Solomon, who passed on in 
1843 at the age of thirty-seven. Although R. 
Solomon was not appointed as a judge, he was 
considered to be among the leading scholars of 
Fez. 


R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur is mentioned in 




Leading scholars 




thirty-one different documents in the Collection. 
A member of the celebrated Hasin family of 
Meknés, who were prolific poets, namely, Aaron 
Hasin, corresponded with R. Solomon in 1860, in 
Ms.7. Often many scholars turned to R. Solomon 
to render Halakhic decisions for them. Among 
them were Elijah b. Haroush, in Ms.8; see also 
Samuel ibn Elbaz, Ms.10. R. Judah Berdugo, of 
Meknés, who left Morocco for the Holy Land, 
turned to R. Solomon asking him to render a 
decision which would enable him to realize the 
cash which the former needed and which could be 
available from R. Judah’s portion of his grand- 
father’s estate. However, his late grandfather had 
stipulated that the estate should remain in 
perpetuity. R. Judah suggests that R. Yedidia 
Monsonyego is also available to R. Solomon for 
consultation. This case is discussed in Mss. 11 
and 265. R. Judah also offers to sell R. Solomon 
books on Responsa literature ata fair price. Other 
authorities who turned with their queries to R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur were R. Matitya ibn Zikhri, 
in Ms.12; R. Rahamin Joseph Gayni, of Sefrou, in 
1874 wins: 13: and R. Raphael Maman, of 
Meknés, in Ms.270. 


R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur cultivated many 
other interests. He copied historical information 
as well as biographical and bibliographical 
material, as may be noted from Ms.85. In the same 
document, R. Solomon Elijah states that his 
grandfather, R. Solomon Samuel Ibn Zur, in- 
formed his father, R. Jacob Ibn Zur Ill, that he saw 
R. Joseph Caro’s signature. R. Solomon Elijah 
received a letter from Judah Zarmon in 1866, 
Ms.52, wherein the latter requests that a copy of 
an historical work called “Divrei ha-Yamim” 
which is supposed to be in the possession of R. 
Rahamim Gayni of Sefrou, should be made 
available to him. This work was in the nature ofa 
diary of events that transpired from the Castilian 




2f. 




Leading scholars 




expulsion until the nineteenth century. R. 
Solomon Elijah also copied a collection of tales 
and aphorisms called Divrei Hakhamim Ke- 
Dérbénét, which appears in Ms.36. 


R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur’s son, R. Raphael III 
Ibn Zur, succeeded his father as rabbinic leader at 
Fez, c.1875. In Ms.120, Raphael is identified as R. 
Solomon’s son. R. Solomon Elijah was often 
referred to in correspondences as “Ham-Melekh 
Shlomo, “King Solomon and his son Raphael 
were often addressed as “Ham-Malakh Raphael,” 
the angel Raphael. Elijah b. Jacob Kasis, who 
served as an emissary for the Jerusalem com- 
munity, was also engaged in the book trade as can 
be ascertained from Ms.32, which was written to 
R. Raphael Ibn Zur, in 1863. R. Raphael’s pur- 
chase of books is also noted in Ms.54. Joseph 
Sasson is the Jerusalem book dealer who corre- 
sponds with him in 1880. Ha-Zevi Me’at Devash, 
of Jerusalem, sends books to R. Raphael via 
Gibraltar through the agency of Moses Halevi, as 
is noted in Ms.145. See also Ms.232 and Ms.264 
which deal with the acquisition of books. Elijah 
Kasis wrote three other correspondences per- 
taining to his function as an emissary, to the 
rabbis Raphael III Ibn Zur and Jacob Ha-Kohen, 
in Mss. 44, 45, and 48. The writer sent regards 
to a number of personalities in Fez who were 
contemporaries of R. Raphael III lbn Zur. Among 
them are the following: R. Solomon Ibn Zur, 
the Nagid Abraham, R. Abner Ha-Sarfati, R. 
Joshua Serero, R. Samuel Ha-Kohen, R. Israel 
Maymeran, Menahem Saba, R. Jacob Dahan, 
Azuz Ha-Kohen, Aaron Ha-Kohen, and Matitya 




Serero. 
R. Raphael Ill Ibn Zur was the recipient of 




many requests to come to the aid of the destitute, 
as in Ms.56; to aid emissaries, as inMs.101; andto 
resolve disputes or to respond to queries of a 
Halakhic nature. In Ms.55, Moses Turgeman of 




28 




Tiberias, in the Holy Land, asks R. Raphael to 
uphold a claim to an estate on behalf of the 
former's family. R. Raphael Ill Ibn Zur and R. 
Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati wrote a decision in a 
paternity suit against the seductor. He was 
flogged and fines were exacted from him. This 
court document, which appears in Ms.146, was 
written in 1876. The rabbis of Sefrou, Hayyim 
Elijah Gayni, Raphael Moses Elbaz, and Yekutiel 
ibn Elbaz ask R. Raphael II! Ibn Zur to serve as 
interim overseer of the estate of the late Raphael 
Ha-Kohen, in Mss. 203 and 204. R. Rahamim 
Joseph Gayni writes to R. Raphael asking him to 
render a decision in a difficult litigation. The 
former expects that R. Raphael’s review of the 
matter will finally lead to its resolution. This is the 
subject of Ms.200. 


R. Raphael Moses Elbaz wrote to R. Raphael 
Ibn Zur in Tammuz 1877, concerning the case of a 
husband who alleges that his wife is rebellious. 
Since the dispute reached a stalemate, R. Raphael 
is asked to try to achieve a compromise and if this 
fails then the latter should try to finalize the 
litigation as he sees fit. This case is reported in 
Ms.245. In Ms.246, R. Raphael Moses Elbaz again 
turns to R. Raphael Ibn Zur to serve as a final 
arbiter. The issue involves one who wants to 
challenge a communal enactment which 
prohibits astranger from marrying a woman of the 
community. In Ms.247, R. Raphael Moses Elbaz 
enquires of R. Raphael Ibn Zur concerning the 
custom in Fez governing the acquisition of 
groves, fields, and gardens. He wants to know 
whether the owner also acquires the right of 
domicile therein, the question having been 
prompted by aJew receiving land in pledge froma 
non-Jewish owner. Can he exercise the right of 
domicile over it and thereby prevent the non- 
Jewish owner from utilizing it as he sees fit? 
Another Halakhic query was posed by Joseph 




Sasson, an emissary from Jerusalem, of R. 
Raphael, in Ms.248, in the year 1877. The former 
was travelling amongst the towns of the Rif when 
a question concerning a levirate arose. A minority 
opinion was referred to from the only work 
available, the code Even ha-Ezer. Joseph, 
however, desires a more sound basis for render- 
ing a lenient opinion and he asks R. Raphael Ibn 
Zur to provide it with despatch. Rabbi Raphael III 
Ibn Zur’s son Solomon III is mentioned in Mss. 99 
and 100. 




R. Elijah b. Joseph Ha-Sarfati was blessed with 
a longevity which spanned almost all of the 
eighteenth century, from 1715 until 1805. He 
studied with R. Judah ibn Attar and he was one of 
the Court of Five scholars of Fez who were 
ordained by R. Jacob Ibn Zur before the latter’s 
demise. Subsequently, he served as the leading 
Halakhic scholar of Morocco during the last 
quarter of the eighteenth century. R. Elijah 
ordained R. Jacob Ibn Zur, the son of Solomon 
Samuel Ibn Zur and the great grandson of R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur, who had ordained R. Elijah. 


R. Elijah Ha-Sarfati composed an aggadic 
work called “Simu Lehem,” when he was fifteen, 
which appears in Ms.107.R. Elijah had two sons, 
R. Israel Jacob Ha-Sarfati who died at an 
advanced age in 1826 and R. Raphael Menahem 
Ha-Sarfati who passed on in 1843. The latter 
served as Nagid. 


A letter of adulation which was written in 
honor of R. Elijah Ha-Sarfati and his son Jacob 
appears in Ms.18. An emissary, Israel Jacob 
Halevi, pleads with R. Raphael Ha-Sarfati to aid 
his plight by rendering a judgement against the 
Nagid of Meknées who has made an unjustified 
claim on a portion of the emissary’s collection for 
the needs of the destitute of Meknes. The 
emissary states that he appeals to R. Raphael to 




Leading scholars 




deal with the issue since it requires the attention 
of the highest Halakhic authority and he imagines 
that only R. Raphael has the power to render a 
judgement in such a case. This subject is dealt 
with in Ms.236. This same emissary corresponded 
with R. Raphael in Ms.103. In this epistle he sends 
regards to Joseph, R. Raphael’s son. In Ms.89, an 
appeal is made to R. Raphael by R. Judah Elbaz to 
convince an intransigent debtor to make pay- 
ment. 


A plea by the Rishon Le-Zion, the Sephardi 
chief rabbi of Jerusalem, R. Hayyim Abraham 
Gagin, to Raphael Ha-Sarfati of Fez, in behalf of 
the former's son-in-law, R. Judah Zacut, is the 
subject of Ms.147. R. Judah who is the son of the 
illustrious mystic R. Moses Zacut is in need of 
financial aid to support his large family and the 
writer asks R. Raphael to use his office to extend 
all possible aid to him. A copy of the introduction 
to R. Moses Zacut’s work, Iggerét ha-Ramaz is 
found in Ms.1517. 


On another occasion a plea was sent to R. 
Raphael Ha-Sarfati to grant protection to a widow 
who is in transit, to help consummate the levirate 
responsibilities. The writer asks that she should 
be chaperoned by persons of high moral 
character and that her needs should be provided 
until she arrives at her destination. Also R. 
Raphael is asked to forward letters to all those 
communities where the widow will stay that they 
should prepare for her arrival. This plea is 
reported in Ms.148, which was composed in 1834- 
35. 


Samuel Halevi ibn Yulee corresponded with R. 
Raphael Menahem Ha-Sarfati on the tenth of 
Kislev 1841, from Gibraltar. Information about the 
whereabouts of the son of R. S. Aflalo is made 
available. R. Raphael is also reminded to concern 
himself with a litigation which involved the 
wealthy Isaac Ben Zaqen in order that justice may 




29

be served. This correspondence is the subject of 
Ms.152. A plea for charitable aid is addressed toR, 
Raphael Ha-Sarfati, who is designated with the 
appellation Ham-Malakh, by Zikhri Meshash. As 
Passover is soon approaching, Zikhri is depen- 
ding upon the merciful nature of R. Raphael to 
help him in his moment of economic adversity. 
This letter is the subject of Ms.222. In Ms.239, R. 
Hayyim Toledano extends an invitation to R. 
Raphael Ha-Sarfati to stay with him when he 
arrives at Meknés. R. Hayyim refers to the close 
relationship that existed between his father of 
blessed memory andR. Raphael. The writer sends 
greetings to R. Raphael's son Joseph. 


R. Israel Jacob Ha-Sarfati, the brother of the 
aforementioned Raphael, had a son called 
Solomon. Solomon's son, R. Vidal Ill, who lived 
from 1797-1856, was a profound rabbinic scholar 
and Talmudist who also served as a judge. In 
Ms.149, R. Hayyim Haluah who wrote to R. 
Hayyim David Ibn Zimra also addresses R. Vidal 
II! Ha-Sarfati. R. Vidal Ill had an illustrious son 
called R. Abner Israel (1827-1884) who servedasa 
rabbinic judge at Fez. He was the author of 
responsa and he is known for his historic work 
called Yahas Fez which contains information 
about the generations of scholars of Fez from the 
seventeenth century until his own time. He wrote 
this work in 1879 at the request of members of the 
Kol Israel Haverim (Alliance Israelite) Society 
who enquired about the origins of the Jewish 
community of Fez. R. Abner Israel was well versed 
in philosophy and mysticism and is noted in ten 
manuscript documents of the Bension Collection. 


A letter was sent by the communal leaders of 
Sefrou to the rabbis of Fez concerning fund 
raising irregularities that arose during an 
emissary's visit. The writer was R. Raphael 
Maman who wrote to the rabbis Saul ibn Danan, 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur, and Abner Israel Ha- 




30 




Sarfati concerning the funds that were collected 
by the Jerusalem emissary R. Barukh Pinto. This 
correspondence is found in Ms.39. 


On another occasion the rabbis of Sefrou, 
namely Rahamim Joseph Gayni, Raphael Moses 
Elbaz, and Saul Elbaz ask the rabbis of Fez, R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur and R. Abner Israel Ha- 
Sarfati to aid in settling prior claims against an 
estate which creditors are now suing. This 
document appears in Ms.57. In the month of Tishri 
1876 R. Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati and R. Raphael 
Ibn Zur rendered a decision and sentence against 
one who was accused in a paternity suit. This case 
is recorded in Ms. 146, 


Moses b. Aaron Attia composed a poetical 
collection called “Yashir Moshe” with an in- 
troduction wherein he moralizes about the 
function of speech and how it is ennobled by 
religious poetic compositions. He also was asked 
to compose appropriate verse for a pleasant Arab 
melody so as to elevate the melody from its 
secular state to the holy. The poems were 
accompanied with an explanation of the terms. 
This work was given a seal of approval by R. Abner 
Israel Ha-Sarfati. For the content of the individual 
poems refer to Ms.224, 


Joseph Sasson, a book dealer of Jerusalem, 
had R. Abner Israel as a client as can be 
ascertained from Mss. 54 and 232. Joseph also 
sent regards to R. Abner ina letter that the former 
sent to R. Raphael Ibn Zur, as may be noted in 
Ms.248. The emissary Elijah b. Jacob Kasis sent 
his regards to R. Abner in his correspondences to 
the rabbis Jacob Ha-Kohen and Raphael Ibn Zur 
in Mss. 32 and 48. 


A letter was prepared by the rabbis of Fez in 
the: month of Tammuz 1838 introducing an 
emissary of Tiberias to the region of Tafilalet. 
Among the rabbis, Hayyim Abraham Ha-Sarfati is 
mentioned, On this occasion the rabbis proclaim- 




ed a malediction and excommunication on all 
those who would refuse to extend aid and a 
blessing upon those who would grant such aid. 
This correspondence is the subject of Ms.240. 




R. Matitya Serero (1718-1788), who was 
ordained by his grandfather R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
(d.1753), had seven sons who became scholars. 
They were the following: R. Saul; R. Menahem 
(1744-1780); R. Joshua (d. 1814); R. Hayyim 
David, who passed away at the age of seventy- 
seven in 1826; R. Jacob, who died at the age of 
eighty-two; R. Judah, who died in a plague in 
1835; and R. Nahman. While the rabbis Saul, 
Joshua, Hayyim David, and Jacob were appoint- 
ed as judges, it was Hayyim David Serero who was 
the most illustrious. Two correspondences con- 
cerning R. Hayyim David appear in the collection; 
Ms.2 contains a letter which R. Hayyim David 
wrote to Mas’ud Arwah asking that a reconcilia- 
tion should take place between the latter and R. 
Abraham Pariente, and in Ms.184 R. Hayyim 
David was asked to render an Halakhic decision in 
a litigation. 


R. Jacob Serero adjudicated a litigation for R. 
Abraham b. Saul ibn David Ve-Joseph, according 
to the text of Ms.3and he is noted as one of the 
authorities of Fez who prepared a letter in- 
troducing an emissary of Tiberias to the area of 
Tafilalet, in 1838, as it is recorded in Ms.240. 
Jacob Serero and Reuben Serero served as 
judges together with Jacob Ibn Zur Ill when they 
signed an edict against unfair pricing in the city of 
Fez. This information is found in Ms.108. A letter 
of consolation which appears in Ms.260 was sent 
by the scholars Amor Abitboul and Amram Elbaz 
of Sefrou to the mourners R. Reuben Serero, R. 
Matitya Serero, R. Shalom Serero, and to R. 
Joshua Serero on the passing of R. Jacob Serero 
o.b.m., in the year 1855. 




Leading scholars 




Joshua Serero’s son, the aforementioned 
Reuben, served as a judge in Fez and signed a 
court document in 1851, together with R. Judah 
Elbaz and R. Yedidia Monsonyego, in a ruling 
concerning the erection of a structure that 
blocked the public throughfare. This document is 
found in Ms.202. Reuben passed on in 1856. 
Another Joshua Serero who was active c.1860 is 
noted in Mss.32, 44, 48, and 260. 


R. Saul Serero and his contemporary R. 
Samuel Ibn Zur both pleaded with R. Solomon 
Toledano (in separate documents but on the 
same page, 176a, which contains Mss. 126 and 
127) to expedite the cause of justice in a case 
which still has not been adjudicated. In the year 
1788, R. Elijah Monsano was disputing with his 
uncle. Hayyim Monsano over property. The 
rabbinic court in Fez could not deal with the 
matter, since the authorities were related to the 
litigants; so the case was to be adjudicated in 
Meknés. However, since the parties to the dispute 
from Fez did not arrive in Meknés, the rabbis of 
Tetuan, namely R. Solomon Toledano, R. Solo- 
mon Abudarham, and the young R. Abraham 
Monsonyego, turned to the rabbis of Fez to 
adjudicate the matter. The rabbis of Fez, Samuel 
Ibn Zur and Saul Serero, still insist that the rabbis 
of Meknés should complete the judgement. This 
material is noted in Ms.155. 


R. Judah ibn Attar Il (c.1725-1812), the son of 
R. Obed b. Attar and the grandson of the Great 
Rabbi Judah ibn Attar, was a contemporary of the 
aforementioned R. Saul Serero. R. Judah was 
appointed as a judge together with R. Saul and he 
acceded to the position as chief judge in Fez, 
c.1810. Prior to their period of rabbinic 
leadership, during the reign of Muhammad ibn 
Abdallah (1759-1790), a tranquil atmosphere had 
prevailed in Morocco, and Marrakesh became the 
center of political activity. Jews served the 




31 




Leading scholars 




interests of the government in areas of diplomacy. 
This atmosphere was marred when Mulay al- 
Yazid, Abdallah’s son, succeeded his father and 
instituted a reign of terror which lasted for two 
years, from 1790 to 1792. During this terrible time 
when the majority of the prestigious Jewish 
citizenry and the rabbis of Fez fled, R. Judah ibn 
Attar Il stayed with the remaining Jews and has 
left us an eye witness account of the occurrences. 


Anti-Jewish hatred, unknown to such an 
extent since the Almohad persecution in the days 
of Maimonides, led to the demise of a multitude of 
Jewish communities and the decimation of the 
Jewish population. Muslims who tried to save 
Jews were subjected to torture when Mulay al- 
Yazid learned of their activities. This ruler 
eventually died as the result of a wound and his 
reign was brought to an abrupt end. 


A litigation which arose out of the conditions 
of these tumultuous times is recorded in Ms.117. 
As a result of the pillage which transpired during 
the days of the arch-enemy Sahiq Tamia Galul, 
the inheritors of a creditor known as R. Aaron Ha- 
Kohen 0.b.m. were unable to collect certain debts 
that were owed to their ancestor. Eventually these 
notes of indebtedness were unearthed during the 
reign of the Sultan Mulay Suleiman, who ruled 
from 1792 to 1822. A judgement was rendered in 
favor of the descendants of the creditor. A more 
recent decision was cited concerning a similar 
case which was adjudicated in the presence of the 
rabbis Saul Serero, Judah ibn Attar Il, and 
Raphael Ibn Zur. The last two were recorded as 
having been dead at the time that this document 
was written. 




R. Raphael Aaron Monsonyego who served as 
a judge in Fez, and who enjoyed longevity, 
(d.1840), was blessed with a son, R. Yedidia 
Monsonyego, who was one of the most prolific 




32 




authors of the nineteenth century. R. Yedidia, who 
also served as a judge in Fez, passed away in 1868. 
He once wrote a letter of reference for R. David 
Monsano who was in need of financial support 
(recorded in Ms.6), alluding to the fact that a 
scholar named Saul was the cause of David’s 
tribulations. 


R. Yedidia served as a judge together with R. 
Solomon Ibn Zur, as is apparent in Mss. 11 and 
265, where R. Judah Berdugo asks that R. 
Solomon should take counsel with R. Yedidia 
concerning Judah’s claim to an inheritance. This 
query was written in 1862. In Ms.268 a plea is 
made to the rabbis. Yedidia Monsonyego and 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur to render a decision on 
behalf of a dead orphan. R. Solomon Elijah Ibn 
Zur notes in Ms.85 that R. Yedidia Monsonyego 
discusses the problem of tribulations that the 
corpse undergoes in the grave after death in 
the latter’s work “Kupat Rokhlim.” In Ms.110 a 
letter of a Halakhic nature which was sent to R. 
Yedidia is recorded. R. Yedidia’s son-in-law, 
who is anonymous, attributes a booklet of Halak- 
hic riddles in the form of responsa to the former’s 
authorship. It is described in Ms.191. The name 
of Yedidia Monsonyego is found in an incomplete 
poetic text which appears as Ms.102. 




In the community of Meknés the Berdugo and 
Toledano families continued their hegemony 
throughout the nineteenth century. One of the 
outstanding figures of the Berdugo family during 
this period was R. Raphael Berdugo (1747-1822). 
In a judgement which was rendered by the rabbis 




_of Meknés, Matitya Berdugo, Abraham Amor, and 




Jacob Berdugo, in 1867, they cited the authority 
for their decision as R. Raphael Berdugo. This 
judgement was sent to the rabbis of Fez in 
connection with the case of a man adjudged as 
unfit to take a second wife on the grounds that he 




would be unable to support two wives. All the 
details are recorded in Ms.243. 


R. Joseph Elmaleh (d.1823), who was ap- 
pointed chief of the rabbinic court in Salé-Rabat 
before 1788, corresponded with R. Raphael Ber- 
dugo on certain matters and about certain cases 
in Jewish law which were of mutual interest to 
both scholars. R. Joseph asks R. Raphael to inter- 
cede in a case involving an inheritance which 
was being disputed. In another matter R. Joseph 
states that he agreed with R. Raphael’s decision. 
A fuller treatment of the correspondence is given 
in Ms.167. 




R. Raphael Berdugo shared leadership in 
Meknes with R. Barukh Toledano (1738-1817), 
with whom he often became embroiled in 
vehement dispute, and with R. Petahiah Mordecai 
Berdugo (1764-1820). R. Samuel b. Waish was 
also reckoned as one of the leading scholars in 
Meknés at this time. In Ms.184, Abraham, the son 
of Samuel b. Waish, wrote to R. Hayyim David 




Serero of Fez asking for his learned opinion ina 
matter pertaining to Jewish law. Abraham states 
that he wrote the letter on behalf of his father who 
could not write at night. 




There were other scholars in Meknes who 
deserve to be mentioned although members of 
neither the Berdugo nor the Toledano families. 
Among them are R. Benjamin Laikhraif, who is 
mentioned in Ms.18 and R. Raphael Maman, 
whose son R. Shalom was also a scholar of note. 
R. Raphael Maman responded to the rabbis of Fez 
as to why an emissary’s funds were held back fora 
prolonged period, in Ms.39. On three other 
occasions R. Raphael Maman wrote to R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur concerning litigations 
which involved a daughter's share in her father’s 
estate (Ms.270), a divorcée who claimed her 
settlement was unjust (Ms.271), and a short 




Leading scholars 




note concerning some litigations (Ms.273). 


R. Samuel Halevi ibn Yulee who lived in Mek- 
nés was also known to have made his residence in 
Tangier and to have settled in Gibraltar. In a cor- 
respondence to R. Raphael Menahem Ha-Sarfati 
of Fez (Ms.152) R. Samuel Halevi wrote, in 1841, 
that he was in Livorno. The letter was, however, 
written upon R. Samuel’s arrival at Gibraltar. R. 
Raphael is reminded about a litigation which 
involves the prosperous Isaac Ben Zaqen, to 
which he should direct himself. R. Samuel Amar 
who served as a rabbi in Meknés (d.1890) and 
composed responsa is noted in Ms.153, where the 
writer pleads, for him to extend aid to R. Jacob 
Ha-Kohen who needs to raise funds for his 
daughter’s forthcoming marriage. R. Samuel 
Amar had a son, R. Shalom, who excelled in the 
rabbinate of Meknes. R. Abraham Amar was 
also a rabbinic scholar in Meknés according to 
Ms.243. 


One of the outstanding rabbinic scholars of 
the nineteenth century was R. Raphael Moses 
Elbaz of Sefrou, who died at the age of seventy- 
three in 1896. R. Raphael Moses was a prolific 
author in the fields of Halakha and Liturgy. At the 
age of twenty-eight he was already a judge of the 
rabbinic court in Sefrou. R. Raphael Moses Elbaz 
joined the rabbis Rahamim Joseph Gayni and 
Saul Elbaz in pressing a claim on behalf of some 
creditors of Sefrou who had prior claims against 
an estate. The rabbis Solomon Elijah lbn Zur and 
Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati of Fez are asked to pursue 
the matter in the interest of justice. This cor- 
respondence appears in Ms.57. 


The signatures of the rabbis Raphael Moses 
Elbaz and Judah Ha-Kohen appear in Ms.155, a 
copy of an older legal correspondence that was 
dated 1788. Apparently, an old dispute about 
property amongst members of the Monsano 
family, had never been concluded. It was prob- 




33 




igi i 




Leading scholars 




ably brought to the attention of the rabbis Elbaz 
and Ha-Kohen by descendants of the disputants. 
This signature of R. Raphael Moses Elbaz is 
significantly different and appears to belong to 
a much earlier period in his legal career than do 
his signatures in Mss.203, 204, 245, 246, and 
247 which were written many years later to R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur. 


There are two more correspondences by R. 
Raphael Moses Elbaz which contain his unique 
signature and which are of interest. In Ms.268, 
Raphael Moses wrote to the rabbis of Fez, Yedidia 
Monsonyego and Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur, to right 
an injustice that had been perpetrated against a 
dead orphan, since the court was the proper 
caretaker of the orphan and the widow. In Ms.269, 
R. Raphael Moses asks R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur 
to extend aid to the former’s relative, Mordecai 
Elbaz, who is frugal, and an avid student of Torah 
and Zohar. In the same correspondence an 
enquiry is made concerning one who paid his 
debt late, whether an additional penalty should be 
paid. 


In the second half of the nineteenth century 
a number of Moroccan rabbinic scholars left to 
settle in the Holy Land. One of these was R. 
Joseph b. Moses Arwaz of Rabat. He settled in 
Jaffa where he served as chief of the rabbinic 
court for the community of Sephardim. In Ms.41 
we learn that R. Joseph Arwaz, now serving 
as an emissary for the Moroccan community 
in the Holy Land, wrote to R. Raphael Ibn Zur 




of Fez on the eighth day of lyar 1876, informing | 




him of the trials and tribulations which hindered 
his mission. There were individuals who would 
prevent a successful fund raising effort from 
being realized he says, and the destitute of 
the Moroccan Jewish communities in the Holy 
Land suffer as a result. R. Joseph Arwaz’s 
signature is accompanied by a seal which 




34 




contains writing composed in three languages, 
namely, Hebrew and Arabic, with the Roman 
initials J.A. inscribed in a wreath at the Seal’s 
center. 


At the age of thirty R. David Ben Simeon 
left Rabat in 1854 for Jerusalem, where he 
helped to establish an organized community for 
Sephardim of the west (Morocco). He was also 
instrumental in the building of synagogues and 
schools. He served as chief of the rabbinic court 
from 1860 to 1880 when he passed away. His son, 
R. Raphael Aaron Ben Simeon, became a leader 
of the community after his father’s demise and 
was sent in 1887 and again in 1891 as an emissary 
to Morocco. 


R. Raphael Hayyim Moses Benaim left Tetuan 
for the Holy Land in 1860 and he settled in 
Tiberias. After he was appointed a member of the 
rabbinic court he was sent to Morocco as an 
emissary. When he arrived in Gibraltar he was 
appointed to serve as the rabbi of that community. 


Other Moroccan scholars made their way to 
Tiberias. R. Raphael Maman (c.1810-1880) left for 
the Holy Land at a young age and aspired to 
rabbinic positions, serving in Tiberias and then in 
Safed. R.Solomon b.R. Jacob Toledano was born 
in Meknés in 1835 and he travelled to Tiberias in 
1858, where he was subsequently appointed to 
the rabbinic court as a judge. He was sent 
afterwards as an emissary to Morocco. He was 
destined never to return to the Holy Land since he 
passed on in the community of Taza in 1877. R. 
Raphael Ohana was also born in Meknés, in 1850, 
and he made his way to Tiberias in 1865. Later he 
served as an emissary on several occasions. He 
passed on in 1902 and was buried in Safed. 


Many scholars and saints were desirous of 
settling in the Holy Land, but the function that 
they fulfilled for the masses of Jews who needed - 
them often prevented them from ever reaching the 




promised land. This function was akin to the role 
that the “Rebbe,” the Hasidic master fulfilled for 
eastern European Jewry. The famous Moroccan 
mystic R. Jacob Abi-Hasira of Tafilalet was such 
an individual, whose renown as a holy man 
reached far and wide. He commingled moments 
of solitude with caring for the needs of the 
destitute, which is reminiscent of R. Israel Ba’al 
Shem Tob, the founder of Hasidism. When R. 
Jacob attempted to make his way to the Holy Land 
the Jews who needed him placed obstacles in his 
path. He was only able to get as far as Egypt, 
where he passed away on the twentieth day of 
Tevet 1880 at the age of seventy-two years. The 
day of his death has been celebrated ever since as 
“Hilula,” a holy celebration. 




The influence of Europe 
and the United States 
The efforts of France and Spain to extend their 
spheres of influence into North Africa were met 
with opposition from the sultans of Morocco at 
the beginning of the nineteenth century. Mulay 
Suleiman, who ruled from 1792 to 1822, was under 
the illusion that by significantly reducing trade 
with Europe he could stop the foreign powers’ 
attempts to dominate Morocco. Since Jews were 
actively involved in foreign trade they were 
suspected of being in the service of the European 
powers and as a result repressive measures were 
applied against them. Jews who were previously 
granted special privileges to dwell in prosperous 
communities were now obliged to live in ghettos 
known as ‘mellahs.’ While Tunisian and Algerian 
Jewry were gaining more rights, the Jews of 
Morocco were obliged to conform to all the 
disabilities of the pact of Omar which relegated 
them to second class citizenship. 


The juridical disabilities that were enforced 
during the early nineteenth century encouraged 




Europe and the United States 




pogroms against Moroccan Jewry. Epidemics 
that occurred in 1799 and 1818 also took their toll. 
It was not surprising that many individuals who 
could leave for the Holy Land did so not only 
because of their fervent love for their ancestral 
homeland, but also because local conditions in 
Morocco were most undesirable compared to the 
more liberal atmosphere that prevailed in other 
countries where Jews took up domicile. Moroc- 
can Jews migrated to the Americas and some 
returned to Spain and Portugal to establish 
communities for the first time since the expulsion 
of 1492. Subsequent rulers of Morocco still turned 
to their Jewish subjects to render service in the 
fields of diplomacy and commerce. This policy 
was pursued during the reigns of Mulay Abd al- 
Rahman (1822-1859), Mulay Muhammad ben Abd 
al-Rahman (1859-1873), and Mulay al-Hasan 
(1873-1894). 


European Jewry began to look southward to 
the plight of their fellow religionists after the 
middle of the nineteenth century. The appalling 
conditions under which the Jews lived in Morocco 
at this time caught the attention of the famous 
English Jew of Sephardic extraction, Sir Moses 
Montefiore, whose philanthropy was legendary. 
At an advanced age he journeyed to Morocco to 
see if he could ameliorate the conditions of his co- 
religionists, and as a result of his efforts the Sultan 
Mulay Muhammad issued a proclamation called 
Dahir, on the fifteenth of February 1864, which 
was to. ensure equality before the law to all his 
subjects. It was, alas, shortlived. 




Included among the manuscripts in the 
“Yalkut Roiim,” volume compiled by Ariel Ben- 
sion, is a printed issue of the Hebrew publication 
“Ha-Libanon” (Vol. 3, No. 9, pp. 129-144), dated 
the eleventh of lyar 1866 which contains an article 
reporting the arrival of Sir Moses Montefiore 
in the Holy Land, on the eleventh of Nisan 1866. 




35 




Europe and the United States 




On that occasion he planned a Jewish quarter 
for domicile outside the Old City of Jerusalem. 
The article appears in Pr.133 5 (Pr.-printed rather 
than manuscript document.) 


Occasionally other Jewish organizations and 
prestigious individuals took a cue from the 
precedent established by Sir Moses Montefiore 
and tried to intervene with the ruling authority of 
Morocco on behalf of the Jews. The Anglo-Jewish 
Association of London tried to have the Sultan 
issue a new Dahir about ten years after the first 
was issued and revoked. Among the concerned 
individuals who attempted to improve the condi- 
tion of Jews of the Maghreb were Dr. Albert 
Cohen in 1860, Hayyim Gedaliah in 1864 and 
again in 1888, and Mr. Marcus of Boston, 
Massachusetts in the United States, in 1885. The 
organization that played a decisive role with an 
eye to the future development of Moroccan Jewry 
was the Paris based Alliance Israelite Universelle, 
known in Hebrew as “Kol Yisrael Haverim.” The 
Alliance was also in the vanguard of those who 
labored for the improvement of the legal status of 
the Jews in the Maghreb. 


The Alliance organized a network of 
educational institutions in Morocco. The first 
school was opened in Tetuan in 1862. The schools 
served to bridge the cultural gap by giving the 
young the wherewithal to meet the challenges of 
modern western society. The schools also served 
as focal points whereby many other services were 
made available to local Jewish communities. The 
Alliance schools were not welcomed by all 
quarters of the rabbinic leadership. Some rabbis 
regarded the introduction of secular studies as an 
effort that would oblige students to neglect their 
religious studies. 


The proceedings of the sixth meeting of Kol 
Israel Haverim appears in printed form in Pr.73.5. 
Among the participants are the following: the 




36 




aforementioned Dr. Albert Cohen, Rabbi Artoum 
of the London Sephardic community, the Chief 
Rabbi of France, and the official Nissim Shamama 
of Tunis, amongst others. A review of the year’s 
previous activities, a financial report, and arecord 
of the number of members is given. America 
begins to play a role and the B’nai Brith Organiza- 
tion is mentioned. It is reported that Serbian Jews 
desire to colonize the Holy Land but funds are not 
available for this purpose. 


In Ms.206 there appears a correspondence 
from Ish Za’ir of Fez to the Alliance Israelite 
Universelle in Paris. The writer commends the 
organization for undertaking the publishing of the 
responsa of R. Asher b. Yehiel. Ish Za’ir reports 
that internal Jewish communal politics in Fez are 
holding back the appointment of the two dele- 
gates who are to come to Paris. He also requests 
the appointment of a resident representative 
for Jewish matters to be stationed in Fez. In his 
opinion this would be an effective way of improv- 
ing the condition of the Jews. The writer states 
that the community of Fez will be unable to raise 
funds for Jewish causes as did Gibraltar, because 
economic conditions have deteriorated con-

Morocco became a French Protectorate in 
1912. Subsequently, the state of affairs which had 
prevailed between the Muslims and Jews for 
twelve centuries was upset by the arrival of the 
French. They became a third force, and drove a 
wedge between Jews and Moslems. Since the 
source material of the Bension collection con- 
cludes at the end of the nineteenth century | shall 
conclude the historical sketch at this point. 


The purpose of this introduction has been to 
give the reader an historical perspective for the 
Bension manuscripts and texts. The Sephardic 
character of the collection has also been 
elaborated upon. Space was devoted to the 




political events in Morocco because a significant 
part of this collection deals with life in Morocco 
from the seventeenth century until the nineteenth 
century. Since a dearth of source material is 
available for this historical period the collection is 
all the more valuable. It will be noted that 
Moroccan Jewry played a dynamic role in the 
preservation and perpetuation of Sephardic 
culture in the four hundred and fifty years 
following the Spanish expulsion. The cultural 
values of the native Jewish population of Morocco 




Europe and the United States 




which were conserved in an unbroken chain of 
tradition, dating back to the days of the destruc- 
tion of the Temple, were given vigorous expres- 
sion when they were amalgamated with the 
Spanish Jewish heritage of the pre-expulsion 
period. This process of conservation of cultures 
was accomplished under very trying political and 
social conditions. The next section will deal with 
the source material of the manuscripts and texts 
in detail.

The two hundred and seventy-five manuscript 
documents and correspondences described in 
this section were originally collated in the volume 
designated “Yalkut Rojim.” The compiler, who 
was in all likelihood Dr. Ariel Bension, had in- 
scribed in ink at the top of the first page of this 
collection “Yalkut Rojim, part III.” The volume 
contained 356 pages. We are confronted with an 
unresolved mystery as to what has happened to 
the other two bound volumes of manuscripts. 


The title “Yalkut Roiim” means “Collected 
writings of the shepherds.” The term “shepherds” 
refers to the rabbinic leaders of Moroccan Jewry. 
The manuscripts did not appear in the book in any 
organized sequence. In fact, while the pages were 
‘numbered in ink, often half of one page would 
appear several pages later because of the way the 
manuscripts were sewn into the text. Blank pages 
were also numbered. 




In order to serve the needs of scholars and 
interested students, and to aid in the method of 
reproduction, each separate manuscript has been 
removed from the original volume and placed in 
an individual case. It is hoped that this method of 
handling the manuscripts will aid in their preser- 
vation. Those desiring to use copies of the 
manuscripts described in this section for their 
research should prefix the manuscript number for 
which they are asking with the letters B.C.Y.R.Ms. 
The symbol B means Bension, C means Cohen, Y 
means Yalkut, R. means Roiim, and Ms. means 
manuscript. Printed documents are given the 
prefix “Pr.” rather than “Ms.” 


The page numbers referred to in this section 
are based on the pagination found in the volume 
wherein the documents were originally bound.
