A Ketubbah from Sefrou in the tradition of the 
Megorashim 




This handwritten Ketubbah (legal marriage 
contract), which is the only one appearing in the 
Bension Collection, was composed in the city of 
Sefrou, Morocco, on the fifth day of the month of 
Nisan, 5603 (1843). The groom’s name is given as 
Abraham the son of Mahlouf and the bride is 
called Esther the daughter of Mordecai. The 
witnesses whose signatures appear on the 
document are Amram Elbaz and Elijah Azulai. The 
total value of the Ketubbah is given as eight 
thousand and eight hundred ugiot. This contract 
stipulates that the groom will never oblige the 
bride to leave the city of Sefrou against her will 
and that he will not take an additional wife unless 
the bride is willing to give her assent. If he violates 
the last two stipulations then he will be obliged to 
pay her the aforementioned sums and he must 
immediately grant her a valid bill of divorce. This 
Ketubbah follows the practices of the community 




A letter by an emissary asking for aid for the 
scholars of Tiberias 




This correspondence is sent by R. David b. 
Abraham Gigi, in the year 1776, to Yauda Franko 




A letter by the emissary R. David Gigi to 
R. Joseph Ha-Kohen 




This letter is written by the emissary R. David b. 
Abraham Gigi to the rabbinic scholar and judge R. 
Joseph Ha-Kohen. The writer informs R. Joseph 
that he suffered a fall from which he is presently 
convalescing in the town of Slieman. [He 
probably fell from his mule which was of the male 
gender. That is why in subsequent letters he is 
insistent that only a mule of the female gender 
should be made available to him for his return 
journey to the Holy Land.] R. David describes the 
treatment he is receiving which consists of 
constantly being bled by a series of physicians 
and this has weakened him considerably. Another

of Castilian exiles of the city of Fez. 


This Ketubbah was originally pasted on the 
inside cover of the bound manuscript volume of 
The Kelalei ha-Rosh, the responsa collection of R. 
Asher b. Yehiel, which is found in the Bension 
collection [cf. Ms.292.] 


The upper left hand corner of the Kewbpah 
was torn away from the inside corner of the Ms. 
volume Kelalei ha-Rosh; that portion of the 
Ketubbah still remains therein. 


The upper third of the Ketubbah is artfully 
decorated by the process of rubrication. The main 
body of the text of the Ketubbah consists of 
nineteen lines including the signatures of the 
witnesses. The Ketubbah measures 33 x 18 cm. 
Portions of the written text have been affected by 
the depredations of time. 


A package containing correspondences, 
novella, and Midrashic texts composed by the 
emissary of Tiberias, R. Hayyim David b. Abra- 
ham Gigi, and one letter written to him, are now 
presented in the following Mss. 




asking him to extend support to the scholars of 
the community of Tiberias, in the Holy Land. The 
writer's distinctive signature is given at the 
conclusion of the epistle as David b. Abraham 
Gigi. 




form of treatment involves the barbecuing of meat 
which is placed onR. David’s shoulder. During the 
past fifteen days, R. David states, he has been 
staying in the home of R. Judah Balish in Slieman, 
where he is convalescing. 


R. Judah’s father stayed at R. David’s home on 
one occasion for several months and the son, R. 
Judah, is now repaying the kindness. 


R. David states that were it not for his present 
misfortune he would have spent some time at 
the home of R. Solomon Alfasi. The writer asks R. 
Joseph Ha-Kohen to extend himself in behalf of R. 
David and the mission which he serves, by 
collecting some monies that are due. R. David 
would not trouble R. Joseph if he was well. As itis, 
he only relates a small part of the tribulations that 
he suffers.

An emissary requests that a mule should be 
purchased for him 




This letter is written in Judaeo-Arabic to R. 
Abraham ibn Paroz by R. Hayyim David Gigi. The 
latter who serves as an emissary for the communi- 
ty of Tiberias informs R. Abraham that he lacks 
nothing. R. Hayyim asks R. Abraham, however, to 
request of Moses ibn Hayon that he sell him his 
mule since R. Hayyim is accustomed to that 
particular animal, having used it on a previous 
occasion. It would be a favor to R. Hayyim 
because he is going to be obliged to purchase 




R. Hayyim David Gigi inquires of R. Moses Hayon 
whether he will sell him his mule 




R. Hayyim David Gigi is preparing to return to the 
Holy Land after having completed his mission as 
an emissary and he requires a mule. He asks the 
prosperous R. Moses Hayon if he will perform an 
act of kindness by selling a female mule to him for 
this purpose. R. Hayyim is preparing to embark on 
Thursday, therefore, he would like the animal to 




Receipts that the emissary David Gigi composed 
for charitable donations given by the community 
of Kanaya 




R. David Gigi, the emissary of Tiberias, declares 
that the fixed sum of money that was pledged by 
the holy community of Kanaya was paid in full by 
their prosperous members. The members of the 
community have further pledged to give asum of 
money over the next four years which will amount 
to five gerush a year per householder may they be 
doubly rewarded from heaven. The author

assisted him, are also recorded. Incidental 
expenses for religious articles, food, clothing, and 
other items are noted as well. 


This list is also revealing in that an emissary 
was held accountable for any sum that was spent. 
Therefore exact records had to be kept. 




another animal in any event. The writer states that 
he had acquired two horses but they did not 
satisfy his needs. If Moses refuses to part with the 
animal then the writer asks Abraham to acquire 
another animal from someone else. R. Hayyim 
states that he will arrive on Thursday since the 
campaign (for charity) has gone well in his 
present location. R. Hayyim prefers that a female 
mule should be bought, and figures the price to be 
twelve or thirteen mitkalin. R. Hayyim inquires 
about the well-being of Abraham’s son, Samuel. 
On previous occasions R. Hayyim signed his 
name David, but now he has added the name 
Hayyim to his signature.

of the animal R. Moses will be paid. If R. Moses 
cannot himself bring that animal, or another 
female mule that would be suitable, then he 
should give the animal to R. Abraham ibn Paroz 
who will deliver it. In his introduction to the letter 
R. Hayyim sends greetings to the distinguished R. 
Aaron Arwaz and to the members of his 
houséhold, as well as to R. Moses Hayon. This 
letter is written in Judaeo-Arabic. 




concludes this receipt with a multitude of 
blessings. [This document was composed and 
signed by the writer David b. Abraham Gigi in 
Kanaya, at the end of the month of Elul 1776.] 
Another receipt states that the emissary of 
Tiberias, R. David Gigi, attests that he received 
from the chosen citizens of the holy community of 
Kanaya and from the hand of the prosperous 
scholar R. Hayyim Kustantin, the sum of one 
hundred gerush. This sum made up the thirty-five 
gerush that was owed according to the previous 
pledge and twenty gerush towards the new

with Jewish law. If the contract is invalidated

Therefore R. Hayyim David is asked to support 
the claim of Reuben b. Mas’Ud for the Ketubbah of

This letter is written by R. David b. Abraham Gigi, 
from Acco. It is difficult to ascertain to whom this 
letter is written because much of the letter is torn 
away. R. David states that he is again going ona 
mission as an emissary and he prays for divine 
guidance on his journey. He states that in the 
months that have passed there has been no 
tranquility in matters pertaining to the govern- 
ment. The writer requests that the person to

There was a sum of seven uqiot which Joseph

be concluded. If, however, Joseph refuses to do 
this, then he will be obliged to pay it as one who 
received a loan. All other matters outstanding.

still participate with adjacent communities in 
these important charitable undertakings. The 
members of the community have also agreed to 
fulfil an annual pledge of three gerush per annum 
which they will pay to the emissary of Tiberias 
who will come to collect it. The emissary’s

A copy of the text of a Halakhic query sent by R. 
Abraham Laredo of Gibraltar and the response 
thereto 




One day, Reuben, who was ill and bedridden, 
sent for the wealthy Simeon and for some others 
and related to them that when he was financially 
well off many years ago, two Ashkenazi Jews 
stayed with him leaving money in the sum of 
four thousand darham for safekeeping. They 
stipulated that if they returned then the money 
should be given to them, but if not then the money 
should be utilized for some religious purpose. The 
Ashkenazi gentlemen never returned. In the 
course of time, Reuben said, he lost his wealth 
and the aforementioned money was mixed 
together with his own, now all of which was spent. 
Subsequently, however, he managed to put some 
money aside, and now he would like Simeon to 
administer a special fund of four thousand dar- 
ham, which is to be invested, and any dividend 
income used to maintain Torah scholars and a 
house of study in the city of Rabat. 


The writer, R. Abraham Laredo, states that he 
was concerned as to what form the act of 
possession should take when Simeon received 
the money from Reuben. The symbolic form of 
affirming possession by the handing over of an 
object from one to the other of the contracting 
parties, called halifin, which is also referred to as 
‘Kinyan Sudar,’ would not be applicable in this 
case, for this procedure involved the transference 
of actual money to which the procedure for 
acquiring objects did not apply. Furthermore, in 
order to ensure the acquisition by transference of 
ownership through the use of an object, the 
governmental authorites would have to record the 
sale and this would only lengthen the procedure 
and would require additional expense. The writer 
therefore decided that Reuben should transmit 
the money directly to Simeon and thereby obviate 
all the aforementioned procedures and dif- 
ficulties. This had been agreed to by Reuben and 
Simeon. 


A technical problem had arisen, since the 
money was hidden in the sides of a box and 
because it was not easy to remove the money it 




150 




had been decided that Simeon should pick up the 
box. There was more money in the box than the 
four thousand darham and Reuben was asked if 
this money, as well should be used for the 
establishment of the academy, to which he replied 
in the affirmative. The aforementioned transac- 
tion was duly recorded. Reuben also stipulated 
that his other properties should be used to 
support his wife and his daughter and if these 
properties came to be exhausted then the wife 
and daughter should share in the dividends of the 
four thousand darham that was designated for 
the scholars. This transaction took place in the 
spring of the year 1841. 


A few days after the aforementioned transac- 
tion took place, Reuben reneged. He demanded 
that Simeon return the box and the money to him, 
and maintained that he had previously promised 
to pay his father-in-law a sum of money that they 
had both agreed upon. However, since he did not 
have the money at that time, it was incorporated 
into the additional sum that was stipulated in his 
wife’s marriage contract. Therefore, he was now 
obliged to make that money available to his wife. 
Simeon was not moved by Reuben’s claim. 
Shortly thereafter the scribes of the non-Jewish 
governmental courts informed Simeon that if he 
did not return the box and the money to Reuben 
immediately then the authorities would seize all 
his household goods and he would be imprisoned 
for theft since the transaction (which was not 
affirmed by the non-Jewish authorities) was 
performed in an unofficial manner. Simeon, who 
was sufficiently frightened, returned the money 
and the box to Reuben, who died thereafter. 


R. Abraham Laredo who supervised the 
aforementioned transaction and recorded all the 
details now composes several queries pertaining 
to this case for which he awaits a reply. One is: did 
Reuben have the right to renege on his original 
commitment and if so, did he also have the right to 
the additional amounts over the four thousand 
darham? Does the wife take precedence in 




collecting for her marriage contract or not? 




. R. Abraham Laredo adds the following before 
he concludes his query. He states that anything 
that he records relating to this case should not be 
regarded as testimony since he writes what he 




recollects and there is a measure of doubt in his 
report. He notes that he did not see the actual 
transmission of the money between the parties to 
the transaction, only the handing over of the box. 
R. Abraham regards himself as the student of the 
anonymous authority to whom he directs this 
query. This query is dated at Jebel Tor (Gibraltar) 
in the month of Sivan 1841.

A manuscript volume of R. Asher B. Yehiel’s 
responsa known as Kelalei Ha-Rosh 




The manuscript volume Kelalei Ha-Rosh, which 
was composed by R. Asher b. Yehiel, is a unique 
compilation since it bridges the cultures of the 
Franco-German Tosaphist schools of Ashkenazic 
Jewry and the Spanish halakhic system of the 
Sephardim at the beginning of the fourteenth 
century. R. Asher had enjoyed a distinguished 
career as a rabbinic leader in Germany before R. 
Solomon ibn Adret welcomed him to Barcelona. 
Subsequently, R. Asher served as rabbi in Toledo. 
He joined the anti-philosophic camp of the 
Talmudic traditionalists and supported R. 
Solomon ibn Adret’s ban on the study of 
philosophy by anybody under the age of twenty- 
five. 


The manuscript volume of the Kelalei ha- 




Rosh, which is written in Sephardic Mashait 




script, was probably located at one time in Sefrou, 
Morocco since a marriage contract from that city, 
dated 1843, was found pasted in the inside cover 
of this work [cf. Ms.276]. The text of this manu- 
script volume follows to a certain extent the 
text of the first printed Constantinople edition of 
1522 which consists of one hundred and eight 
chapters, numbering one thousand responsa. 
The manuscript volume commences with chapter 
four in the middle of law twenty-one, as the first 
four chapters are missing. The text that is extant 
contains one hundred and sixty-seven pages, and

brought to litigation by the descendants of

indications that more pages were written. ] 




is written on folios a and b. The text concludes 
with chapter ninety, the laws of Pledges, law 
number six. There is no colophon. The manu- 
script volume can be dated c. the fifteenth cen- 
tury. There are thirty-three lines to a page and 
the size of each page is 39 x 22 cm. The text is 
written on vellum. While no pagination is given the 
heading on each page notes the particular section 
and law that is being discussed on that page. 




The copyist added texts in the margins of the 




manuscript. These notes were originally com- 
posed by R. Asher b. Yehiel and they provide 
additional material, some of which do not appear 
in the printed editions. The additional texts 
appear on pages 66; 86; 11a [is incorporated in the 
printed edition]; 13a [is incorporated in the 
printed edition at the end of Kelal “Yud’-“Aleph” 
p. 146, but in a truncated version while the Ms. 
contains a more complete text]; 72a [is incor- 
porated in the published edition on p. 41a and b]; 
page 101a [is incorporated in page 54b and 55a of 
the published work, but in chapter 58 instead of 
chapter 57, see below]; and 133a. The arrange- 
ment of the Kelalim (chapters) differ in the Ms. 
version and the published edition. Thus, chapter 
57 in the Ms. volume is chapter 58 in the pub- 
lished edition. The variants between the manu- 
script and the published edition, as well as the 
change in the order of chapter classification, 
including additional elements that appear in the 
Ms. volume, make it a valuable addition to the field 
of responsa literature. 




ha-Rashba (Ms.293), makes it characteristic 
of its time and place, since the early masters of 
Sephardic culture prepared many such collec- 
tions for their own scholarly needs. This effort 
which began in Spain was perpetuated by North 
African scholars who copied earlier collections

Ms. 292 




Ms. 293 




of Responsa while also making original con- 
tributions to the field. 


R. Solomon ben Abraham ibn Adret (1235- 
c.1310) served as rabbi in Barcelona for more 
than four decades. His scholarly acumen gained 
him a reputation while he was still a young man 
and queries in matters of Jewish law were sent 
to him from all the countries of Europe, North 
Africa, and the Middle East. R. Solomon's corre- 
spondences exceeded ten thousand responsa. 
This well preserved corpus on Jewish law left 
its imprint on the Codes known as Shulhan Arukh. 


This new collection of Adret’s responsa (Ms. 
293) is a welcome addition to other collections 
of his responsa that are presently extant. The text 
was written in Sephardic mashait script. In the 
absence of any colophon it could probably be 
dated as a product of pre-expulsion Spain c. the 
fifteenth century. There are sixty-seven pages 
and the writing appears on folios a and b, apart 
from the Index. There are thirty-four lines on 
each folio. The work commences with an Index of 
seventeen pages and thirty-four folios, which 
records the subject of each responsum. Although 
the first three sections, and a part of the fourth 
section of the Index are deleted, the major portion 
of the Index which originally contained twenty- 
five sections, referred to as “Batim,” houses, is 
extant. The fact that the first chapters of the Index 
are missing is not a great loss since the contents 
of these sections are given in their entirety in the 
main body of the text. The main body of the text is

The Index which is written in double columns 
on each folio enumerates one thousand and 
thirty-nine responsa which originally comprised 
this collection. Two hundred and fifty responsa 
are given plenum with pagination. These extant 
responsa are valuable because their variant 
readings, when compared to the published 
responsa, are very illuminating in helping to 
establish a critical text. 


It is probable that Ariel Bension, the compiler 
of this entire collection, penned the correspond- 
ing citations in the margins of the pages of this 
manuscript indicating where the _ particular 
responsum can be found in the published edition 
of the same work. A similar script appears at the 
beginning of the first page of the Yalkut Roiim. It is 
important to note that the sequence of the 
responsa in the manuscript volume is entirely 
different from that of the published editions. 




Misim,” 




the sixteenth century. In 1543 R. Ishmael felt 
obliged to leave Tunis because of the difficult 
political situation that had developed there and 
made his way to Egypt where he served as chief 
rabbi. The synagogue which R. Ishmael fre- 
quented in Egypt subsequently became known as

Ms. 295 




the Tanuji synagogue. 


R. Ishmael completed his work, Sefer ha- 
Zikkaron in Egypt upon his arrival, in 1543. The 
author formulated this work as a Code of Law by 
classifying the halakhic rulings which he ex- 
trapolated from the text of the Talmud according 
to the order of the Tractates In his introduction to 
his work the author states “| desired to compose a 
concise digest of all the laws that pertain to our 
times [thereby excluding those laws which would 
pertain to the practices during the days when a 
Temple would be established] that are found 
in the Talmud according to the order of the 
Tractates. This digest should serve as an intro- 
duction to the Talmud and the legal decisions 
rendered by the Rif, [R. Isaac Alfasi of the elev- 
enth century].” The author became aware of the 




A manuscript collection of fragments of 
Maimonides’ commentary on the Mishnah 




R. Moses b. Maimon (1135-1204) composed his 
Commentary on the Mishnah, during the early 
years of his scholarly career. It was his intention 
to present the basic principles of the various 
halakhic topics discussed in the Talmudic Trac- 
tates and their rulings for those who might find the 
rambling discussions of the Talmud too difficult 
to follow. In his introductions to the various trac- 
tates he launched into theological formulations 
which could serve as a guide to the general reader 
in an age when polemic forced the various faith 
systems to present their beliefs in a concise and 
orderly fashion. Thus, the Jew would be able 
to respond to a wide range of questions such 
as the Judaic view on an afterlife, the concept 
of God, the psychological function of ethics, and 
the role of prophecy and revelation, among other 
topics which were discussed in the age of belief. 


In his design of the Commentary on the 
Mishnah one could already discern the begin- 
nings of the formulation of Maimonides’ later 
works such as his halakhic code called “Mishneh 
Torah” and his philosophic magnum opus, 
“Guide of the Perplexed.” Throughout his works 
concise definition of terms and classification of 
topics are his hallmark. In his introduction to the 
tractate on ethics called “Avot,” Ethics of the

tioned that work in his manuscript. 


The text of the Sefer ha-Zikkaron which is 
found in the Bension collection is a copy of the 
first printed edition of this work. According to the 
colophon it was published in Ferrara, on a 
Tuesday, the twenty-sixth day of Av 1555 by the 
publisher Abraham ibn Usque, Sefardi. R. Judah 
Doron aided in the production of this work. The 
ruler of the duchy is noted to be Don Herculi 
Diasti. No pagination is given and the first part of 
the work is missing. The book commences with 
the laws which conclude the first chapter of the 
Tractate Megillah. The rest of the work is 
complete. The size of a page is 19.2 x 14cm. The 
Original cover and binding of the book appears 
to be intact. 




Fathers, Maimonides attempts to harmonize 
Aristotelian ethical thought with Talmudic ethical 
teachings. 


Maimonides completed his commentary to the 
Mishnah, called Siraj, in 1168, at the age of thirty- 
three. 


The fragments that comprise the manuscript 
of Maimonides’ Commentary on the Mishnah 
which are found in the Bension Collection 
[Ms.295] consist of twenty-eight pages, folios 
a and b, and they are written in Temanic Mashait 
script. Many of the pages are in a damaged 
condition. There is no colophon available and no 
pagination is given. There are generally about 
twenty-six lines to a folio. The script is large and 
clear and the average size of the letters of each 
word is one-half centimeter. The length of each 
page is twenty-three centimeters with a width of 
eighteen centimeters, except where the pages are 
truncated. On the whole the texts that are 
presented are legible except where the pages 
are torn or perforated. The Commentary which 
follows each Mishnah is written in Judaeo-Arabic. 
The fragments can be regarded as having been 
written in the fourteenth century. The following 
are the contents of the available texts. [Albeck’s 
edition of the Mishnah was used as the basis for 
numbering the respective Mishnayot.] 




Tractate Shabbat 


Chapter one commences with the commentary to 
the first Mishnaic text, while the page containing 
the Mishnah text itself is missing. In chapter one, 
Mishnayot two to four inclusive are given. The 
concluding portion of the first chapter is also 
given. No introduction is available to the Order of 
Mo’ed in this collection. The fragments contain 
pointillation for the Mishnah text up to chapter 
seven. 


Chapter two contains Mishnayot one, two, 
five, six, and seven, with the commentary given. 


Chapter three contains only the text of Mish- 
nah six and its commentary. 


Chapter four appears to be given in its greater 
part. Mishnah one is given complete with com- 
mentary but the commentary on Mishnah two is 
truncated. 


Chapter five is almost entirely deleted except 
for some concluding lines of the commentary to 
the last Mishnah text of that chapter. 


Chapter six is given in full with the entire 
commentary. 


Chapter seven is given almost in its entirety 
except for a few concluding lines of the commen- 
tary to the last Mishnah. 


Chapter eight has the first four Mishnayot 
missing. The last portion of the commentary to 
the fourth Mishnah is available followed by 
Mishnayot five, six, and seven which conclude the 
chapter. 


Chapter nine commences with the first Mis- 
hnah and its commentary, but Mishnayot two and 
three and their commentaries are missing. A few 
concluding lines of the Commentary to Mishnah 
three are available, followed by Mishnayot four to 
seven inclusive, with commentary. The lines of 
the commentary to the seventh Mishnah are badly 
blurred. 


Chapter ten is given in full, except that 
Mishnah five appears as two Mishnayot in the 
manuscript. 


Chapter eleven also appears in its entirety. 
Diagrams are provided in the commentary to the 
second Mishnah. The third and fourth Mishnayot 
are combined in the third Mishnah of the 
manuscript edition. 


Chapter twelve is given in full, but the fifth 
Mishnah is very blurred except for the last line. 




Chapter thirteen is also given in full except that 
part of the fourth Mishnah is partly missing and 
the writing is blurred. No more text is available on 
the Tractate Shabbat. 




Tractate Yoma [Dealing with legislation per- 
taining to the Day of Atonement.] 


Several pages of fragments on the Tractate Yoma 
are found in the collection. There are, however, no 
texts available of the first four chapters. 


The first fragments on Yoma commence with 
chapter five where Mishnayot one and two appear 
as one Mishnah. Otherwise chapter five appears 
in its entirety; parts of the pages however, are 
torn, perforated, or blurred. 


Chapter six is complete except that the final 
passages of the eighth Mishnah commenced with 
the words “Rabbi Ishmael” were deleted by the 
copyist and then restored in the left hand column 
in a different script. 


Chapter seven is given in full. The fourth and 
fifth Mishnayot are combined in one text. 
Maimonides provides, in his commentary to the 
last Mishnah, a diagram of the sequence in which 
the names of the tribes appear on the stones of the 
Ephod. 


Chapter eight has, as the only text available in 
the Tractate of Yoma, the concluding (ninth) 
Mishnah and commentary prefaced by some of 
the lines which conclude the commentary to the 
eighth Mishnah. The upper portion of this text is 
blurred and a portion of it is torn away; there are 
also perforations. 


The Tractate Yoma is concluded with the 
benediction “Barukh Notain Laya-aif Ko’ah U-le- 
ain Onim Ozmah Yarbeh.”—“Blessed be He who 
gives strength to the weary and to the powerless 
He imparts much might.” Excluding the first word 
(Barukh) the rest of the text is a passage from 
Isaiah 40:29. This blessing is also given in Judaeo- 
Arabic. Folio b of this page commences with the 
Tractate Sukkah. 




Tractate Sukkah [Laws pertaining to the con- 
struction of booths for the festival of Taber- 
nacles. ] 


The first Mishnah of the first chapter of the 
Tractate Sukkah is given with the commentary 
which contains diagrams pertaining to the 




155 




Pr. 296 




construction of a Sukkah. The Mishnah is blurred 
and perforated, and a portion of the text is torn 
away. 




Tractate Ta’anit 


The available fragment from the Tractate Ta’anit 
contains the commentary to the first Mishnah of 
the fourth chapter followed by the second and 
third Mishnayot, including their commentary. The 
third Mishnah is divided into two Mishnayot in the 




An early printed edition of the Tur Shulhan Arukh, 
Yoreh De’ah. This is an incunable and a unicum. 




R. Jacob ben Asher, more popularly known by his 
major work “The Arba’ah Turim,” or “The Ba’al 
ha-Turim,” arrived in Spain from Germany [c.f. 
Ms.292] at the beginning of the fourteenth cen- 
tury with his scholarly father R. Asher ben Yehiel, 
R. Jacob was concerned that individual Jews and 
communities should be guided by the corpus of 
halakha, Jewish law, in all their activities. In order 
to facilitate his aim, because he found that the 
available works on Jewish law were unsatisfac- 
tory, he formulated the whole field of Jewish law 
into a code which contained four subdivisions. 


Volume |, which he designated as Orah Hay- 
yim, in 697 chapters sets forth the laws dealing 
with daily duties of Jews and the legislation 
pertaining to blessings, prayers, holidays, fasts, 
and the Sabbath day. 


Volume II, Yoreh De’ah, contains 408 chapters 
which deal with legal decisions pertaining to ritual 
law. In the purview of ritual law are such subjects 
as the dietary laws, mourning for the dead and 
their preparation for burial, organic deficiencies 
in animals which prohibit them for human 
consumption, laws on usury, the menstrual cycle, 
and many other topics. 


Volume lil, Even ha-Ezer, deals with laws 
involving the legal relationships between men and 
women, such as marriage and divorce, and 
contains 178 chapters. 


Volume IV, Hoshen Mishpat, is a corpus on all 
matters pertaining to civil law. 




156 




manuscript fragment. The first part of the third 
Mishnah is almost entirely obliterated and the 
upper part of the text is torn away. No other texts 
from the Tractate Ta’anit are extant in this 
collection of Mishnaic fragments. . 


Variant readings are noted when _ the 
manuscript fragments of Maimonides’ Commen- 
tary on the Mishnah are compared to the texts of 
the printed editions on the same work. 




The printed edition of the Tur, Yoreh De’ah, 
which is available in the Bension Collection is 
from the late fifteenth century. The first part of 
the work is missing and itcommences in the midst 
of chapter fifteen. Chapter sixteen is designated 
by the letters “Yud” and “Vav.” The volume 
concludes with chapter 298, the Law of Orlah. In 
some editions the Law of Orlah is recorded under 
chapter 294. This discrepancy can be explained 
by the fact that the Spanish editions of the Tur, 
Yoreh De’ah, follow one Ms. tradition while the 
Ashkenazi tradition follows a different Ms. text 
which was used by the Jewish printers in Italy, 
as may be noted when one examines the Soncino 
edition of 1490. 


The size of a page is 30 x 21.5 cm. No pagina- 
tion is given. There are thirty-six lines to a page 
with two columns to each folio. While the work is 
sewn together the book’s covers are missing. 
No colophon is available and both the beginning 
pages and those at the end of the book are miss- 
ing. The publisher used Sephardi Mashait type 
except at the beginning of new chapters and 
paragraphs when Sephardi Square type is used. 
This type differs from that in the Guadalajara 
edition of 1482 by the publisher Solomon ibn Al- 
Kabiz, and from that of Eliezer Atlantansi’s Ixar 
edition of 1487. While the latter was produced 
in long lines rather than double columns, it con- 
forms in all other respects with the layout of the 
text in the Bension Collection edition. The source 
of both works appears to be the same Ms. Unlike 
the Italian editions, which contain 403 chapters, 
the Sephardic Text contains 408 chapters. 




A first edition of the Sefer Abudarham, 
Lisbon, 1489. 




R. David b. Joseph Abudarham was a Spanish 
rabbinic author of the early fourteenth century 
who was concerned about the lack of understan- 
ding, by his co-religionists, of prayer, it origins, 
and its structure. He therefore wrote his commen- 
tary on Jewish liturgy which traced the origin of 
prayer to its Talmudic and Gaonic sources. He 
explained ritual procedures and elaborated on the 
meaning of various prayers. His works cited 
the following authorities who wrote on the sub- 
ject of prayer, such as the author of the Manhig, 
R. Abraham ben Nathan ha-Yarhi of Lunel, R. 
Asher ben Yehiel, and the latter's son R. Jacob, 
author of the Turim, who was contemporaneous 
to R. David, among other authorities. 


R. David was also perceptive in his discern- 
ment of the various traditions that were 
perpetuated by different communities. The Sefer 
Abudarham was completed in Seville in 1340. 
Appended to the work were a section explaining 




A manuscript volume of Samuel Ibn Tibbon’s 
Hebrew translation of Maimonides’ “Guide of the 
Perplexed,” known as Moreh Nevukhim 




Maimonides, the luminary of Jewish scholarship 
during the twelfth century, is represented in the 
Bension Collection by two of his works. His 
halakhic work is represented by fragments of 
his Commentary to the Mishnah [cf. Ms.295]. 
Moses b. Maimon as philosopher is represented 
by his magnum opus which was originally written 
in Arabic as Dalalat al-Ha’rin, “Guide of the Per- 
plexed.” It appears in the Bension Collection in 
the Hebrew translation of Samuel Ibn Tibbon 
entitled “Moreh Nevukhim.” The fact that Mai- 
monides prepared most of his major works in 
Arabic is indicative of the familiarity that Jews 
had with that language in the twelfth century, 
apart from the fact that Maimonides’ literary 
activity was produced in Islamic lands, namely, 
Spain, North Africa, and Egypt. 


Moses ben Maimon, after studying Aristoteli- 




the various benedictions, calendrical tables, anda 
commentary on the Passover Haggadan. The first 
edition was published in Lisbon in 1489. The 
edition in the Bension Collection is a copy of 
the first edition, and an incunable. Another copy 
was recently acquired for the Jacob M. Lowy 
Collection in the National Library, Ottawa. The 
work is preserved almost in its entirety. Each 
page measures 29.5 cm in length and 19.5 cm 
in width. No pagination is given. The author’s 
introduction and the first two sections designated 
as ha-Sha’ar ha-Rishon and ha-Sha’ar ha-Sheni 
are missing. These sections discuss the time of 
the performance of the Sh’ma and the institution 
of prayer, respectively. 


The first few pages of the Sha’ar ha-Shlishi, 
which deals with the laws concerning blessings 
recited upon the performance of commandments, 
are also deleted. At the conclusion of the book, 
Tables of Calculations are given. 


This is the second book printed in Lisbon; 
an edition of Nahmanides’ Biblical Commentary 
preceded it by a few months. 




an philosophy, felt his Jewish faith, which is 
based on God’s revelation of Himself to man, 
confronted by the challenge of knowledge, which 
is based on human reasoning. Moses Maimonides 
tried to meet the challenge by seeking ways of 
achieving a reconciliation between the systems 
of faith and reason. Similar efforts at reconcilia- 
tion were attempted by Muslim theologian-phi- 
losophers and by Christian scholastics who 
followed Maimonides, such as Thomas Aquinas, 
who is known to have been influenced by him. 
Maimonides devoted portions of the “Guide” 
to presenting a philosophic interpretation of 
scripture, defining terms related to God in scrip- 
ture, and discussing the problems of God's unity 
and Divine attributes, the proof of God’s exist- 
ence, unity and incorporeality; theories on crea- 
tion, the nature of prophecy, evil, and Divine 
Providence; and finally a substantial section dis- 
cussing the reasons for the biblical command- 
ments. While Maimonides made a valiant effort 
to achieve the sought-after reconciliation be- 
tween religion and philosophy he paid a price 




157 




Pr. 297 




Ms. 298 




for engaging in that pursuit. He was seduced 
by the Aristotelian view of ethics which placed 
the subject in a subordinate role. For Maimonides, 
as for Aristotle, morality is only the third perfec- 
tion, while the dianoetic virtues are for them the 
fourth and highest perfection. Thus does Mai- 
monides state in the concluding chapter of the 
“Guide,” 11:54, “The third type of perfection is 
more closely connected with man himself... It 
includes moral perfection, the highest degree 
of excellency in man’s character. Most of the 
precepts aim at producing this perfection; but 
even this kind is only a preparation for another 
perfection... The fourth kind of perfection is the 
true perfection of man; the possession of the 
highest intellectual faculties; the possession of 
such notions which lead to true metaphysical 
opinions as regards God.” 


Fortunately, among the post-Maimonidean 
philosophers of the thirteenth century, Shem Tob 
ibn Palqera refused to accept Maimonides’ view 
on ethics even though he defended the latter’s 
approach, which sought to achieve a reconcilia- 
tion of revelation with reason. After all, the God of 
biblical tradition revealed Himself as the activator 
of mercy and grace, and not as the detached Mind 
thinking thoughts. Thus Palqera, who was 
primarily an ethical and a pedagogic philosopher 
in the authentic Judaic tradition, would not permit 
himself to be seduced by Aristotelianism on this 
vital point. Even Maimonides felt the tension of 
the biblical ethical protest pitted against sterile 
intellectualism when he stated, (Mishneh Torah, 
hilkhot De’ot, 5:1), “The scholar must be 
recognizable by his activities.” 


The manuscript volume of the Moreh contains 
one hundred and fifty pages and three hundred 
folios, two columns to a page and thirty lines to 
each column, which are written on vellum in 
Provengal-Sephardic Mashait script, of pre- 
expulsion Spain. The largest complete page 
measures 29.8 x 23.5cm. However, since the work 
was written on vellum even the measurements of 
complete pages vary. Where the pages are not 
torn as a result of wear or decay, they have been 
cut away to be utilized as writing material. Many 
pages were cut almost to the bottom line or 
margin of the text. No pagination is given. The 
work commences with Samuel ibn Tibbon’s 




158 




Thesaurus of Philosophic Terms which consists 
of twenty pages. The first four introductory pages 
to ibn Tibbon’s Thesaurus are missing, as well as 
the following sections of the alphabetical terms: 
from the term “Kamut” at the end of letter “Khaf” 
to the term “Kotev” in the section of the letter 
“Koof.” The remaining terms classified under the 
letters “Raish,” “Shin,” and “Tof” are complete. 


The aforementioned text concludes with anew 
paragraph consisting of four lines which are 
written in Maaravic Cursive script wherein the 
following is stated: 


“Il composed this section [The Thesaurus] ona 
ship which was located four miles from the coast 
of Al-Akliba and a distance of one and one-half 
day’s travel from Tunis, on my journey from 
Alexandria [Egypt], in the month of Tammuz, in 
the year 4973 from creation [1213], may the 
Almighty return our group in peace to our city and 
our homes.” 


We often dismiss the translator as merely the 
secondhand instrument of the author of the 
original text. This attitude towards translators, 
especially one of the caliber of Samuel ibn 
Tibbon, must be dispelled. After Maimonides had 
composed the “Moreh” in Arabic, R. Jonathan ha- 
Kohen of Lunel approached Samuel ibn Tibbon 
asking him to render a service to the scholars of 
the Provence by translating the “Moreh” into 
Hebrew. Although Samuel possessed excellent 
credentials as a translator (he was the son and 
student of the master translator Judah ibn 
Tibbon) he still approached the task of translating 
Maimonides’ “Moreh” with trepidation. The 
Hebrew language had to be recast to express 
philosophical terms which were the products of a 
culture that was foreign to medieval Judaism until 
that time. Not only the translator but the Hebrew 
language was put to a severe test. 


Samuel ibn Tibbon maintained personal 
communication with Maimonides so that the 
author could clarify his intended meaning for the 
benefit of the translator. Finally, Samuel 
journeyed to Egypt to receive Maimonides 
personal confirmation of his work. Fourteen days 
before the demise of Maimonides, on November 
30, 1204, the translation was completed at Arles. A 
cataclysmic revolution commenced as ibn Tib- 
bon’s translated work was rapidly disseminated. It

became an instant best-seller as it served as fuel 
for the conflagration which burst out between 
traditional conservatives and those who were 
adherents of a liberal intellectualist tradition in 
the Jewish and, subsequently, the Christian faith 
systems. The Dominicans officially consigned the 
“Moreh” to the flames at Paris. Thereafter, the 
Dominican Thomas Aquinas enhanced the value 
of the “Moreh” in scholastic circles. While Samuel 
ibn Tibbon was engaged in his meticulous effort 
to produce a precise translation, Judah Al-Harizi 
was urged to offer his Hebrew translation of the 
“Moreh.” The latter’s work was notas technical an 
effort as was that of ibn Tibbon. 


It may be that Samuel ibn Tibbon realized that 
his more technical language might be an obstacle 
to the serious student who was unfamiliar with the 
nuances of philosophical Hebrew terminology 
that he had devised, so he attempted to remedy 
the situation by offering a Thesaurus of Philo- 
sophical terms as an aid to the reader. Thus, we 
are informed in his concluding paragraph, after 
the Thesaurus, that he completed it in the year 
1213; 


We noted above that the script of the con- 
cluding paragraph to the Thesaurus was written 
in Maaravic Cursive script while the main body of 
the text before and after this paragraph, which 
serves as a colophon to the Thesaurus, was 
written in Provengal-Sephardic Mashait script. 
This oddity can be explained in the following 
manner. We often use a Cursive script and sud- 
denly we switch to a square script. This same 
technique was practiced by the copyist. Before 
the expulsion from Spain there was no clear 
distinction in the writing style between those 
Sephardic Jews who lived on either side of the 
Strait of Gibraltar and Provengal Jewry. When 
subsequently the cultural connection was sev- 
ered the Jews indigenous to each geographic 
location developed their own peculiar writing 
styles. One could be tempted to speculate that 
since ibn Tibbon was from the Provence, he might 
have been the copyist of the manuscript, es- 




160 




pecially since he states in the concluding para- 
graph to the Thesaurus, “I composed this 
section,” instead of the usual “Samuel ibn Tibbon 
said.” Furthermore, why would the copyist 
change the nature of the script unless he was, 
indeed, Samuel ibn Tibbon, who desired to 
personalize the text? If we accept this theory then 
this manuscript would have to be dated as early 
as 1213. However, since this is improbable, we 
must at least conclude that this manuscript dates 
from the period of pre-expulsion Spain. How- 
ever, the mystery concerning the change of script 
remains. 


Samuel ibn Tibbon’s preface to the work 
which follows the problematic four lines is now 
written by the copyist in the same script with 
which he began the Thesaurus of Philosophical 
Terms. This preface is given almost in its entirety 
with only the last few lines missing. The last part 
of Maimonides’ Introduction to the Moreh, in 
Hebrew translation, is also available on two 
pages. The next section commences with almost 
the entire first part of the Moreh, chapters 1 to 76. 
Chapters 14, 15, 16 of Part One are missing in 
their entirety, and half of chapter 46. While most 
of the pages are intact and they are sewn together, 
some pages have been severely torn. At the end 
of chapter thirty of the First Part, a note is given 
by the copyist which does not appear in printed 
editions of the Moreh. It consists of twelve lines 
which were written in a similar but smaller size 
script than that which is available in the main 
body of the text. This note appears in the main 
body of the text, not in the margin. The following 
chapters are missing in Part Two of the Moreh— 
chapters 8, 9, and 10; otherwise Part Two is 
complete. Sections of chapters 21, 24, and 50, 
and chapters 52, 53, and 54 in their entirety, are 
missing from Part Three. Variants are noted 
throughout the text when it is compared with the 
printed edition. No colophon other than the para- 
graph after the Thesaurus is available. While 
many of the pages are bound together, other 
pages are severed from the text.

An early printed edition of the homiletic work 
called Menorat ha-Ma’or 




R. Isaac Aboab was a noted rabbinic author and 
preacher who lived towards the end of the 
fourteenth century. His major literary achieve- 
ment was the Menorat ha-Ma’ér, which is to this 
day among the most popular ethico-Aggadic 
works of Judaism. This work has undergone more 
than seventy editions, with the first edition 
published in Constantinople in 1514 and the latest 
Hebrew edition published in Jerusalem in 1961. 
The Menorat ha-Ma’or was subsequently 
translated into Spanish, Ladino, Yiddish, and 
German. Preachers and study groups in syn- 
agogues found this work to be an indispensable 
source of aggadic material and a basic text for 
ethical instruction. 


The author sought to restore Aggada to its 
rightful place as an essential part of rabbinic 
tradition. Until his own time only the legal materi- 
al of the Talmudic tradition, known as Halakha, 
was deemed a necessary object of study for 
Jewish survival. Thus, it was his desire to com- 
pose the kind of structured work for Aggada 
which would oblige scholars to notice its intrinsic 
value. R. Isaac utilized the symbol of the seven- 




A volume of the printed edition of the biblical 
commentary Zuf Devash 




The volume known as Zuf Devash is acompilation 
of four works of biblical commentary by R. Vidal I 
Ha-Sarfati (1631-1703) of Fez, the son of R. Isaac 
Ha-Sarfati and the grandson of Vidal | Ha-Sarfati. 
[The Encyclopaedia Judaica, 14:879, Jerusalem 
1973, is in error when it ascribes the authorship of 
Zuf Devash to Vidal I.] The first work, Zuf Devash, 
is acommentary on the Pentateucnh. It appears on 
pages 1 to 19. The second work which appears on 
pages 19 to 32 is entitled Megilat Setarim, a 
commentary on the Scroll of Esther. The third 
work is Ha-Za’at Rut, acommentary on the Scroll 
of Ruth, which is found on pages 32 to 42. A fourth 
work by R. Vidal Il Ha-Sarfati, called Ozar 
Nehmad, a commentary on the Psalms, is found 
on pages 42 to 60. 




branched candlestick of the biblical Tabernacle 
as the central image of his work, which in English 
translation means “Candlestick of Light.” 


R. Isaac Aboab provided a special service to 
scholars by making available to them passages 




from aggadic works which are no longer extant’ 




and by citing from variants of Talmudic and 
Midrashic texts which were utilized in the 
Spanish-North African schools and which 
differed from those texts used by scholars of the 
Franco-German tradition. R. lsaac Aboab was 
eclectic in his use of sources. He utilized texts 
from the rational philosophic tradition as well as 
from the halakhic and mystical traditions. Among 
the authors from whose works he quoted we have 
Alfasi, Rashi, the Tosafists, Abraham ibn Ezra, 
Maimonides, Abraham ibn David, Jacob Anatoli, 
Nahmanides, Solomon ibn Adret, Abudarham 
Bahya’s Hovot ha-Levavot, Joseph Gikatilla’s 
Sha’arei Orah, Asher b. Yehiel, and Jacob b. 
Asher’s Tur. Aboab’s use of sources belies his 
own world view which appears to have been 
syncretic, since he co-mingles Kabbalistic views 
with philosophic notions. Religious practices 
were also explained in his moralistic work. 


The Menorat ha-Ma’or in the Bension Collec- 
tion is a complete printed volume of the 1623 
Venice edition. 




Another work which appears at the end of this 
volume was composed by R. Aaron Sarfati, a 
grandson of the author R. Vidal Il Ha-Sarfati. The 
title of the work is Misgav ha-Imahot, a commen- 
tary on Eshet Ha’Yil, the Woman of Valor, which is 
found on pages 60 to 65. Another grandson of R. 
Vidal Il, who was a noted scholar, was R. Samuel 
Ha-Sarfati, author of the work Sefer Nimukei 
Shmuel. 


The manuscript of the work Zuf Devash which 
was published in Amsterdam in the year 1718, was 
brought to that city by R. Isaac b. R. Joseph 
Bueno De Mosquita. He came to Amsterdam 
which was a center of scholarship to pursue his 
studies. This information is made available in the 
colophon to the work. The publisher was R. 
Solomon b. Joseph Kohen-Zedek Proops. The 
work was published two columns to a folio and 
contains sixty-five pages.

A manuscript fragment of Nahmanides’ biblical 
commentary on the Decalogue 




R. Moses b. Mahman (1194-1270), who was also 
known as the Ramban, was born in Gerona in the 
province of Catalonia, Spain where he maintained 
an academy. R. Moses was proficient in many 
scholarly fields but his special renown was 
established in the fields of Kabbala, biblical 
exegesis, and in Jewish law. R. Moses was 
acknowledged as the leading halakhic authority 
of his age, and one of his most outstanding 
students was R. Solomon ibn Adret of Barcelona 
[cf. Ms.293). 


Nahmanides is the latinized form of R. Moses’ 
name. He composed his biblical commentary 
when he was advanced in years. While most of the 
work was completed in Spain, the finishing 
touches were applied after R. Moses b. Nahman 




A Ms. fragment of a philosophic text

“Or Adonai.” Each folio contains twenty-four 
lines and the size of the fragment is 27 x 15 cm. 




Manuscript fragments of a Talmudic text 




Two manuscript fragments of a Talmudic text 
which were composed in a beautiful Sephardic 
Mashait script, c. late fourteenth century, are 
available in the Bension Collection. The pages 
measure 35.9 x 12 cm with thirty-five lines to a 
page. The text appears on two pages, folios a and 
b and it is quite worm-eaten. The subject that is 
recorded in these texts corresponds to the 
material that is under discussion in the Babylo- 
nian Tractate, Yebamot, pages 36b to 38a. 
However, these fragments do not just contain 
Talmudic texts. The author intersperses the views 
of medieval commentators such as R. Zerahiah 
Halevi, Rabbenu Tam, Rashi, and Rav Alfasi, on 
parallel texts to the topics that are under discus- 
sion,

arrived in the Holy Land, in 1263. The author fled 
to the Holy Land as the result of a disputation he 
had with the apostate Pablo Christiani, over 
whom he was victorious. The Dominicans, who 
initiated the disputation, were disappointed with 
the outcome especially since the victor’s views 
were subsequently recorded at the request of the 
Bishop of Gerona. The Dominicans requested 
that Pope Clement IV should intervene and 
request that Nahmanides be punished for his 
calumny against the Church. It was at this point 
that Nahmanides fled from Spain. 


The manuscript fragment was written in 
Sephardic Mashait script in pre-expulsion Spain. 
It is considerably damaged and worm-eaten. The 
commentary that is extant gives an exposition on 
the last words of Deuteronomy 4:25—5:5. The 
fragment, which bears writing on both sides, 
measures 25.5 x 17.3 cm. 




The copyist wrote in Sephardic Mashait script of 
the fifteenth century. In this fragment the author 
dwells upon the nature of the leader and the 
effects that he has upon those whom he governs.

what will be done with her marriage contract

case the School of Shammai maintains that the 
heirs of the deceased’s husband share in her

of Hillel maintains that her property designated as

death or divorce the husband must restore 
entirely, falls equally to the first husband's heirs 
and the father’s heirs; while the Ketubbah falls to 
the first husband's heirs, and the property that

Ms. 304 Manuscript collections of liturgical poems and a 




mahzor from Morocco 




It can be stated that the field of liturgical poetry 
is a preoccupation of Moroccan Jews ofall ages. 
Unlike the Ashkenazi Jew who has little occasion 
to innovate or to alter the program of the daily, 
Sabbath, or Holiday services, the Sephardi, who 
draws from a vast storehouse of liturgy, did not 
give up his creativity in this field in the early 
sixteenth century. Rather, Moroccan Jewish 
masters of liturgical poetry continued to compose 
new poems for sad and joyous occasions as well 
as for the prayer services throughout the syna- 
gogue calendar. On the occasion of my marriage 
in 1969, in the town of Tivon, in Israel, the leader 
of the Sephardi congregation of Moroccan Jews 
signalled a halt to the routine of the regular Sab- 
bath service as he sang songs of joy for the wed- 
ding occasion. These beautiful religious com- 
positions lasted for more than a half-hour before 
the regular service routine was resumed. 
Among the most celebrated authors of litur- 
gical literature noted in the several collections 
of the first section of this manuscript, the follow- 
ing are mentioned; Solomon Haluah, David b. 
Aaron b. Hasin, Shalom Zur, Solomon ibn Gabirol, 
Israel Najara, Jacob Ibn Zur, Isaac ibn Haluah, 
Moses b, Ezra, Abraham ibn Ezra, Mimun b. Solo- 
mon, Jacob Adhan, and Moses b. Jacob Adhan. 
Several poems in these collections are unpub- 
lished and have not heretofore been mentioned 
in liturgical reference works. The complete manu- 
script text, which is bound together with a prayer 
book, consists of two sections. The first section 
contains ninety-seven pages of collections of 
liturgical poems and it appears before the text of 
the printed edition of the prayer book. The poems 
are written on sides a and b and the size of the 
pages in this section vary. Some pages were 
measured at 14.5 x 10.5 cm while others measured 
15.8 x 10 cm. The second section, which appears 
after the conclusion of the printed edition of the 
prayer book, consists of forty-seven pages and 
contains Penitential prayers known as Selihot, 




164 




Bava Batra. Finally, the decisions of medieval 
authors called Rish6nim are given. 




which are recited before the High Holy Days, and 
a Mahzor for Rosh Hashanah. The writing ap- 
pears on folios a and b of each page which meas- 
ures 16.1 x 11 cm. The manuscript dates from the 
late eighteenth century. This work originated in 
Morocco and the signature of Abraham ibn 
Adhan is written on the inside cover of the book. 
Most of the prayers are written in Maaravic 
Mashait script. One collection is written in 
Maaravic Square script. 


The types of liturgical compositions are 
Piyyutim, Pizmonim, and Bakashot. Piyyut is the 
name applied to liturgical poetry which is usually 
composed for recital at the synagogue service. 
Pizmon is a hymnal poem which concludes with 
a refrain after each verse. It is sung by the reader 
and repeated by the congregants. Bakashah is a 
prayerful petition representing the relationship 
between God and the people of Israel. The Angel 
of Mercy, Throne of Glory, and Torah are calied 
upon to intercede for Israel. A detailed analysis 
of the contents of this manuscript follows. 


The first page of the manuscript is part of an 
incomplete liturgical piece but what is available 
in the acrostic indicates that the author was R. 
Solomon Haluah. The letters of the acrostic are 
given twice; part of the page is torn away. The 
Piyyut on the other side of the page (1b) was also 
composed by R. Solomon Haluah according to 
the acrostic. The first stanza is as follows: 


“Ashir Shirah Ne’emanah, Le-Zur; dar 


Me’onah, Yom Zeh Al Siyyum Mishnah, Ba- 


Kol Shemurah Mefo’arah Tehorah Barah, 


Ev’en Yekarah.” 


In the preface to a poem given on this page it is 
reported by the author, R. Solomon Haluah, that 
he composed this piece in honor of the scholars 
R. Yekutiel Berdugo, his sons and sons-in-law, 
and in honor of R. Solomon Toledano. The work 
commences with the words, “Or ha-Ne’erav, 
Mizrah Ma’arav. ...” A poem on the exalted nature 
of the Almighty, which follows on pages 3a to 
4a was also composed by R. Solomon Haluah. 


R. Solomon Haluah composed a poem on the 
occasion of his completion of the study of the 




Tractate Ketubbot, which appears on page 5a. 
He also composed a poem (page 5b) which was 
based on the following text from the first chapter 
of the Tractate Eruvin, “Kol Davar Dibbur Al 
Ofano Ta’amo Ve-Nimuko Emo.” 


On page 6a a new series of supplicatory 
prayers are introduced under the title Bakashah. 
The first part of the first prayer is missing. The 
second prayer under this title was composed by 
David b. Aaron b. Hasin according to the acrostic. 
[See Davidson, Thesaurus of Medieval Hebrew 
Poetry, Vol. |, 1970, P. 115, No. 2435.] This prayer 
concludes on the bottom of page 7a. It may be 
that the copyist did not know that the authorship 
of this text was by Hasin, since he made no effort 
to reveal the acrostic. The Bakashah at the top of 
page 7b, “Shima Tefilatee ha-Shem Ve-Shavati 
ha-Azayna...” was attributed by scholars to one 
called Isaac. The final prayer, called Bakashah in 
this section, which commences at the bottom of 
page 7b-8b, is “Ereh Yomi U-Mitrahek Ve- 
Hapoalim Azaylim...” 


The next section, commencing in the middle 
of page 8b, begins a series of prayers introduced 
by the word Piyyut. They are given below.

that page 14a which com-

More collections of Piyyutim follow and some 
of them which are repeated were noted in the two 
aforementioned collections that were analyzed. 


The next collection is written in a beautiful and 
clear Maaravic Square script. These poems ap- 
pear from pages 40a to 47a. The Piyyutim were 
composed by Solomon Haluah and David b. 
Hasin. David b. Aaron [Hasin]’s poem Mashiah, 
mentioned in the previous collection, appears 
again; also a poem by Shalom [Zur], a Piyyut for 
evening, and a Piyyut by David b. Aaron Hasin. 
The last Piyyut in this collection was composed 
by Solomon Haluah on the occasion of the per- 
formance of the Mitzvah of Milah. 




47b-48b A Piyyut.is offered which 
belongs to a new

80a-97b Bakashot are commenced 
at this point. R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur is mentioned as 
the author of the 
Bakashah on page 93a. 




At this point the printed Siddur commences. 
After the conclusion of the printed Prayerbook 
text the penitential prayers preceding the Holy 
Days of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, 
are presented in manuscript form. The printed 
1968 edition of the Mahzor “Zekhor Le-Avraham,” 
in accordance with the Sephardic ritual, was used 
as a basis of comparison with the text of the 
manuscript.

An unbound manuscript volume of a High Holy 
Days Mahzor with penitential prayers and 
fragments of Hoshandot 




This manuscript volume was found unbound 
and in fragmented sections. It was written in 
Sephardic Square script on vellum with lineation 
called “Shirtut,” and pointillation. The size of 
each page is 23 x 17.8 cm except where the pages 
are truncated. The text is given on sides a and b 
of each page. No pagination is given but the 
special Piyyutim were numbered in sequence 
by the scribe. There are ninety-five pages and 
introductory sections to the Rosh Hashanah, 
Yom Kippur, and Hoshanét services are written 
in Judaeo-Arabic in a script which is indigenous 
to the Eastern Mediterranean. While no colophon 
is given, this manuscript appears to be a product 
of the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. 
Several of the liturgical poems are not noted in 
Davidson’s Thesaurus nor do they seem ever to 
have been published. It can be ascertained by 
a review of this volume that anumber of the pages 
are missing. 


A perusal of the authors of the Piyyutim found 
in this Mahzor reveals that they span a period of 
over one thousand years. A composition by the 
celebrated and the earliest of the known liturgical 
poets of c. the fifth century, who is given the 
appellation Yose b. Yose Kohen Gadol, of the 
Holy Land, appears at one end of the spectrum 
and a composition by R. David ibn Abi Zimra 
(1479-1573) appears at the other end of this time 
span. R. David was born in Spain and it is sur- 
mised that his family left via Fez for the Holy Land 
and he arrived in Safed when he was still a teen- 
ager. Finally, he made his way to Egypt where he 
ascended to the rabbinic leadership of that com- 
munity. The time period in which R. David lived 
enables us to ascertain that the Mahzor could not

monim of the morning services for both days of 
Rosh Hashanah begin on page 121a while the 
morning services conclude on page 134b. The 
Musaf service commences on page 134b and 
concludes on page 144b, which is also the con- 
clusion of this manuscript. 




be earlier than from the end of the sixteenth 
century. 


Other authors whose compositions appear in 
this Mahzor are representatives of the classical 
schools of French, Provengal, and Spanish litur- 
gical poetry of the tenth to the thirteenth cen- 
turies. Among them are the following authors; 
Joseph ibn Abitur, c. tenth century, who was the 
first Sephardi to compose a Ma’amad prayer; Levi 
b. Jacob Altabban; David b. Elazar ibn Bakuda; 
Abraham ibn Ezra; Moses ben Ezra; Solomon ibn 
Gabirol; Isaac b. Judah Gerondi; Isaac ibn Ghay- 
yat; Judah Halevi; Joseph Hazan; Benvenist 
ha-Katan bar Hiya; Isaac Halevi bar Zerahiah 
Yarondi (Gerondi); Joseph b. Isaac of Orleans; 
Joseph Kimhi; Judah b. Samuel; Moses Katan 
b. Jacob of Grenoble; Rabbenu Nissim; and 
Joseph b. David ibn Suli. 


The terms Pizmon, Piyyut, and Bakashah, 
which are different types of poems that appear 
in this volume, | have already defined in Ms. 304. 
In addition to those types of poems, there appear 
also the Tokhehah, a type of poem which contains 
self-chastisement in the form of prayerful expres- 
sion, and Selihah, a penitential prayer wherein 
one seeks Divine forgiveness. This last type is 
usually recited on occasions for fasting, on the 
nights before the High Holy Days, and also on the 
Day of Atonement. The poems of this manuscript 
volume were checked against Davidson’s 
Thesaurus of Mediaeval Hebrew Poetry for 
variants, as well as to see if they were extant in 
other collections. Most of the poems in this manu- 
script are in accord with Spanish and North 
African rites. The first section commences in the 
middle of the Ma’amad for the seventh night. 
The term Ma’amad hearkens back to temple times 
when representatives of the Jewish people stood 
by as the offerings were made and they recited 
scriptural passages. This term eventually was

At this point in the manuscript volume, the 
next nine liturgical poems are missing and the 
Selihot section for the days preceding Rosh 
Hashanah concludes. An introduction to the 
Rosh Hashanah services follows in a Judaeo- 
Arabic script of the Eastern Mediterranean area. 
The concluding prayer of the Shaharit Amida 
for Rosh Hashanah is followed by the service for 
the blowing of the Shofar. The Musaf Amida 
follows without any special piyyutim noted. The 
usual sections of Malkhiyét Zikhréndét and 
Shofardt are given.\ Direction for the conclusion 
of the Musaf service is given in Judaeo-Arabic 
as well as directions for the Minhah service of 
Rosh Hashanah and the Fast of Gedaliah. The 
aforementioned introduction and prayers appear 
on fourteen pages. 


The next section is introduced with directions 
for the recital of the Minhah service before the 
eve of Yom Kippur, and the Confessional that is 
added to this service is given. Additional direc- 
tions are given in Judaeo-Arabic pertaining to 
the conclusion of the Minhah service and the 




introduction of the Ma’ariy service which com- 
mences with the text of Kol Nidrei which is given. 
The text of the evening service follows. Three 
liturgical pieces in fragmented form, are pre- 
sented at the end of the Ma’ariv service, but only 
the following Selihah is identified. 




“Ya’aseh Tevuah U-Feri, Tahanun Tiknu 
Emunai.. .”

text is generally recited as a Piyyut 
for blowing the Shofar and here it 
appears as the concluding portion 
of the Selihdt for the evening 
service of Yom Kippur.

“Aromimkha Hezki Ve-Helki be- 
Voee Ve-Rov Davki Ve-Dafki...” 
This text was known to the Jewish 
communities of the 
Mediterranean. 


On the other side of this page is contained 
the “Seder Avodah Le-R. Yose ben Yose Kohen 
Gadol.” “Atah Konanta Olam Me-Kedem Yisadeta 
ha-Kol ve-ha-Kol Pa’alta U-Viryot Yazarta.. .” 
Many variants are noted in this text. Davidson 
writes in his Thesaurus, Volume |, the letter 
“Aleph,” No. 8816, that the author of this famous 
text is unknown. Yet, in our text, Yose ben Yose 
Kohen Gaddl is declared to be the author. 


Eight pages contain the text of the 
aforementioned Seder Avodah. 
An unnumbered Pizmon is 
recorded on another page. 
“Pizmon Le-R. Solomon ibn 
Gabirol N[ishmato] “E[den]. 




“Ashrei Ayin Ra’atah Kol Aileh, 
ha-lo Le-Mishma Ozen Da’avah 
Nafshaynu ...” 


Davidson notes that Solomon ibn 
Gabirol’s Pizmon commences 
from the second line of our text 
“Ashrei Ayin Ra’atah Shoshanat 
ha-Sharon Ve-ha-Kavod 
Mehofef,” rather than from the 
aforementioned first line. This 
poem is an addition to the Seder 
Avodah. 


Additional psalms and poems follow the Musaf 
Service and some of them are numbered, from 
234 to 253. Among these poems are supple- 
mentary piyyutim and selihdét for Rosh Hashanah. 
The last numbered poem is No. 253, “Barukh 
She’amar Le-Yom Zom Kippur.” “Barukh El Adir 
ba-Meromim Ve-Lo Ye-Khalkeluhu .. .” This 
poem is recorded as a Pizmon in other collec- 
tions. 


Two liturgical poems which are not numbered 
are very significant since the copyist also gave 
the names of their authors; something which we 
find but rarely in this manuscript volume. They 
are given below. The first is, “Nishmat Le-R. 
Joseph B. R. Isaac Z.Z.L.” “Ashkimah Shahar 
Yom Yee-hadetow Le-Zom Heh-Asor...” The 
author of this work is Joseph Kimhi. 


The next text is titled, ‘“Ve-Ailu Finu Malei Le. 
R. Abraham ben Ezra, Z.Z.L.” The opening line 
is now given; “Ve-Ailu Finu Malei, Ve-Ailu Finu 
Malei, Shir Zur Lo Ye-Suleh...” This poem is 
not noted in Davidson’s Thesaurus. Thus, we 
have discovered a poem by the celebrated poet 
of the twelfth century, Abraham ibn Ezra, which 
has heretofore been unknown. 


The last section, which contains several 
pages, is in a poorly fragmented condition. It 
contains supplementary prayers called Hoshanot 
which are read in the synagogue on the festival 
of Tabernacles. While most of these prayers are 
available in other collections they have variants 
which will be of scholarly interest. Some of the > 
texts are not referred to in liturgical reference 
works. Unlike most of the prayers contained in the 
Mahzor no numeration of these prayers is avail- 
able.

Ms. 306 A manuscript volume of the kabbalistic work 




Ez Hayyim 




R. Hayyim b. Joseph Vital Calabrese (1542-1620) 
was one of the great Kabbalists and a principal 
disciple of the founder of Ari Kabbalism, R. |saac 
Luria. R. Hayyim devoted his literary activities 
to elaborating on the teachings of Isaac Luria 
in a compulsive manner. He hoped to be the sole 
transmitter of what he comprehended to be the 
authentic ideas of Lurianic Kabbala, to the exclu- 
sion of all other interpreters of the master. A 
group of disciples followed R. Hayyim even 
though he demanded acertain amount of secrecy 
from them. When R. Hayyim left the inner circle 
at Safed, for Jerusalem, where he served as rabbi 
and head of an academy from 1577 to 1585, the 
group dissolved. During this period R. Hayyim 
composed his final version of the Lurianic system. 


R. Hayyim returned to Safed and remained 
there for several years. During this period it is 
reported that he became ill, and while he was 
unconscious, some scholars of Safed bribed his 
younger brother Moses to allow them to copy 
six hundred pages of Hayyim Vital’s writings 
which were subsequently circulated. Hayyim’s 
youngest son, Samuel, inherited all the manu- 
scripts containing his literary output. The two 
major works Ez Hayyim and Ez ha-Da’at were 
disseminated in several versions. The various 
treatises were divided into “Gates,” “She’arim.” 
Even during R. Hayyim’s lifetime many of the 
copies of his works in circulation were poorly 
arranged. 


Vital’s last version, which he prepared during 
his stay in Jerusalem, was discovered there in a 
Genizah by Abraham Azulai. During the early 
decades of the seventeenth century Jacob b. 
Hayyim Zemah, who studied Kabbala in Safed, 
arrived in Damascus where he studied Kabbala 
under the direction of Samuel, the son of Hayyim 
Vital. Jacob Zemah began to draw on Hayyim’s 
rediscovered Jerusalem manuscript for his own 
literary efforts. Meir Poppers, a disciple of Zemah, 
produced his final edition of Vital’s works in 1653. 
A colleague of Poppers, Nathan Shapira, edited 
a Kabbalistic work called Me’érét Natan.

pp. 45b-51a 




Shalom Sharabi (1720-1777), of Yemen, 
arrived in the Holy Land via Damascus. He 
studied at the celebrated Kabbalistic academy 
Beth-El, which was founded in 1737 by the Kab- 
balist Gedaliah Hayon, where prayers were 
recited according to the directives of Isaac Luria. 
Sharabi studied Lurianic Kabbala according to 
R. Hayyim Vital’s tradition as was the practice 
of other Kabbalists of Jerusalem. He succeeded 
Hayon as head of the academy after 1751. Sharabi 
wrote comments and glosses which elucidated 
much that was obscure in the works of R. Hayyim 
Vital. 


The aforementioned scholars, namely, Jacob 
Zemah, Nathan Shapira, and R. Shalom Sharabi, 
have their glosses contained in the manuscript 
volume of Ez Hayyim, Ms. 306. This work, which 
is written in Maaravic Mashait script, might have 
been copied from a late eighteenth or early nine- 
teenth century published edition of the Ez 
Hayyim. The text is written on two hundred and 
two pages, and on sides a and b. It contains the 
following sections:

Four manuscript volumes of the work Torat 
Emet Tikkun Soferim 




The work Torat Emet Tikkun Soferim was in- 
tended to serve as a model text by which a scribe 
could be guided to write a scroll containing the 
text of the Pentateuch which could then be used 
for the ritual of the Torah reading at synagogue 
services. The scribe added the prophetic reading 
which is introduced at the conclusion of each 
Sabbath text. Occasional readings from the 
prophets for the festivals and the new month were 
also included. Only four of the bound Penta- 
teuchal volumes, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, 
and Deuteronomy are available. Genesis is miss- 
ing. According to the title pages to the books of 
Numbers and Leviticus, these four volumes were 




180 




pp. 163b-166a Sha’ar 45—Sha’ar ha-Makifim, 
4 chapters 


pp. 166a-170a Sha’ar 46—Sha’ar Kisei ha-Kavéd 
ve-Ha-haykhalot, 
4 chapters 


pp. 170a-178a Sha’ar 47—Sha’ar Seder 
A‘B’ ISA”, 
7 chapters 


pp. 178b-183b Sha’ar 48—Sha’ar Derushei ha- 
Kelipdt, 
9 chapters 


pp. 183b-192a Sha’ar 49—Sha’ar ha-Kelipdot, 
9 chapters 


pp. 192a-202b Sha’ar 50—Sha’ar Kelipat Nogah, 
11 chapters 




Although the manuscript is complete, no 
colophon is given. The bibliophile Ariel Bension, 
the originator of this Collection, would have 
developed an avid interest in this manuscript 
because his family was quite involved in the 
movement of the Beth-El mystical community of 
Jerusalem where this type of literature was in- 
tensively studied. Bension also composed a pub- 
lished work on Sar Shalom Sharabi. The influence 
that Ari Kabbalism had in the past and its echoes 
that still reverberate in theosophical literature 
and in Hasidic movements, is ample testimony 
to the important role that R. Hayyim Vital played 
as the penman of Kabbalism. 




written by a scribe in the city of Meknés. 


The text, which is probably from the eight- 
eenth century, is given in Sephardic Square script 
throughout. No pagination is available. Scribal 
lines called “Shirtut” are given. All four volumes 
are written on vellum and they follow the Sep- 
hardic ritual. Sentence endings are also desig- 
nated. Each volume will be described separately. 


The Exodus volume The title page is torn 
away almost entirely. The size of each page is 
13 x 10 cm. After the text of the first Haftorah 
(prophetic reading) for the section of Exodus, 




‘the scribe introduces a second prophetic reading 




from the sixteenth chapter of Ezekiel. He prefaces 
that text with the remark that it is in accord with 
the view of the Rif and the Rosh, and that is why 
he included this reading. The work concludes 




with the prophetic readings for the Arba Parshiyot 
and the blessings which are recited before and 
after the prophetic section. Notes for the cantilla- 
tion are given on side a of the last page. On side b 
the names of Daniel Toledano and Raphael 
Legimi appear. The scriptural passage from 
Ecclesiastes 7:23 is quoted. No pointillation is 
given in this volume. 


The Leviticus volume The work commences 
with a title page. The names Raphael Legimi and 
Mimin Legimi appear on the first page. In addi- 
tion, a list of names with numbers in the form of 
alphabetical letters are given. Some of the names 
that are distinguishable are Mas’ud ibn Sharbit, 
Menasseh Kohen, Levi, Isaac ibn David Ohaytn, 
Shalom Edery, Musa ibn Shitrit, Mordecai ibn 
Shitrit, ibn Biri, Jonah, Isaac ibn Shalilo (Baleiro), 
Abraham, and Aaron. Calculations are given on 
the opposite page. 


The Pentateuchal and prophetic readings for 
Sabbath which falls on the New Month is given 
as well as those readings which pertain to the 
Passover festival. The Haftorah reading is given 
with the Targum (Aramaic translation) of Jona- 
than ben Uziel. A special prayer is added after 
the Haftorah reading for the first day of Passover. 
The last page, side a, gives the notes of cantilla- 
tion with pointillation. 


The Numbers volume The title page of this 
volume is the only one that is rubricated. The 
page prior to the title page contains two beautiful 
signatures by Raphael Legimi. A faded name is 
given in Square script and the name Elijah ibn 
Maman also appears. Four lines of verse appear 
on side b of the page which contains the signa- 
tures. One page containing the conclusion to 
the Haftorah of the last section of the Numbers 
reading is missing. 


The Deuteronomy volume The title page is 
missing in this volume. Side a of the first page 
is given with pointillation. At the end of this 
volume the text of the scroll of Esther is given in 




Mss. fragments of scriptural verses from Isaiah 




34:5 - 36:4 44:5 - 45:1 60:16 - 62:6 




full with the blessings which are recited both 
before and after the ritual reading of Esther. The 
prophetic readings and blessings for the High 
Holy Days and the feast of Tabernacles conclude 
this volume. 


There is some slight variation in the size of 
the pages of the four volumes. Some pages 
measure 14.3 x 10 cm while others measure 13 x 
10 cm. 


An introduction is given to the section on 
Biblical texts and fragments which appear in the 
Bension Collection Ms. 308 to Ms. 322. 


The above enumerated manuscripts are all 
part of a collection of Biblical texts which were 
written in Sephardic Square script, on vellum, 
c. the fourteenth century. The manuscript texts 
follow the Masoretic text; however variants 
abound. Pointillation is given, the conclusion of 
sentences are marked, and to a certain extent 
the Petuhét and Stumét are adhered to. There 
is no pagination or other demarcation of the 
Biblical chapters. The size of each page is 16 x 
16 cm, except where the pages have been trun- 
cated. It appears that originally all these texts 
were bound together as part of one work and they 
were composed by one scribal hand. Two col- 
umns of text appear on each side and there are 
twenty-one lines to a page. There are one hun- 
dred and three separate texts available in this 
collection. 


The classification of the manuscripts is or- 
dered according to the traditional sequence of 
the prophetic texts. Thus, all fragments of Isaiah 
are enumerated under the same classification 
number, followed by Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the 
twelve minor prophets in sequence. The only 
exception is the fragment from the Second Book 
of Kings. Originally, this collection of Biblical 
texts was larger. Additional fragments from the 
books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jonah, and Habbakuk, 
once part of this collection, are known to be 
extant.

The nature of the Hebrew script in the 
Bension collection. 




Three types of script are prominent in the Bension 
Collection. The first is used in ritual works such 
as prayerbooks, facsimiles of Torah Scrolls, and 
Biblical texts, and is designated as Sephardic 
Square script. It is noted in the descriptions of 
Ms. 304; Ms. 305; Ms. 307; Mss. 308 to 322. The 
second type most commonly found in the col- 
lection is known as Cursive script. This least 
formal of all scripts was most widely used in 
correspondences, court documents, and per- 
sonal records and notes. Most of the documents 
and correspondences in the Yalkut Roiim Manu- 
scripts Ms. 1 to Ms. 275 are characteristic in their 
use of this script. The third type is usually used in 
the more formal works not generally utilized 
for ritual purposes and this is designated as 
Mashait script. Examples of this third class of 
script can be found in major halakhic, philo- 
sophic, mystical, and liturgical works which were 
principally written in book form for study pur- 
poses. This script can be found in Ms. 292; Ms. 
293; Ms. 295; Ms. 298; Ms. 301; Ms. 302; Ms. 303; 
Ms. 304; and Ms. 306. 


At the very outset of this book we character- 
ized this collection as Sephardic. The movements 
of Sephardic Jews, after the Spanish expulsion 
of 1492, brought them to the shores of the Eastern 
and Western Mediterranean. There were also 
historical periods when Jews, whom we regard 
today as distinct from one another, were drawn 
together culturally. As they shared similar tradi- 
tions so did their script manifest similarities. 
External influences also had an effect upon 
Jewish life. Those diverse communities who lived 
under the Moorish influence, such as the Jews of 
North West Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and 




the Provence, manifested a similarity of script 
as long as they were able to share the same cul- 
tural contacts. Thus, we find in Ms. 298 two 
different scripts, by the same scribe, adjacent to 
one another. In the post-expulsion period these 
scripts were classified as Provengal-Sephardic 
and as Maaravic. In the pre-expulsion period they 
could be regarded as Sephardic scripts shared 
by three major literary contributors, namely: 
Spanish Jewry, Provengal Jewry, and the Jews 
of North West Africa. 


The scribal tradition of the Eastern Mediter- 
ranean is represented in the collection by the 
Mahzor, Ms. 305. When Jews from the Maghreb 
migrated to the Holy Land, their descendants 
developed an affectation in their script which 
developed its own characteristics. This script 
can be regarded as a Holy Land or a modern 
Western Palestinian Cursive script. Examples of 
it are manifested by Holy Land emissaries and 
book dealers whose correspondences appear in 
Ms. 30; Ms. 31; Ms. 44; Ms. 45; Ms. 54; Ms. 95; 
Ms. 99; Ms. 101; Ms. 103; Ms. 120; and Ms. 125. 
This type of script must be distinguished from the 
Temanic or Parsic types which, although con- 
temporaneous, developed their own peculiari- 
ties apart from the Western Palestinian types 
but these are not available in this collection. A 
script which seems to conform to the scribal tradi- 
tion of Egypt does appear in the Cursive script 
which introduces the different sections of the 
Mahzor in Ms. 305. 


The Cursive script was utilized by copyists 
in an ornamentalized fashion which we call 
Mashait when they sought to give their work 
the quality of a book script. An example of this 
can be seen in Jacob Ibn Zur’s poetic composi- 
tions which appear in Maaravic Mashait script 
in Ms. 84. A peculiar development took place in 




187 




Appendix 




Appendix 




modern Holy Land Mashait script of the nine- 
teenth century when the writer tried to achieve 
an ornamental effect similar to printed works, 
even in his correspondences such as shown in 
Ms. 56. The ornamentalized form can also be 
detected when formal documents for certifica- 
tions of officials such as ritual slaughterers were 
composed, as may be noted in Ms. 16. Authors 
and copyists of Chronicles also wrote those texts 
in a more ornate Mashait script as may be noted 
in Ms. 87. 


Signatures were developed into a special 
art form especially in the North African com- 
munities. Note the listings of signatures in the 
Index of Subjects. One of the many examples 
of signatures can be noted in Ms. 43, a product 
of the mid-seventeenth century. Few examples of 
the signatures indigenous to writers of the Holy 
Land communities are available in this collection 
(cf. Ms. 100). However, these writers did develop 
a distinctive signature type, though it was less 
elaborate than those of the Moroccans. 


In the past the tendency was to designate 
what we call Mashait script as rabbinic script. 
This developed because most of the scholarly 
tomes that were read by Jews were halakhic 
works whose authors wrote in a specialized 
scribal style which had to be less painstakingly 
produced than the traditional square script if 
voluminous works were ever to reach completion. 
This “rabbinic” script was even adopted by the 
nascent printing industry in the late fifteenth 
century. 


One halakhic work in the collection which 
dates from the fourteenth century and is written 
in a Temanic Mashait script is Ms. 295, Mai- 
monides’ Commentary on the Mishnah. Each 
text of the Mishnah is translated into Judaeo- 
Arabic. Several documents of this collection are 




188 




written wholly or partially in Judaeo-Arabic, 
which is the Arabic language in Hebrew charac- 
ters. Different Arabic dialects can be detected 
and the script in which they are written usually 
indicates whether the Arabic is a North Western 
African dialect or an Egyptian dialect. 


Occasionally, liturgical poems known as 
Piyyutim are written in square script, but most 
Piyyutim, especially of Morocco, are written in 
Cursive or Mashait script. This genre of literature 
was used extensively at prayer services; since 
many of the collections of Piyyutim were not 
published they were recorded by many individu- 
als who had neither the time nor the inclination 
to render them in an ornate script. 


It sometimes occurs that a copyist will render 
a text, that originally was written in another locale 
and in a different script, into his own script. 
Therefore the reader must consider whether the 
text before him is an original text or correspond- 
ence, or a copy of the original. An example of 
this can be noted in Ms. 4, where letters from the 
Holy Land were copied by a Moroccan scribe into 
Maaravic script. When a colophon is offered by 
the writer or copyist it gives valuable information 
concerning the provenance of the text and other 
details. However, sometimes a colophon might be 
copied as well; as may be the case in Ms. 298. 


Certain types of script seem to endure through 
the centuries. This is particularly true with regard 
to those used by scribes who write texts which are 
used as ritual items such as Torah Scrolls. How- 
ever, when Jewish migrants come under new 
influences, scripts are inclined to change. The 
first generation might retain the script of their 
previous land, but new or syncretic forms of 
writing usually evolve among their descendants, 
and often come to dominate. When political con- 
ditions are relatively static, the uniformity of a 




script can endure for a few centuries. The trained 
eye can detect a certain uniformity of style in 
Ms. 292; Ms. 293; Ms. 298; Ms. 301; and Ms. 303. 
They were all produced before the end of the fif- 
teenth century and under the influence of the 
Sephardic Mashait script. While there are diver- 
gences among the texts, there are certain features 
in the writing which places them together in a 
group. The trained eye can recognize the work of 
certain copyists even though no clear indicators 
are available other than the script. In collections 




Appendix 




of correspondences such as appear in the Yalkut 
Roiim one can notice the evolution of a particular 
individual’s script or signature when a series of 
documents or epistles by the same author are 
offered spanning decades. Such is the case with 
the signature of R. Raphael Moses Elbaz (cf. 
Introduction). One can study the evolution of 
R. Jacob ibn Zur’s signature over half a century. 
The effects of age on handwriting can be noted 
in one document and one letter by Hayyim 
Joseph Gayni in Ms. 158 and Ms. 159.
