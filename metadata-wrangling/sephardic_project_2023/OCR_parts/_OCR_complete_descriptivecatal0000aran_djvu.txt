People talk of the experience of travel as 
culturally enriching. Others do their travelling by 
reading a variety of books that transport them to 
the four corners of the earth and to the far reaches 
of outer space. When valuable books and 
manuscripts, heretofore unknown, begin to travel 
then history is made and the details of a previous 
age are discovered. 


The acquisition of the Bension manuscripts 
and texts for the University of Alberta by the Harry 
R. Cohen Memorial Foundation was an even more 
exciting experience for a number of reasons. This 
was the first time that Hebrew manuscripts had 
ever been discovered in Canada. Secondly, there 
is a dearth of scholarly source material in the field 
of North African Sephardic studies to which a 
good portion of the collection pertains, and yeta 
growing number of universities in France, the 
United States, and Israel are establishing in- 
stitutes which are specializing in the field of 
Sephardic studies. Thirdly, scholars in a variety of 
cognate fields of Jewish study will be able to draw 
upon the scholarly resources which are now 
housed in the Special Collections department of 
the Library of the University of Alberta. This 
collection will bring the University of Alberta into 
the orbit of select libraries and institutions of 
higher learning throughout the world which 
possess unique materials in the field of Jewish 
scholarship and which make these sources 
available for scholarly investigation. Fourthly, the 
collector, who was a scholar in his own right, has 
been rediscovered. 


There is a social aspect to the significance of 
the Bension collection. Exhibitions of specimens 
in the collection have already been held in eastern 
and western Canada. At a recent exhibit which 
was held in Montreal, under the sponsorship of 
the Organisation Sepharade Francophone, 
several thousand Jews of Moroccan extraction 




were in attendance. The Jewish community of 
Morocco once numbered over a quarter-of-a- 
million people. The majority of these people 
presently make their domicile in Israel, but a 
sizeable number migrated to France since they 
are French-speaking, and it is estimated that 
about twenty thousand Moroccan Jews 
emigrated to Quebec. It is therefore quite proper 
that after Israel and France, Canada should 
possess and disseminate materials which will 
preserve the cultural continuity of North African 
Jewry for their descendants who have found 
refuge on Canadian shores. The acquisition and 
dissemination of material from the Bension 
collection by the University of Alberta is a major 
effort in this direction. 


The element of uniqueness should not be 
sacrificed as people of diverse cultural 
backgrounds join together to achieve a united 
society. While there is a natural tendency for 
minorities to assimilate into the mainstream of 
society, sooner or later there arises a quest for 
one’s identity which must be satisfied. An 
exposition of the valuable efforts that were made 
by outstanding Jewish scholars of the Maghreb, 
who have contributed to the dynamic develop- 
ment of communal organization in Morocco for 
hundreds of years, will serve as a source of pride 
to all who would inquire about their heritage. 


A fascinating aspect of the collection is the 
story of how the Bension collection arrived at the 
Library of the University of Alberta. The collector, 
Ariel Bension, passed away suddenly in Paris 
at the age of fifty-two, in 1932. His collection 
came into the possession of his second wife, née 
Ida Siegler, who lived in Montreal where she had 
served as a Hebrew teacher prior to their mar- 
riage. Before Ida Bension passed away in 1952 
she sold the collection to a book dealer. There 
is evidence that the collection contained more 




ix 




Preface 




Preface 




items than at present. Some of these works were 
probably sold by Ida Bension separately. At one 
time the collection was supposed to have con- 
tained thirty letters composed by the illustrious 
scientist Albert Einstein on the subject of Zion- 
ism. These were presumably sold at an earlier 
date. Since Ariel Bension was an important 
emissary for the World Zionist Organization, it 
is logical to deduce that he possessed corre- 
spondence of this nature. 


A noted Montreal collector, Mr. Saul 
Muhlstock, who was an acquaintance of the late 
Ida Bension, subsequently acquired the collec- 
tion from the book dealer to whom she sold it. In 
the spring of 1973, Mr. L.E.S. Gutteridge of the 
Library of the University of Alberta was contacted 
by a book dealer who was supposedly acting for 
Mr. Muhlstock. The latter was prepared to sell the 
collection to a Canadian institution of higher 
education. | was lecturing in the Department of 
Religious Studies at the University of Alberta 
when | was asked to assess the value of the 
Bension collection for scholarly research. | was 
surprised to find that, indeed, a treasure trove of 
manuscripts and texts were before me, especially 
since this was the first collection of Hebrew 
manuscripts ever to be discovered in Canada. The 
result of my findings are incorporated in part IV of 
this work. 


A meeting was held in the Cameron Library 
Board Room, at the University of Alberta, on 
Monday, June 25, 1973. Among those in atten- 
dance were Messrs. Sam Goldsmith, Sam Greene 
and Tom Mayson, Q.C., representing the Harry R. 
Cohen Memorial Foundation; Messrs. L.E.S. 
Gutteridge and Bruce Peel, representing the 
Library of the University of Alberta; members of 
the University Committee on Scholarly Ac- 
quisitions and myself, Saul Aranov. At the 
conclusion of this meeting, the Harry R. Cohen 




x 




Memorial Foundation of Edmonton, Alberta, had 
acquired the Ariel Bension Sephardic 
Manuscripts and Texts for the Library of the 
University of Alberta. This is the initial acquisition 
and showpiece of the Harry R. Cohen Memorial 
Collection at the University of Alberta. 


| express my gratitude to the trustees of the 
Harry R. Cohen Memorial Foundation for their 
munificent benefaction and their interest in 
establishing a collection of Hebraica and Judaica 
at the Library of the University of Alberta. Their 
sponsorship will be instrumental in helping to 
establish Jewish scholarship in Canadaonamore 
sound basis. Their effort is agenuine testament to 
the character of Harry R. Cohen, who was truly a 
high priest in the temple of philanthropy and 
culture in the general and Jewish communities of 
Edmonton, Alberta throughout his lifetime. 


| am particularly indebted -to Messrs. Sam 
Goldsmith and Sam Greene who have made the 
publication of this catalogue possible by their 
benevolence. | also express to them my 
everlasting gratitude for the many kindnesses that 
they showed me during the past years. | shall 
always cherish the support of this project by Dr. 
Henry Kreisel, who served as Vice-President 
(Academic) at the University of Alberta, at the 
time of purchase and who initially suggested that | 
should study the Bension collection. 


Thanks are especially due to Mr. Bruce Peel, 
Librarian to the University of Alberta. His 
foresight in desiring to make the acquisition 
available for the Library at the University of 
Alberta will always be remembered in gratitude. | 
also wish to thank Mr. L.E.S. Gutteridge for his 
guidance in matters pertaining to the publishing 
of this work as well as for his efforts in making 
available to me works that were generally 
inaccessible. Mrs. Helen Cramer was devoted in 
her efforts to type the drafts for this volume and | 




appreciate her dedication. 


In the course of the preparation of this 
catalogue my mother, Sarah M. Aranov, went to 
her eternal reward. It is in humility that | 
memorialize her for my physical being and for the 
sacrifices she endured while | pursued my 
studies. My maternal grandfather, Reverend Zisel 
Gedalia Goodkin, a lover of humanity, taught me 
to appreciate the contributions of the diverse 
cultures that make up the landscape of mankind. 
Any abilities that | possess | owe to his pedagogic 
powers while my imperfections are my own. 


| am indebted many times over to my revered 
father-in-law, the scholarly Rabbi Shlomo Amor, 
of Tivon, Israel, for introducing me to Sephardic 
culture and for his many comments that went into 




Preface 




the preparation of this volume; also for the gift of 
his daughter, Dina, that princess of patience, who 
endured until this work was brought to comple- 
tion. Finally, | dedicate this volume to my children 
Noam, Shalhevet and Sarit Aviva and to all of 
their generation who are the products of Ash- 
kenazi and Sephardi culture. Learn to cherish 
your origins and to fuse them into something 
beautiful for God and mankind. 


| give thanks to the Almighty who helped me 
bring this work to completion.

The collector was known as Dr. Ariel Bension. 
The name Ariel was derived from the original 
given name of the collector, Judah, and the family 
name Bension was derived by him from the 
second of the two given names of his father, R. 
Joshua Sion Halevi. The original name of the col- 
lector was Judah Levi. 


Ariel Bension was born in Jerusalem in the 
year 1880. His father was the Rabbi and Mystic, 
Joshua Sion Halevi and his mother Mazal Tob, the 
daughter of R. Solomon Ezekiel Yahuda. R. 
Joshua Sion had migrated from Fez, Morocco to 
the Holy Land while he was yet a youngster. His 
ancestry dates back to the Ben Hasdai family that 
was known in Barcelona, Spain in the twelfth 
century. R. Joshua Sion was a devotee of the 
mystical group at Jerusalem known as the Holy 
Community of Beth-El. Ariel Bension informs us, 
on page 245 of his work The Zohar in Moslem and 
Christian Spain, that the Beth-El community was 
“founded by the descendants of some of the 
exiles from Spain; at first small but loosely held 
together, lacking cohesion and unity. As time 
went on, however, and under the guidance of 
devoted leaders, the group was transformed into a 
co-ordinated body possessing both authority and 
strength. Dominated by what may be called the 
categorical imperative of Ha-Ari’s teachings, the 
prayers were made with Kavanoth-inner medita- 
tion... At first it had been the custom to carry 
meditation in a deep silence—the meditation on 
a single word, sometimes lasting for fifteen 
minutes. But with the introduction of the musical 
interludes the Kavanoth began to be performed 
during the intoning of a melody that was at the 
same time suggestive of the form which the 
meditation was to take. So true are these tunes in 
searching out and expressing the emotions of 
souls dwelling on the mystic meaning of the 
prayer, that even the listener, uninitiated though 




he may be, feels himself transported into the 
realms of thought, where dwell those who 
commune with the Infinite.” This mystical com- 
munal atmosphere exerted a lasting influence on 
Bension throughout his life as is evident in his 
later literary activity. 


The collector was educated by his father in the 
academy called “Qasad-El,” which was establish- 
ed by his maternal grandfather. He was also 
educated at the institute called “Tifereth 
Jerusalem” and at “Beth-El,” Bension acquired 
a wide knowledge of Talmud, Codes, and in 
mystical studies. At the age of fifteen he wrote 
a story entitled ‘“Hanolad Be-Qedusha’—“He 
Who Was Born in Holiness,” which was published 
in a series of five instalments in the publication 
known as Ha-Yehudi, in London. 


Bension spent some time with his father’s 
relatives in Algiers before he continued on his 
journey to western Europe, where he studied at 
universities in Germany and Switzerland. He 
pursued courses in history, philosophy, literature, 
and Asiatic philology. He was granted a doctoral 
degree in philosophy and semitic languages at 
the University of Berne and then he returned to 
the Holy Land. Subsequently he married Rachel, 
the daughter of Rahamim Mizrahi. After his first 
wife’s demise he married Ida Siegler of Montreal. 
It was due to this second marriage that the 
Canada connection was established so that the 
Bension manuscripts and _ texts eventually 
became the first collection of Hebrew 
manuscripts ever to be discovered in Canada. The 
young Ariel Bension was the first Sephardi of the 
Holy Land who is known to have pursued studies 
in the universities of western Europe. Bension 
served as Rabbi to the Jewish community of 
Betulia, Serbia for one year before the advent of 
the First World War. He worked in the service of 
the Zionist Organization from the beginning of

the year 1920. Afterwards he served as an 
emissary for the Keren Ha-Yesod until the end of 
his life. He was especially active in this capacity in 
the Sephardic communities of Iraq, India, In- 
do-China, North Africa, Spain, Portugal, South 
America, and Egypt among other communities. 
He was successful in acquiring an ideological and 
financial commitment for the future building of 
the Land of Israel from the Jewish members of the 
aforementioned communities. Bension was also 
successful in gaining sympathy and esteem for 
the nationhood of Israel and for the Zionist cause 
from figures of prominence in the world political 
arena and from men of letters in many of the 
countries which he visited. The Indian poet 
Tagore was numbered among those sym- 
pathizers influenced by Bension. 


Ariel Bension was also active on behalf of the 
Jewish Sephardic Organization in his travels 
throughout the diaspora. He co-ordinated the 
Sephardic organization’s efforts together with 
those of other Jewish organizations that worked 
for the national aspirations of the Jewish people. 
Bension commenced these activities at the as- 
sembly of the Eleventh Zionist Congress which 
was held in Vienna. On that occasion he was 
chosen as the honorary secretary of the Execu- 
tive that was given the task of assembling an inter- 
national conference which would bring the 
Jewish nationalistic idea to reality. He partic- 
ipated in the Fifteenth Zionist Congress as a 
representative of the Jews of Argentina. Between 
his travels he engaged in communal activities in 
the Holy Land. Bension participated in the 
founding of the Rabbinic Academy “Mahzikei Ha- 
Torah,” in Jerusalem. Bension also was responsi- 
ble for the redemption of land in Netanya, Israel. 
The Bension quarter of the town was named for 
him. 


Ariel Bension published articles of a scholarly 




Xiv 




nature in publications such as Hasfirah, Ha-Or, 
Ha-Herut, and Ha-Olam, in his student days and 
thereafter, in Hebrew, German, and English. 
Special attention was paid to his article on the 
mysticism of Maeterlinck, in the publication 
Ha-Olam, in 1914. He also wrote on “The Seph- 
ardi Hassidism in the Land of Israel,” “On the 
question of the Arabs and the Jews,” which was 
written in English, “An Essay on Yemen,” and 
“Echoes of the Inquisition” among other articles. 


Bension’s books include Hatunat Ha-Mavet— 
Marriage with Death, which appeared in Hebrew 
and German and served as an introduction to his 
work “Raphael,” which remained unpublished. He 
also wrote the following books which were 
published, Sar Shalom Sharabi, in Hebrew and in 
English, and The Zohar in Moslem and Christian 
Spain, in English, a portion of which was 
produced in Hebrew, and for which the author 
was elected as a fellow of the “Real Academia de 
la Historia” of Madrid. This last work was 
originally published in London in 1932, and 
reprinted by the Sepher-Hermon Press Inc., New 
York in 1974. Ariel Bension is also mentioned in 
Gershom Scholem’s Major Trends in Jewish 
Mysticism. The scholarly credentials of the col- 
lector of our manuscripts and texts, as well as 
his eclectic interests coupled with his extensive 
travel in behalf of Sephardic Jewry, are sufficient 
in themselves for us to acknowledge that this 
private collection is indeed an extraordinary find 
and that its Sephardic character is manifest. His 
Moroccan ancestry from his father’s side of the 
family also supports the centrality of Moroccan 
material in the collection. It seems evident that we 
possess only a portion of this scholar’s collection 
of manuscripts and texts. It is indeed a tragedy 
that he passed on, in Paris, on the ninth of 
November 1932, at the age of fifty-two. Had he 
been granted a longer life his literary productivity 




would have been even more prolific. Rabbi Dr. 
Ariel Bension was survived by his daughters from 
his first wife, namely Miriam, the wife of Simon 
Sassoon, and Hannah, the wife of Abraham 
Kohen. It is our hope that this volume will again 




An appreciation 




bring the collector, scholar, rabbi, mystic, and 
indefatigable worker for the cause of Zion, to the 
attention of the reading public. We remain 
indebted to him for his collection.

The historical and political background 


The Bension Manuscripts and Texts of the Harry 
R. Cohen Memorial Collection have been desig- 
nated as Sephardic. An explanation of the term 
“Sephardic,” will help the reader comprehend 
the character of the entire collection. The term 
“Sephardic” has generally referred to those Jews 
who hailed from the Iberian peninsula, which 
includes Spain and Portugal, and all countries 
surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, and who 
came under the influence of the traditions of the 
Babylonian rabbinic leaders known as “Geonim” 
during the period of Mohammedan rule of these 
areas. In our age the term “Sephardic” has been 
broadly applied to most Jews hailing from Afro- 
Asian countries. The contemporary application of 
the term “Sephardic” to all Afro-Asian Jews is not 
in the purview of the collection. The Bension 
collection is primarily concerned with the 
literature and personalities of descendants of 
Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before the 
expulsion of 1492, and of Jews who were 
indigenous to North Africa. 


The Mohammedan influence was dominant 
throughout southern Europe and the Maghreb 
from the eighth century until the thirteenth 
century. During this period there was much 
commercial and cultural interaction between the 
populations of Iberia and North Africa. This was 
especially true of the cultural atmosphere that 
pervaded the Jewish communities of both areas. 
This glorious period in Jewish history is 
characterized as the Golden Age of Spanish 
Jewry. Major strides were made in the fields of 
Jewish philology, lexicography, liturgy, poetry, 
philosophy, rabbinic law, and mysticism. 


Many of the illustrious teachers of the Jewish 
people appeared in this period on both sides of 
the Strait of Gibraltar. Among them were Bible 
commentators such as the members of the Ibn 




Ezra family; grammarians such as Rabbi Judah 
ibn Kuraish of Tahert, Rabbi Dunash ben Labrat 
of Fez, Rabbi Judah Hayudj of Fez, and Rabbi 
Menahem ben Saruk of Tortosa, Spain; poet- 
philosophers such as Bahya ibn Pakuda, 
Solomon ibn Gabirol, and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi; 
and then there were the legal interpreters and 
codifiers such as Rabbi Isaac Alfasi of Fez, Rabbi 
Moses ben Maimon known as Maimonides, Rabbi 
Moses ben Nahman known as Nahmanides, and 
Rabbi Solomon ben Adret of Spain. Often, as was 
the case in the Middle Ages, each scholar was a 
master in several fields of endeavor. Thus 
Maimonides was a philosopher and an eminent 
jurist, while his income was derived from practice 
of the medical profession. Nahmanides was an 
astute commentator of the Bible while he was also 
known as an outstanding legal commentator and 
leader of a major mystical school in Gerona, 
Spain. 


Moorish rulers of Spain encouraged a liberal 
atmosphere in the intellectual exchange of ideas 
and served as patrons of the arts and sciences of 
their day. In fact, the “lingua franca” of the 
scholarly world from the tenth through the 
thirteenth centuries was the Arabic language. The 
master works of such luminaries as Saadya Gaon, 
Bahya ibn Pakuda, Maimonides, and other Jewish 
writers, which originally appeared in Arabic, had 
to be translated into Hebrew in order that they 
could be accessible to a wider reading public in 
the thirteenth century. 


The adjoining provinces of Languedoc and 
Provence, the home of Provengal Jewry in 
southeastern France, served as adjacent allies to 
Spanish Jewry in the pursuit of Jewish culture. 
This district in southern France, whose in- 
habitants were the happiest of those under 
Christian rule in Europe, was also a bridge 
between the intellectual Jewish currents of

Introduction 




Historical background 




northern and southern Europe. The Provence, 
blessed with a perpetual spring season, was the 
haven of a multitude of Jewish scholars who 
established schools where philosophical texts 
were translated into Hebrew in such centers as 
Beaucaire and Narbonne. Prominent among 
Provengal scholars were members of the Tibbon 
family who were translators of philosophical 
texts, the Kimhi family of grammarians and Bible 
commentators, the philosopher-translator Shem 
Tob ibn Palgera, and the Talmudic commentators 
Rabbi Abraham b. David of Posquieres and Rabbi 
Zerahia Halevi. 


The Provence was the major battleground in 
the “Hundred Years’ War” of culture that ensued 
between the liberal religious pro-philosophical 
group referred to as the Maimunists (Jewish 
Rationalists), and the conservative, religious anti- 
philosophical anti-Maimunists. The philosophical 
camp viewed the study of philosophy as a natural 
ally to traditional Jewish study and piety while the 
anti-Maimonidean camp viewed philosophical 
study as a foreign element that was inimical to the 
preservation of traditional Jewish study and 
values. The battles which began after the death of 
Maimonides, in 1204, were not resolved because 
the Jews were expelled from the Provence and all 
of France in 1306. Many of those who were 
expelled made their way to Spain and North 
Africa. 


At the close of the thirteenth century a new 
influx of scholars from northern Europe, which 
was under Christian influence, began to converge 
on the cultural centers of Spain. Some were 
driven from the Rhineland by the Rindfleish 
massacres of 1298, which uprooted over a 
hundred Jewish communities. In 1290, the sixteen 
thousand Jews of England were the first of their 
people on the European continent to be the 
victims of an official edict of expulsion. Most of 




2 




them made their way to northern France. Every 
possible calumny that could be charged against 
the Jews was perpetrated in the thirteenth century 
under the crusading Pope Innocent III, such as 
the ritual blood libel. Jews were made to wear 
special badges, marking them as pariahs in 
Christian society. It is true that occasionally anti- 
Papist Christian rulers favored the Jews. Subse- 
quently Jews came to Andalusia from northern 
France where they had been victimized by the 
pogroms that were current during the period of 
the Crusades. These newcomers from the north 
who came to Spain were known as Ashkenazim. 
An overwhelming number of northerners moved 
eastwards to the provinces of Bohemia, Moravia, 
and Silesia in central Europe and eventually 
penetrated eastern Europe. The theory is 
prevalent that those who are descended from 
most east European Jews are the children of the 
early Jewish settlers of the Rhineland and 
northern France. 


The Ashkenazi traditions of the northern 
Europeans who came to Spain were markedly 
different from those of the Sephardim of the 
Iberian Peninsula. The origins for Ashkenazi 
traditions, excluding those practices that were 
added during the period of domicile in northern 
Europe, have been traced to the Holy Land. 
During the period after the destruction of the 
Second Temple in 70 C.E. many Jews journeyed 
to Italy. After living in Italian communities for 
hundreds of years the Jews were invited by 
Christian noblemen of northern Europe during 
the tenth century, to settle in northern France and 
the Rhineland and to help establish centers of 




‘trade. More often than not they migrated in the 




farm of nuclear communities. Thus, the 
Ashkenazi traditions are traced to Israel while the 
Sephardi traditions are traced to the great 
Talmudic academies of Sura and Pumbedita in 




Babylonia, today known as Iraq. 


Despite the differences in traditions, the 
Hebrew language served as a common bond 
between Jews throughout Europe. The following 
incident will demonstrate that indeed this was the 
case. When Rabbi Asher b. Yehiel, the famous 
student of Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, arrived in 
Toledo, Spain at the beginning of the fourteenth 
century, he was immediately accepted as a 
rabbinic leader. There he led a Talmudic academy 
and delivered his lectures in the Hebrew language 
which was comprehensible to all his students. We 
can assume that the overwhelming number of 
students were Sephardim. Rabbi Asher was 
representative of those Ashkenazi scholars who 
entered the Sephardic world because of expul- 
sion from northern Europe. 


At this point in our cultural travelogue the 
historical significance of the Bension Sephardic 
Manuscripts and Texts begins to become ap- 
parent. The collection contains a manuscript 
volume of the Responsa of the aforementioned 
Rabbi Asher b. Yehiel. Responsa are the answers 
that a rabbinic scholar gives to Jewish legal 
questions that have been addressed to him by 
individuals, communities, or other rabbinic 
scholars who may be seeking his guidance. 


Although Rabbi Asher was educated in the 
Rhineland by Ashkenazi masters, he became the 
adopted teacher of the Sephardim in Toledo, 
Spain. He served as a vital cultural link between 
the Talmudical traditions of the Franco-German 
schools of the Tosaphists, those who added their 
comments to the Talmudic texts from the twelfth 
until the fourteenth centuries, and the Talmudical 
academies in Spain. It appears that his principles 
of Talmudic interpretation were compatible with 
those of the Sephardim. The collection contains 
an early manuscript volume of the Responsa of 
Rabbi Solomon ibn Adret of Barcelona, who was 




Historical background 




acknowledged as the greatest halakhic authority 
in Spain in the early part of the fourteenth cen- 
tury, and a comtemporary of Rabbi Asher b. 
Yehiel. The great Sephardi codifier of the six- 
teenth century was Rabbi Joseph Caro. He stated 
that in all his halakhic decisions he was guided by 
three luminaries of Jewish law, namely, Rabbi 
Isaac Alfasi, Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, and Rabbi 
Asher b. Yehiel. Thus we note that Rabbi Asher’s 
absorption into the spectrum of Sephardic culture 
was complete. 


Rabbi Asher’s son, Rabbi Jacob, was 
representative of tne first generation of children 
of Ashkenazi parents from northern Europe who 
came to settle in Spain, and who were subse- 
quently influenced by the teachings of Spanish 
Jewry. Rabbi Jacob Bal Ha-Turim, as he was 
called because of his codification of Jewish law in 
four books called Rows-“Turim,” cites the rulings 
of the Sephardic rabbis such as Rabbi Solomon 
ibn Adret side by side with the rulings of his father, 
Rabbi Asher, and other northern European 
Ashkenazi Talmudic authorities. The collection 
contains a late fifteenth century printed edition 
of Rabbi Jacob’s “Tur” Shulhan Arukh—Code 
of Jewish Law. Rabbi Jacob passed on in 1340. 
A famous halakhic work on Jewish liturgy which 
was produced by his contemporary, Rabbi David 
Abudarham, is also included in the collection in 
a printed edition of the late fifteenth century. 


We mentioned earlier that the Jews of France 
were expelled in 1306. On several occasions they 
were invited to return to France and shortly 
thereafter they were again expelled. A similar 
opportunity was offered to the Jews by the 
German principalities. However, a more dis- 
astrous fate was to greet the Jews in German 
lands than even that visited upon them during 
the Rindfleish persecutions. A band of ruffians 
massacred many Jewish communities in the

Historical background 




Armlieder persecution of 1336-1338. In the next 
decade the Black Death plague was blamed upon 
the Jews who, according to rumor, were acting in 
consort with the Moslems to poison the wells of 
Christian Europe. The fourteenth century has 
been regarded as the blackest in the history of 
northern European Jewry. 


Unlike their co-religionists of northern Europe 
the Jews of the Iberian peninsula passed the 
fourteenth century in relative tranquility. 
However, suddenly the sky fell in on Spanish 
Jewry in 1391. We will briefly outline the events 
that led to the debacle of 1391 which did not reach 
its climax for the Jews of Spain until the issuance 
of the edict of expulsion in 1492, and for the Jews 
of Portugal in the year 1497. 


While the Mohammedans controlled Spain for 
about three centuries, they did not exercise any 
uniform control, which was characteristic of the 
political history of this period. They were divided 
into a number of smaller states perpetually 
quarreling amongst themselves. The _ ruling 
Almoravid dynasty was toppled by the fanatical 
Almohads (both were of Berber origin) of North 
Africa in the middle of the twelfth century and this 
contributed to a further weakening of the political 
hold of Islam in Iberia. The Almohads’ invasion 
caused repercussions in the Jewish communities. 
Maimonides left Spain for North Africa and the 
Kimhi family moved from Spain to the Provence. 
We can conclude that other Jews also left Spain at 
this time. The Christians who held some parts of 
northern Spain seized the opportunity to go on 
the offensive which became known as the 
Reconquista, in the first decade of the thirteenth 
century. 


By the second decade of the thirteenth century 
only the kingdom of Granada was under Moorish 
control. The majority of Jews who lived in Aragon, 
Castile, Leon, Portugal, and Navarre were now 




4 




under Christian domination and they faced the 
full brunt of anti-Jewish legislation and the 
prejudices that Christians promulgated and 
perpetuated wherever they ruled in Europe. In this 
age of turmoil it became increasingly difficult for 
rulers to allow for a climate of free intellectual 
exchanges. The splendor of the golden age of 
Spanish Jewry began to dim. 


The economic factor of the growth of a 
merchant class in the cities became a new force 
for the rulers to contend with. Christian 
merchants viewed Jewish merchants and 
tradesmen as competitors and the former sought 
favored status at the expense of the Jews. 
Occasionally the kings sought the support of the 
townspeople as a check against the nobility. 
Furthermore, the kings used the Jews as tax 
farmers and treasurers to secure funds that were 
needed by them to live opulently and to conduct 
military campaigns. This gave the Christian 
element further reason for disliking the Jews. The 
convergence of all these factors served to cause 
the first outbreaks against the Jews in 1391. 
Ferrand Martinez, the father confessor to the 
Queen-Mother of young King Henry VII, began to 
stir up mobs against the Jews from city to city. 
The Jewish communities of Seville, Cordoba, and 
Toledo, amongst others, were almost annihilated. 
Many individuals were given the choice between 
baptism or death. A significant number chose 
baptism hoping thereby to live as Jews in secret 
while protecting their positions which had been 
secured over hundreds of years of settlement. 
While some chose martyrdom rather than to 
submit to baptism, others were able to flee to 
North Africa. Some Jews who arrived in the 
Maghreb had already lived as Christians. Upon 
their arrival, Rabbinic tribunals sought methods 
by which the unfortunates could be restored to 
their people. Rabbi Isaac bar Sheshet and Rabbi 




Simeon b. Zemah Duran, of Algiers were among 
those rabbis who dealt with this problem at the 
end of the fourteenth century. 


The New Christians were a source of great 
disturbance as they rose in privilege and in 
importance. Thus, the Inquisition was instituted 
to ferret out those who were regarded as insincere 
Christians. In order to facilitate their work the 
Christian clergy requested the rulers to remove 
Jews and Mohammedans from the kingdom. The 
edict of expulsion issued in Spain in 1492, forced 
the Jews to leave their wealth behind while they 
had to seek domicile in new lands. Jewish 
notables interceded with Ferdinand and Isabella, 
but to no avail. 


Isaac Abrabanel, an advisor to the rulers of 
Spain and Portugal, left for Italy upon expulsion. 
While Italy was more favorably disposed to the 
Jews than the other western European powers 
heretofore mentioned, the various duchies and 
the Papal States subsequently instituted in- 
quisitions and expulsions. One of the reasons that 
Jewish notables left for Italy as a place of refuge 
was that the Italian princes required their finan- 
cial expertise. Many others turned to the rapidly 
expanding Turkish empire. Large Sephardic 
communities were established by the Meg6ra- 
shim—those expelled were thus designated— 
in Salonika and Constantinople. Eventually some 
used this route as a stepping stone to settlement 
in the Holy Land. 


A major portion of over 150,000 Jewish 
emigrés made their way to the shores of North 
Africa. Entire communities of the Megérashim 
transplanted themselves to Fez, Debdou, Meknés, 
Tangiers, Tetuan, Salé, Safi, Tunis, Algiers, 
Tripoli, and a host of other communities along the 
shores of the Maghreb. Often ransom had to be 
paid for the Jews who were carried across the 
Strait of Gibraltar when their vessels were 




Historical background 




accosted by pirates who abounded in those 
waters. While some Muslim communities 
perpetrated rape and pillage against these 
unfortunates when they were thrust upon their 
shores, the overwhelming number of North 
African communities were very happy to receive 
these new settlers. It should be noted that asevere 
famine prevailed in Morocco in 1492. The Sultans 
looked upon these newcomers as a constructive 
adjunct to the native Jewish population. The 
economic and political sophistication of the 
industrious newcomers was looked upon as a real 
asset to the future development of North Africa. 


While admittedly there were some marked 
differences in outlook between the Megérashim 
and the native Jewish population known as 
Toshavim, there were also similarities. The Jews 
of Spain and North Africa shared many religious 
traditions drawn from a common Sephardic 
heritage that was nurtured in a Moslem environ- 
ment in Spain and in the Maghreb. Students from 
North Africa frequented the rabbinic academies 
of Spain and liaison was established between 
Jewish families on both sides of the Strait of 
Gibraltar. It was natural for Spanish Jewry to flee 
to a place like Morocco because of the 
geographic proximity and a common sharing of 
traditions. 


In the following years Castilian Jewry did 
succeed, in great measure, in preserving the 
distinct customs and halakhic traditions that they 
brought with them from Spain by establishing 
their own synagogues and by living in accordance 
with their traditions. In fact, in many communal 
matters the Castilians were able to win over the 
native born North African Jews to their ways of 
thinking and practices. In other matters a friction 
continued to persist between both Jewish groups. 


A new spirit of cultural and commercial 
rejuvenation was infused into the indigenous 




5 




Historical background 




Jewish communities by the newcomers. While we 
may be certain that the emigrés from Spain could 
not take their gold and silver with them they were 
able to transport their spiritual treasures, their 
scholars, and their literature. This was especially 
the case in the area of philosophical literature. 
While the philosophical traditions of Aristotle and 
the Neo-Platonic school had finally received wide 
acceptance on the European continent at the end 
of the thirteenth century by Jewish and Christian 
scholastic circles, they were not popularized in 
North Africa, where a more conservative religious 
atmosphere prevailed. It remained for the 
Megorashim to disseminate philosophical texts 
and studies. Among the manuscripts in the 
Bension collection there is acopy of Maimonides’ 
“Moreh’—Guide of the Perplexed; also there are 
two manuscripts of aphoristic literature which 
were popularized by philosophic writers. 


While many refugees settled in North Africa, 
not all remained there. In the early sixteenth 
century, we find the Maghreb becoming a way 
station to the Holy Land. One of the many 
celebrated personalities who came to Fez and 
subsequently journeyed to Palestine was Rabbi 
Jacob Berab. He studied in Spain with the famous 
Rabbi Isaac Aboab who was the author of the 
popular homiletic work Menorat ha-Ma’or. In the 
collection there is an early printed edition of this 
work. Rabbi Berab sought refuge at Tlemcen and 
later he became rabbi at Fez. After disseminating 
Torah learning in Morocco for a number of years 
he arrived in Safed in 1534. Rabbi Jacob Berab 
was also regarded as a teacher of Rabbi Joseph 
Caro, the celebrated author of the Shulhan 
Arukh—Code of Jewish Law. Other famous 
scholars who journeyed from Spain to Morocco 
and then eastward at this time were Abraham 
Zacuto and Rabbi David ibn Abi Zimra; the latter 
finally settled in Egypt.

We would be guilty of presenting an un- 
balanced historical picture if we viewed the 
conditions under which the Jews in the Maghreb 
lived as having been appreciably more satisfac- 
tory than the conditions of their settlement in 
Spain until the end of the fifteenth century. Two 
factors which undoubtedly contributed to the 
decision of the family of Maimonides to leave 
Cordoba for Fez in North Africa in c. 1150 was the 
religious policy of the ascendant Almohad 
movement, which did not tolerate the existence of . 
non-Muslims and discouraged the study of 
philosophy as inimical to the true interests of 
Islam. During the reign of Abu Ya’Qub Yusuf 
(1165-84) the resurgence of Almohad fanaticism 
in Fez resulted in a new wave of forced conver- 
sions. Those who refused to be converted were 
put to death. At this time Maimonides left Fez for 
the Middle East. It is apparent that many families 
departed Morocco for Spain and the Provence 
when conditions became unbearable. Members 
of the ibn Danan family are representative of 
those Moroccan Jews who crisscrossed the Strait 
of Gibraltar as the exigencies of the times no 
doubt required. A further deterioration in the con- 
dition of Moroccan Jewry took place during the 
reign of al-Mansur (1184-1199) when he imposed 
upon the Jews, whether or not they were 
converted, the wearing of a distinctive badge 
called the Shikla because he questioned their 
sincerity to live by the rule of Islam. During the 
reign of al-Ma’mun (1227-1232) the Jews were 
permitted domicile in Morocco. However, shortly 
after, they were massacred at Marrakesh. Only 
when the Merivid dynasty replaced the Almohads 
in 1269 did Jews come to settle in Morocco in 
appreciable numbers. During the reign of the 
Almohads Jews sought refuge in the Christian 
territories of southern Europe and in the East. The 
Jews were favorably received by Christian rulers 




in northern Spain, in the territories of Aragon, 
Catalonia, and in Majorca. 


The Jews of Morocco enjoyed relatively good 
conditions during the reign of the Merinid Sultans 
from 1269 to 1438. The Jewish ambassadors of 
the Christian kings of Spain were well received 
and native Jews were taken into the service of the 
sultans. The Moroccan Jews played a prominent 
role in the Sahara gold trade and in the exchanges 
with Christian countries. An indication of the 
tranquility of this period was the appearance of a 
Moroccan Jewish philosopher Judah ben Nissim 
ibn Malka who was active in the second half of the 
fourteenth century. 


In the fifteenth century, as the Merinid dynasty 
began its decline, the Jews began to suffer. For 
the first time in Moroccan history the institution of 
what European Jewry was to refer to as a“‘ghetto” 
was introduced to the Jews of Fez, as they were 
enclosed in the walls of the mellah, in 1438. In the 
political upheaval that marked the fall of the 
Merinid dynasty, in 1465, many Jews were 
murdered or forcibly converted. Some families 
fled to Spain only to return to Morocco a 
generation later because of the general expulsion 
of Spanish Jewry. When Muhammad al-Shaykh 
al-Wattasi came to power in 1471, he permitted 
the Jews who were forcibly converted to return to 
Judaism. He was the founder of the Wattasid 
dynasty that ruled the territories around Fez and 
he was the ruler who welcomed those who were 
subsequently expelled from Spain and Portugal. 


The Portuguese began capturing port cities 
along the North African coast in 1415 with their 
taking of Ceuta. By the beginning of the sixteenth 
century Portugal occupied part of the Moroccan 
coast on the Atlantic Ocean, while Spain con- 
quered cities off the Moroccan coast on the 
Mediterranean at the end of the first decade of the 
sixteenth century. Surprisingly, the Portuguese 




Historical background 




employed the Jews who were expelled from their 
lands as negotiators and political emissaries to 
the Muslim rulers. Other Jews who lived under the 
Wattasids of Fez and the sharifs of Marrakesh 
were the principal negotiators of the peace 
settlements between the Muslims and the Por- 
tuguese. Even more astonishing was the fact that 
Spanish and Portuguese Jewish exiles were 
engaged by the Moroccan rulers as ambassadors 
to the courts of Iberia. These Jews apparently 
prevailed upon a number of their co-religionists 
who had earlier publicly opted out of Judaism 
while remaining Jews in secret in order to remain 
as New Christians in Spain and Portugal, to settle 
in Morocco where they could return to Judaism. 


The New Christians who were known by a 
variety of appellations such as Morranos, Conver- 
sos, Anusim, and Chuetas came to Morocco in the 
sixteenth century from the Iberian Peninsula, the 
Azores, and the Canary Islands, and some may 
even have returned from the Americas. Centers 
for reconversion to Judaism were established in 
the major cities of Morocco. 


The first Sherifian dynasty known as the Sa‘dis 
ascended the throne of Morocco by conquering 
Marrakesh in 1525 and Fez in 1549. The Sa’dis 
defeated the Portuguese army in 1578 and from 
that time Portuguese influence began to decline 
in North Africa. The Netherlands became the hub 
of commerce in northern Europe and the city 
states of Italy played that role on the Mediterra- 
nean. Moroccan Jewry served the Sa’di dynasty in 
both centers of the commercial world. Samuel 
Pallache, a Jew, arrived in the Netherlands and 
signed the first alliance pact between Morocco 
and Christian Holland. 




The cultural background 
as revealed in the manuscripts 
Among the masters of mystical literature in Spain 




ri 




Cultural background 




during the thirteenth century were Nahmanides 
and his contemporaries, Abraham Abulafia, 
Shem-Tob ibn Gaon, Joseph Gikatilla, Moses de 
Leon, and Nahmanides’ student, Rabbi Solomon 
ibn Adret. This coterie of scholars represented 
the Jewish esoteric tradition which stood in 
opposition to the Maimonidean rational philo- 
sophical system and its adherents. In the Col- 
lection there is a fragment of a manuscript of the 
classical commentary of Nahmanides on the 
Decalogue Ms. 301. The author presented his 
rational insights alongside his mystical interpre- 
tations of the biblical texts. 


The Zohar, Book of Splendor, was traditionally 
associated with the mystical teachings of Rabbi 
Simeon Bar Y ohai of the second century. This text 
continues to be part of the trilogy that is venerated 
by Moroccan Jewry: namely the Bible, Talmud, 
and Zohar. The Zohar and its associated literature 
were brought from Spain to Morocco. The forced 
geographic movement of thousands of Jews from 
Spain at the end of the fifteenth century began to 
spawn a number of dynamic systems and 
movements in Judaism. Such a revolution took 
place in Jewish Mysticism, but it did not achieve 
its full expression until the appearance of Rabbi 
Isaac Luria in the mystical community of Safed, in 
the Holy Land, after the second half of the 
sixteenth century. His system became known as 
Ari Kabbalism or Lurianic Kabbalism. 


The dynamic concepts of spiritual exile and 
redemption of the soul took on new dimensions 
because of the recent mass physical exile that the 
Jews had to endure under the Spanish expulsion. 
An age of suffering was considered preamble to 
the final redemption. The chief exponent and 
literary figure of Lurianic Kabbala was Rabbi 
Hayyim Vital who had lived in North Africa and 
eventually sat at the Ari’s feet in Safed. Rabbi 
Hayyim Vital was among the unwitting popu- 




8 




larizers who made Kabbalism go public. In 
previous centuries only the select initiates could 
delve into this esoteric wisdom. The need for 
Tikkun—self improvement—was so urgent and 
the time so propitious, that the secrets had to be 
made available to every Jew. It was a matter 
greater than physical survival; it was a matter of 
salvation. The collection contains a manuscript 
copy of Hayyim Vital’s classical work called Etz 
Hayyim—the Tree of Life. 


The social phenomenon that accompanied the 
rampant mystical manifestations was the 
Messianic movement. The communities of North 
Africa were vulnerable to the Messianic tides that 
swept Europe during the days of Shabbetai Zevi. 
Long after the Messianic fervor had subsided on 
the European continent its embers were kept 
burning by its devotees in the Maghreb. Un- 
doubtedly the mystical literature of Spain and the 
new esoteric expression of Lurianic Kabbalism 
had fired the imagination of the Jewish masses. 
Among several of the documents in the Bension 
Collection that contain mystical elements, the 
manuscript numbered 46 in the “Yalkut Roiim” 
volume is of special interest. The author of this 
text uses the biblical passage “Blot out the 
memory of Amalek” (Deut. 25:19) to demonstrate 
his view that the year 1688 is significant for 
Messianic events. The Holy Name of God is 
computated together with the Hebrew terms 
“Timhe” and “Zekhr’” and the term “Yimlokh”—He 
will reign. The implication is that the enemies of 
Israel will be blotted out and God will manifest His 
glory in the year 1688. 


The tradition that Elijah the prophet revealed 
himself to saintly scholars is noted in Ms.85. 
Examples of mystical elements that appear in 
poems and prayers are found in the collection. A 
poem by R. Jacob Ibn Zur, on the Ten Sephirot 
and the Holy Names of God, appears in Ms. 84. 




A mystical prayer for protection when travelling in 
a dangerous area under siege is recorded in 
Ms.177. \t reads as follows: “May the names of 
Sandalphon and Uriel strive to save me from the 
enemy and from those who lie in wait forme on my 
journey.” Another prayer, which is supplicatory in 
nature and which possesses mystical elements, 
appears in Ms.241. After mentioning the merit of 
the scholars, saints, matriarchs, and patriarchs, 
the author adds “for the sake of the Ofanim and 
Seraphim, Hashmalim, Tarshishim and the Holy 
Hayydt, may you separate from me, your servant, 
the son of your maidservant, all those who would 
despise me and harm me.” 


A new figure appeared in the Maghreb who 
was responsible for the dissemination of the new 
mystical studies. He soon became an institution; 
he was cailed the Haham Kollel. He was a rabbi 
well versed in Kabbala, who journeyed forth as an 
emissary from the Kabbalistic centers of Safed, 
Tiberias, and Jerusalem to collect donations for 
their maintenance. He lectured on mystical 
themes, he provided the latest news that he 
amassed during his travels, he played an impor- 
tant role in stimulating the Hebrew book trade, 
and he brought glowing reports about the 
religious centers in the Holy Land, thus keeping 
the Messianic hope alive in the far flung com- 
munities. 


The Haham Kollel was a vital force for in- 
jecting Zionistic fervor into Moroccan Jewry. This 
Zionism, which was based more on religious than 
on secular motives, prepared the Moroccans 
psychologically for mass migration to Israel. 
Unlike the European Jews who had experienceda 
major holocaust, the stimulus for North African 
Jewish aliyah was based on Messianic yearnings. 


If a Haham Kollel died during his journeying 
he would be regarded as a saint and his burial site 
would become a place for religious pilgrimage. 




Cultural background 




These pilgrimages to the graves of the saints 
throughout Morocco as well as the daily recitals 
of Zohar were, in some communities, regarded as 
ways to ward off the evil forces and demons 
known as Jinns, to restore health, and to help the 
Moroccan meet the daily adversities of mellah 
existence. Talismans and amulets were also 
popular as protection from the “evil eye.” The text 
of an amulet which was intended to protect one 
from plagues appears pasted on to Ms.18. Similar 
practices won wide-spread appeal among large 
segments of east European Jewry until the advent 
of the twentieth century. Practical Kabbala was 
more pronounced, while the theoretical studies of 
speculative mysticism, which characterized the 
Spanish schools of Kabbala, were being pursued 
with zeal because of the influence of the new 
school of Lurianic Kabbala. In Ms.269, R. Raphael 
Moses Elbaz asks R. Solomon Ibn Zur to extend 
aid to R. Mordecai Elbaz. Among the latter’s 
virtues it is noted that he “devotes himself to 
Torah study constantly and especially to the 
study of Zohar.” In Ms.220, R. Menahem Serero 
informs R. Jacob Ibn Zur that R. Habib Toledano 
is sending R. Jacob a copy of a mystical work 
called Sefer Zerubbabel. R. Menahem says that he 
would appreciate R. Jacob’s comments after he 
has read the work. R. Menahem notes that this 
work was composed by the author of Pirkei 
Haikhalét, the Talmudic master R. Ishmael 
Kohen-Gadél. 


A providential aid to the perpetuation of 
Jewish literature at the time of the expulsion was 
the invention of printing. A golden age of Hebrew 
printing was attained in Italy in the first half of the 
sixteenth century, thanks to the efforts of the 
Soncino family, Samuel Latif, and Samuel 
Zarefati. Non-Jewish printers in Italy, such as 
Daniel Bomberg, engaged Jewish scholars to aid 
in choosing the best of the available manuscripts 




9 




Cultural background 




as the basis for the printed text. Turkey, in 
Constantinople and Salonika, took second place 
in the Hebrew printing field after Italy. In Portugal, 
Eliezer Toledano had published Hebraic and 
rabbinic works before the edict of expulsion. 
The art of printing was brought to North Africa 
by the Spanish and Portuguese emigrés. The 
main location for the publishing of Hebrew books 
in Morocco was at Fez during the second decade 
of the sixteenth century. A Hebrew printing 
establishment was founded at Tunis in the third 
quarter of the eighteenth century and at Oran, 
Algiers in the middle of the nineteenth century. It 
was not until the end of the first quarter of the 
seventeenth century that Hebrew books were 
published at Amsterdam. The early printed works 
of the Bension collection that have been identified 
came from Ferrara, Lisbon, and Amsterdam. 
It is perhaps understandable why the works of 
Jewish scholars in Morocco were published in 
Amsterdam. They obviously had contacted the 
Sephardim who were prominent in the publishing 
industry in the Jewish community in Amsterdam. 
Among the leaders in the Hebrew printing field in 
Amsterdam was Manasseh Ben Israel. The 
principal centers of Hebrew publishing moved 
from southern Europe to central and eastern 
Europe by the middle of the eighteenth century. 
Another intellectual “spin-off” resulting from 
the Spanish expulsion was the development of an 
historical sensitivity as Sephardic scholars of the 
post-expulsion period began to write chronicles 
about the unfortunate events they had experienc- 
ed as eye witnesses. These scholars analyzed the 
calamitous events which had brought down the 
curtain ona thousand years or more of domicile in 
Spain. They memorialized the martyrs and left a 
record of the accomplishments of their co- 
religionists of earlier periods until their own time 
for posterity. Among these historians were 




10 




Abraham Zacuto, who wrote the Sefer Yuhasin 
which listed those personalities who brought 
glory to Spanish Jewry; Yehudah Ibn Verga who 
moralized about the reasons for the calamity in 
his work Shevet Yehudah; and the work Emek ha- 
Bakha, ‘Valley of Weeping,’ which was composed 
by Joseph Ha-Kohen. 


The historical method of the Sephardim was 
perpetuated and given greater depth of expres- 
sion by Moroccan Jewry. The repeated attacks 
upon the mellahs gave impetus to record the 
events that led to the martyrdom of co-religionists 
and the pillage of synagogues. The instability of 
the political situation in Morocco during the years 
1640-1680 had its repercussions in the misfor- 
tunes that befell the Jewish communities. At Fez, 
Bu-Begir, acting in behalf of the ruler who was a 
religious fanatic, ordered the complete destruc- 
tion of all synagogues and schools of the Jews of 
that city. Among the synagogues that were 
destroyed are the following: the synagogue of the 
Meg6rashim, the Atazi synagogue, and the 
synagogue of R. Isaac Abirgil, as well as the syn- 
agogue of the Toshavim. Only two were spared, 
the synagogues named after R. Saadya Rabuh 
and R. Jacob Roti. The same policy was promul- 
gated in Tetuan among other communities. 


One historical-legal document in the collec- 
tion, Ms.43, gives an account of the pillage of the 
synagogue of the Toshavim in the mellah of Fez, 
in the year 1647. R. Isaac Sarfati was instrumental 
in preventing the complete destruction of the 
synagogue by paying a ransom to the attackers. 
The document is signed by the leaders of the 
Jewish community since it involved the sale of 
synagogue ritual vestments which were purchas- 
ed by R. Isaac Sarfati. The latter served as the 
Nagid—political leader of the Jewish community 
of Fez—during the middle of the seventeenth 
century. The leading religious figure of this period 




was R. Saadya ibn Danan who supported the 
efforts of the aforementioned R. Isaac in im- 
plementing communal legislation against those 
who informed on the Jewish community to the 
governmental authorities. Another figure of this 
period (c. 1649) who appears in Mss.141 and 144 
is R. Ezra di Paridosh, who was a celebrated 
scribe gifted in the use of metaphor. His signature 
appears on two dowries composed at Marrakesh 
in 1649. 


Other personalities of this period who appear 
in Mss. 194 and 199 are the rabbis of Tetuan, 
Hananiah Arubash, Jacob Halevi, and Isaac 
Abudarham. R. Immanuel b. Menahem Serero (c. 
1610-1680) of Fez, who was empowered by Isaac 
ibn Maman to act for him in matters pertaining to 
the estate of his late brother Moses ibn Maman, 
according to Ms.199, was appointed a judge 
during the lifetime of his paternal uncle, the 
famous Saul b. David Serero. These documents, 
which were composed in 1647, concern the estate 
of the late brother of Isaac ibn Maman. The 
aforementioned R. Jacob Halevi was known as a 
Kabbalist; he was author of a book on responsa 
called “Beit Yaakov,” and a writer of elegies and 
liturgical pieces. 


Rabbi Jacob b. Joseph b. Danan of Fez was 
active as a scribe during the ministration of R. 
Saul Serero (c. 1606). Rabbi Jacob was subse- 
quently elevated to a judgeship in the rabbinic 
court of Fez. He composed a work on Jewish law 
which was quoted by subsequent scholars. R. 
Jacob ibn Danan signed a legal document, 
Ms.172. This document is especially interesting 
since it obliges one to reflect on the legal status of 
the Jew in relation to his Mohammedan counter- 
part. 


The Charter of Omar, which was formulated in 
the ninth century and codified by Al-Mawardi, 
gave Jews the legal status of Dhimmi Ahl el Kitab, 




Cultural background 




protegés of Muslim society. Among the advan- 
tages offered to the Christians and Jews, who 
were regarded as “people of the Book’—the 
Bible, were the right to live and the declaration of 
their property as inviolable. These rights were not 
always available to the Jews of Europe under 
Christian canon law. However, even in Islamic 
society there were limitations; Jews and 
Christians were not permitted to own a horse, 
which was regarded as a noble beast. A donkey, 
which was a lowly beast of burden, presented no 
problems of ownership. A mule as an article of 
transaction could pose a problem since it was part 
horse. Therefore, when Gideon ibn Sa’id Ha- 
Kohen purchased a mule from Yahya b. Abraham 
ibn Arwah for one hundred and eighty uqiot in 
1624, a clause had to be inserted stating that both 
parties agreed that if a Muslim should initiate a 
claim for the mule in a Muslim court and he won 
his claim, then Yahya, the vendor, would restore 
to Gideon, the purchaser, sixty ugiot, which was 
one-third of the original price. If Gideon won the 
case the loss that he might incur in payment for 
his legal defense might accrue to the total price of 
the animal plus an additional twenty ugiot. If the 
court expenses should exceed this amount then 
Yahya would be liable to pay half of any additional 
amount. 


R. Saul Serero, who was active in the early part 
of the seventeenth century, served more than fifty 
years as a rabbi in Fez. His ministration extended 
from 1602 to 1655. After the demise of R. Samuel 
ibn Danan, R. Saul Serero was the Chief Rabbi of 
Fez for the next thirty years. A rabbi of Algiers, 
R.S. Zror, said of him that he was unique in his 
generation and the law was always decided in 
accord with his opinion. He is known for his 
halakhic work called “Urim Ve-Thumim.” In it he 
informs the reader that his name was changed, 
because of illness, to Samuel.

Cultural background 




Chronicles were composed by the leading 
scholars of the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries. Specimens composed by R. Saul b. 
David Serero and R. Samuel b. Saul ibn Danan 
are noted in Ms. 87. In the latter's chronicle a 
statement is attributed to the Talmudic sage 
Hanina b. Dosa which justifies the function of the 
chronicler; namely, that the tribulations of Israel 
should be recorded as well as the miracles. Every 
aspect of human existence was considered by the 
chroniclers to be a part of some divine plan and 
was accorded historical importance. Even such 
minute details as the formation of clouds in daily 
weather reports, especially during periods of 
famine and drought, were not considered too 
mundane to be recorded. 


R. Saul b. David Serero writes in Ms.87 abouta 
famine that transpired between 1604 and 1606 at 
Fez, which took the lives of about three thousand 
souls, including that of R. Jacob ibn Attar. A 
lamentation was composed on the twentieth day 
of Adar 1606. During the second decade of the 
seventeenth century an incident is reported 
concerning one called Hamdun whose sons were 
killed by brigands. Hamdun wanted to blame the 
Jews and pour his wrath upon them. R. Saul 
Serero reported the incident to the king’s officials 
as well as to the Nagid, R. Jacob Roti, who 
accompanied the king. After many bribes were 
paid safety was assured. The movements of the 
royal retinue are also meticulously recorded. 


On another occasion, R. Saul Serero states 
that brigands, about ten of them, tried to enter his 
home through a window, but his brother David 
saw them and the brigands started shooting 
arrows. R. Saul and his brother thereupon threw 
stones at them until they fled. Conditions were so 
bad at Fez that R. Saul Serero moved to Sefrou. He 
also reported the upheavals of the community in 
Tafilalet where the majority of Jews suffered 




12 




death, pillage, and starvation during a siege. 
Others were sold into slavery and the synagogues 
were destroyed. The Nagid was either hanged 
or crucified. The death of King Mulay Abdallah 
is reported. An earthquake was noted to have 
occurred on the twenty-second of lyar 1625. 
Samuel b. Saul ibn Danan, writing on Thurs- 
day, the tenth of Tevet 1724, reports a famine that 
lasted for three years, from 1721 to 1724, anda 
drought that continued for four years. The price of 
wheat was quoted at one hundred and thirty-five 
ugiot. A circuit of fasts was meticulously observ- 
ed. A great penitential convocation took place in 
1723 at the communities of Meknés, Salé, and 
Sefrou, as Torah scrolls were brought forth. 
Subsequently, rain fell for three days, whereupon 
the price of barley was reduced and wheat was 
quoted at sixty ugiot. The chronicler reports that 
the misfortune at Fez was indescribable. 
Another chronicler of the seventeenth century 
was the illustrious scholar R. Saadya ibn Danan 
who is noted in Ms.258. The copyist of R. Saadya’s 
chronicle was Immanuel b. R. Joshua Serero, in 
the month of Heshvan 1724. Some of the excerpts 
are given as follows, “I have it in my grandfather 
R. Samuel ibn Danan’s hand that the Castilian 
expulsion was in 1497. Lest | forget the date | have 
recorded it here. Also he [R. Saadya’s grand- 
father] recorded that the expulsion that occurred 
to the Toshavim of the old city of Fez took place in 
1438. The mellah suffered an expulsion in 1465.” 
Another excerpt from Saadya ibn Danan reports 
an earthquake to have taken place at Fez on the 
seventh of Adar || 1636. As a result of the panic 
that followed, people grabbed weapons and 
attacked one another in confusion. A solar eclipse 
was recorded and the amount of sunlight was 
measured. Stars were seen in the afternoon on the 
twenty-eighth of Nisan 1630. A great quake was 
felt on an early morning in 1624, whereupon a 




great number of houses and towers were 
demolished in the old city of Fez and about three 
thousand, five hundred people were killed. More 
people were injured after the quake because of 
the weakened conditions of the houses. It was 
regarded as a miracle that not one Jew was killed 
although their houses were demolished, especial- 
ly as their houses were not so well constructed as 
the houses of the non-Jews. A reason is given for 
recording this event. “To make known to future 
generations the magnitude of this miracle that 
occurred.” The author is Saadya b. Abraham b. 
Samuel ibn Danan. 


Additional natural occurrences are reported. 
On Wednesday, the eve of Shavuot 1624, the sky 
darkened and small creatures, the upper portion 
of their bodies appearing to be like locusts and 
the bottom like worms, fell from the sky. Simul- 
taneously, a storm of large (hail) stones also 
fell. The weight of one stone was given as four 
uqiot. People who were in the marketplace were 
injured by the falling stones. One stone came 
through the window of R. Moses Almosni’s house 
and broke a vessel. It was reported that a lion 
entered the Giza gate of the old city of Fez and 
killed one donkey and took another with him. “It is 
not known whether this is true but most of the 
non-Jews Say that it transpired.” 


An almanac type of forecasting is offered for 
the cities of Morocco based on when the New 
Year falls. Brigands will abound and wars will be 
fought. The end of the year will be appreciably 
better than the early part of the year. Plentiful rain 
will reduce the price of wheat. The day on which 
the New Year will occur will affect weather 
conditions, health conditions, and whether dif- 
ficulties will be encountered with the crops. 


The chronicler, lmmanuel Monsano of Fez of 
the eighteenth century, appears as the author of 
Ms.275. He commences his chronicle with the 




Cultural background 




usual lament about how unfortunate are the times 
in which he lives. The excerpts deal with the years 
1738-1760. Reports are given as to the scarcity of 
rain and to details of the fasts and services that 
were held. Then he adds, “The head of the 
academy, and the leading rabbi of the community, 
delivered a lecture. The message stressed that 
denial of rain is directly related to the sin of 
neglecting Torah study, since Torah study leads 
to proper actions.” The speaker apparently also 
stated that another moral lapse that causes the 
rains to cease is gossip and the improper exercise 
of speech. Public violation of the Sabbath laws, 
especially by liquor vendors, is also a factor not to 
be discounted. An enactment was instituted to the 
effect that even if a liquor vendor was seen by only 
one witness to be violating the Sabbath by selling 
his wares then he should pay a fine which would 
be used to help the poor. The scholar noted 
another moral lapse which needed correction. 
Jewish women working in Fez for non-Jews 
remained there day and night and on the Sabbath. 
They should henceforth behave in accordance 
with the code that Jewish women are accustomed 
to live by. It was further decided that an emissary 
should make the women return. If the women 
remained adamant in their refusal then the ruler 
should intervene to oblige them to adhere to the 
enactment. 


The political situation is also described. King 
Mulay La-Muztadi acceded to his throne in the 
month of Tammuz 1738 (at Meknés) and was 
declared king at Fez on Friday the eighth of Av. 
The non-Jew Mahmad ibn Abu ibn Sa’id suffered 
a terrible death at the king’s hands at Meknés. 
There was tranquility in the land during Mulay 
La-Muztadi’s reign. 


Immanuel Monsano reports the following: “On 
Sunday, the sixteenth of Shevet 1740, while we 
were engaged in Torah study we were informed 




13 




Cultural background 




that King Mulay La-Muztadi had fled to Fez. The 
entire city was in an uproar because of the reign of 
terror that would follow, especially for the Jewish 
populace, which was the usual course of events 
during unsettled times. That same day R. Jacob 
Monsonyego was wounded in the arm and head 
and lost much blood. The king fled the city in an 
easterly direction when he saw no relief. Mulay 
Abdallah was then declared king. This is the third 
time that he rules.” 


His supporters went to return the king who 
fled, arriving at Meknés in the month of Tishri 
1740. The Al-Wadaya rebelled against the king for 
two months and refused his offer of amnesty 
because they did not trust him. A prayer is added 
that the Messiah might come. Finally, we learn, 
a reconciliation between the king and the Al- 
Wadaya was effected. 


In the year 1758-59 no rain fell. After the usual 
fasts and prayer services some rain fell. Prayers of 
thanksgiving were then recited. When the rain 
ceased the non-Jews asked the Jews to pray for 
rain. Following the prayer service the people went 
to the cemetery to pray at the graves of the saints. 
Psalms were recited at R. Judah ibn Attar’s tomb. 
R. Elijah Ha-Sarfati gave a lengthy discourse. 
That afternoon R. Saul ibn Danan addressed the 
people. On a subsequent occasion R. Elijah 
addressed the people in the morning and R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur addressed them at the afternoon 
service. 


The city of Fez was conquered by King 
Muhammed ben Mulay-Abdallah on Friday, the 
twenty-sixth of Av 1760. Afterwards acannon was 
brought to the mellah and it was fired in the 
cemetery. The king was curious to see what 
distance the missile would attain. 


In the seventeenth century, Moroccan Jewry 
had settlements in a number of communities in 
the Holy Land, at Jerusalem, Tiberias, Hebron, 




14 




and Safed. In anumber of eastern Mediterranean 
countries such as Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Greece, 
and Turkey, Moroccan nuclear communities 
maintained their own synagogues, customs, and 
rabbinic leaders. It is probable that the North 
African scholar R. Ishmael Ha-Kohen Tanuji, 
author of the text Sefer Ha-Zikkaron which 
appears in the Bension collection, functioned asa 
rabbinic leader to North African Jews in Egypt 
during the first third of the sixteenth century. 


The Algerian scholar R. Hayyim Capusi (1540- 
1631), who is mentioned in Ms.85, is another who 
is representative of the movement of scholars 
from Northwest Africa to the Eastern Mediterra- 
nean. R. Hayyim made his way to Egypt where he 
served in a rabbinic capacity in later years. He 
arrived in Egypt during the sixth decade of the 
sixteenth century. He is referred to as Ba’al Nes, 
the one to whom a miracle had occurred, as a 
result of a controversy which he had with the 
scholar R. Bezalel Ashkenazi, compiler of the 
work Shitah Mekubbezet, concerning a suit fora 
debt. R. Hayyim sided with the defendant in the 
suit. Subsequently, he became blind and an 
aspersion was cast upon him that his blindness 
was due to a bribe he had taken. However, his 
sight was soon restored and R. Hayyim felt that he 
was vindicated in the dispute. The synagogue 
where he prayed received the appellation Ba’al 
Nes. 


The illustrious Moroccan scholar and mystic 
R. Hayyim ibn Attar, author of the celebrated 
commentary on the Pentateuch Or ha-Hayyim, 
left Morocco for the Holy Land at an advanced 
age, in the eighteenth century. He took many 
disciples with him since he was desirous of 
opening an academy there. More disciples were 
added to his venture during his stopover in Italy. 
The unsettled economic and political situation in 
Morocco during the fourth decade of the 




eighteenth century was sufficient reason for R. 
Hayyim ibn Attar to make his exodus. R. Hayyim 
Joseph David Azulai, the prolific author and bio- 
bibliographer of the second half of the eighteenth 
century, studied under R. Hayyim ibn Attar. The 
former was a descendant of R. Abraham Azulai, 
the famous mystical scholar of Marrakesh. R. 
Hayyim Azulai is the author of the oft-quoted bio- 
bibliographical work Shem Ha-Gedolim, which is 
cited in Ms.85. He was the first Jewish scholar to 
study the Hebrew manuscripts of Italy and France 
systematically. 


’ The last dynasty of Sharifs to rule Morocco 
until our own day is that of the Alawids. They rose 
to power in the seventeenth century during a 
period of political chaos which marked the end of 
the dynasty of the Sa’dis. Many chronicles are 
available that report on the activities of this 
dynasty. These rulers are noted in some of the 
chronicles that appear in the Bension collection. 
Mulay al-Rashid, who ruled between 1660 and 
1672, was regarded as the founder of the dynasty. 
He received much support from the Jews and he 
subsequently adopted a favorable attitude toward 
them. Mulay Ismail, the brother of Mulay al- 
Rashid, was viceroy in Meknés while his brother 
ruled from Fez. When his brother died in 
Marrakesh, Ismail, with the help of the Jews, 
secured the sultanate for himself. The Jews fared 
better than even most of the Muslim population 
during Mulay Ismail’s long rule, from 1672 to 1727. 


The situation of the Jews began to deteriorate 
at the end of Mulay Ismail’s reign when his sons 
fought over the ascendancy to the sultanate 
which was based in Meknés. Usually these stormy 
periods were of short duration until a ruler was 
finally installed. However, the thirty years follow- 
ing Mulay Ismail’s death, 1727 to 1757, were 
marked by anarchy and suffering for the entire 
population. A vivid report of these events is noted 




Cultural background 




in a chronicle which appears in Ms.275. This 
disorganized state of affairs gave France and 
Spain a golden opportunity to extend their 
influence in Morocco. The Jews dwelling in the 
towns in the interior began a movement to the big 
cities and the coast because of the lack of 
security. 


There arose a number of rabbinic scholars 
who were prolific authors and who directed the 
religious life of Moroccan Jewry during the period 
that overlapped the reign of the aforementioned 
Mulay Ismail and the period of strife which 
followed, from 1672 to 1757. Itis important to note 
that the religious life of Moroccan Jewry was not 
just confined to attendance at the synagogue on 
the Sabbath or even thrice daily. Rather the 
religious leadership played a decisive role in 
legislating on all aspects of daily life such as 
marriage, divorce, and inheritance as well as 
regulating the production and distribution of all 
food supplies, especially meat products which are 
subject to many dietary laws. The regulation of 
weights and measures and the establishment of 
fair pricing also came under rabbinic scrutiny, as 
is noted in Ms.108. The rabbinic courts were the 
formulators of the proper documentation for 
various legal situations such as certification for 
religious functionaries, bills of divorce, bills of 
debt, and legal forms for a variety of commercial 
transactions. The adjudication of property rights 
between individuals as weil as all that which 
pertained to communal property rights came 
under their scrutiny. Occasionally enactments 
were made for the material and spiritual wellbeing 
of the inhabitants of the various communities. 


Often as a result of persecutions and exorbi- 
tant taxes many rabbinic leaders of the various 
communities were obliged to leave. This resulted 
in an absence of rabbinic leadership to serve in 
the rabbinic courts and to educate young men 




15 




Cultural background 




who would be able to meet the future needs of the 
Jewish community. Some communities were 
fortunate in having distinguished scholars who 
stayed on and supervised activities at the rabbinic 
courts while they single-handedly directed 
studies at rabbinic academies. Communities 
which were in dire need of rabbinic leaders would 
often send pleas to larger communities to senda 
scholar of note to settle in their community. Thus, 
the responsibility for the perpetuation of the 
educational system was also the responsibility of 
the rabbinate. 


Dynasties of scholars were nurtured in several 
families. These families are constantly reappear- 
ing in the hundreds of documents of the Bension 
collection, particularly in the “Yalkut Roiim” 
volume. Several of the personalities that were 
especially active in the major Moroccan com- 
munities during the first half of the eighteenth 
century will now be introduced. Among the most 
illustrious rabbinic scholars of Fez were the 
following three: Rabbi Judah ibn Attar, Rabbi 
Jacob b. Reuben Ibn Zur, and R. Samuel ibn 
Elbaz. 




Fez and Meknées— 


seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 


Rabbi Judah ibn Attar lived from 1655 to 1733. He 
was known by the title “Rabbi al-Kabbir,’—The 
Great Rabbi of Fez. R. Judah was a disciple of R. 
Vidal Ha-Sarfati and R. Menahem Serero of Fez. 
He was appointed to serve as judge together with 
his masters in the year 1698. Due to the 
persecutions that took place in Fez he moved to 
Mekneés in 1701. He joined the rabbis Moses 
Toledano ‘and his brother Habib in deciding 
judicial matters before returning to Fez inc. 1704. 
The only judges of the rabbinic court in Fez at this 
time were R. Judah ibn Attar and R. Samuel Ha- 
Sarfati because other scholars had left and had 




16 




not as yet returned to Fez. During his ministration 
as head of the court and as a judge he did not 
receive compensation from the community but he 
was self-employed as a silversmith. He was well 
versed in the customs of Castilian Jewry as well as 
being erudite in all areas of Jewish Law. 
Therefore, all the Moroccan communities turned 
to him with their queries. R. Judah collaborated 
with his younger colleague Jacob Ibn Zur in 
publishing the enactments of the Spanish exiles 
in Fez and in enacting new legislation which 
served as a basis for subsequent development in 
Moroccan Jewish law. In the Bension collection 
Rabbi Judah ibn Attar is noted in over forty-five 
separate documents and texts. R. Judah 
demonstrates great concern for his younger 
colleague, R. Jacob Ibn Zur, and had a high 
regard for R. Jacob’s scholarly attainments. R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur recorded in Ms.85 that the 
prophet Elijah revealed himself to R. Judah ibn 
Attar. 


Rabbi Jacob b. Reuben Ibn Zur (1673-1752), 
appeared to suffer the exigencies of a more 
unsettled life than did his older colleague, R. 
Judah ibn Attar. In spite of his wanderings from 
Fez to Meknés (1720-28) and then to Tetuan 
(1738-40), R. Jacob was able to manifest prolific 
output in many literary directions as well as in 
the field of jurisprudence. Whereas R. Judah 
succeeded in achieving some financial stability, 
R. Jacob was always seeking ways of lessening 
the oppressive financial burden which was his to 
bear. Others usually seemed to be getting the 
better of him in matters of finance. Yet he was 
strong-willed and his temperament was such that 
he would rather suffer than succumb to those who 
attempted to lord it over him. 


An indication that this indeed was the case can 
readily be noted from a very revealing cor- 
respondence in the collection, Ms.227, wherein 




the reason as to why R. Jacob Ibn Zur felt obliged 
to leave Fez, where he enjoyed such prestige, for 
Meknés, is alluded to. R. Judah ibn Attar, who 
is the writer of Ms.227, takes pain to keep R. 
Jacob’s confidence and for this reason his 
essential motive for leaving Fez is not revealed. 
Yet R. Judah notes in a nebulous manner that a 
disorganized state of affairs affecting the Jewish 
community is the cause. 


R. Judah is against R. Jacob’s departure for 
Meknés. However, he refuses to have him write 
to the Nagid of Fez to initiate a process of con- 
ciliation and appeasement. He implies that it is 
the Nagid who should initiate the process of 
reconciliation, since R. Jacob suffers much priva- 
tion because of the situation. He concludes the 
correspondence with his view that because of the 
personalities involved, no real improvement in 
relations will result until R. Jacob confronts the 
Nagid face to face. R. Judah seems to hint that R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur should make some effort to 
confront the Nagid so as to end his exile (at 
Meknés). He writes that he will only intervene in 
the dispute when R. Jacob returns to Fez. 


R. Jacob Ibn Zur knew personal tragedy in the 
untimely death of his two sons who were named 
after his late father, the scholar R. Reuben. The 
Bension collection contains letters of consolation 
in Mss.21 and 37 to R. Jacob on the passing of his 
sons. R. Jacob also suffered the loss of his 
precocious son-in-law, R. Menahem II Serero, at 
the age of twenty-six, which is noted in Ms.35. 


A most revealing correspondence concerning 
this family in later years may be found in the 
collection. It is a response to Aaron Ibn Zur’s 
desire to acquire a family tree, aKtav Yuhasin, on 
the occasion of the forthcoming marriage of his 
daughter. This information was composed in a 
letter on Purim day, 1876 by his brother, who 
desired anonymity. The writer describes the 




Fez and Meknés 




family as having originated in Castile and he 
commences with R. Moses Ibn Zur, who was 
known as Abraham the Hebrew, as the first 
scholar of note who was situated in Morocco. The 
writer regards the disclosure of this information 
as a disturbance of the dead and he asks that the 
letter should be destroyed after the contents are 
revealed, presumably to the groom’s father, 
Mordecai ibn Go. For the entire text see the 
contents of Ms.244. 


R. Jacob Ibn Zur, who was also known by the 
name Yaabez, was the acknowledged Master of 
Jewish law by all the sages of his generation. In 
Ms.19, the leading rabbis of Mekneés speak with 
the highest regard for R. Jacob’s authority. R. 
Mordecai Berdugo states that the custom of 
Castilia remains the final guide for R. Jacob Ibn 
Zur and the former will do nothing until he 
receives permission from R. Jacob Ibn Zur. R. 
Mordecai Berdugo asks R. Jacob Ibn Zur to clarify 
a dispute but he will surely abide by R. Jacob’s 
decision because of the esteem in which he is 
held, see Ms.262. In Ms.117, R. Jacob Toledano 
states that “the scholars of the West relied uponR. 
Jacob Ibn Zur.” See also Mss.118 and 119 where 
R. Mordecai looks to R. Jacob for guidance. In 
Ms.63 the writer states, “that the law is in accord 
with R. Jacob (Ibn Zur) everywhere.” 


R. Jacob was an undisputed master of the 
popular metaphoric style of liturgical poetry of his 
age. He was a prolific composer of poetic 
constructions, several of which appear in the 
Bension collection in Ms.84 while others are 
alluded to in R. Jacob’s correspondence with R. 
Menahem Serero in Ms.105. According to R. 
H.J.D. Azulai, R. Jacob was also accomplished in 
the field of practical Kabbala. One of the poems 
that R. Jacob composed on the mystical theme of 
the ten sephirot and the holy names that are 
related to the sephirot, in twenty-six verses equal 




Ae 




Fez and Meknés 




in number to the Holy Name of the Almighty, 
appears in Ms.84. R, Menahem Serero asks for R. 
Jacob’s comments on a mystical work called 
Sefer Zerubbabel which was composed by the 
author of Pirkei Haikhalét, the Talmudic master, 
R. Ishmael Kohen-Gadol. This correspondence 
appears as Ms.220. |n his prose writings he shows 
an historical sensitivity. He also possessed an 
exhaustive knowledge of the traditions of 
Castilian Jewry. 


Although R. Jacob Ibn Zur never made any 
one community his permanent home he im- 
mediately functioned as the highest authority in 
every community in which he sojourned. While he 
studied under the same masters as did R. Judah 
ibn Attar, namely, the rabbis Vidal Ha-Sarfati, and 
Menahem Serero, he always showed deference to 
his older contemporary. R. Judah was quick to 
capitalize on R. Jacob’s abilities by having him 
serve as ajudge in Fez. Thesignatures of R. Judah 
and R. Jacob that appear together on several 
court documents in the collection are represen- 
tative of this period of R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s activity in 
Fez. (See Mss. 67, 196, 231 and 252.) 


When R. Jacob Ibn Zur moved to Meknés 
much correspondence passed between him and 
his colleague R. Judah ibn Attar. Some letters 
were of a personal nature while others involved 
litigations. (See Mss. 28, 33, 62, 65, 69, 70, 73, 162, 
171, 188, 193, 207, 242, 250 and 257.) R. Jacob Ibn 
Zur had his share of controversies and personality 
Clashes with such figures as R. Jacob ibn Malka, 
R. Jacob Toledano, R. Samuel Azawi, and the 
Nagid of Fez among others. In Ms.35,R.Jacoblbn 
Zur blames R. Jacob Toledano as being the cause 
of his wanderings and of his migration to Tetuan 
because he could not make a living in Meknés 
owing to R. Toledano’s manipulations. 


Towards the end of his life he ordained five of 
his students who subsequently became known as 




18 




the “Court of Five at Fez.” They were (1) Samuel 
Saul b. R. Jacob b. Danan (1700-1766); (2) R 
Ephraim b. Abraham Monsonyego (1710-1780), 
who subsequently served as a judge in Tetuan; (3) 
R. Raphael Obed Ibn Zur (1710-1769), the son of 
R. Jacob Ibn Zur; (4) R. Elijah b. R. Joseph Ha- 
Sarfati (1715- 4805); and (5) R. Matitya b. R. 
Menahem Il Serero, R. Jacob’s grandson. ThusR. 
Jacob Ibn Zur ensured a rabbinic leadership for 
the future generation. He also left many responsa 
in his work called “Mishpat u-Zedakah be- 
Ya’aqov,” which is a good source for history of 
this period. He left much poetry as well. His 
liturgical compositions are sung by Moroccan 
Jewry till this day. Many of his works are still in 
manuscript. R. Jacob Ibn Zur is noted in more 
than sixty documents and correspondences in the 
Bension collection. The pre-eminence of Fez in 
Moroccan Jewish life ended with the death of R. 
Jacob Ibn Zurin 1753. The rabbis of Salé, Hayyim 
Toledano, Aaron the son of Judah Halevi, and 
Jacob Bibas, sent a letter of consolation to R. 
Raphael Obed Ibn Zur on the passing of his father. 
R. Raphael is mentioned as a successor to his 
father in this epistle which appears in Ms. 132. 


R. Samuel ibn Elbaz (1698-1749) was in his 
mid-thirties when he was appointed a judge 
in Fez together with R. Jacob Ibn Zur and R. 
Shalom Edery. His first wife was the grand- 
daughter of R. Nehemia Ha-Kohen, whose sons, 
Moses and Shem Tob, died martyrs’ deaths. 
Subsequently, R. Samuel inherited the authority 
over the synagogue in Fez that had belonged toR. 
Nehemia, established a school there, and in turn 




passed it on to his sons, R. Judah, R. Moses, and 




R. Jacob. R. Samuel Elbaz was shown deference 
by his colleagues on matters pertaining to Jewish 
law. The names of members of this scholarly 
family are noted in thirty-two separate documents 
in the Bension Collection. R. Samuel composed 




many works in the field of Jewish jurisprudence, 
among them decisions that he rendered in re- 
sponsa as well as novellae on several tractates 
of the Talmud. 


R. Samuel b. Abraham Ha-Sarfati (1660-1713), 
who was the cousin of R. Vidal I] Ha-Sarfati (1631- 
1703), was a contemporary of R. Judah ibn Attar 
and served as a judge together with R. Judah at 
Fez. On the seventeenth of Tammuz 1707, the 
rabbis Judah ibn Attar, Samuel Ha-Sarfati, and 
Abraham ibn Danan signed a court document 
affirming Saadya Lahakhusin’s ownership of a 
portion of an upper storey of a house that the 
latter had purchased from a non-Jew named 
Musa. The wife of the Jew David b. Tata o.b.m. 
made a claim against this property. Saadya was 
now protected by the rabbinic tribunal from any 
claims that David’s wife might make. This is the 
subject of Ms. 17. 


On another occasion R. Samuel Ha-Sarfati 
joined R. Judah ibn Attar, R. Vidal Il Ha-Sarfati, R. 
Saadya b. Mimun Aflalo, and R. Isaac Ha-Sarfati 
in attesting to the financial need of R. Isaac 
Melamed who was a scholar of Jerusalem. The 
aforementioned rabbis signed a court document, 
which appears in Ms.192, stating that financial aid 
should be made available to R. lsaac whenever he 
came to Fez. During the period in which this 
document was composed the economic situation 
in Fez was unfavorable for the Jews, while the 
non-Jewish population fared much better. The 
expression “the maidservant inherited the role of 
the mistress,” was used by the rabbis to 
characterize the relations between Muslims and 
Jews and the conditions under which they lived. 
The rabbis pray that the scholar will receive his 
due as economic conditions improve. 


R. Samuel Ha-Sarfati was a co-signer with R. 
Judah ibn Attar, R. Abraham ibn Danan, and R. 
Jacob |bn Zur of acourt document that was drawn 




Fez and Meknés 




up on the seventeenth of Tammuz 1709. On that 
occasion the community of Fez was in need of 
funds so it leased a concession to R. Daniel 
Toledano thereby realizing the necessary funds. 
All the particulars of this transaction are noted in 
Ms.196. 


R. Samuel was a scion of the illustrious Ha- 
Sarfati family which claimed descent from the 
twelfth century Tosafist of Northern France, 
Rabbi Jacob Tam, otherwise known as Rabbenu 
Tam, who was the grandson of the celebrated 
Biblical and Talmudic commentator, Rashi. R. 
Samuel Ha-Sarfati’s paternal grandfather was the 
famous scholar R. Vidal | Ha-Sarfati (1550-1620), 
whose son Issac II (d. 1660) served as the Nagid at 
Fez. R. Vidall was acontemporary of the author of 
the Shulhan Arukh, R. Joseph Caro, according to 
Ms.85. R. Samuel authored many halakhic works 
as well as a text on the aggadic portions of the 
Talmud entitled Petah Ainiiyim. He also wrote an 
exegetical work on the commentaries of Rashi 
and Nahmanides entitled Nimukei Samuel. There 
are more than forty-five citations of the members 
of this illustrious family in the Bension collection, 
with biographical source material available on 
them from the mid-seventeenth century. 
Signatures on legal documents in the collection 
bear the names of many scholars from this 
prestigious family. 


R. Jacob, the son of Joseph ben Malka, served 
as a scribe of the rabbinic tribunal in Fez in the 
year 1717, and was still active as the head of the 
rabbinic court in Tetuan c. 1771. However, his 
irascible nature brought down the ire of his con- 
temporaries who were the leading scholars of 
the age, see Ms.133. Among those who attempted 
to discipline him for his presumption were R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur, R. Shalom Edery, R. Samuel Elbaz, 
and R. Abraham Alel. Even R. Judah ibn Attar did 
not go unscathed from Jacob b. Malka’s barbs. 




19 




Fez and Meknés 




R. Jacob b. Malka is mentioned in several docu- 
ments and correspondences in the Bension col- 
lection. Immanuel Monsano’s letter of consola- 
tion to R. Jacob b. Malka upon the murder of 
his son Samuel in c. 1760 is found in Ms.255. 




R. Samuel b. R. Saul b. Danan (1668-c.1730), 
who served as the chief Ritual Slaughterer in Fez, 
was the composer of a chronicle on the history 
of the Jews of Fez between the sixteenth and 
early eighteenth centuries. This work was called 
Divrei ha-Yamim. The Chronicle Serero which 
is found in Ms.87 includes some chronicles which 
were composed by Samuel b. Saul ibn Danan as 
well as by R. Saul Serero. More than thirty docu- 
ments in the Bension collection note the mem- 
bers of this family, that was indigenous to 
Morocco centuries before the Spanish expulsion. 




The Edery family is mentioned in the Bension 
collection in a dozen different documents. R. 
Shalom Edery, who served as a judge at Fez, was a 
contemporary of R. Judah ibn Attar and R. Jacob 
lbn Zur. He was active between the years 1707 and 
1736. R. Shalom’s signature appears on several 
documents in this collection. 


The Zikhri family was represented in Fez 
during this period by R. Hananiah b. R. Isaiah 
ben Zikhri. R. Hananiah left Fez to settle in Mek- 
nes, where he served as ascribe for the rabbinical 
courts at the beginning of the eighteenth century. 
He was also a composer of liturgical poetry. 
Members of this family are noted in several docu- 
ments of the Bension collection. R. Hananiah b. 
Zikhri and R. Abraham b. David Hasin are the 
signatories to Ms. 113, in a correspondence 
from Meknés to R. Jacob Ibn Zur at Fez, in behalf 
of R. Samuel Maymeran. R. Jacob is asked to 
intercede with R. Shalom Edery to pay more for 
a piece of property even though the sale had been 
consummated a long time before. 




20 




The leading authority of Jewish law at Mek- 
nés during the time that R. Judah ibn Attar was 
active in Fez, was R. Moses Toledano (1643- 
1723). R. Moses inherited the leadership of the 
rabbinic court from his father, R. Hayyim, in the 
year 1680. R. Moses’ younger brother, R. Habib 
(1658-1716), was active as a judge in the year 
1703. Both brothers remained childless. R. 
Habib’s first wife was the daughter of R. Shemaya 
Maymeran. R. Habib’s student, who was regarded 
as the next scholar of prominence in Meknés, 
was R. Moses Berdugo, also known as the Mash- 
bir. He inherited the post of chief of the rabbinic 
court of Meknés upon the death of R. Moses Tole- 
dano, and died in 1731, when he was succeeded 
by R. Moses Adhan. The latter died in the year 
1737. 


The aforementioned brothers Moses and 
Habib Toledano are not the only members of the 
larger Toledano family to be mentioned in twenty- 
two separate documents of the Bension col- 
lection. There were also four other Toledano 
brothers: R. Daniel, R. Barukh, R. Hayyim, and R. 
Jacob, the sons of another R. Moses Toledano 
whose father was R. Barukh. Two of these 
brothers, R. Hayyim and R. Jacob Toledano, are 
mentioned in several documents of the collection. 
R. Hayyim Toledano (1690-1750) was able to 
pursue an intensive Torah education because of a 
bequest that he received from his late uncle 
Hayyim’s estate. He became a judge in 1723 and 
succeeded the late R. Moses Adhan in the 
position of chief judge of the court in Meknés in 
the year 1737. He composed works in the area of 
Jewish law and elegies. 


R. Jacob Toledano surpassed his brother 
Hayyim in prestige and achievement. R. Jacob, 
who was also popularly Known as the Moharit, 
served as the chief judge of the rabbinic court in 
Meknés from the year 1750, as well as being the 




leader of the community. He placed his relatives 
in the most influential positions, incurring the 
wrath of other scholars who became jealous of his 
power which he wielded for over forty years. He 
was the acknowledged halakhic authority from 
1750 until his death in 1771. 


R. Mordecai Berdugo, who was known as 
Harav Hamarbiz, is as often mentioned in this 
collection as is the aforementioned R. Moses Ber- 
dugo, the Mashbir. The latter was R. Mordecai’s 
father-in-law and teacher. R. Judah Berdugo, 
a brother of R. Mordecai, was a colleague of R. 
Hayyim ben Attar, author of the celebrated Bib- 
lical commentary Or ha-Hayyim. R. Mordecai and 
his brother R. Judah served as judges in Meknés. 
R. Mordecai passed away in 1763. The greater 
Berdugo family is noted in this collection in 
twenty-five separate documents and correspond- 
ences. 




Salé— 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 


Some of the outstanding scholars from Salé 
who are mentioned in the collection are R. Joseph 
Saba, R. Mordecai Ha-Kohen, R. Jacob b. R. 
Joseph Bibas, R. Samuel Azawi, and R. Jacob 
ben Shaiya. The first three are signatories to 
the same document, Ms.175, that orginated at 
Salé. R. Mordecai died in the year 1717. R. Jacob 
Bibas was born at Tetuan but eventually left for 
Salé where he was appointed a judge. He married 
a great-granddaughter of R. Vidal II Ha-Sarfati of 
Fez and she bore him two sons, R. Joseph and R. 
Hayyim. There are nine documents in the 
Collection which refer to members of the Bibas 
family. R. Samuel b. Moses Azawi also signed 
Ms.189 with R. Jacob Bibas and R. Joseph Saba 
of Salé. R. Samuel Azawi served as the ritual 
slaughterer and scribe to the rabbinic court of 
Salé and was there appointed to a judgeship 




Sale 




aided by the rabbis of Fez and Meknés. R. Samuel, 
however, manifested an argumentative nature, 
particularly to scholars who were of a higher 
stature than he. The same scholars of Fez and 
Meknes who referred him to the judgeship now 
tried to have him removed, especially R. Jacob lbn 
Zur who bore him particular enmity. 


Moses Ben-Zur, who was a distinguished 
citizen of Salé, was the uncle of R. Jacob Ibn Zur. 
Moses died in the year 1706 and left three sons, 
Shalom, Jacob, and Judah. R. Shalom, who was 
considered a scholar in Salé, wrote and signed 
Ms.129 to R. Jacob Ibn Zur, as well as Ms.256. R. 
Shalom was considered to be the greatest 
grammarian of the West as well as a proficient 
poet. 




Tetuan— 


seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 


R. Hasdai Almosnino was a leading schoiar and 
judge in Tetuan at the beginning of the eighteenth 
century until his demise in 1728. After R. Isaac 
Bibas left Tetuan, R. Hasdai and R. David Ha- 
Kohen (the latter serving as head of the rabbinic 
court until his death in 1708), were the only 
scholars left. After R. David’s death, R. Hasdai 
remained the sole spiritual leader of authority in 
Tetuan. The dearth of scholars to lead the people 
was due to persecution and excessive taxation, 
particularly between the years 1700 and 1705. R. 
Hasdai Almosnino guaranteed spiritual 
leadership for the future in Tetuan by preparing 
the following students to serve as rabbinic judges: 
R. Menahem Anhori, R. Moses b. Zimra, R. 
Abraham Abudarham, and R. Isaac Nah6én. The 
Bension collection contains documents from R. 
Hasdai (Ms. 23) and his student R. Isaac Nahon 
(see Ms. 128). R. Jacob Maragi, who was a resi- 
dent of Tetuan at this time, was a celebrated 
Kabbalist who published commentaries on the 




Zohar.

Sefrou 




Sefrou— 


seventeenth and eighteenth centuries 


Although the city of Sefrou had a smaller Jewish 
population than either Fez or Meknés, it could 
boast a high level of scholarship during the 
eighteenth century due to the efforts of the 
erudite sage, R. Moses b. Hamo. R. Moses was 
active in judicial matters during the last quarter of 
the seventeenth century as can be attested to 
from Ms.197, whereR. Moses corresponds with R. 
Menahem Serero. That same document permits 
us to receive some insight as to the nature of the 
organization and curriculum at R. Moses’ 
Academy in Sefrou. He states, in a postscript to 
Ms.197, that he is presently studying the Talmudic 
Tractate Hullin with his students after the 
morning service. At midnight he has another 
study session with more than twenty advanced 
scholars. R. Moses also corresponded with R. 
Vidal Il Ha-Sarfati and R. Judah Uziel of Fez, 
contemporaries of R. Menahem Serero. R. Moses 
was the undisputed authority in every area of the 
communal life of Sefrou. He also possessed a 
zealous disposition which obliged him to rebuke 
all those who were in violation of the law 
irrespective of their position. Whenever R. Moses 
arrived in Fez for a visit the whole community was 
electrified by his personality and his homiletic 
ability. 


Among R. Moses ben Hamo’s students who 
served as spiritual leaders in the eighteenth 
century were his son R. Yeshua ben Hamo, R. 
Samuel b. Hota, R. David B. Shitrit, R. Meir 
D’Avila, R. Joseph b. Attia, R. Joseph Gabbai, 
R. Mas’ud b. Joseph b. Rabuh, and R. Yahya 
Banon. R. Moses b. Hamo died at an advanced 
age in the year 1707.

Marrakesh and Demnat— 


eighteenth century 


R. Isaac Delouya of Marrakesh, who was highly 
regarded by the rabbis of Fez and Meknes and 
who left many notable students, died in 1711. 
Among his students were R. Solomon Amar of 
Demnat and R. Abraham Azulai of Marrakesh. R. 
Solomon and R. Abraham passed away in the 
same year, 1735. They both composed Halakhic 
works and were proficient in Kabbalism. R. 
Abraham Azulai engaged in Kabbalistic practices 
while he also composed works on Ari Kabbalism. 
Another student of R. |lsaac Delouya, at Demnat, 
was R. Mordecai Attia, who also received instruc- 
tion from R. Solomon Amar. R. Abraham’s student 
R. Jacob Pinto wrote commentaries on the Zohar. 
He is mentioned in Ms.4 of the Bension collection. 
His descendant, the Haham Kollel R. Moses Pinto, 
is mentioned in connection with fund raising for 
the great academy of the Jewish community of 
Tiberias in the Holy Land. There were many 
descendants of Moroccan scholars who served 
the interests of the Sephardi communities after 
they settled in the Holy Land. This epistle, which 
was written in the month of Shevat 1828, is part of 
a collection of letters which are called Kitvei Ha- 
Qodesh (letters from the Holy Land) requesting 
aid for the communities of Safed and Jerusalem 
as well as Tiberias. 


The fourth letter in Ms.4 is particularly 
interesting in as much as it concerns the 
Sephardic communities of Jerusalem who sent 
their emissary on behalf of the members of the 
community of Ashkenazim Midrash Perushim, the 
eastern European community of Jerusalem in 
search of funds in the year 1842. This epistle was 
signed for the Kdllel Ashkenazim Midrash Peru- 
shim at Jerusalem, by Natan the son of Menahem 
MendlI. This may not have been so unusual since 
the Sephardim who had the facility of the Arabic 




language were more successful in establishing 
an economic base than were the Ashkenazim 
who settled in the Holy Land during this period. 
It was also not unusual for Ashkenazi emissaries 
to come to the Moroccan communities for aid. 
This can be noted in the third letter in Ms.4 where 
it mentions funds needed to rehabilitate syna- 
gogues damaged during earthquakes. 




All the communities— 


eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 


During the second half of the eighteenth century 
the members of the “Court of Five at Fez” who 
were ordained by R. Jacob Ibn Zur, namely, R. 
Samuel Saul ibn Danan, R. Ephraim Monsonyego 
who later established himself at Tetuan, R. 
Raphael Obed Ibn Zur, R. Elijah Ha-Sarfati, and 
R. Matitya Serero, were joined in their efforts by 
the scribe of the court, R. Immanuel Monsano, 
who died before 1770. R. |mmanuel appears in his 
official scribal capacity in Ms.121. R. Immanuel 
Monsano is also the author of a chronicle that 
appears in Ms.275. He is noted in several other 
documents and on some occasions together with 
his brother, Abraham Monsano, see Mss. 116 and 
237. Other members of this family that are 
mentioned in the collection are Yehonatan Ish 
Sion the son of Bezalel, Barukh Monsano, and 
David Monsano. 


R. Raphael Obed Ibn Zur, the son of the 
aforementioned R. Jacob Ibn Zur, was called 
Obed by his father when he was a youngster. The 
name Raphael must have been added as a result 
of an illness from which he recovered, Ms.105.He 
received a portion of the income from his father’s 
synagogue at Meknés, which was contested by R. 
Jacob Toledano. Apparently, R. Raphael Obed 
Ibn Zur was no more successful in his business 
ventures than his father had been. R. Raphael 
Obed informs R. Moses ibn Maman, in Ms.190, 




Marakesh and Demnat 




that he suffers a multitude of misfortunes as well 
as economic privation. He lost his possessions 
because he gave capital to entrepreneurs to invest 
for him; his goal in business ventures is not wealth 
but merely the ability to acquire that which would 
permit him to purchase the basic necessities; he is 
destitute and is located at the house of study at 
Mekneés. He had been offered a stipend by that 
community which was available for resident 
scholars and after refusals had finally succumbed 
and taken it, but only as a loan. Eventually, we 
learn, the stipend was reduced because business 
conditions were bad. Raphael Obed refused to 
take any more stipends while he viewed his 
poverty as a sign of Divine chastisement. 


He asks R. Moses Maman to extend a loan of 
two hundred ugiot to help him support his family, 
especially as the holiday season is approaching. 
He offers to compose a bill of debt and to give his 
land in Meknés as collateral. He has his eye on 
another business scheme (not unlike those which 
previously placed him in a situation of adversity) 
which someone would invest and manage for him. 
He expects that he will be able to live off the 
profits. For more bibliographical information on 
these members of the Ibn Zur family, see Ms.35. 


After the passing of R. Raphael Obed, in the 
year 1769, his son, Samuel Ibn Zur, was elected as 
a judge to the court in Fez, in his father’s stead. R. 
Samuel was still active in that capacity in the year 
1782. There is a letter of consolation, Ms.77, 
which was sent by R. Ephraim Monsonyego and 
R. Judah b. Abraham Coriat, both of Tetuan, toR. 
Samuel Ibn Zur on the passing of his father. 
Another letter of consolation, Ms.78, was sent to 
the rabbis Matitya Serero and Samuel Ibn Zur by 
the rabbis Jacob, Solomon, and Moses Toledano 
and R. Solomon Tapiero of Meknés. 


Contemporaneous with the activities of the 
“Court of Five” at Fez was the “Court of Three” at 




23 




All communities 




Mekneés which consisted of R. Solomon b. R. 
Eliezer Toledano, R. Moses b. Daniel Toledano, 
and R. Yekutiel b. R. Mordecai Berdugo. They 
succeeded the eminent R. Jacob Toledano, who 
passed on in 1771. R. Jacob, R. Solomon, and R. 
Moses Toledano were the signatories to the 
aforementioned letter of consolation, Ms.78. 
R. Moses Toledano also sojourned at Salé fora 
time because of the pestilence and famine which 
affected Meknés. He lost his first wife in the 
pestilence and in the ensuing years the rest of his 
family succumbed. R. Hayyim b. R. Judah 
Toledano, who resided in Meknés for atime, was 
an uncle to the aforementioned Moses and 
Solomon. R. Hayyim subsequently moved to Salé 
in 1750, where he served as a judge for thirty 
years. He wrote many Halakhic works and he 
composed a memorial book noting Moroccan 
scholars who passed on between 1714 and 1773. 


Several documents of the Maymeran family 
appear in the Bension Collection. R. Moses 
Maymeran of Meknés and his son Hayyim were 
noted scholars who composed Halakhic works. R. 
Moses was a son-in-law of R. Jacob Toledano. A 
dispute between R. Moses andR. Jacob Toledano 
is noted in Ms.35. R. dayyim was born in 1765 and 
although he passed on at the age of twenty he 
received wide acclaim for his erudition and he 
composed works in several areas of Jewish 
scholarship. 


The Dahan family appears in eighteen docu- 
ments of the collection. The spelling of the name 
may vary, i.e. Dahan, Adhan and Bendahan, and it 
is listed in the Index of Names under Dahan as 
well as Adhan. R. Moses Adhan who served as 
the head of the Rabbinic Tribunal in Meknés until 
1737, was to serve as a conciliator in the dispute 
between the Nagid of Fez and R. Jacob Ibn Zur. 
R. Jacob was in self-imposed exile in Meknés 
because of that clash of personalities, which 




24 




is noted in Ms.227. In the same correspondence 
it is noted that Mas’Ud ibn Adhan, together with 
R. Jacob Aspag and Saadya Lahaboz, wrote to 
Fez to get the notables to persuade R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur to write to the Nagid so that he would 
be able to return to Fez. R. Mimun Adhan is 
mentioned in several documents. In Ms.96 he 
joined R. Jacob Toledano in writing to R. Samuel 
Elbaz concerning a claim made by Isaac ibn 
Haroush against Hayyim ibn Magiruz. In Ms.71 
a note of consolation is added marking the recent 
demise of R. Mimun ibn Adhan in Fez, on Satur- 
day evening, the seventh of Heshvan 1756. 


Two interesting documents in the Bension 
collection which give additional information 
concerning some of the vicissitudes of members 
of the Adhan family are Mss.250 and 251.R. Judah 
ion Attar inquires of R. Jacob Ibn Zur about 
certain deeds belonging to the descendants of 
Isaac and Ephraim ibn Amara which are supposed 
to be in R. Jacob’s possession. These deeds will 
have a bearing on whether the descendants of the 
late Levi ibn Amara will be able to claim a 
courtyard containing a ritual bath or whether it 
will remain in the possession of R. Joseph Adhan 
in the form of a pledge. The latter needs to 
produce the pledge in order to redeem himself 
with its value because he and his two brothers are 
being held by a non-Jew who has confined them 
on his property for more than two weeks. The 
non-Jew also caught the young son with the 
intention of converting him to Islam. They were 
freed by the non-Jew on the condition that cash 
would immediately be made available to him. 
Joseph Adhan is sending his eldest son, Mimun, 
to R. Jacob for the documents since the case 
involves redemption of captives. In Ms.2517, R. 
Judah ibn Attar informs R. Shalom ibn Lakhraif 
that a decision was rendered in favor of R. Joseph 
Adhan. 




The Hasin family was also active in Meknés 
during this period. One of the outstanding mem- 
bers of this family was R. David b. R. Aaron b. 
Kasin who was born c. 1730 and passed on after 
1790. He was the student and son-in-law of R. 
Mordecai Berdugo of the previous generation. 
R. David was famous for his outstanding liturgical 
poems which were published in his liturgical 
work “Tehila Le-David.” R. Abraham b. David 
ibn Hasin of Meknés was a signatory to Mss. 
113, 180 and 187. 


One of the rabbinic leaders of this generation 
in Sefrou, was R. Saul Yeshua Abitboul. He is the 
writer of a letter of consolation and a poem to R. 
Samuel Ibn Zur, on the passing of his father, R. 
Raphael Obed Ibn Zur, which is Ms.208. R. Saul 
Yeshua composed works pertaining to the laws of 
ritual slaughter in accord with Maaravic custom. 
He passed on in the year 1802. In Ms.13 which was 
written in 1871, enactments pertaining to the 
practice of ritual slaughter and the examination of 
the lungs of animals are recorded. These 
enactments were formulated in Sefrou by R. Amor 
Abitboul and R. Amram Elbaz in the year 1847. 
Some of the enactments were that the 
slaughterer’s knife and the lungs of animals must 
be examined by two people, one is insufficient. 
Also ritual slaughterers shall not use their 
occupation as an excuse for not attending 
morning services at the synagogue, since 
henceforth no slaughtering shall commence 
before the conclusion of morning services. The 
Abitboul family perpetuated an unbroken chain of 
leadership at Sefrou throughout this period. The 
members of the Abitboul family are noted in 
several documents of the collection. 


The leading scholar at Salé during this period 
was R. Eliezer b. R. Samuel D’Avila. His father, 
R. Samuel b. R. Moses who was born in Meknés, 
studied under R. Hayyim ibn Attar |, and married 




All communities 




the latter's granddaughter. R. Samuel left Mekneés 
because of the excessive taxes that were levied 
on him and he made his home at Salé. R. Samuel’s 
aspiration to travel to Jerusalem was realized as 
Ms.135 testifies. In that epistle R. Samuel informs 
R. Jacob Ibn Zur that he has purchased several 
books for him and states that they should be paid 
for. R. Eliezer, who was called “Rav Adda,” was 
born in 1714 and he married the daughter of R. 
Elijah Halevi b. Susan of Salé, at age fifteen. 
Although R. Eliezer died at the age of forty-seven, 
in 1761, he was a prolific scholar. Many of his 
works were posthumously published by his son- 
in-law. 


R. Eliezer D’Avila appears in Ms.47, where his 
mother disputes with him over the estate of his 
late father, R. Samuel. R. Eliezer agrees that half 
of the properties should be given to his mother in 
accord with the custom of the enactment of the 
Jews of Castile. However, he claims that he has no 
properties available to give to his mother since 
they were sold to realize money for her 
maintenance and to pay off his father’s debts. 


Another dispute involving the inheritance 
between members of the D’Avila family of an 
earlier generation is recorded in Ms.178. R. 
Mordecai Berdugo wrote to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
concerning this dispute. R. Moses b. Jacob 
D’Avila of Meknés, who was apparently a grand- 
son of the late R. Judah D’Avila, was engaged ina 
litigation with another grandson, named Judah 
D’Avila, over wine barrels that once belonged to 
the late R. Judah D’Avila. R. Mordecai Berdugo 
asks R. Jacob Ibn Zur to endorse either R. 
Mordecai’s decision or R. Jacob Toledano’s 
decision in the same dispute, In Ms.119 R. 
Mordecai Berdugo notes that R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
decided with him against R. Jacob Toledano. 


R. Moses ibn Hamo wrote to R. Menahem 
Serero, in Ms.197, explaining that R. Jacob 




25 




All communities 




D’Avila, who was a party to a dispute, was unable 
to participate in the proceedings because of ill 
health. Therefore, he should not be cited for 
obstructing justice. This R. Jacob D’Avila, who 
had a son called Meir, may also have been the 
father of R. Moses D’Avila who was the grand- 
father of Eliezer b. Samuel D’Avila. 




Among the leading rabbinic scholars of 
Tetuan during the second half of the eighteenth 
century was R. Judah b. R. Abraham Coriat. We 
have already mentioned that R. Judah was a co- 
signer with R. Ephraim Monsonyego of a letter of 
consolation written to R. Samuel Ibn Zur on the 
passing of his father, see Ms.77. Many of the 
literary works produced by R. Judah were 
destroyed in the reign of terror of Al-Yazid in the 
year 1790. R. Judah passed on c. 1788, but his 
son, Isaac, was able to salvage some works which 
he took to the Holy Land. R. Judah is also men- 
tioned in Ms.155 as one of the judges in Tetuan 
together with the rabbis Judah and Solomon 
Abudarham. R. Judah Abudarham passed on 
after 1780. Members of this family of the previous 
generation are noted in Ms.252; namely, R. 
Samuel Abudarham and Joseph Abudarham. The 
subject of that document is Abraham ibn Amara 
who was in trouble with the ruling authorities 
and was obliged to call in bills of debt in order to 
realize money by which he could redeem himself. 
Itis probable that the author of the liturgical work 
Sefer Abudarham (a printed edition appears in the 
Collection) was R. David Abudarham of the 
fourteenth century, a Spanish antecedent of this 
family which resided in Tetuan. 




Another scholar of eminence in Tetuan during 
this period was R. Judah Halevi. He may be 
identified with R. Judah Halevi who was at Salé 
during this period, as may be noted from Mss. 130 




26 




and 132. R. Judah did move about from one 
community to another throughout his lifetime. 
After leaving Tetuan the first time he made his way 
to Algiers where he involved himself in controver- 
sy with the chief of the rabbinic court, R. Jacob b. 
Na’im but he returned to Tetuan and established 
an academy. Then he left Tetuan again with the 
desire to get to the Holy Land and made his way 
there via Gibraltar, where he remained for five 
years and established another academy. He did 
not get to the Holy Land, however. Indeed, in 
1790, he desired to return to Tetuan, but a storm 
brought him to Algiers. This turn of events was 
fortunate, since the persecutions of Al-Yazid’s 
short reign (1790-1792) began soon afterwards. 
R. Judah lost all his possessions that remained in 
Tetuan while he tarried at Algiers. Subsequently, 
he made his way to Livorno, Italy, and then he 
returned to Gibraltar. 


R. Judah Halevi’s family achieved prominence 
at Gibraltar in the generations that followed. Ha- 
Zevi Me’at Devash, who was a book dealer in 
Jerusalem during the third quarter of the 
nineteenth century, informs R. Raphael |bn Zur of 
Fez that the books he had ordered will be sent to 
the Halevi family at Gibraltar once they are 
available. These transactions are recorded in 
Mss.264, 145, and 238. The last two corre- 
spondences mention Moses Halevi as the agent 
for the transactions. R. Judah Halevi’s last journey 
to Gibraltar, where he stayed until his demise, was 
that travelled by many Moroccan Jews after the 
persecutions of 1790; especially by those Jews 
who lived in Tetuan which was in close proximity 
across the Strait of Gibraltar. 




Leading scholars— 


nineteenth century 


R. Samuel Ibn Zur of Fez, who was also known as 
Solomon Samuel, had two sons, R. Jacob Ibn Zur 




and R. Raphael Ibn Zur. The subject of his estate 
after his demise is found in Ms.31. This document 
was composed in Fez, in the month of Heshvan 
1791. At that date Jacob Ibn Zur is reported to bea 
bachelor while Raphael is married and their 
mother is the third party to share in the estate. All 
three are agreed never to dissolve the estate. 
Jacob is given permission to pay for his future 
marital expenses from it. Both sons have made 
available to their mother half of what they each 
received. The remainder of the document 
stipulates how the perpetuation of the estate in 
future generations is to be ensured. 


R. Jacob Ibn Zur, who served as a rabbi at Fez, 
passed on in the year 1850 at about the age of 
seventy years. R. Jacob had a son called R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur (1821-1873). R. Solomon 
Elijah lbn Zur is mentioned in Ms.3, in a letter of 
reconciliation that was sent by Abraham b. Saul 
ibn David ve-Joseph to R. Solomon in the year 
1864. R. Abraham appeals to R. Solomon not to 
let false statements that were made against him 
become a reason for accusing him of taking 
letters of correspondence that belonged to R. 
Solomon Elijah and to the latter’s grandfather R. 
Solomon Samuel for whom he was named. R. 
Abraham also writes that R. Solomon Elijah is 
married to his sister. In the concluding portion of 
this epistle, Abraham discusses a litigation in 
which he is involved. It appears that R. Jacob, the 
father of R. Solomon Elijah, refuses to adjudicate 
because R. Jacob is wroth with Abraham. Finally, 
R. Jacob Serero is obliged to decide the matter. R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur, the brother of R. Jacob Ibn Zur, 
also had a son called Solomon, who passed on in 
1843 at the age of thirty-seven. Although R. 
Solomon was not appointed as a judge, he was 
considered to be among the leading scholars of 
Fez. 


R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur is mentioned in 




Leading scholars 




thirty-one different documents in the Collection. 
A member of the celebrated Hasin family of 
Meknés, who were prolific poets, namely, Aaron 
Hasin, corresponded with R. Solomon in 1860, in 
Ms.7. Often many scholars turned to R. Solomon 
to render Halakhic decisions for them. Among 
them were Elijah b. Haroush, in Ms.8; see also 
Samuel ibn Elbaz, Ms.10. R. Judah Berdugo, of 
Meknés, who left Morocco for the Holy Land, 
turned to R. Solomon asking him to render a 
decision which would enable him to realize the 
cash which the former needed and which could be 
available from R. Judah’s portion of his grand- 
father’s estate. However, his late grandfather had 
stipulated that the estate should remain in 
perpetuity. R. Judah suggests that R. Yedidia 
Monsonyego is also available to R. Solomon for 
consultation. This case is discussed in Mss. 11 
and 265. R. Judah also offers to sell R. Solomon 
books on Responsa literature ata fair price. Other 
authorities who turned with their queries to R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur were R. Matitya ibn Zikhri, 
in Ms.12; R. Rahamin Joseph Gayni, of Sefrou, in 
1874 wins: 13: and R. Raphael Maman, of 
Meknés, in Ms.270. 


R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur cultivated many 
other interests. He copied historical information 
as well as biographical and bibliographical 
material, as may be noted from Ms.85. In the same 
document, R. Solomon Elijah states that his 
grandfather, R. Solomon Samuel Ibn Zur, in- 
formed his father, R. Jacob Ibn Zur Ill, that he saw 
R. Joseph Caro’s signature. R. Solomon Elijah 
received a letter from Judah Zarmon in 1866, 
Ms.52, wherein the latter requests that a copy of 
an historical work called “Divrei ha-Yamim” 
which is supposed to be in the possession of R. 
Rahamim Gayni of Sefrou, should be made 
available to him. This work was in the nature ofa 
diary of events that transpired from the Castilian 




2f. 




Leading scholars 




expulsion until the nineteenth century. R. 
Solomon Elijah also copied a collection of tales 
and aphorisms called Divrei Hakhamim Ke- 
Dérbénét, which appears in Ms.36. 


R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur’s son, R. Raphael III 
Ibn Zur, succeeded his father as rabbinic leader at 
Fez, c.1875. In Ms.120, Raphael is identified as R. 
Solomon’s son. R. Solomon Elijah was often 
referred to in correspondences as “Ham-Melekh 
Shlomo, “King Solomon and his son Raphael 
were often addressed as “Ham-Malakh Raphael,” 
the angel Raphael. Elijah b. Jacob Kasis, who 
served as an emissary for the Jerusalem com- 
munity, was also engaged in the book trade as can 
be ascertained from Ms.32, which was written to 
R. Raphael Ibn Zur, in 1863. R. Raphael’s pur- 
chase of books is also noted in Ms.54. Joseph 
Sasson is the Jerusalem book dealer who corre- 
sponds with him in 1880. Ha-Zevi Me’at Devash, 
of Jerusalem, sends books to R. Raphael via 
Gibraltar through the agency of Moses Halevi, as 
is noted in Ms.145. See also Ms.232 and Ms.264 
which deal with the acquisition of books. Elijah 
Kasis wrote three other correspondences per- 
taining to his function as an emissary, to the 
rabbis Raphael III Ibn Zur and Jacob Ha-Kohen, 
in Mss. 44, 45, and 48. The writer sent regards 
to a number of personalities in Fez who were 
contemporaries of R. Raphael III lbn Zur. Among 
them are the following: R. Solomon Ibn Zur, 
the Nagid Abraham, R. Abner Ha-Sarfati, R. 
Joshua Serero, R. Samuel Ha-Kohen, R. Israel 
Maymeran, Menahem Saba, R. Jacob Dahan, 
Azuz Ha-Kohen, Aaron Ha-Kohen, and Matitya 




Serero. 
R. Raphael Ill Ibn Zur was the recipient of 




many requests to come to the aid of the destitute, 
as in Ms.56; to aid emissaries, as inMs.101; andto 
resolve disputes or to respond to queries of a 
Halakhic nature. In Ms.55, Moses Turgeman of 




28 




Tiberias, in the Holy Land, asks R. Raphael to 
uphold a claim to an estate on behalf of the 
former's family. R. Raphael Ill Ibn Zur and R. 
Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati wrote a decision in a 
paternity suit against the seductor. He was 
flogged and fines were exacted from him. This 
court document, which appears in Ms.146, was 
written in 1876. The rabbis of Sefrou, Hayyim 
Elijah Gayni, Raphael Moses Elbaz, and Yekutiel 
ibn Elbaz ask R. Raphael II! Ibn Zur to serve as 
interim overseer of the estate of the late Raphael 
Ha-Kohen, in Mss. 203 and 204. R. Rahamim 
Joseph Gayni writes to R. Raphael asking him to 
render a decision in a difficult litigation. The 
former expects that R. Raphael’s review of the 
matter will finally lead to its resolution. This is the 
subject of Ms.200. 


R. Raphael Moses Elbaz wrote to R. Raphael 
Ibn Zur in Tammuz 1877, concerning the case of a 
husband who alleges that his wife is rebellious. 
Since the dispute reached a stalemate, R. Raphael 
is asked to try to achieve a compromise and if this 
fails then the latter should try to finalize the 
litigation as he sees fit. This case is reported in 
Ms.245. In Ms.246, R. Raphael Moses Elbaz again 
turns to R. Raphael Ibn Zur to serve as a final 
arbiter. The issue involves one who wants to 
challenge a communal enactment which 
prohibits astranger from marrying a woman of the 
community. In Ms.247, R. Raphael Moses Elbaz 
enquires of R. Raphael Ibn Zur concerning the 
custom in Fez governing the acquisition of 
groves, fields, and gardens. He wants to know 
whether the owner also acquires the right of 
domicile therein, the question having been 
prompted by aJew receiving land in pledge froma 
non-Jewish owner. Can he exercise the right of 
domicile over it and thereby prevent the non- 
Jewish owner from utilizing it as he sees fit? 
Another Halakhic query was posed by Joseph 




Sasson, an emissary from Jerusalem, of R. 
Raphael, in Ms.248, in the year 1877. The former 
was travelling amongst the towns of the Rif when 
a question concerning a levirate arose. A minority 
opinion was referred to from the only work 
available, the code Even ha-Ezer. Joseph, 
however, desires a more sound basis for render- 
ing a lenient opinion and he asks R. Raphael Ibn 
Zur to provide it with despatch. Rabbi Raphael III 
Ibn Zur’s son Solomon III is mentioned in Mss. 99 
and 100. 




R. Elijah b. Joseph Ha-Sarfati was blessed with 
a longevity which spanned almost all of the 
eighteenth century, from 1715 until 1805. He 
studied with R. Judah ibn Attar and he was one of 
the Court of Five scholars of Fez who were 
ordained by R. Jacob Ibn Zur before the latter’s 
demise. Subsequently, he served as the leading 
Halakhic scholar of Morocco during the last 
quarter of the eighteenth century. R. Elijah 
ordained R. Jacob Ibn Zur, the son of Solomon 
Samuel Ibn Zur and the great grandson of R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur, who had ordained R. Elijah. 


R. Elijah Ha-Sarfati composed an aggadic 
work called “Simu Lehem,” when he was fifteen, 
which appears in Ms.107.R. Elijah had two sons, 
R. Israel Jacob Ha-Sarfati who died at an 
advanced age in 1826 and R. Raphael Menahem 
Ha-Sarfati who passed on in 1843. The latter 
served as Nagid. 


A letter of adulation which was written in 
honor of R. Elijah Ha-Sarfati and his son Jacob 
appears in Ms.18. An emissary, Israel Jacob 
Halevi, pleads with R. Raphael Ha-Sarfati to aid 
his plight by rendering a judgement against the 
Nagid of Meknées who has made an unjustified 
claim on a portion of the emissary’s collection for 
the needs of the destitute of Meknes. The 
emissary states that he appeals to R. Raphael to 




Leading scholars 




deal with the issue since it requires the attention 
of the highest Halakhic authority and he imagines 
that only R. Raphael has the power to render a 
judgement in such a case. This subject is dealt 
with in Ms.236. This same emissary corresponded 
with R. Raphael in Ms.103. In this epistle he sends 
regards to Joseph, R. Raphael’s son. In Ms.89, an 
appeal is made to R. Raphael by R. Judah Elbaz to 
convince an intransigent debtor to make pay- 
ment. 


A plea by the Rishon Le-Zion, the Sephardi 
chief rabbi of Jerusalem, R. Hayyim Abraham 
Gagin, to Raphael Ha-Sarfati of Fez, in behalf of 
the former's son-in-law, R. Judah Zacut, is the 
subject of Ms.147. R. Judah who is the son of the 
illustrious mystic R. Moses Zacut is in need of 
financial aid to support his large family and the 
writer asks R. Raphael to use his office to extend 
all possible aid to him. A copy of the introduction 
to R. Moses Zacut’s work, Iggerét ha-Ramaz is 
found in Ms.1517. 


On another occasion a plea was sent to R. 
Raphael Ha-Sarfati to grant protection to a widow 
who is in transit, to help consummate the levirate 
responsibilities. The writer asks that she should 
be chaperoned by persons of high moral 
character and that her needs should be provided 
until she arrives at her destination. Also R. 
Raphael is asked to forward letters to all those 
communities where the widow will stay that they 
should prepare for her arrival. This plea is 
reported in Ms.148, which was composed in 1834- 
35. 


Samuel Halevi ibn Yulee corresponded with R. 
Raphael Menahem Ha-Sarfati on the tenth of 
Kislev 1841, from Gibraltar. Information about the 
whereabouts of the son of R. S. Aflalo is made 
available. R. Raphael is also reminded to concern 
himself with a litigation which involved the 
wealthy Isaac Ben Zaqen in order that justice may 




29

be served. This correspondence is the subject of 
Ms.152. A plea for charitable aid is addressed toR, 
Raphael Ha-Sarfati, who is designated with the 
appellation Ham-Malakh, by Zikhri Meshash. As 
Passover is soon approaching, Zikhri is depen- 
ding upon the merciful nature of R. Raphael to 
help him in his moment of economic adversity. 
This letter is the subject of Ms.222. In Ms.239, R. 
Hayyim Toledano extends an invitation to R. 
Raphael Ha-Sarfati to stay with him when he 
arrives at Meknés. R. Hayyim refers to the close 
relationship that existed between his father of 
blessed memory andR. Raphael. The writer sends 
greetings to R. Raphael's son Joseph. 


R. Israel Jacob Ha-Sarfati, the brother of the 
aforementioned Raphael, had a son called 
Solomon. Solomon's son, R. Vidal Ill, who lived 
from 1797-1856, was a profound rabbinic scholar 
and Talmudist who also served as a judge. In 
Ms.149, R. Hayyim Haluah who wrote to R. 
Hayyim David Ibn Zimra also addresses R. Vidal 
II! Ha-Sarfati. R. Vidal Ill had an illustrious son 
called R. Abner Israel (1827-1884) who servedasa 
rabbinic judge at Fez. He was the author of 
responsa and he is known for his historic work 
called Yahas Fez which contains information 
about the generations of scholars of Fez from the 
seventeenth century until his own time. He wrote 
this work in 1879 at the request of members of the 
Kol Israel Haverim (Alliance Israelite) Society 
who enquired about the origins of the Jewish 
community of Fez. R. Abner Israel was well versed 
in philosophy and mysticism and is noted in ten 
manuscript documents of the Bension Collection. 


A letter was sent by the communal leaders of 
Sefrou to the rabbis of Fez concerning fund 
raising irregularities that arose during an 
emissary's visit. The writer was R. Raphael 
Maman who wrote to the rabbis Saul ibn Danan, 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur, and Abner Israel Ha- 




30 




Sarfati concerning the funds that were collected 
by the Jerusalem emissary R. Barukh Pinto. This 
correspondence is found in Ms.39. 


On another occasion the rabbis of Sefrou, 
namely Rahamim Joseph Gayni, Raphael Moses 
Elbaz, and Saul Elbaz ask the rabbis of Fez, R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur and R. Abner Israel Ha- 
Sarfati to aid in settling prior claims against an 
estate which creditors are now suing. This 
document appears in Ms.57. In the month of Tishri 
1876 R. Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati and R. Raphael 
Ibn Zur rendered a decision and sentence against 
one who was accused in a paternity suit. This case 
is recorded in Ms. 146, 


Moses b. Aaron Attia composed a poetical 
collection called “Yashir Moshe” with an in- 
troduction wherein he moralizes about the 
function of speech and how it is ennobled by 
religious poetic compositions. He also was asked 
to compose appropriate verse for a pleasant Arab 
melody so as to elevate the melody from its 
secular state to the holy. The poems were 
accompanied with an explanation of the terms. 
This work was given a seal of approval by R. Abner 
Israel Ha-Sarfati. For the content of the individual 
poems refer to Ms.224, 


Joseph Sasson, a book dealer of Jerusalem, 
had R. Abner Israel as a client as can be 
ascertained from Mss. 54 and 232. Joseph also 
sent regards to R. Abner ina letter that the former 
sent to R. Raphael Ibn Zur, as may be noted in 
Ms.248. The emissary Elijah b. Jacob Kasis sent 
his regards to R. Abner in his correspondences to 
the rabbis Jacob Ha-Kohen and Raphael Ibn Zur 
in Mss. 32 and 48. 


A letter was prepared by the rabbis of Fez in 
the: month of Tammuz 1838 introducing an 
emissary of Tiberias to the region of Tafilalet. 
Among the rabbis, Hayyim Abraham Ha-Sarfati is 
mentioned, On this occasion the rabbis proclaim- 




ed a malediction and excommunication on all 
those who would refuse to extend aid and a 
blessing upon those who would grant such aid. 
This correspondence is the subject of Ms.240. 




R. Matitya Serero (1718-1788), who was 
ordained by his grandfather R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
(d.1753), had seven sons who became scholars. 
They were the following: R. Saul; R. Menahem 
(1744-1780); R. Joshua (d. 1814); R. Hayyim 
David, who passed away at the age of seventy- 
seven in 1826; R. Jacob, who died at the age of 
eighty-two; R. Judah, who died in a plague in 
1835; and R. Nahman. While the rabbis Saul, 
Joshua, Hayyim David, and Jacob were appoint- 
ed as judges, it was Hayyim David Serero who was 
the most illustrious. Two correspondences con- 
cerning R. Hayyim David appear in the collection; 
Ms.2 contains a letter which R. Hayyim David 
wrote to Mas’ud Arwah asking that a reconcilia- 
tion should take place between the latter and R. 
Abraham Pariente, and in Ms.184 R. Hayyim 
David was asked to render an Halakhic decision in 
a litigation. 


R. Jacob Serero adjudicated a litigation for R. 
Abraham b. Saul ibn David Ve-Joseph, according 
to the text of Ms.3and he is noted as one of the 
authorities of Fez who prepared a letter in- 
troducing an emissary of Tiberias to the area of 
Tafilalet, in 1838, as it is recorded in Ms.240. 
Jacob Serero and Reuben Serero served as 
judges together with Jacob Ibn Zur Ill when they 
signed an edict against unfair pricing in the city of 
Fez. This information is found in Ms.108. A letter 
of consolation which appears in Ms.260 was sent 
by the scholars Amor Abitboul and Amram Elbaz 
of Sefrou to the mourners R. Reuben Serero, R. 
Matitya Serero, R. Shalom Serero, and to R. 
Joshua Serero on the passing of R. Jacob Serero 
o.b.m., in the year 1855. 




Leading scholars 




Joshua Serero’s son, the aforementioned 
Reuben, served as a judge in Fez and signed a 
court document in 1851, together with R. Judah 
Elbaz and R. Yedidia Monsonyego, in a ruling 
concerning the erection of a structure that 
blocked the public throughfare. This document is 
found in Ms.202. Reuben passed on in 1856. 
Another Joshua Serero who was active c.1860 is 
noted in Mss.32, 44, 48, and 260. 


R. Saul Serero and his contemporary R. 
Samuel Ibn Zur both pleaded with R. Solomon 
Toledano (in separate documents but on the 
same page, 176a, which contains Mss. 126 and 
127) to expedite the cause of justice in a case 
which still has not been adjudicated. In the year 
1788, R. Elijah Monsano was disputing with his 
uncle. Hayyim Monsano over property. The 
rabbinic court in Fez could not deal with the 
matter, since the authorities were related to the 
litigants; so the case was to be adjudicated in 
Meknés. However, since the parties to the dispute 
from Fez did not arrive in Meknés, the rabbis of 
Tetuan, namely R. Solomon Toledano, R. Solo- 
mon Abudarham, and the young R. Abraham 
Monsonyego, turned to the rabbis of Fez to 
adjudicate the matter. The rabbis of Fez, Samuel 
Ibn Zur and Saul Serero, still insist that the rabbis 
of Meknés should complete the judgement. This 
material is noted in Ms.155. 


R. Judah ibn Attar Il (c.1725-1812), the son of 
R. Obed b. Attar and the grandson of the Great 
Rabbi Judah ibn Attar, was a contemporary of the 
aforementioned R. Saul Serero. R. Judah was 
appointed as a judge together with R. Saul and he 
acceded to the position as chief judge in Fez, 
c.1810. Prior to their period of rabbinic 
leadership, during the reign of Muhammad ibn 
Abdallah (1759-1790), a tranquil atmosphere had 
prevailed in Morocco, and Marrakesh became the 
center of political activity. Jews served the 




31 




Leading scholars 




interests of the government in areas of diplomacy. 
This atmosphere was marred when Mulay al- 
Yazid, Abdallah’s son, succeeded his father and 
instituted a reign of terror which lasted for two 
years, from 1790 to 1792. During this terrible time 
when the majority of the prestigious Jewish 
citizenry and the rabbis of Fez fled, R. Judah ibn 
Attar Il stayed with the remaining Jews and has 
left us an eye witness account of the occurrences. 


Anti-Jewish hatred, unknown to such an 
extent since the Almohad persecution in the days 
of Maimonides, led to the demise of a multitude of 
Jewish communities and the decimation of the 
Jewish population. Muslims who tried to save 
Jews were subjected to torture when Mulay al- 
Yazid learned of their activities. This ruler 
eventually died as the result of a wound and his 
reign was brought to an abrupt end. 


A litigation which arose out of the conditions 
of these tumultuous times is recorded in Ms.117. 
As a result of the pillage which transpired during 
the days of the arch-enemy Sahiq Tamia Galul, 
the inheritors of a creditor known as R. Aaron Ha- 
Kohen 0.b.m. were unable to collect certain debts 
that were owed to their ancestor. Eventually these 
notes of indebtedness were unearthed during the 
reign of the Sultan Mulay Suleiman, who ruled 
from 1792 to 1822. A judgement was rendered in 
favor of the descendants of the creditor. A more 
recent decision was cited concerning a similar 
case which was adjudicated in the presence of the 
rabbis Saul Serero, Judah ibn Attar Il, and 
Raphael Ibn Zur. The last two were recorded as 
having been dead at the time that this document 
was written. 




R. Raphael Aaron Monsonyego who served as 
a judge in Fez, and who enjoyed longevity, 
(d.1840), was blessed with a son, R. Yedidia 
Monsonyego, who was one of the most prolific 




32 




authors of the nineteenth century. R. Yedidia, who 
also served as a judge in Fez, passed away in 1868. 
He once wrote a letter of reference for R. David 
Monsano who was in need of financial support 
(recorded in Ms.6), alluding to the fact that a 
scholar named Saul was the cause of David’s 
tribulations. 


R. Yedidia served as a judge together with R. 
Solomon Ibn Zur, as is apparent in Mss. 11 and 
265, where R. Judah Berdugo asks that R. 
Solomon should take counsel with R. Yedidia 
concerning Judah’s claim to an inheritance. This 
query was written in 1862. In Ms.268 a plea is 
made to the rabbis. Yedidia Monsonyego and 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur to render a decision on 
behalf of a dead orphan. R. Solomon Elijah Ibn 
Zur notes in Ms.85 that R. Yedidia Monsonyego 
discusses the problem of tribulations that the 
corpse undergoes in the grave after death in 
the latter’s work “Kupat Rokhlim.” In Ms.110 a 
letter of a Halakhic nature which was sent to R. 
Yedidia is recorded. R. Yedidia’s son-in-law, 
who is anonymous, attributes a booklet of Halak- 
hic riddles in the form of responsa to the former’s 
authorship. It is described in Ms.191. The name 
of Yedidia Monsonyego is found in an incomplete 
poetic text which appears as Ms.102. 




In the community of Meknés the Berdugo and 
Toledano families continued their hegemony 
throughout the nineteenth century. One of the 
outstanding figures of the Berdugo family during 
this period was R. Raphael Berdugo (1747-1822). 
In a judgement which was rendered by the rabbis 




_of Meknés, Matitya Berdugo, Abraham Amor, and 




Jacob Berdugo, in 1867, they cited the authority 
for their decision as R. Raphael Berdugo. This 
judgement was sent to the rabbis of Fez in 
connection with the case of a man adjudged as 
unfit to take a second wife on the grounds that he 




would be unable to support two wives. All the 
details are recorded in Ms.243. 


R. Joseph Elmaleh (d.1823), who was ap- 
pointed chief of the rabbinic court in Salé-Rabat 
before 1788, corresponded with R. Raphael Ber- 
dugo on certain matters and about certain cases 
in Jewish law which were of mutual interest to 
both scholars. R. Joseph asks R. Raphael to inter- 
cede in a case involving an inheritance which 
was being disputed. In another matter R. Joseph 
states that he agreed with R. Raphael’s decision. 
A fuller treatment of the correspondence is given 
in Ms.167. 




R. Raphael Berdugo shared leadership in 
Meknes with R. Barukh Toledano (1738-1817), 
with whom he often became embroiled in 
vehement dispute, and with R. Petahiah Mordecai 
Berdugo (1764-1820). R. Samuel b. Waish was 
also reckoned as one of the leading scholars in 
Meknés at this time. In Ms.184, Abraham, the son 
of Samuel b. Waish, wrote to R. Hayyim David 




Serero of Fez asking for his learned opinion ina 
matter pertaining to Jewish law. Abraham states 
that he wrote the letter on behalf of his father who 
could not write at night. 




There were other scholars in Meknes who 
deserve to be mentioned although members of 
neither the Berdugo nor the Toledano families. 
Among them are R. Benjamin Laikhraif, who is 
mentioned in Ms.18 and R. Raphael Maman, 
whose son R. Shalom was also a scholar of note. 
R. Raphael Maman responded to the rabbis of Fez 
as to why an emissary’s funds were held back fora 
prolonged period, in Ms.39. On three other 
occasions R. Raphael Maman wrote to R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur concerning litigations 
which involved a daughter's share in her father’s 
estate (Ms.270), a divorcée who claimed her 
settlement was unjust (Ms.271), and a short 




Leading scholars 




note concerning some litigations (Ms.273). 


R. Samuel Halevi ibn Yulee who lived in Mek- 
nés was also known to have made his residence in 
Tangier and to have settled in Gibraltar. In a cor- 
respondence to R. Raphael Menahem Ha-Sarfati 
of Fez (Ms.152) R. Samuel Halevi wrote, in 1841, 
that he was in Livorno. The letter was, however, 
written upon R. Samuel’s arrival at Gibraltar. R. 
Raphael is reminded about a litigation which 
involves the prosperous Isaac Ben Zaqen, to 
which he should direct himself. R. Samuel Amar 
who served as a rabbi in Meknés (d.1890) and 
composed responsa is noted in Ms.153, where the 
writer pleads, for him to extend aid to R. Jacob 
Ha-Kohen who needs to raise funds for his 
daughter’s forthcoming marriage. R. Samuel 
Amar had a son, R. Shalom, who excelled in the 
rabbinate of Meknes. R. Abraham Amar was 
also a rabbinic scholar in Meknés according to 
Ms.243. 


One of the outstanding rabbinic scholars of 
the nineteenth century was R. Raphael Moses 
Elbaz of Sefrou, who died at the age of seventy- 
three in 1896. R. Raphael Moses was a prolific 
author in the fields of Halakha and Liturgy. At the 
age of twenty-eight he was already a judge of the 
rabbinic court in Sefrou. R. Raphael Moses Elbaz 
joined the rabbis Rahamim Joseph Gayni and 
Saul Elbaz in pressing a claim on behalf of some 
creditors of Sefrou who had prior claims against 
an estate. The rabbis Solomon Elijah lbn Zur and 
Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati of Fez are asked to pursue 
the matter in the interest of justice. This cor- 
respondence appears in Ms.57. 


The signatures of the rabbis Raphael Moses 
Elbaz and Judah Ha-Kohen appear in Ms.155, a 
copy of an older legal correspondence that was 
dated 1788. Apparently, an old dispute about 
property amongst members of the Monsano 
family, had never been concluded. It was prob- 




33 




igi i 




Leading scholars 




ably brought to the attention of the rabbis Elbaz 
and Ha-Kohen by descendants of the disputants. 
This signature of R. Raphael Moses Elbaz is 
significantly different and appears to belong to 
a much earlier period in his legal career than do 
his signatures in Mss.203, 204, 245, 246, and 
247 which were written many years later to R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur. 


There are two more correspondences by R. 
Raphael Moses Elbaz which contain his unique 
signature and which are of interest. In Ms.268, 
Raphael Moses wrote to the rabbis of Fez, Yedidia 
Monsonyego and Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur, to right 
an injustice that had been perpetrated against a 
dead orphan, since the court was the proper 
caretaker of the orphan and the widow. In Ms.269, 
R. Raphael Moses asks R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur 
to extend aid to the former’s relative, Mordecai 
Elbaz, who is frugal, and an avid student of Torah 
and Zohar. In the same correspondence an 
enquiry is made concerning one who paid his 
debt late, whether an additional penalty should be 
paid. 


In the second half of the nineteenth century 
a number of Moroccan rabbinic scholars left to 
settle in the Holy Land. One of these was R. 
Joseph b. Moses Arwaz of Rabat. He settled in 
Jaffa where he served as chief of the rabbinic 
court for the community of Sephardim. In Ms.41 
we learn that R. Joseph Arwaz, now serving 
as an emissary for the Moroccan community 
in the Holy Land, wrote to R. Raphael Ibn Zur 




of Fez on the eighth day of lyar 1876, informing | 




him of the trials and tribulations which hindered 
his mission. There were individuals who would 
prevent a successful fund raising effort from 
being realized he says, and the destitute of 
the Moroccan Jewish communities in the Holy 
Land suffer as a result. R. Joseph Arwaz’s 
signature is accompanied by a seal which 




34 




contains writing composed in three languages, 
namely, Hebrew and Arabic, with the Roman 
initials J.A. inscribed in a wreath at the Seal’s 
center. 


At the age of thirty R. David Ben Simeon 
left Rabat in 1854 for Jerusalem, where he 
helped to establish an organized community for 
Sephardim of the west (Morocco). He was also 
instrumental in the building of synagogues and 
schools. He served as chief of the rabbinic court 
from 1860 to 1880 when he passed away. His son, 
R. Raphael Aaron Ben Simeon, became a leader 
of the community after his father’s demise and 
was sent in 1887 and again in 1891 as an emissary 
to Morocco. 


R. Raphael Hayyim Moses Benaim left Tetuan 
for the Holy Land in 1860 and he settled in 
Tiberias. After he was appointed a member of the 
rabbinic court he was sent to Morocco as an 
emissary. When he arrived in Gibraltar he was 
appointed to serve as the rabbi of that community. 


Other Moroccan scholars made their way to 
Tiberias. R. Raphael Maman (c.1810-1880) left for 
the Holy Land at a young age and aspired to 
rabbinic positions, serving in Tiberias and then in 
Safed. R.Solomon b.R. Jacob Toledano was born 
in Meknés in 1835 and he travelled to Tiberias in 
1858, where he was subsequently appointed to 
the rabbinic court as a judge. He was sent 
afterwards as an emissary to Morocco. He was 
destined never to return to the Holy Land since he 
passed on in the community of Taza in 1877. R. 
Raphael Ohana was also born in Meknés, in 1850, 
and he made his way to Tiberias in 1865. Later he 
served as an emissary on several occasions. He 
passed on in 1902 and was buried in Safed. 


Many scholars and saints were desirous of 
settling in the Holy Land, but the function that 
they fulfilled for the masses of Jews who needed - 
them often prevented them from ever reaching the 




promised land. This function was akin to the role 
that the “Rebbe,” the Hasidic master fulfilled for 
eastern European Jewry. The famous Moroccan 
mystic R. Jacob Abi-Hasira of Tafilalet was such 
an individual, whose renown as a holy man 
reached far and wide. He commingled moments 
of solitude with caring for the needs of the 
destitute, which is reminiscent of R. Israel Ba’al 
Shem Tob, the founder of Hasidism. When R. 
Jacob attempted to make his way to the Holy Land 
the Jews who needed him placed obstacles in his 
path. He was only able to get as far as Egypt, 
where he passed away on the twentieth day of 
Tevet 1880 at the age of seventy-two years. The 
day of his death has been celebrated ever since as 
“Hilula,” a holy celebration. 




The influence of Europe 
and the United States 
The efforts of France and Spain to extend their 
spheres of influence into North Africa were met 
with opposition from the sultans of Morocco at 
the beginning of the nineteenth century. Mulay 
Suleiman, who ruled from 1792 to 1822, was under 
the illusion that by significantly reducing trade 
with Europe he could stop the foreign powers’ 
attempts to dominate Morocco. Since Jews were 
actively involved in foreign trade they were 
suspected of being in the service of the European 
powers and as a result repressive measures were 
applied against them. Jews who were previously 
granted special privileges to dwell in prosperous 
communities were now obliged to live in ghettos 
known as ‘mellahs.’ While Tunisian and Algerian 
Jewry were gaining more rights, the Jews of 
Morocco were obliged to conform to all the 
disabilities of the pact of Omar which relegated 
them to second class citizenship. 


The juridical disabilities that were enforced 
during the early nineteenth century encouraged 




Europe and the United States 




pogroms against Moroccan Jewry. Epidemics 
that occurred in 1799 and 1818 also took their toll. 
It was not surprising that many individuals who 
could leave for the Holy Land did so not only 
because of their fervent love for their ancestral 
homeland, but also because local conditions in 
Morocco were most undesirable compared to the 
more liberal atmosphere that prevailed in other 
countries where Jews took up domicile. Moroc- 
can Jews migrated to the Americas and some 
returned to Spain and Portugal to establish 
communities for the first time since the expulsion 
of 1492. Subsequent rulers of Morocco still turned 
to their Jewish subjects to render service in the 
fields of diplomacy and commerce. This policy 
was pursued during the reigns of Mulay Abd al- 
Rahman (1822-1859), Mulay Muhammad ben Abd 
al-Rahman (1859-1873), and Mulay al-Hasan 
(1873-1894). 


European Jewry began to look southward to 
the plight of their fellow religionists after the 
middle of the nineteenth century. The appalling 
conditions under which the Jews lived in Morocco 
at this time caught the attention of the famous 
English Jew of Sephardic extraction, Sir Moses 
Montefiore, whose philanthropy was legendary. 
At an advanced age he journeyed to Morocco to 
see if he could ameliorate the conditions of his co- 
religionists, and as a result of his efforts the Sultan 
Mulay Muhammad issued a proclamation called 
Dahir, on the fifteenth of February 1864, which 
was to. ensure equality before the law to all his 
subjects. It was, alas, shortlived. 




Included among the manuscripts in the 
“Yalkut Roiim,” volume compiled by Ariel Ben- 
sion, is a printed issue of the Hebrew publication 
“Ha-Libanon” (Vol. 3, No. 9, pp. 129-144), dated 
the eleventh of lyar 1866 which contains an article 
reporting the arrival of Sir Moses Montefiore 
in the Holy Land, on the eleventh of Nisan 1866. 




35 




Europe and the United States 




On that occasion he planned a Jewish quarter 
for domicile outside the Old City of Jerusalem. 
The article appears in Pr.133 5 (Pr.-printed rather 
than manuscript document.) 


Occasionally other Jewish organizations and 
prestigious individuals took a cue from the 
precedent established by Sir Moses Montefiore 
and tried to intervene with the ruling authority of 
Morocco on behalf of the Jews. The Anglo-Jewish 
Association of London tried to have the Sultan 
issue a new Dahir about ten years after the first 
was issued and revoked. Among the concerned 
individuals who attempted to improve the condi- 
tion of Jews of the Maghreb were Dr. Albert 
Cohen in 1860, Hayyim Gedaliah in 1864 and 
again in 1888, and Mr. Marcus of Boston, 
Massachusetts in the United States, in 1885. The 
organization that played a decisive role with an 
eye to the future development of Moroccan Jewry 
was the Paris based Alliance Israelite Universelle, 
known in Hebrew as “Kol Yisrael Haverim.” The 
Alliance was also in the vanguard of those who 
labored for the improvement of the legal status of 
the Jews in the Maghreb. 


The Alliance organized a network of 
educational institutions in Morocco. The first 
school was opened in Tetuan in 1862. The schools 
served to bridge the cultural gap by giving the 
young the wherewithal to meet the challenges of 
modern western society. The schools also served 
as focal points whereby many other services were 
made available to local Jewish communities. The 
Alliance schools were not welcomed by all 
quarters of the rabbinic leadership. Some rabbis 
regarded the introduction of secular studies as an 
effort that would oblige students to neglect their 
religious studies. 


The proceedings of the sixth meeting of Kol 
Israel Haverim appears in printed form in Pr.73.5. 
Among the participants are the following: the 




36 




aforementioned Dr. Albert Cohen, Rabbi Artoum 
of the London Sephardic community, the Chief 
Rabbi of France, and the official Nissim Shamama 
of Tunis, amongst others. A review of the year’s 
previous activities, a financial report, and arecord 
of the number of members is given. America 
begins to play a role and the B’nai Brith Organiza- 
tion is mentioned. It is reported that Serbian Jews 
desire to colonize the Holy Land but funds are not 
available for this purpose. 


In Ms.206 there appears a correspondence 
from Ish Za’ir of Fez to the Alliance Israelite 
Universelle in Paris. The writer commends the 
organization for undertaking the publishing of the 
responsa of R. Asher b. Yehiel. Ish Za’ir reports 
that internal Jewish communal politics in Fez are 
holding back the appointment of the two dele- 
gates who are to come to Paris. He also requests 
the appointment of a resident representative 
for Jewish matters to be stationed in Fez. In his 
opinion this would be an effective way of improv- 
ing the condition of the Jews. The writer states 
that the community of Fez will be unable to raise 
funds for Jewish causes as did Gibraltar, because 
economic conditions have deteriorated con-

Morocco became a French Protectorate in 
1912. Subsequently, the state of affairs which had 
prevailed between the Muslims and Jews for 
twelve centuries was upset by the arrival of the 
French. They became a third force, and drove a 
wedge between Jews and Moslems. Since the 
source material of the Bension collection con- 
cludes at the end of the nineteenth century | shall 
conclude the historical sketch at this point. 


The purpose of this introduction has been to 
give the reader an historical perspective for the 
Bension manuscripts and texts. The Sephardic 
character of the collection has also been 
elaborated upon. Space was devoted to the 




political events in Morocco because a significant 
part of this collection deals with life in Morocco 
from the seventeenth century until the nineteenth 
century. Since a dearth of source material is 
available for this historical period the collection is 
all the more valuable. It will be noted that 
Moroccan Jewry played a dynamic role in the 
preservation and perpetuation of Sephardic 
culture in the four hundred and fifty years 
following the Spanish expulsion. The cultural 
values of the native Jewish population of Morocco 




Europe and the United States 




which were conserved in an unbroken chain of 
tradition, dating back to the days of the destruc- 
tion of the Temple, were given vigorous expres- 
sion when they were amalgamated with the 
Spanish Jewish heritage of the pre-expulsion 
period. This process of conservation of cultures 
was accomplished under very trying political and 
social conditions. The next section will deal with 
the source material of the manuscripts and texts 
in detail.

The two hundred and seventy-five manuscript 
documents and correspondences described in 
this section were originally collated in the volume 
designated “Yalkut Rojim.” The compiler, who 
was in all likelihood Dr. Ariel Bension, had in- 
scribed in ink at the top of the first page of this 
collection “Yalkut Rojim, part III.” The volume 
contained 356 pages. We are confronted with an 
unresolved mystery as to what has happened to 
the other two bound volumes of manuscripts. 


The title “Yalkut Roiim” means “Collected 
writings of the shepherds.” The term “shepherds” 
refers to the rabbinic leaders of Moroccan Jewry. 
The manuscripts did not appear in the book in any 
organized sequence. In fact, while the pages were 
‘numbered in ink, often half of one page would 
appear several pages later because of the way the 
manuscripts were sewn into the text. Blank pages 
were also numbered. 




In order to serve the needs of scholars and 
interested students, and to aid in the method of 
reproduction, each separate manuscript has been 
removed from the original volume and placed in 
an individual case. It is hoped that this method of 
handling the manuscripts will aid in their preser- 
vation. Those desiring to use copies of the 
manuscripts described in this section for their 
research should prefix the manuscript number for 
which they are asking with the letters B.C.Y.R.Ms. 
The symbol B means Bension, C means Cohen, Y 
means Yalkut, R. means Roiim, and Ms. means 
manuscript. Printed documents are given the 
prefix “Pr.” rather than “Ms.” 


The page numbers referred to in this section 
are based on the pagination found in the volume 
wherein the documents were originally bound.

A letter of reconciliation called Divrei Shalom 
Ve-emet 




This letter of reconciliation is written to R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur, the son of the Torah 
scholar R. Jacob Ibn Zur, by Abraham the son of 
Saul Ibn David Ve-Joseph. The writer intends to 
set the record straight as well as to achieve a 
reconciliation. That is why he calls the letter 
Divrei Shalom Ve-Emet, which means “Words of 
Peace and Truth.” 


Abraham claims that he was falsely accused 
by R. Solomon Elijah. He appeals to the latter not 
to believe these false accusations: “R. Samuel (R. 
Solomon’s sister’s husband) informed me of that 
which you accuse me, namely, that | took letters 
of correspondence that belonged to you and your 
grandfather, Solomon, of blessed memory, which 
would destroy a long friendship.” Abraham’s son 
is ill He asks R. Solomon to recite prayers in 
behalf of his son; since R. Solomon is descended 
from such an illustrious line of rabbis his prayers 
will have especial merit. 




A ms. copy of a collection of letters called Kitvei 
Ha-Qodesh pertaining to Halukah 




The collection of letters is called Kitvei Ha- 
Qodesh because all the letters relate to the needy 
communities in the Holy Land. The first letter of

Abraham does not hesitate to exhort R. 
Solomon to improve his own character. On page 
5a, the writer states that R. Solomon Ibn Zur is 
married to his sister. He also prefaces a poem of 
friendship, “Shir Yedidut,” that he includes in the 
letter in honor of R. Solomon. The writer gives his 
full name as Abraham bar Saul David Ve-Joseph, 
in acrostic form. The authorship of the poem he 
attributes, however, to R. Raphael Jacob Ibn 
Simhon, who was still living when this letter was 
composed. The poem consists of twenty-two 
lines. The letter was written in the month of lyar 
1846 (see page 6a). The writer states that his 
epistle was not concluded for quite a while after it 
was commenced since his son had already 
recovered from his illness before the letter was 
sent. In the last part of the letter the writer 
discusses a litigation in which he was involved 
with one called Abraham Ibn Zagen. It was finally 
decided by R. Jacob Serero. R. Jacob |bn Zur, the 
father of R. Solomon, refused to judge the case on 
an earlier occasion because he was angry with the 
writer. 




this collection commences with a short excursus 
on Jewish history leading to the religio-historical 
importance of Tiberias. The one who is men- 
tioned in connection with fund raising for the 
great academy of the Jewish community of 
Tiberias, which is in dire need of funds, is the 
Haham Kollel R. Moses Pinto, the son of Isaac, 




0.b.m., who is descended from R. Jacob Pinto. 
The latter composed the work “Miqdash Melekh.” 
The date of this epistle is given as Shevat 1828. 
The debt had grown to over 300,000 gerush. The 
conditions were exacerbated by plagues of 
locusts. 


The second letter in this collection was written 
to the members of the community of Tetuan. They 
are informed that the great academy of Tiberias is 
maintaining the traditions that were set in Tiberias 
from the days of the Talmudic masters. Many 
misfortunes have created a great need for money 
for food and clothing and to pay debts including 
the interest that had accrued. The emissary who 
was sent was called R. Abraham ha-Cohen 
Duwayk. The date of this epistle is given as 1834 
and it was written at Tiberias. 


The third letter is to the scholars and com- 
munal officials of Fez, from Safed, the location of 
the tomb of R. Simeon bar Yohai. Money is 
needed to repair the holy synagogues, in par- 
ticular, the synagogue called “Ba’al Teshuvot,” 
where repentant sinners gain forgiveness. The 
structure is falling into great disrepair. R. Hayyim 
Ashkenazi is sent to the diaspora to raise the 
funds necessary for the rehabilitation project. The 
latter is a descendant of the author of “Pithei 
Levahoh” and “Hiddushei Shnei ham-Me6érét.” 
The leaders of Fez are asked to accompany the 




A ms. copy of a letter sent by R. Raphael Jacob 
Ibn Simhon on behalf of R. Samuel Koskaso 




The first four lines of this letter contain a poem 
commencing with the acrostic which spells out 
the name Raphael. It was written by R. Raphael 




A ms. copy of a letter written by R. Yedidia 
Monsonyego on behalf of R. David Monsano 




R. Yedidia Monsonyego writes this letter extolling 
tne virtues of R. David Monsano. The writer 
compares R. David to the biblical David who 




aforementioned emissary from house to house 
and that one gerush be donated for every member 
of the household to this special reconstruction 
fund. This letter is dated in the month of Elul 1835, 
and it is signed by the rabbis of Safed. 


The fourth letter is from the Sephardic 
communities of Jerusalem for the community of 
Ashkenazim Midrash Perushim, consisting of 
three houses of prayer and study. The misfor- 
tunes that have befallen the community include 
natural calamities such as an earthquake in 
Galilee as well as physical attacks from 
marauders. Great losses have been incurred both 
in money and in people, particularly by the 
Ashkenazim. The scholar R. David Devash, who 
was a Sephardi and a Jerusalemite, has been sent 
as an emissary. The communities are asked to 
extend him hospitality and to help him in his fund 
raising endeavor. The letter is signed for the 
directors of the Kollel Ashkenazim Midrash 
Perushim in the month of Tammuz 1842, at 
Jerusalem, by Nathan the son of R. Menahem 
Mendel of blessed memory. 


The fifth and final letter by this copyist is from 
the rabbis of Safed to Shalom b. Malkaasking him 
to receive the emissary R. Simeon Ha-Kohen and 
to extend to him all necessary aid and financial 
support in his endeavor to collect money to help 
rebuild the city of Safed. 




Jacob Ibn Simhon on behalf of R. Samuel 
Koskaso who has fallen upon hard times and 
requires financial aid. This letter of reference is 
written to the Jewish communities to help R. 
Samuel pay his debts. The epistle concludes with 
the prayer that the Messiah should come and that 
he shall remove the burden of the tax collectors. 




suffered tribulations because of Saul’s enmity. R. 
Yedidia notes that R. David suffered economic 
adversity because “two kings cannot wear one 
crown.” R. David Monsano was forced to seek his 
fortunes elsewhere because of Saul. The writer 
asks that financial support should be extended to 
R. David Monsano.

the singular one, and concludes with other forms 
of the word “Ehad.” It was composed in praise

An Halakhic query concerning a sale with an 
option to repurchase, but the inheritors are not

This query was sent to R. Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur, 
of Fez, by R. Samuel Ibn Elbaz of Sefrou. A house 
was sold by David ben Elijah Moses Ha-Kohen, 
his mother, and his brother, to Azuz Ha-Kohen 
with a provision that the vendors could 
repurchase the house at the same price, in the 
fifth year from the time of purchase. The 
aforementioned vendors, excluding David, are

spondence was sent. The date of this epistle is 
the fifth of Kislev 1860. The writer informs R. 
Solomon at length of his weakened physical and 
mental condition and of his inability to visit him 
but he is filled with desire to correspond with him.

rabbis at Fez to aid R. Barukh in his mission. The 
community of Debdou is also advised to follow 
the practice of Fez in this matter while the same 
applies to outlying villages. Even if any emissaries 
should appear from the Kollelim of Hebron, the 
emissary from Jerusalem shall take precedence.

deceased and the agreement did not include their 
inheritors. R.J. Caro states this ruling in Hoshen 
Mishpat 209:6; namely, that the descendants shall 
also be included in the terms of the transaction. 
The Maharshakh, Part Il, No. 32 and Beit Judah, 
Hoshen Mishpat, No. 14, state that at the time of 
the original transaction the term “to me and to my 
inheritors,” should have been included. R. Samuel 
Elbaz asks R. Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur to contact 
Azuz, who now resides in the latter’s jurisdiction, 
to resolve the matter, perhaps by reaching a 
compromise. 




that it should not be used as apayment for aclaim 
on a marriage contract, nor should it be sold or 
given as a pledge. It should always remain as a 
family inheritance so that future generations 
might benefit from the land’s produce. Judah has 
left Morocco and settled in Jerusalem, but while 




on a visit to Meknés, his brother granted him his 
portion of land as agift according to law. He wants 
to sell it because he really needs the money and 
since he resides in the Holy Land he wants to 
assure the purchaser that no claim will arise 
against the sale by any of the other relatives. 


R. Judah argues that the original contract does 
not actually contain the aforementioned stipula- 
tion, even though it might be claimed that sucha 
stipulation is indeed implied. He feels this is 
particularly the case, as the proper legal form of 
stipulating a condition, a “T’nai Kafull,” a double 
stipulation [an agreement stating both alterna- 
tives and their eventual consequences], is not

An Halakhic query asking if one partner marries 
must the other refrain from business transactions. 
Also an enactment concerning ritual slaughter 




This letter was addressed to R. Solomon Ibn Zur 
of Fez by R. Rahamim Joseph Gayni of Sefrou in 
the year 1871. The date is given in two different 
ways in this epistle. After two introductory 
paragraphs the writer poses a legal question and 
supplies an answer himself inthe third paragraph. 
The question is posed in the following manner: “If 
one of two partners weds, must the other partner 
refrain from transacting any business during the 
traditional seven days of post-nuptial festivities, 
just as one would be obliged to in the case of 
seven days of mourning? The work “Pri Hodosh 
Matei Aharon” is cited in the answer given, which 
states that if the younger of two brothers who are 
business partners marries, the older brother may 
transact the business, only the bridegroom must 
refrain. 




given. This is not a case of actual claimants as the 
present situation stands. Therefore, R. Judah 
turns to R. Solomon Ibn Zur of Fez to render a 
decision on the matter. R. Judah reminds R. 
Solomon that R. Yedidia Monsonyego is also 
available to R. Solomon for consultation. Inciden- 
tally, Judah offers books on Responsa literature 
to R. Solomon at a fair price. He also informs R. 
Solomon that a speedy response would be 
appreciated since he is obliged to return to the 
Middle East. [This letter was sent prior to another 
letter on the same subject which was sent in 1862. 
The second letter appeared in the original volume 
on page 334a, Ms.265.] 




took and that is now found in the possession of a 
third party? This would be in accord with Moram 
[Rema] in his amendment to Even ha-Ezer, 
chapter 160:3. Or can she not use the dowry for 
her support until the levirate marriage comes into 
force when the prospective husband becomes of 
age? This view would be in accord withR. Joseph 
Caro. R. Matitya states that he has heard that R. 
Solomon agrees with the former authority and 
wants to know if such is indeed the case? He asks 
for a speedy reply. 




In the last paragraph of the letter an enactment 
is presented concerning the ritual slaughter of 
animals and fowl. The main points of the 
enactment are as follows: 


“(1) Because people make light of the ex- 
amination of the knife of the ritual slaughterer and 
of the animal’s lungs, henceforth at least two 
people shall examine the knife and at least two 
people shall examine the lungs. 


(2) No ritual slaughter of animals or fowl shall 
commence before the hour when the morning 
services are completed, since those who are in the 
service of the abattoir use this as an excuse not to 
attend morning services. 


(3) Any ritual slaughterer violating the 
aforementioned enactments by slaughtering or 
examining lungs unaccompanied by another 
individual will mean this animal being declared 
unfit for human consumption. These rules do not 
apply to the slaughter of fowl which the ritual 
slaughterer can be trusted to do himself.”

This letter is more informative in nature than the 
usual type of inquiry. The writer supplied 
documents that were apparently of interest to R. 
Solomon Ibn Zur. Another document that was 
requested by R. Solomon could not be found by 




A court action legalizing the transfer of land from 
a non-Jew to a Jew for the welfare of the Jewish 
community 




Unscrupulous people are taking advantage of the 
poor by building shops on land that belongs to the 
non-Jew Al-Hawaja. This individual places all the 
purchasers of the shops at his mercy by ignoring 
all claims that they bring against him. He acts in 
this manner because he desires to destroy all 
those structures which house these shops. 
Sometimes he dismantles them and then claims 
the material as his own. The shopkeepers can do 
nothing to stop him and they suffer a complete 
loss.

An Halakhic exposition on succession to rabbinic 
leadership when a leader is temporarily in- 
capacitated 




Rabbi S. Atazi acceded to the role of rabbinic 
leader when his predecessor was temporarily 
incapacitated. The latter is now able to resume his 
duties and Rabbi S. Atazi’s future role is in 
question. The author of this legal opinion 
disagrees with the decision of the authority to 
whom he writes who had argued that a com- 
promise should be achieved similar to that which 
prevailed at the accession of R. Eleazarb. Azariah 
and R. Gamliel. He had based his decision on the 
version of the Talmud in the Propes edition, which 
requires that the honor of the second authority 
should be taken into consideration. 


The author of this expositon refers to the 
decision rendered by R. Joseph Caro in his codes, 
Orah Hayyim, 153:22, and Hoshen Mishpat, 149.

the writer. The latter states that he will not eat 
anything but fowl, even on the Sabbath, unless 
the aforementioned enactments are fulfilled and 
he is present during their implementation. He 
states that he will not buy meat from the butchers 
on any occasion. The writer gives his signature as 
Rahamim Joseph Gayni. 




ing the transfer of the land to R. Joseph 
Almosnino who has acquired it from the 
aforementioned Al-Hawaja. R. Joseph will sell the 
shops to the vendors at a fair price. Whoever 
refuses to abide by this arrangement loses the 
shops which revert back to Joseph. There is also 
the danger of a precedent being established 
whereby other unscrupulous people will ap- 
propriate land, as Al-Hawaja did, unless it is 
bought from him. It is noted in an addendum to 
this document that the chaotic political situation 
justifies this action being taken. This document 
was composed in the month of Nisan 1757 at Fez. 
The three rabbis who served as the tribunal were 
Saul Ibn Danan, Raphael Obed !bn Zur, and Elijah 
Ha-Sarfati. 




“If one lost the right to perform a ritual, the honor 
for which he paid in the past, because he is 
poverty-stricken, that right shall be returned to 
him when he again has the money to pay for the 
honor. The one who had the honor in the interim 
loses it completely.” R. Caro’s view is in accord 
with the Mordecai, Pereq Hezqat, No. 533. It is 
also in contradiction to the Propes edition of the 
Talmud. 


A further proof favoring the first appointed 
rabbi over the second is the case of the High Priest 
when temporarily disqualified. When the condi- 
tion which disqualified him passes he is restored 
to his previous position to the detriment of the one 
who replaced him. A further distinction is made by 
the author: when a monetary loss is incurred, 
such as in this situation, Rabbi S. Atazi should not 
even be considered. Whereas, in the performance 
of rituals, as was cited by R. Caro, no loss of 
money is involved. 




A certificate for one to serve as a ritual 
slaughterer, given at Fez, foraresident of Debdou 




A beautifully hand-written certificate, issued in 
Fez, authorizes Yamin Kohen ben Ishak of 
Debdou to serve as a Ritual Slaughterer. The 
candidate must agree to review all the laws 
thereto pertaining according to the ruling of 
Maharil and Maharash. The reason for issuing 
such a certification is given in the text as follows: 




A Jewess collects a debt from the niece of King 
Mulay Rashid which results in complexities 




The wife of David ben Tata engaged in commer- 
cial dealings with some non-Jews. One of them 
was known as Musa ben Abd Laziz against whom 
she had a claim in the non-Jewish court. She has 
also acquired the right to collect a debt from Lala 
Sharif, the niece of the King Mulay Rashid. Lala 
had sold the wife of David half of an upper floor in 
exchange for the amount of the loan that she 
owed. The non-Jew, Musa, bought the other half 
of the upper floor. 




A letter of adulation written in honor of R. Elijah 
Ha-Sarfati and his son Jacob 




This epistle was written in honor of R. Elijah Ha- 
Sarfati and his son R. Jacob. A poem in honor of 
the former appears on page 30a and a second 
poem in honor of the latter appears on page 30b. 




The rabbis at Meknés intervene in a judgement 
rendered by the rabbis at Fez 




R. Jacob Ibn Zur rendered a decision in a certain 
matter. 


R. Samuel Labaz is also involved in this 
litigation. One of the disputants has refused to 
abide by the judgements of R. Jacob Ibn Zur and 
the matter has been brought to the attention of the 
rabbis of Meknés, namely, R. Hayyim Toledano, 
R. Jacob Toledano, and R. Mordecai Berdugo, all 




“Villagers who required the services of a Ritual 
Slaughterer would ask a sojourner if he was well- 
versed in the laws pertaining to Ritual Slaughterer 
whereupon he would answer in the affirmative, 
even if he was totally ignorant and he would then 
be guilty of providing the Jewish community with 
prohibited food. In order to avoid this situation, 
the scholars of an earlier period made a require- 
ment that a Ritual Slaughterer was to present a 
document from them attesting to his ability and 
knowledge.” 




A Jew known as Saadya Lahakhusin ben R. 
Moses purchased the half that belonged to the 
non-Jew. The undersigned rabbinic tribunal 
comprising the rabbis Judah ibn Attar, Samuel 
Ha-Sarfati, and Abraham ibn Danan gave assent 
and support to Saadya’s legal right so that no one 
should register a claim against it. Even if the 
owners of the land raised sufficient funds within

remain silent. The rabbis of Meknes state that 
they will assemble all the arguments pro and con 
including the ruling of R. Jacob Ibn Zur and they 
will send them to all the rabbinic scholars so that

A controversy concerning a Torah scroll 




On the Intermediate days of the Passover Festival, 
in the year 1734, the author of this text accom- 
panied Yaabez [Rabbi Jacob ibn Zur] to the 
synagogue of R.Y. Busidan to collect a Torah 
scroll which was to be taken to Yaabez’s syna- 
gogue from which it had been borrowed. It be- 
longed to R. Hayyim ibn Magirz who was also of 
the party with a whole assembly of people. When 
they entered the synagogue, they opened the ark, 
and asked the incumbent reader, R. Hayyim Al- 
Atabi, to point out the right Torah. Al-Atabi 
claimed he didn’t know which it was, a most 
improbable state of affairs. Two hours later the 
sexton was brought and he also claimed not to be 
able to identify the scroll. The man who prepared 
the parchments said that he wasn’t able to identify 
it either, so another Torah was given in its place. 


Subsequently R. Hayyim [Al-Atabi] wrote to 
his brother Mimun who normally shared his 
duties as reader in the synagogue but who was 
on a visit to Mekneés at the time, whereupon 
Mimun began to spread slander against Yaabez. 
Yaabez, he said, had waited for him, Mimun, to 
leave for Meknés before claiming that the scroll 
should be returned to his synagogue, and Yaabez 
had forced Hayyim ibn Magirz into returning the 
scroll against his will. All these damaging state- 
ments were made against Yaabez but none of the 
scholars or communal leaders reprimanded R. 
Mimun. 


In response to the aforementioned attacks, on 
the eighth of lyar, witnesses testified that for more 
than a year Hayyim ibn Magirz had wanted to 
return the scroll to Yaabez’s Synagogue. He had 
procrastinated, however, because he wanted to 
be accompanied by R. Moses ibn Maman so that 




46 




decision-making process of the rabbinic courts. If 
R. Samuel feels that his wrath justifies his silence 
then steps should be taken to appease him so that 
he will report the necessary information. ff, 
however, he does not accept the counsel of the 
rabbis of Meknés then they will be forced to 
exercise all measures to uphold the honor of R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur. 




he could save face. But R. Moses was always 
preoccupied and so the Torah had not been 
returned until the present. Upon R. Mimun’s 
return from Meknés he begged forgiveness from 
Yaabez for treating the latter unjustly. Yaabez was 
magnanimous in accepting the apology, which 
was in accord with his forgiving nature, and 
Hayyim ibn Magirz returned to pray at Yaabez’s 
synagogue which had been the place of prayer of 
his forebears. 


[The story behind the controversy over the 
Torah, as gleaned from the manuscripts, is an 
interesting one. Hayyim’s grandfather, Hanun 
ben Magirz, had prayed with Yaabez from the time 
that he moved his residence from Al-Arsa to the 
Mellah until his death, at which time Yaabez 
eulogized him as he had Hanun’s wife at her 
passing. Hanun’s son, Mas’ud, also frequented 
Yaabez’s synagogue until his death and Hayyim 
himself had celebrated his Bar Mitzva there. Only 
after Yaabez had left Fez and established his 
residence at Meknes, had Hayyim moved to the 
synagogue of R. Mimun Al-Atabi. Eventually 
Yaabez returned to take up residence again in Fez 
and because there had been a period of misfor- 
tune and famine during his absence Yaabez was 
not surprised to find Hayyim no longer among the 
worshippers; many had died or moved away. 
Then one day Yaabez noted Hayyim’s name 
among the parties involved in a litigation. He 
inquired if Hanun was his grandfather. When this 
fact was established, he convinced Hayyim he 
should return to the synagogue of his forefathers 
according to the legal tradition. The Torah Scroll 
was to be returned as well. 


So eventually R. Mimun was ordered to return 
all the vestments belonging to Hayyim’s Torah.] 


This judgement was rendered in the tenth of 
lyar 1734.

A letter of consoiation to Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur on 
the death of his son Samuel 




This letter was written to Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur 




A correspondence from R. Jacob Ibn Malka to 
Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur 




R. Jacob ibn Malka informs R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
that in spite of his many duties and the exigencies 
of time he has been able to prepare certain docu- 
ments which have been signed by rabbinic 




A scholar demands that certain legal actions ina 
litigation should be taken before a final judge- 
ment is rendered 




R. Hasdai Almosnino is involved in a case where 
the litigants are R. Joseph Ha-Sarfati and his 
uncle. The uncle, R. Joseph, who previously 
resided in R. Hasdai’s community Tetuan isnow 
living in Fez. R. Joseph had also abandoned the 
members of his family who now suffer privation. 
The rabbis of Fez and Meknés have brought the 
matter under litigation to a settlement by having 
the uncle pay R. Joseph a stipulated sum of 
money. R. Hasdai notes that he had more 
evidence that was pertinent to the case but since 
the matter has already been resolved by the rabbis

A case involving the expiration of tenancy ina 
domicile and property claims 




The following case was adjudicated by R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur on the twenty-fourth day of Elul 1747. 
Jacob ben Amozag, who was abroad, is at present 
a tenant of Menahem ben Amozag. The period of 




48 




consoling him, his wife, and his daughter-in-law 
on the untimely passing of his son Samuel, may 
his memory be a blessing. The letter was signed 
by Samuel ibn Adhan. 




authorities, and he sends them through a 
messenger. He apologizes for being tardy in his 
response to an earlier letter by R. Jacob Ibn Zur. 
However, two weeks passed before R. Jacob Ibn 
Malka received R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s letter. The 
former states that his function as teacher to many 
students prevents him from devoting more time to 
the transcribing of documents. 




of Fez and Meknés he will not forward it. However, 
R. Hasdai feels that the case will not be closed 
until the uncle (who is referred to as “the scholar’) 
pays an additional sum of fifty ugiot of silver, 
which would cover the amount due to R. Hasdai 
for the services that he rendered in the case 
heretofore. This demand is just since the other 
rabbis have already received payment for their 
services rendered and Joseph is too poverty- 
stricken to make the payment. The rabbis are 
asked to relay this information to the uncle. R. 
Hasdai asks that in order to insure that the 
settlement is a lasting one, the uncle should 
pardon R. Joseph for any indiscretion that might 
have arisen during the litigation. The author 
states that he is in mourning. 




Abraham Monsano is Abraham Alfasi. After an 
introductory paragraph, the author writes four 
paragraphs. The first paragraph consoles the 
wife, the second the children, the third the 
relatives, and the fourth the whole house of Israel. 




occupancy of the suite had run its course, when 
Jacob claimed that he still owned a percentage of 
two courtyards while another portion of his total 
claim had been sold against his will by his brother 
Joseph. He said that even if proof could be 
brought that Joseph had acted for him legally and 
with his knowledge, still only a portion thereof 
had been sold. Therefore, Jacob insisted that he 




still had a percentage in the courtyard that was 
not sold. Subsequently, Jacob admitted that he 
was paid additional money by Menahem so that 
he really had no claim to a percentage in either 
the longer or the smaller courtyard as he had 
previously asserted. 


In the outcome, Menahem waives the 
monetary claim for the apartment that was owed 




The rabbis of Meknés wish to apply a ban against 
another community for money that should be 
forthcoming 




R. Solomon ben Moses Maman wrote this letter in 
Judaeo-Arabic and Hebrew to the Rabbis Jacob 
lbn Zur and Moses Birdugo, at Meknés, concer- 
ning the emissary R. David Gabbai, of blessed 
memory. The aforementioned rabbis of Meknés 
claim that R. David left money with somebody in 
the other community and if the money is not 
forthcoming then they will declare a ban against 
the community. R. Solomon replies, “Let it 
therefore be known that the emissary did nothing

The first was composed by one called Reuben. 




A Jew owes a non-Jew money and the Jew must 
collect a loan to ease his burden which affects the 
property of R. Jacob Ibn Zur 




Rabbi Judah ibn Attar wrote this letter toR. Jacob 
Ibn Zur concerning R. Aaron ibn Haroush. The 
last-named owes money to a non-Jew called ben 
Azzim Adda. The time to pay the debt has arrived 
but Aaron does not have the money available to 
make the payment. Azzim Adda is putting him 
under pressure but he is ill and has no recourse to 
money except by calling for the payment of a debt 
of 500 uqiot of silver which is owed to him by R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur. When Aaron told Azzim that the

waives any claims for back rent that was due to

Jacob for two more years, rent-free, provided that 
Jacob promises never to make further claims on 
properties which are no longer his.

that he gave not a penny to anyone except the 
Master David Abirgil to whom he gave twelve

Lisha for the remaining two. A contract of 
indebtedness was made which | signed. In truth, 
forty or fifty mitkalin were given to R. Elazar 
Delouya. The aforementioned David [Abirgil] is 
not a liar or a thief, God forbid, and he is prepared 
to send the balance of the money. However, we 
must wait until he completes a transaction 
involving the sale of arak and raisins when the 
market price is higher.” 




The second prayer of supplication at the bottom 
of the page was composed by R. Yaabez, of 
blessed memory. 


A Liturgical poem appears on page 40b. 
It was composed by one called Abraham. The 
writing on 40b is quite faded.

guarantee more than equalled the value of the 
money owed, Azzim was happy to accept this in 
payment. These are the places enumerated in the 
bill of debt: one sixth of the courtyard adjoining 
the synagogue wherein the descendants of R. 
Immanuel Monsano pray, one sixth of R. Jacob’s 
synagogue, and one sixth of the courtyard called 
Zar Asiban. The non-Jew wants to have the option 
to sell these properties or to realize dividends 
therefrom. R. Judah notes that the property of the 
courtyards is for sale; however, not the syn- 
agogue property, as is stipulated in the bill of 
debt. This communication is dated Shevat 1721.

A request for a document of transference of 
property to be drawn 




Rabbi Judah ibn Attar writes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 




on Adar II, 1720, upon the request of Aaron ben ~ 




Moses ben Samuel. One known as Israel Ben 
Shaiya, the son of the scholar R. Jacob, has writ- 
ten a letter to Aaron in his own name and in the 
name of his brother Reuben’s wife (who dwells at 
Tafilalet) stating that Reuben has granted permis- 




-sion to transfer to Aaron the pledge of property 




which is located in Fez, in the courtyard of R. 
Solomon ibn Amiel. The value of the pledge is 
sent through the agent Jacob ibn Garton. It is 




A plea to the rabbis to innovate and support 
methods of fundraising for the Jerusalem com- 
munity as the emissary is encountering difficulties 




One who signs his name as David Ha-Katan writes 
to the rabbis informing them of many difficulties 
that he encounters in fundraising for Jerusalem. 
He asks them to support such an effort but says 




The inheritance and perpetuation of the estate of 
rabbi Solomon Samuel Ibn Zur O.B.M. 




This document, which was written in Fez, on 
Heshvan 1791, was signed by R. Abraham ben 
David Ohayun and Rabbi Saadya. The two sons of 
the rabbinic scholar Solomon Samuel ibn Zur 
were Rabbi Raphael and his brother Jacob. The 
latter who was a bachelor, desired to formulate a 
contract to deal with the terms of the estate which 
their late father had left for them and their mother. 
They agreed never to dissolve the estate until 
parted by death. Jacob would be permitted to 
draw upon the estate for marital expenses since 
he was still unmarried. If any party violated this 
agreement by desiring to dissolve it, he would

Aaron’s desire that a document of transfer be 
drawn by R. Jacob Ibn Zur stating that Aaron has 
acquired the pledge and that Israel shall assume 
the responsibility for his brother Reuben and the 
latter's wife. If Reuben will put his assent to the 
transfer in writing, then this should be submitted 
so that R. Jacob Ibn Zur can formalize the 
document. When the procedures are completed, 
the final document of ownership should be sent to 
Aaron through the agent. The monies that are 
made available for this transaction are also 
mentioned at the end of the letter. R. Judah also 
wants a reply to the letters that he senttoR. Jacob 
lbn Zur in the previous week. 




that if it will cause difficulties then the effort 
should not be expended. Help will be available 
from another place. Some practices are 
suggested for fundraising. On joyful ritual oc- 
casions such as weddings and Brit Milah (circum- 
cision), it would be appreciated if money could be 
donated for Jerusalem. The communal reader 
should remind the people; also the synagogue 
treasurers should put in more effort. 




forfeit half of the rights which accrued to him both 
before and after the death of his father. Also each 
one would make available his half for the use of 
his mother. The liability would be limited only to 
those items that came under the terms of this 
agreement. If anyone should die, to be survived by 
daughters only, the latter were to be sustained 
from the estate until such time as they married, at 
which time they would be entitled to a proper 
dowry from the estate. If any one of the brothers 
died without leaving an heir then all these benefits 
would accrue to the surviving brother. The 
brothers would be unable to pass on their rights to 
a female heiress. If either brother died then his 
wife would be sustained by the estate until such 
time as she remarried. If she did remarry then she 
might take only 15 mitkalin of silver. 




A letter of greeting from Jerusalem to Fez which 
deals with the purchase of books 




This letter was written from Jerusalem by Elijah 
ben Jacob Kasis to Rabbi Raphael, referred to as 
Ham-Malakh (The Angel), in Sivan 1863. The 
author states that he recites prayers for R. 
Raphael’s family when he visits the graves of the 
Saints and he recites blessings at the Kotel ha- 




A son has aclaim against his father, the amount of 
which can be ascertained by a document held by 
R. Jacob Ibn Zur 




This is adocument signed by the rabbis Judah ibn

Jacob Ibn Zur requesting that he supply informa- 
tion from a legal document that he possesses. 
This information will substantiate the amount ofa 
claim by Joseph ben David Elmaleh against his 




A document of sale of a Jewish communal 
enterprise in Fez when the community needed 
funds 




The Jewish community of Fez was in need of 
money, so the rabbinic court, consisting of R. 
Judah ibn Attar, R. Mimun Alfasi, and R. Moses 
ibn Maman, acted for the community and arrang- 
ed for the sale of a communal enterprise to 
Abraham ben Mahlouf ben Yitah for 1,200 ugiot. 
This document was drawn in the month of Elul 
1729. The terms of the contract are spelled out as 
follows: Only Abraham or those he designates 
may engage in the sale of alcoholic beverages. If 
he agrees to permit Saadya Lehaboz and Moses 
ibn Reuben ben Susan to serve as vendors they 
may do so. Any other person selling alcoholic 
beverages will be obliged to pay 10 uqia for each 
one hundred kilo. Those who prepare them for 
private consumption will pay five uqiot, and for 
those alcoholic beverages produced from raisins, 
figs, dates, almonds, and rice one uqiot for each 




Maaravi (Western Wall of the Temple). The books 
that were requested by R. Solomon Alaluf for 
Rabbi Raphael are unavailable, including the 
work of Harav Hukkei Hayyim, since the author’s 
son is presently abroad as an emissary for the 
Jerusalem community. Regards are sent to R. 
Solomon Ibn Zur, R. Jacob Ha-Kohen, ha-Nagid 
R. Abraham, Rabbi Abner Ha-Sarfati, R. Joshua 
Serero, R. Samuel Ha-Kohen and his brothers R. 
Moses and R. Isaac, and to R. Israel Maymeran. 




father, David, for his portion of his deceased 
mother’s estate. David has admitted that the 
document that requires him to pay the money of 
his departed wife to his son is in the possession of 
R. Jacob Ibn Zur. Since the son is not aware of the 
amount that is due to him and what the father 
wants to give him seems a small amount, strife has 
ensued between father and son. R. Jacob can help 
to resolve the matter by sending the document to 
either one of the two judges. 




one hundred kilo. For dealers in charcoal, one 
quarter of an ugia and olive oil; one quarter of an 
uqia whether it is pressed out in the olivepress or it 
is brought into the Mellah. Different amounts 
payable are enumerated such as one hundred and 
ten uqiot to Isaac Porat, sixty ugiot to Moses Ibn 
Susan, and two hundred and seventy uqiot to be 
paid to R. Moses ibn Maman as agent of the 
community. Even if the purchaser should benefit 
beyond the sum of three thousand ugiot the 
agreement must still be honored. On page 47pb, in 
an addendum, we are informed that the original 
transaction with Abraham ben Yitah as the buyer 
was nullified. R. Judah Bibas replaced Abraham 
ben Yitah as the purchaser with all stipulations of 
the contract remaining the same as before except 
that the price rose to thirteen hundred uqiot. 
Seven hundred uqiot was to be paid to Abraham 
ben Yitah with the balance going to whomever the 
community should designate. The latter transac- 
tion took place in Fez, on the third day of Tishri 
1729. The addendum to the earlier document was 
signed by R. Jacob Ibn Zur.

R. Jacob Ibn Zur is asked to return a confiscated 
article to a litigant after a dispute is settled. R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur sends a correspondence to R. 
Jacob Toledano 




R. Jacob Toledano sent a short correspondence 
to R. Jacob Ibn Zur concerning a monetary 
dispute between one called Saiyag and Judah ben 
Zazun. R. Toledano states that since the litigation 
has been settled R. Jacob Ibn Zur should return 
an article belonging to Judah ben Zazun which 
was previously confiscated because ofthe latter’s 
non-payment. R. Jacob |bn Zur’s correspondence 
to R. Jacob Toledano also appears. This letter is 
dated from Fez to Tetuan, Tishri 1741 and in itR. 
Jacob Ibn Zur complains that R. Jacob Toledano 
has spoken harshly of him because he has left a 
percentage of income from his synagogue in 
Meknés to his son R. Raphael Obed without 
informing R. Toledano. A quarter of the income 
was allotted to R. Toledano, although he is 
claiming that only an eighth part was allotted to 
him. R. Toledano has therefore referred to R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur as a cruel person. The latter claims 
that it is a most natural act to guard one’s own 
son’s succession in preference to someone whois 
not related. Besides, R. Toledano has been given 
a percentage towards his income apart from other 
sources of income that are available to him. R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur argues that if he had left out his son 
and given all toR. Toledano, then everyone would 
consider that he had wronged his son. The only 
one R. Jacob Ibn Zur has been cruel to is him- 
self, he states, as he enumerates a variety of 
transactions concerning himself where R. Jacob 
Toledano did not act fairly. 


One such occasion transpired on the death of 
R. Mimun ben Nissim when R. Toledano per- 
suaded R. Jacob Ibn Zur to lend him close to two 
thousand ugiot and promissory notes were drawn 
for this transaction which were in R. Ibn Zur’s 
possession until the time for payment arrived. R. 
Toledano used guile to secure those notes, 
claims R. Ibn Zur, and the money remained in the 
other’s possession unjustly for many years. On 
another occasion, says R. Jacob Ibn Zur, he held 
the promissory notes of one R. Meir Bibas and 
had refused to give them to R. Toledano, but the 




52 




latter pleaded that they should be placed with him 
and as a result R. Jacob Ibn Zur was unable ever 
to collect a penny on the notes. Once during a 
dispute R. Toledano had with R.M. Maymeran, in 
Meknés, he asked R.J. Ibn Zur for money which 
was given in payment for aloan. R. Toledano gave 
some volumes of codes in return which made up 
only a portion of the loan. R. Ibn Zur wanted to 
return the books, but they were refused. Once 
when R. Ibn Zur travelled to Meknés he left money 
belonging to some orphans with his son-in-law, R. 
Menahem Serero, 0.b.m. R. Toledano persuaded 
R. Serero to receive promissory notes for the 
money. When R. Serero passed away, R. Ibn Zur 
went to Fez where he found two sacks full of 
promissory notes. RJ. Ibn Zur confronted R. 
Toledano with the notes whereupon the latter 
admitted that they were his and he offered to sell 
them and to pay R.J. Ibn Zur, but in the event he 
never paid a penny. R. Jacob Ibn Zur had a bill of 
debt against R. Solomon Al-Mishaeli which was 
held by R. Ibn Zur’s cousin, R. Judah, the brother 
of the departed, called Isaac. R. Toledano asked 
to be able to collect the debt whereupon he would 
share half with R. Ibn Zur. Instead R. Toledano 
made a deal with the one who held the debt, 
whereby he received all and R. Ibn Zur received 
nothing. 


Jacob Ibn Zur faults R.J. Toledano as the 
cause of his wanderings and his migration to 
Tetuan because he couldn’t make a living in 
Mekneés due to R. Toledano’s manipulations. 
Apparently he returned to Fez for a short time 
because of his insolvency. R. Jacob |bn Zur's son, 
R. Reuben, was obliged to accompany his father 
in the latter's quest for financial stability. R. 
Reuben’s wife was obliged to remain in Salé due 
to these circumstances. R. Jacob Ibn Zur informs 
us that his only grandson has been born, in Salé, 
and that he has not yet had a chance even to see 
him. Since his quest for economic self sufficiency 
is unsuccessful he refuses to have his daughter- 
in-law suffer hunger on his account. In spite of all 
his suffering R. Jacob is falsely accused of 
wronging R. Jacob Toledano. R. Toledano is 
maintaining that he should have the total income 
of R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s synagogue in Meknés 
instead of just a quarter, while half goes to R. Ibn 




Zur and the remaining quarter to the latter’s son 
Raphael. R. Jacob Ibn Zur retorts that R. 
Toledano owes him much money which has never 
been paid even though funds were available. Even 
if R. Toledano couldn't pay a// of his debts he 
could atleast pay a portion of them. IfR. Toledano 
claims not to have available cash or movable 
property he still owns real estate, books, and 




A ms. of the collection of tales and aphorisms 
called Divrei Hakhamim Ke-Dérbonét 




[See also page 62a and b and Ms.160 on pages 
221a to 224b.] 




The title of this manuscript, Divrei Hakhamim Ke- 
Dérbdndt, is based on a verse which is found at 
the end of the biblical work, Ecclesiastes, 12:11. It 
means, “The words of the wise are like goads.” It is 
a compilation of aphorisms of the philosophers 
and sages including riddles anda tale concerning 
the wisdom of R. Saadya Gaon which contains 
Judaeo-Arabic statements. In our collection 
called Yalkut Roiim there are two such manu- 
scripts. Ms.36, which is found on pages 50a to 
52b, should have the additional pages 62a and 
b following it. The compiler of this collection 
mistakenly separated it from the other pages. The 
earliest copyist is noted as Yaabez (R. Jacob Ibn 
Zur) who also provides comments on some texts. 
Yaabez informs us (on page 52b) that he copied 
this text from an earlier manuscript which he 
expanded upon with comments and a more 
complete text than the original. 


At the end of the third line of page 62a we are 
informed that “The material given until this point 
comes from Yaabez while the texts given 
thereafter were copied by R. Solomon Elijah Ibn 




A eulogy 




This classical form of a Moroccan eulogy was 
written by one called Yehonatan. It may be 
surmised that he wrote this eulogy and letter of 




scrolls of the Law which could be sold for cash. In 
the face of all this R.J. Ibn Zur has never made a 
claim against R. Toledano in court but R. 
Toledano has the temerity to call R.J. Ibn Zura 
cruel man. The latter notes that justice would 
prevail if R. Toledano was obliged to sell his 
properties to pay his debts, rent living quarters, 
and suffer like those whose lot it is to be poor. 




Zur.” The signature of R. Solomon appears at the 
end of this manuscript, on page 62b. 


There is another manuscript in the Yalkut 
Roiim (pages 221a to 224b) which is almost 
identical to Ms.36; it is another copy of Divrei 
Hakhamim Ke-Dorb6n6t. This is Ms. 160 which is 
identical to Ms. 36until page 62a, where Yaabez is 
quoted as the copyist, except that Yaabez is 
identified as Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur and as “Yaabez, 
the son of R. Reuben, of blessed memory.” 
Thereafter a text is given which does not appear in 
Ms. 36. |t is recorded as part of what is found of the 
manuscript copied by Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur. 
Another copyist whose name _ follows is 
Yehonatan Ish Sion Monsano, the son of Rabbi 
Bezalel, of blessed memory. There follows acopy 
of Abraham ibn Ezra’s riddle on his poverty which 
was copied from a Ms. by Rabbi Elijah Ha-Sarfati. 
Page 224b is titled “Maalt ha-Emet” since the 
opening statement deals with the subject of truth 
and falsehood. A number of statements and 
anecdotes follow, one of which is attributed to the 
RASHBA, author of a volume of Responsa in the 
Bension Collection. At the end of Ms.160, on page 
224b, the last copyist mentioned by the copyist of 
this manuscript is given as R. Immanuel Mon- 
sano, of blessed memory. Our final copyist is 
noted as Yehonatan Ish Sion Monsano, the son 
of R. Bezalel. 




consolation for R. Jacob Ibn Zur, on the passing 
of his son Reuben, who was a colleague of the

that of the writer. A letter of consolation which 
was written to R. Jacob Ibn Zur on the demise of 
his son Reuben appears in Ms. 217.

An Halakhic text dealing with an alteration to 
one’s property which may infringe on private or 
public property 




One has a cistern in his house and he wants to 
direct the water that is flowing into his courtyard 
into another. cistern from which Reuben is 
drawing water. The owner of the courtyard can 
construct a conduit underground at a distance of 
at least three handbreadths removed from the wall 
of the house and at a depth of two or three 
handbreadths so that the clean water shall flow 
into his cistern. This procedure may be followed 
even in a courtyard held in partnership and even 
within four cubits opposite his partner's entrance. 
This decision was rendered by Maharam Mi- 
Trani, Volume two, No. 96 and by Keneset ha- 
Gedolah, No. 153. Another ruling, that of 
Maharam Galante, No. 85, states that water drawn 
from one well to another gives one property 
rights. 


One who builds opposite a synagogue must 
allow for a greater distance (than from a house) 
because a synagogue requires more light. The 
Beit Yosef on the code Orah Hayyim cited the 
Sefer Agudah who is mentioned by the Mahari- 
Weil in his Responsa, on this subject. 




A letter from the communal leaders of Sefrou to 
the rabbis of Fez concerning fundraising 
irregularities that arose during an emissary’s visit 




Raphael Maman writes to the three rabbis (of Fez) 
Saul ibn Danan, Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur, and 
Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati concerning the funds that 
were collected by the emissary from Jerusalem, 
R. Barukh Pinto, in the author’s community. The 
author reports that the collected funds were senta 
day earlier but he felt obliged to respond to the 
communication of the rabbis as to why the money 
was held up until this late date and as to why the 
sum is less than might be anticipated. It seems 
that R. Barukh wanted a larger sum than the 
community could produce at the present time. 
The writer mentions that he was among those who 
negotiated for the emissary with the leaders of the 
community whereby a compromise was reached 




54 




A case arose concerning one who wanted to 
build near asynagogue in Salonika and the matter 
was adjudicated in accord with the Agudanh, i.e.a 
synagogue requires the allowance of a greater 
distance by the builder than from a private 
domicile. The measure of distance that must be 
maintained is discussed by the Maharad Egozi in 
his Responsa as being eight cubits. However, if 
there is sufficient light for the synagogue even 
with a four cubit separation that sufficeth accor- 
ding to R.M. Egozi. The Keneset ha-Gedolah in 
Responsum No. 154 is also in agreement. 


Reuben and Simeon are neighbors who are 
dwelling near the public thoroughfare. Simeon 
builds a new addition to his house which 
protrudes into the public thoroughfare opposite 
Reuben’s window. The latter claims that the new 
addition should be dismantled since it causes him 
the discomfort of being exposed to his neighbor's 
sight. Simeon retorts that he left the necessary 
four cubits vacant; but in order to remove the 
cause of the complaint he is prepared to build a 
fence around his addition. Reuben replies that if 
Simeon builds a fence he will obstruct Reuben’s 
view of the length of the marketplace. The law is 
decided in Simeon’s favor. Thus do we find the 
decision rendered by R. Levi ibn Habib in No. 44, 
of his work. 




but the emissary was not present on that 
occasion. The expenses incurred by the emissary 
would be deducted up to one fourth of the income 
from the collection. The emissary finally agreed to 
this arrangement after refusing to do so at first. 
The writer notes that the emissary did not lose any 
money, since more than a quarter of the total 
amount was added to the regular collection. 
When the community leaders had to settle with R. 
Barukh before his departure he refused to pay the 
twenty-five percent which had been agreed upon 
as the expense of his upkeep. The writer notes 
that he counselled the emissary not to behave in 
this way because his actions would reflect upon 
all the scholars of the Holy Land. People would 
say that these scholars were not trustworthy 
people. R. Hayyim Elijah and the author accom- 
panied the emissary out of town and they 
continued to persuade him to take the money. 




Shortly after the emissary took the money hesent 
it back to R. Hayyim Elijah, writing that he found 
less than the proper amount without an explana- 
tion as to why the amount was deficient. It is 
because of the highly improper conduct of the 
emissary that the money was subsequently 
withheld until a later date. Furthermore, every 
precaution was taken to see that the proper sum 
should be received by the emissary excluding the 
possibility of theft on the journey. R. Hayyim 
Elijah is too trustworthy to be doubted as to the 
sum that he placed in the pouch before he sent it 




Calamitous conditions and strife are recorded in 
an early sixteenth century correspondence 




This letter is written by Aaron Ha-Kohen to one 
whom he regards as his master. The author 
reports on the diligence that Joseph, his son, has 
shown in his studies which will be to the satis- 
faction of the respondent. The author then 
describes the visitation of many natural and 
political calamities that have befallen him and 
some of his compatriots. Drought conditions 
prevail and anumber of his colleagues have been 
imprisoned and beaten. Among them are men- 
tioned R. Solomon ibn Daviera and R. Samuel ibn 




An emissary informs R. Raphael Ibn Zur of the 
trials and tribulations which hindered his mission 




This letter was written on the eighth of lyar 1876 
to R. Raphael Ibn Zur by the emissary of the 
Moroccan community in the Holy Land, Joseph 
the son of Moses Arwaz. The writer's signature is 
accompanied by a seal which is composed in 
three languages; namely, Hebrew, Arabic, and in 
the center of the seal a wreath wherein the Roman 
initials J.A. are inscribed. 


This letter commences with two paragraphs of 
flowery introduction. In the third paragraph, 
Joseph apologizes to R. Raphael for not writing 
sooner; however, the tribulations of his journey 
prevented him from doing so. He then reports on 
some of the hindrances he has encountered on 
his fundraising mission. 


When Joseph arrived in Debdou he stayed at 




to the emissary; in fact, he even added more 
money from his own pocket. Regards are sent to 
the rabbis and to the emissary (who is presently at 
Fez). 


R. Hayyim Elijah added a postscript to the 
letter, which is found on page 56a. He states that 
Joseph Ha-Kohen can testify about the money 
that was sent. Also the emissary was given 
seventeen mitkallin as a loan. Another eleven 
mitkallin was given to him by Shalom Abitbol and 
another person called Abraham; additional 
money was given to him by Aaron Elbaz. 




Saiivar. The latter’s son is imprisoned because he 
entreated His Majesty the King concerning his 
suffering at the hands of the leader of the Jewish 
community, referred to as the Nagid. An allusion 
is made to Moses, the anniversary of whose death 
is commemorated on the date the letter was 
written. The author states that more could be 
reported but the time is not propitious. Aaron 
cannot comprehend why one called R. Shemaya, 
who is also a Kohen, rose up against him. 


The script appears to belong to the first half 
of the sixteenth century. It is possible that it is 
the strife between the Megorashim and Toshavim 
in Morocco that is hinted at in this letter. 




the residence of Judah ibn Susan who was allied 
with the Kohanim. The Murciano family, who 
apparently feuded with the Kohanim, made sure 
that Joseph’s fundraising efforts would not be too 
successful. If anyone wanted to give a larger 
contribution the Murciano family prevented them 
from doing so. The ones who will suffer from this 
dispute are the poor of the Moroccan Jewish 
community in the Holy Land. Joseph’s journey to 
the villages of Arif was likewise unsuccessful 
since a libelous charge had been made that aJew 
had murdered a non-Jew, so he feared to travel in 
that area. Joseph would not permit R. Judah Leib, 
his associate, to travel there either for the same 
reason. Joseph was therefore unable to meet R. 
Abner and R. Raphael (to whom this letter is 
written) and he begs for their pardon. He 
describes his journey as a very unsettling 
experience. Regards are sent to R. Hayyim 
Kohen.

The rabbis of Fez are asked to assemble all

This court document was sent by the rabbis Isaac 
ibn WalidGn and Isaac Nahon of Tetuan to the 
rabbis of Fez, in the year 1857, concerning an 
estate. Clara, the daughter of the late Yom Tob ibn

A legal document concerning the history of Fezin

This legal document begins with a dirge which 
describes the pillage of the Mellah of Fez in the 
year 1647. The Arab destroyers vented their 
venom in particular against the synagogues. They 
wanted to level the synagogues completely and 
with this threat they extorted money from the 
Jews. They said they would not be satisfied until 
they were guaranteed a huge sum of money. The 
community agreed to sell a pair of silver Torah 
crowns, made by the artisan ibn Rivka, to the 
scholar Issac Sarfati, the son of the scholar Vidal, 
of blessed memory, in order to realize the sum of 
money that was needed. The sum that was agreed 
upon for the Torah crowns was four hundred and

This letter was written by Elijah b. Jacob Kasis in 
1868 to the rabbis Ham-Malakh Raphael and 
Jacob. He informs them that he has left money 
collected in Meknés with R. Israel Maymeran 
who is supposed to forward the sum of three 
hundred and one durham to the rabbis. The 
balance of six hundred durham should be sent by 
them to Tangiers, to Joseph Achrigi through R. 
Hayyim Yemin Ha-Kohen. The letter to Joseph 
should contain another letter which should be 
forwarded to his (the writer's) son. The writer

recently passed on and one who was not 
numbered amongst those who had her best 
interests at heart made a claim upon her estate. 
The rabbis of Fez are asked to protect the estate of 
the departed Clara, first, by supervising the 
accumulation of all her assets and then by 
sending them to the rabbis of Tetuan who will 
apportion them to her legal inheritors. Thus false 
claims against the estate or its inheritors will be 
thwarted. 




twenty uqiot, according to the old standard of 
currency. The legal formuta for this transaction is 
then elaborated upon. The document was com- 
posed on the first third of Adar Il, in the year 1647. 
The sum of one hundred and seventy ugiot was 
used to pay the ransom so that the synagogue 
walls would not be levelled and the remaining two 
hundred and fifty ugiot were given in payment for 
the Torah crowns which were held as a pledge by 
R. David Alkazabi. The Torah crowns were in the 
possession of the congregation that prayed inthe 
Great Synagogue of the Toshavim. Among the 
five signers of this historic document were: 1. 
Shem Tob ibn Ramukh; 2. Saadya bar R. Samuel 
ibn Danan; 3. Abraham ibn Danan; 4. Benjamin 
Ha-Kohen bar R. Nahman; 5. Ephraim Ha-Kohen 
bar Manasseh. 




suggests to R. Raphael that if the money is already 
available to be sent to Joseph then his letter to his 
son should be sent with it. If not, then the letter 
should be forwarded to R. Hayyim who will 
forward it to the son. He asks them to use good 
glue by which to secure the letter, since he has 
none available. The writer requests of the rabbis 
to whom he is writing, as well as of the Nagid 
Abraham, that they should prevent wayfarers 
from coming to Sefrou from Fez since they cause 
the writer a substantial loss. It has been the Nagid 
Abraham’s practice to prevent wayfarers from 
coming in the past. The writer asks R. Raphael 
to hasten to fulfill all his requests, and he sends 
regards to R. Ham-Melekh Solomon, the Nagid 
Abraham, Menahem Saba, R. Jacob Dahan, 
Azuz Ha-Kohen, R. Joshua Serero, and Aaron 
Ha-Kohen. The address to this document is

Elijah b. Jacob Kasis thanks the rabbis for writing

the near future. He also thanks them for acquiring 
four durham from Moses ibn Na’im. The writer

A Kabbalistic Messianic Calculation 




This is a Kabbalistic manuscript using the biblical 
text of “Timheh Zekhr Amalek” (Deut. 25:19) to 
point to the year 1688 as significant for Messianic 
events. The numerical value of Timheh equals 
5,488 which also corresponds to four sets of six 
combinations of the word “Zekhr’ as the author 
tabulates them. The sum total of the four lines is 
5,448 as each line equals 1,362. In all probability 




A dispute over the estate of the late R. Samuel 
D’Avila 




[This document commences on page 65b and 
concludes on page 65a. The compiler bound the 
page in the book in reverse order.] The document 
deals with a legal judgement concerning the 
claims of the widow of R. Samuel D’Avila against 
her son R. Eliezer D’Avila. The mother originally 
claimed that her son’s half of the inheritance 
included Torah scrolls and Torah crowns, while 
the half that belonged to her and her daughters 
consisted of properties. R. Eliezer denied this to 
be the case and he took an oath. He agreed, 
however, that half of the properties should go to

them, nor has he written to Joseph Chrigi 
concerning the same matter. The money that is 
being delivered to the Nagid by the bearer of this 
letter comes from the hospitable innkeeper Aaron 
Elbaz, asupporter of Torah. Regards are senttoR. 
Ham-Melekh Solomon and to all the scholars, 
including Menahem Saba, R. Jacob Dahan, the 
innkeeper Azuz Ha-Kohen, and to Raphael Elijah 
Elbaz, the son of Aaron Elbaz. On page 61 a whole 
page of calculations is given. On the other side of 
the page the address is given. [Page 62a and b

tion “Yalkut Roiim” is the concluding page to

this text dates from 1688. Page 63b contains 
mystical calculations based upon the Holy Name 
of God. Twelve lines of computation of the 
Hebrew letters of God’s Name are set out six 
terms to a line which result in the numerical value 
of 72. Pages 64a and b contain alphabetical 
calculations of the Hebrew word Yimlokh, “He will 
reign.” The implication is that God will reign and 
the enemy will be blotted out in 1688. Twelve lines 
with four terms to each line equals the number 48 
as the Mem and Het of Tamah on pages 64a and b. 




his mother in accord with the custom and 
enactment of the Jews of Castile. Presently he 
stated that he had no properties available that he 
could hand over to his mother since some had 
been sold to realize money for her maintenance 
and others sold to pay his father’s debts. 
Additional properties belonging to his father had 
been deposited with the scholar and judge Jacob 
Gedaliah. 


It was decided that these properties should be 
divided between mother and son, but the son 
subsequently refused to divide them. Instead he 
said that he would use them to pay a debt to B’nai 
Yeshurun, which never had been recorded in 
contractual form or in the presence of witnesses.

then the mother would pay from her portion. If the

This is one of a series of letters sent by Elijah b. 
Jacob Kasis to R. Jacob Ha-Kohen and R. Ham- 
Malakh Raphael ibn Zur of Fez. Here he informs 
the rabbis that on his travels from Fez to Sefrou he 
was the guest of the munificent R. Aaron Elbaz of 
the latter city, who also aided him in the collection 
of charity. The writer excuses himself for not 
having corresponded earlier as he was preoc- 
cupied with the collection of funds. He expresses 
the hope that the rabbis to whom he writes have 
forwarded certain letters for him and that they 
have collected some monies from Jacob ibn 




A query from Debdou concerning a complex 
problem involving real estate transactions 




Simeon Jacob ben Susan, of Debdou poses a 
Halakhic query concerning real estate transac- 
tions and he asks the rabbis to resolve the matter. 
We are not informed as to who the rabbis are. 
One who is designated as Reuben held land in 
partnership with his mother and sisters which he 
subsequently sold to another called Simeon, and 
guaranteed the value of the land for acertain sum. 
Reuben had additional land in partnership with 
Simeon. Reuben sold the additional land to anon- 
Jew but, in accordance with an enactment that 
land remains intact in the hands of the previous 
owners when it is treated as confiscated property 




60 




from Jacob Gedaliah and use it for any purpose 
she deems fit. 


The aforementioned document and judge- 
ment appears to be rendered by R. Jacob ibn Zur 
even though his name does not appear anywhere 
on this document. The script is characteristic of 
his style of writing. 




Na’im. The author also asks these rabbis to speak 
with Hayyim Yamin Ha-Kohen concerning 
monies that should be forwarded to Joseph 
Achriqi. The author sends regards to R. Solomon, 
R. Saul, R. Mattitya, R. Abner, and R. Israel. Also 
regards should be sent to the prominent citizen 
Menahem Saba, to the scholar R. Jacob Dahan, 
and to Azuz Ha-Kohen. The author sends his best 
wishes for a speedy recovery to the daughter of 
the latter because when he last saw him she was 
ill. He also asks to be remembered to R. Joshua 
Serero. In a postscript he sends regards to 
Solomon Halevi and Aaron Ha-Kohen. On the 
other side of page 66a the address is given for this 
document. Four lines of biographical material are 
also given. [P. 67a is an address from Elijah b. 
Jacob Kasis to R. Raphael ibn Zur and Jacob Ha- 
Kohen of Fez. See page 60a for the document. 
It is really one and the same page. P. 68a is an 
address to the rabbis Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati 
and Raphael ibn Zur. It is pasted to page 59a as 
a reinforcement. } 




with which one may not transact, the sale was not 
valid. The non-Jew sold the land to another Jew 
called Levi. Levi acquired the property rights from 
the vendors. The sisters of Reuben made a claim 
against Simeon and they wrested the land from 
him. Simeon arose and made a claim against 
Levi with his aforementioned property rights. 
Upon further examination it was learned that one- 
sixth of the aforementioned property rights 
belonged to Reuben. An evaluation was made as 
well as a proclamation concerning these property 
rights. The result was that Simeon possessed one 
part while Reuben’s rights consisted of one part 
and one-half. 


After some years, Simeon brought a claim 
against Levi because he said that he had found 




proof that the entire rights of the property 
belonged to Reuben. Levi responded that if in fact 
it was as Simeon claimed, then he would do 
whatever was necessary to restore everything to 
Reuben and that he, Levi, should be the recipient 
of one-sixth. Simeon claimed that the sixth was 
established to be his and if Levi didn’t turn over 
the remainder then he, Simeon, would claim it 




A responsum concerning air pollution and 
property rights 




The question: Reuben possesses a structure that 
houses furnaces which is located near the home 
of Simeon. An oven is located therein which many 
people use for baking. Simeon suffers much 
physical and monetary damage because of the 
smoke that is emitted from the oven even when 
the wind is normal. The walls of his house have 
become blackened from the soot. Reuben wants 
to add another oven to the structure. Simeon, 
upon hearing of this, has made a claim to prevent

A request for information about an historical 
chronicle and a copy of that work 




This letter was written to R. Solomon Elijah !bn 
Zur in the year 1866 by Judah Zarmon. The writer 
requests that R. Solomon should secure informa- 
tion concerning a manuscript of an historical 
work that is in the possession of R. Rahamim 
Gayni of Sefrou. R. Rahamim had promised to 




according to law. The writer turns to the rabbis to 
whom he sent this letter to respond whether the 
law is in accord with Levi, in which case the sixth 
that Simeon took was in error, because he was of 
the opinion that Reuben’s property rights extend- 
ed only to a sixth, or is the law in accord with 
Simeon? This document was sent from Debdou in 
the year 1870. 




the new oven from being added since heclaims to 
suffer so much from the first one. A decision is 
requested. 


The responsum: The law is in agreement with 
Simeon’s claim and Reuben is unable to add an 
additional oven since the smoke is injurious even 
with a normal wind. Even though the property 
damage is slight, (a mere blackening of the walls) 
still Simeon can prevent Reuben from building 
any further additions. The authority of R. Joseph 
Caro is cited in Hoshen Mishpat, chapter 155. 
Also the Haggahot Maimoniyyot, chapter 11 of 
the Laws of Neighbors, law number 7, in the 
Maimonidean Code, is cited.

A letter from Joseph Sasson of Jerusalem to R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur of Fez concerning book 
purchases 




The address of this letter appears on page 73a and 
the letter appears on page 73b. The letter was 
written in the year 1880 and was sent to R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur of Fez, by Joseph Sasson of 
Jerusalem. The writer notes that he wrote to R. 
Raphael a while ago and has not received any 
reply. Now Abraham ibn Simhon and his son have 
come to make some acquisitions on behalf of R. 
Raphael. Other books, purchased previously, 
were sent through the emissary Maharam Suzan 
with a list denoting all the books that were 
purchased. The writer is in constant contact with 
the book dealers that they should supply him with 




A plea to R. Raphael Ibn Zur to uphold a claim to 
an estate 




In Elul 1861, Moses Turgeman writes from 
Tiberias to R. Raphael Ibn Zur at Fez. He relates 
that in the year of the demise of King Mulay 
Mahmad he and his son Jacob, of blessed 
memory, desired to go to settle in the Holy Land. 
However, this desire never materialized because 




62 




should be copied and then sent through Samuel 
Ibn Zur. Judah asks to be informed of the cost of 
the copyists’ work and he will pay well. When he 
has perused the ten or fifteen pages he will give 
the permission for the work to be completely 
transcribed. 




a number of words are given in Judaeo-Arabic. 


In the same scribal hand a vertical list of books 
is given on page 72b. Among the titles are the 
following: Mikneh Avraham, Melekhet Shlomo, 
Simhat Yehudah, Heker Lev, Ohalei Yehudah 
Naggar, Devar Emet, Zera Avraham, Elef Kesef, 
Oseh Shalom, Sha’ar Ha-Zekenim, Zekan Aaron, 
Siftei Renanot, Penei Maivin, Shoresh Yosef, Lev 
Maivin, Kehunat Olam, Yavo Ha-Levi, Minhat 
Zikkaron, and Derash Avraham. This document 
was composed in the second half of the 
nineteenth century. 




the additional works that were requested by R. 
Raphael as soon as they are available. Payment 
for the books that were sent previously should be 
given to R. Jacob Ha-Kohen excluding three 
books that were sent as a gift. One book from 
Joseph Sasson isin place of the Sha’ar ha-Melekh 
that was requested but it was unavailable, and two 
books from R. Kubo, 0.b.m. Also two books are 
sent for R. Abner. The writer wants to know if 
these have arrived. 


Joseph entreats R. Raphael concerning R. 
Yeshua Halevi who apparently owes money for 
books that his son bought. The latter has been 
unable to pay due to illness. Therefore, Joseph 
asks R. Raphael to convey his regrets, and says 
that he has also reduced the price that he would 
have otherwise charged. 




of poverty and the illness and demise of his son. In 
spite of his poor economic condition Moses 
would not permit himself to live on gifts, although 
he had only enough to make ends meet from what 
he was able to earn. 


The writer continues that he has been in- 
formed of the death of Mahmoud Turgeman, may 
his soul reside in paradise, who was his brother- 
in-law (the brother of his wife). According to law, 




part of the estate of Mahmoud should come to 
him. Meanwhile, one called Jacob ibn Zimra, a 
man of means, has taken that portion of the estate 
that should go to his, Moses’, daughters. Moses 
has asked the permission of his daughters to

estate. The rabbis of Sefrou ask the rabbis of Fez 
to aid in settling the matter of prior claims 




This legal document is written to R. Solomon 
Elijah Ibn Zur and to R. Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati of 
Fez by three rabbis situated in Sefrou. The latter 
were R. Rahamim Joseph Gayni, R. Raphael 
Moses Elbaz, and R. Saul Elbaz. [The compiler 
placed this document in the original compilation 
in such a manner that one part is on page 76a 
and the concluding part with three rabbinic sig- 
natures are on page 79b. The address of this 
letter is found on the reverse sides of pages 
76b and 79a. They are actually one page. ]

On page 77a a dowry is fully documented. The 
dowry was for the maiden Masuda, the daughter 
of Levi Magirz. It contained linens, a pillow, a 
tablecloth, pieces of silk fabric, and various gar- 
ments that made up the bride’s trousseau. On 
the bottom half of page 77a many names are 
recorded. Among them are the following: Isaac 
Hota, Moses Solomon Susi, Ephraim Jacob bar 
Moses, Jacob Maymeran, ——— Solomon Yom- 
tob Saadon, ——— Ephraim bar Solomon Susi,

Moses therefore appeals for justice for his 
daughters. He feels that since his wife has died he 
has no claims, but that his daughters’ claim 
should be upheld.

the land is in the hands of the inheritors of 
Mulayl’s wife in accordance with the ruling of the 
court in Fez. A half and an eighth of the upper 
levels of the structure are owned by the aforemen- 
tioned R. Elijah but they were further placed asa 
pledge in the hand of R. Yeshua Elbaz for more 
than three years. Other adjoining attics were 
given in pledge to Simha, the widow of R. Salim 
ben Hamo, and the pledge ended up in the 
possession of Elijah ben R. Solomon ben Asulin 
for the two upper stories. Elijah Asulin also held 
debts against the estate. The creditors of Sefrou 
demand prior payment by having the land 
evaluated and apportioned. They should be paid 
before Elijah since they have prior claims. The 
rabbis who are addressed are asked to compel 
Elijah to come to court or to send his agent so that 
prior claims can be paid and justice done.

Two Halakhic queries to R. Jacob Ibn Zur. The 
first concerns a possible levirate. The second 
concerns an inheritance 




[This letter commences on page 84b and con- 
cludes on page 84a.] Two halakhic queries are 
written to R: Jacob ben R. Reuben, of blessed 
memory, Ibn Zur, on Shushan Purim, in the year 
1749. 


The first query concerns a woman who gave 
birth to a baby prematurely at seven months and 
the baby died nineteen days later. The baby had 
hair and nails. The woman’s husband died 
subsequently. Is she obliged to go through the 
levirate ceremony? The one who poses the 
question notes that the code Even ha-Ezer,

This letter is written by Isaac Sabag to R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur, at Fez. The writer informs R. Jacob about 
all the vicissitudes he has suffered: loss of limb, 
destitution, and the death of his son. He mentions 
the tribulations that transpired on his way to 
Marrakesh. He states that he was the beneficiary 
of the hospitality of R. lsaac Morigon, who 
supports poor wayfarers at his table. Three of 
them ask for alms from door to door. The writer 
mentions that he is ashamed to ask his host to aid 




A correspondence from R. Judah Ibn Attar to R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur 




This letter was written by R. Judah ibn Attar to R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur on the twenty-first of Adar Il in the 
year 1720. R. Judah informs R. Jacob that he was 
chagrined to learn of R. Jacob’s illness and he 
prays for his speedy recovery. The writer also 
informs R. Jacob of drought conditions (in Fez) 
which necessitated the declaration of fasts, public

chapter 166:4, deals with the subject. 


The second query concerns an inheritance. A 
woman brought her possessions as her dowry to 
her husband’s house upon her marriage. (Her 
husband can hold these possessions. However, 
upon her divorce or death he must restore in 
specie, all these possessions, and he is responsi- 
ble for their loss or deterioration. This property is 
designated as Nikhsei Zon Barzel.) This woman 
has died and so has her husband, who was in 
another country. The woman had stated in her will 
that she wanted her niece, her brother's daughter, 
to inherit. The question posed is can the niece, 
who is poor, inherit the aunt’s possessions? The 
anonymous person who poses this question 
states “that the law is in accord withR. Jacob (Ibn 
Zur) everywhere.” 




his plight. The writer requests that R. Jacob ibn 
Attar should be asked to give aid to the members 
of the writer's family in his absence, since they are 
in a poverty-stricken condition. There was 
another person named R. Jacob Ibn Zur who died 
and the writer appeals to R. Jacob Ibn Zur to act 
on behalf of the widow. R. Jacob is asked to write 
to Elazar Arwah and one called David to help 
secure property that once belonged to Yahya 
Lekra for the deceased Jacob Ibn Zur’s heirs. R. 
Moses Berdugo can’t act for the heirs since he is 
at presentvery ill. The writer asks R. Jacob lbn Zur 
to pray that he may return home safely from his 
journey.

R. Judah ibn Attar writes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
concerning the daughter of Joshua, deceased,

Fez ask that financial aid be given to the emissary 
from Jerusalem, R. Yom Tob Krispo, through the 
person of his agent R. Joseph b. Sa’id Abuzaglo. 
Due to his physical exhaustion R. Yom Tob is 
personally unable to travel to Arif. Since, for a 
prolonged period of time, no emissary has visited 
these areas the rabbis of Fez ask these com- 
munities to give a more substantial sum of money 
to maintain the institutions in the Holy Land. [The

claim he had filed against Ephraim ibn Saadon

it. R. Judah ibn Attar says he has discussed the 
matter with the aforementioned Solomon, who

what is his due and there are still expenses 
outstanding for which he should be paid.

The rabbis of Tetuan ask the rabbis of Fez to 
uphold the claim of Abraham Ibn Zerah to the 
estate of his sister , 




This letter was sent by R. Jacob ibn Malka and R. 
Moses Bibas of Tetuan to the rabbinic judges of 
Fez, and signed by the former on the fourteenth 
day of HWeshvan 1756. The subject of this 
document is the claim of Abraham ibn Zerah 
called Musi, for his sister Donna, the widow of R. 
Yaabez, whose legacy fell to him after she passed 
on. Abraham’s brother Solomon was missing and 
therefore was not included in the legacy. 
Abraham claims that there were properties of the 
estate recorded in her marriage contract with her 
second husband apart from what was stipulated 
for her in her marriage contract with her first 
husband. 


The rabbis of Fez are asked to support 
Abraham against R. Raphael lbn Zur who is a 
stepson of Abraham’s deceased sister. Both claim 




R. Saul Serero protests a ban placed by the Holy 
Land communities against the community of 
Tetuan for appropriating charity in times of need 




This is a copy of a manuscript originally com- 
posed by R. Saul Serero to the rabbis in the Holy 
Land who have unjustly pronounced the ban 
against the community of Tetuan for withholding 
funds originally designated for charities in the 
Holy Land. The rabbis of the Holy Land are 
evidently not aware of the dire conditions and 
severe taxation prevailing in Tetuan in this most 
troubled of times. R. Joseph Bibas of Tetuan, who 
has been taken to task by the rabbis in the Holy 
Land has pleaded with R. Saul Serero to reply to 
them. R. Saul berates the rabbis in the Holy Land 
for rashly using the ban; particularly since 
rabbinic luminaries of earlier generations such as

Since the widow has decided to go to Meknés R. 
Jacob is asked to prepare her brothers for her 
arrival. 




the right to receive all the monies that are due to 
her estate. Until such time as the rabbis render 
their decision all those monies should be held by 
R. Saul ibn Danan. Any monies that R. Raphael 
might have belonging to this estate should also be 
surrendered by R. Saul ion Danan. All additional 
properties of a movable nature belonging to 
Donna, which are not stipulated in the marriage 
contracts, that are outstanding, should likewise 
be held by R. Saul ibn Danan. 


The rabbis should inquire about the second 
marriage contract that was held by R. Samuel ibn 
Elbaz, which was also attested to by the elderly R. 
Joseph ibn Attar who accompanied her when she 
married her second husband. Therefore, the 
rabbis should request the marriage document of 
the widow of R. Samuel ibn Elbaz, and upon 
reviewing all the conditions set forth therein let 
them render their final decision on the matter. A 
note of consolation is added on the recent demise 
of R. Mimun ibn Adhan, of Fez, on Saturday 
evening, the seventh of Heshvan 1756. 




R. Joseph Colon, the Rosh, and Rabbenu Tam 
permitted funds earmarked for charity to be 
appropriated for other pressing purposes in times 
of distress. Furthermore, the resident scholars of 
Tetuan should have first been informed of the 
contemplated ban. This was the procedure 
followed when the rabbis in Morocco had to 
exercise a ban against the smaller communities; 
they always informed the scholars of that com- 
munity first. R. Serero affirms the love of the 
western communities, especially Tetuan, for the 
Holy Land communities; but times are bad in the 
west so aid cannot be forthcoming at present. 
Three scrolls of the Law have already been sent to 
Algiers to be sold to pay obligations to the 
emissary of the Holy Land, Abraham Pariente. 
The letter concludes with the hope that times will 
become better and the western communities will 
again resume sending money to the Holy Land. 




R. Judah Ibn Attar implores R. Habib Toledano to 
intercede with a non-Jewish creditor on behalf of 
Abraham Ibn Danan 




This letter is written by R. Judah ibn Attar to R. 
Klabib Toledano on behalf of Abraham ibn Danan. 
In this troubled period ibn Danan owes adebttoa 
non-Jew, Lehajj Adayl, who is demanding pay- 
ment before the date the debt is due. The non-Jew 
is a candidate for a royal position as the third in 
charge of the chariots for the royal entourage. He 
therefore needs the money immediately in order

the month of Kislev 1722, to R. Jacob Ibn Zur by 
Menahem Attia in response to a letter received 
from the former. It deals with two different cases. 
The writer states that in regard to the first mattera 
compromise was finally achieved after the clai-

proper consideration, especially since a decision 
had already been rendered on the matter by a 
scholar.

The importance of perfecting the skills of the 
artisan in performing tasks for preparing or re- 
pairing articles for holy use in religious rituals, 
is discussed by Uri, the son of David Levi, of 
blessed memory. Biblical and Talmuaic texts are 
quoted in support of this viewpoint. The prepare- 
tion of the parchment to best receive the ink when 
writing Torah Scrolls is elaborated upon. It is 
noted that R. Samuel Aboab, of blessed memory, 
was concerned that the concoction used to 
prepare parchments might become an obstruc- 
tion between the parchment and the ink that 
comes into contact with it. This would invalidate

The writer states that R.Y. Caro was a con-

Zur, had it from his father, R. Solomon Samuel Ibn 
Zur 0.b.m., that he saw R.Y. Caro’s signature. R. 
Solomon Elijah records that the prophet Elijah 
revealed himself to R. Judah ibn Attar. Also that R.

in the seventh year after the demise of the 
aforementioned R. Aboab, the author claims to 
have devised a method whereby it is unnecessary 
to apply some other material to the parchment to 
achieve the desired results. He states that he 
discovered this by experimentation even though 
he is not a scribe by profession. The method is 
then fully described. 


The last section of page 119b deals with 
methods of correcting mistakes in a Torah Scroll. 
In the last paragraph the problem concerning the 
impression left by the Divine names of God is 
discussed and R. Samuel Aboab’s concern in this 
matter is mentioned. [This page is not the con- 
clusion of the subject matter under discussion

Saul b. David Serero begins by relating some 
misfortunes. A famine between 1604 and 1606 
took the lives of about eight hundred dwellers in 
Fez. More than six hundred are mentioned as 
having been .converted. The roads were dan- 
gerous because highwaymen abounded. Sui- 
cides were also reported. A lamentation was 
composed on the twentieth day of Adar 1606 for 
the community of Fez. The famine claimed the life 
of R. Jacob ibn Attar among close to three thou- 
sand souls who also succumbed.

This letter is written by Amor Abitbol to R. 
Raphael Ha-Sarfati of Fez. The writer states that 
he accompanied R. Isaac Abitbol to appease R.Y. 
Elbaz, who swore that he had only received half of 
the money in question, the other half having gone 
to his nephew Mordecai Elbaz. After being spoken 
to he was prepared to return a certain amount 
from his portion. 


R. Raphael is also informed of an enactment by 
the community of Meknés in the matter of 
inheritance laws, namely, that the inheritors have 
the prerogative of paying a widow only the value 
of her marriage contract when the estate is large. 




An appeal is made to R. Raphael Ha-Sarfati to 
convince an intransigent debtor to pay his debt

Samuel (son of Saul ibn Danan) writing on 
Thursday the tenth of Tevet 1724 reports a famine 
that lasted for three years, from 1721 to 1724, and 
a drought that continued for four years. The price 
of wheat was quoted at 135 ugiot. Every year the 
“Ba-Ha-B” circuit of fasts was constantly observ- 
ed and added to. Great convocations were ob- 
served in 1773 at Meknés, Salé, and Sefrou. Torah 
Scrolls were brought forth. Rain began to fall and 
continued for three days. The price of barley was 
reduced and wheat was quoted at 60 uqiot. In 
the month of Tevet the price went up again to 
135 uqiot. The author informs us that the misfor- 
tune in Fez was indescribable. [Another part of 
the chronicle is found on pages 127a and b.] 




lf, however, the estate is small they may divide it 
with the widow. An orphan has informed the 
writer that in his case he followed the ruling of 
Mahari Berdugo and only paid the value of the 
marriage contract. If a protest was going to be 
lodged then he would increase the amount. In the 
present case Mahari Elbaz and his nephew have 
permitted the orphan to take all that remained 
over the value of the wedding contract. The writer 
informs Mahari Berdugo that in this case the 
enactment of Meknés will not be in force since the 
woman was married in Sefrou. Even though they 
subsequently moved to Meknés the customs of 
Sefrou on these matters should prevail. The 
author states that he is aware that Mahari 
Berdugo is adamant in following the custom of 
Meknés. However, he should at least try to reacha 
compromise. In the earlier case, R.Y. Elbaz is 
vindicated. If it were possible to satisfy the orphan 
they would have done so. Now, however, the 
orphan can only be convinced to follow the law.

called Abraham ibn Azuz to pay his debts to R. 
Elbaz. Abraham lived in an apartment belonging 
to the writer for some years after 1822. The apart- 
ment has now been sold but Abraham still has 
not paid his debt. In the year 1829 he was called 
to a judgement on this matter and Abraham 
sought the help of R. Jonathan, of blessed 
memory. The latter convinced the writer to let 




Abraham pay his debt in installments because of 
the embarrassment involved. R. Raphael is in- 
formed that he will receive the bill of debt that 
will indeed show that such was the case. The 
aforementioned Abraham is still intransigent and 
therefore R. Judah Elbaz appeals to R. Raphael 
Ha-Sarfati for help since so many years have

This letter, which commences with an introduc-

is sent by Samuel Halevi ibn Yulee toR. Immanuel 
Monsano at Fez. Greetings are sent to R. 
Immanuel’s daughter and his son-in-law R. David. 
Also Jacob Ibn Zur is alluded to. The writer 
informs R. Immanuel that he did everything in his 
power to oblige R. Jacob ben Simhon to pay the 
money that he owed to the estate belonging to R. 
Abraham, the late father-in-law of R. Immanuel 
Monsano. R. Jacob did, however, place the 
money in the safekeeping of a third party until a 
copy of the will of the late R. Abraham could be 
made available. Samuel asks R. Immanuel either

On page 122b a list of names appear next to

dispute can be resolved. The contract that is in the 
possession of R. Joseph Ohanah is still awaited. 


Samuel informs R. Immanuel that the reason 
that he does not reside in his former domicile is 
because R. Sammai Masrafi made free lodgings 
available to him while the status of the previous 
dwelling was involved in a litigation. It is possible 
the case could be reopened so that there is an 
element of insecurity involved in living there. A 
book of accounts will be forwarded to R. 
Immanuel as soon as R.Y. Maragi has time to 
make certain corrections therein. The garment 
that R. Immanuel inquired about is not presently 
available, but another kind is available for pur- 
chase. The writer inquires if the book Maharam 
Zabara is available. If so it should be sent through 
the person of R. Solomon Edery or Joseph Al- 
mosnino who is coming to the writer's city. 
Samuel asks that the letter should be given to

The chronicler, Serero, reports an incident 
(one of a series, we gather), concerning the two 
wicked sons of Hamdun, a non-Jew, who entered 
the Mellah and spent the night in the house of a 
divorcée whom they raped while a few immoral 
Jews offered a musical accompaniment. Some 
brigands, attracted by the music, entered the 
house, beat the Jews, and murdered the two sons 
of Hamdun as well as a third non-Jew who was 
with them. The author feared that the wicked 
Hamdun would spend his wrath on the Jews, 
himself included, in retaliation for the lives of his 
sons. The king was not in the city, the writer 
informs us. He himself sought refuge in the house 
of an Arab official to whom he reported all that 
had transpired. He then began to send messages 
to many of the officials of the realm and to the 
Nagid, R. Jacob Roti, who accompanied the king. 
After many bribes were given, his safety was 
assured. The wicked Hamdun appealed to the 
king who informed him that his charge was false. 
It was not the Jews but the brigands who killed 
his sons and, the Qadi of Fez added, the brigands 
would probably kill Hamdun too.

Ms. 91 and Ms. 92, is part of a small collection 
of writings. It consists of about twenty-two lines 
of verse. The theme deals with a prayerful peti- 
tion to the Almighty in times of trouble. 




In the month of Heshvan 1622, the king went 
to the city of Qazzar when he heard that his 
brother Mulay Mahmad had been chased from 
there. 


The brigands finally came to the author's 
home on the fifteenth of Kislev and tried to gain 
entry through the window. The author's brother, 
R. David, noticed about ten of them and was shot 
at by arrows but he and his brother cast stones at 
the intruders until they fled. The chronicler 
informs us that he went to Sefrou in the month of 
Kislev because of the violence in Fez. He 
remained there for fifteen days whereupon the 
community sent messages on his behalf from the 
king and Officials to the Sheikh Ali, who ruled the 
village of Sefrou, to provide protection (an escort) 
to enable him to return to Fez. 


On page 127b we are informed of upheavals in 
the community of Tafilalet and how the majority 
of Jews suffered death, pillage, and starvation 
during the siege of that community. Others were 
sold into slavery and the synagogues were 
destroyed. The Nagid was hanged. 


On the eve of the new month of Sivan, King 
Mulay Abdallah became ill and on the night of the 
fourteenth of Sivan he died. After his burial, his 
brother Mulay Abd Almalkh, who was fifteen 
years old, was crowned in his stead. The political 
situation was stabilized and travel to Sefrou 
became safer except for the wicked Almatein 
who subsequently rebelled against the king in the 
month of Elul. After a Friday service the ninety- 
year-old Qadi was killed on his return from the 
king’s palace. He was reported to have been 
favorably disposed to the Jews, and they mourn- 
ed his passing. Apparently conditions grew worse 
for the Jews, since all the king’s actions were now 
influenced by the official Ali ibm Musa. He took a 
certain fixed sum of tribute from the Jews. 


On Sabbath eve, the twenty-second of lyar 
1625, there was a great rumbling and an earth- 
quake.

This document is written to R. Samuel Elbaz of 
Fez by the Rabbis Jacob Toledano and Mimun 
Adhan of Meknés concerning the claim of Isaac 
ibn Haroush against Hayyim ibn Magiruz. Isaac 
held a pledge against a portion of a courtyard 
called Zar Asbaga which Joseph ibn Amram ibn 
Tata sold for 700 uqiot of silver thereby forfeiting 
his rights to the courtyard. The time to make good 
on the pledge before it would become forfeited 
was on the twenty-eighth of Adar 1716. That date

four subsequent occasions Isaac sent formal 
legal claims, but no response was forthcoming. 
On his arrival in Meknés Hayyim had stated that 
when he returned to Fez he would ask R. Samuel 
Elbaz to forward additional information which 
would support his case, but Hayyim had never 
taken this action and his stalling was making a 
mockery of justice. Now if a satisfactory answer 
was not forthcoming then within a month Isaac 
would exercise his claim to all parts of the 
courtyard. Both parties to the dispute had been 
instructed by the undersigned rabbis to write toR. 
Samuel Elbaz concerning the litigation, on the 
same day that this letter was written. This would 
insure that R. Samuel could forward a speedy

assigned to the younger son, David. Joseph

This letter which is in metaphoric style was

A letter from the Holy Land to rabbi Raphael Ibn 
Zur of Fez 




This letter was sent by Abraham ibn Walid of 
Jerusalem in 1873 to R. Ham-Malakh Raphael Ibn 
Zur of Fez and it also mentions R. Raphael’s son 
Solomon. The author apologizes for not being 
able to write sooner. He states that his brother and 
sister and her sons have just arrived from the west 
and he is busy caring for their needs. Concerning 
certain books he replies that Rabbi Zuf Devash

eighteenth day of Shevat 1874. The original was 
drawn up on the twenty-eighth day of Tishri 1873. 
The witnesses to the original will were R. Aaron 
Ha-Kohen, and R. Joseph ibn Aaron Hamo. The 
witnesses to the copy were Abraham ibn Jacob 
Ha-Kohen Skali and Solomon ibn Joseph ibn 
Hamo. 




indeed the report is true then R. Mordecai asks R. 
Samuel to substantiate the matter by providing a 
written statement of the witnesses and their 
names. If the witnesses had already been cross- 
examined by the Rabbinic Tribunal (in Fez) then 
apparently nothing could be done to reverse the 
judgement. Even so why would the plaintiff be 
encouraged by R. Samuel to inquire of the non- 
Jewish authorities to force the defendant to 
comply? R. Samuel is asked to stop the non-Jews 
from interfering in the matter, “As if we have not 
sufficiently suffered by their actions.” This letter

and to the innkeeper Mahlouf and his son. The

R. Raphael to send a letter in the former's name to 
the city of Taza concerning their contribution to

A letter from the Holy Land to R. Raphael Ibn Zur

This letter is sent to R. Raphael lbn Zur asking him 
to aid an emissary who is referred to as R. Aryeh. 
The latter has been sent to collect funds for the 
purpose of building a synagogue in the Holy 
Land. The author expresses his regrets that he 
was not able to find a book that R. Raphael 
requested. It was called Torah Hadashah. The 




author of this letter states that he offers prayers

of the death of the Saint. This letter is written in 
anticipation of the arrival of the aforementioned 
emissary in the west. The letter will be borne by 
Elijah Asulin who is returning to Fez after 
spending some time in the Holy Land. The letter 
cannot be too lengthy since Elijah Asulin has to

Aresponse is given to the query as to what point in 
time one attains his majority, in a lengthy letter 
written to R. Menahem Serero 




This correspondence was written toR. Menahem 
Serero, at Fez, on the twelfth day of Adar, in the 
year 1719. The author is R. Jacob |bn Zur who was 
situated in Meknes when he wrote the letter. The 
author informs us of his inability to take solid or 
liquid nourishment because of his illness and of 
his need to take medicine before prayer services 
and before recital of the Kiddush on Sabbath 
morning. Then he takes up the issue as to when 
one attains one’s majority. Whether it is on the 




first or second day of the fourteenth year which is 
thirteen years and one day or thirteen years and 
two days. “It is obviously attained by the age of 
thirteen and one day and far be it for me to have 
stated that it was thirteen and two days. The next 
question is, must a full twenty-four hours of the 
first day transpire before the majority is attained 
or as soonas the first hour of that day commences 
is it attained?” The author admits to having erred 
because of the influence of his illness when it 
was noted that he stated that the day of birth was 
regarded as belonging to the thirteenth year when 
it is indeed common knowledge that it belongs to 
the fourteenth year. The name of Judah ibn

Mahmias is noted as the messenger who 
transmitted the erroneous calculations of the 
author that misled R. Menahem Serero. Before the 
author had a chance to correct his error the 
messenger was gone. The writer mentions that 
his son Reuben fell and remained in a stupor for 
a long time but is now recovered. The writer asks 
R. Menahem Serero to transmit the former’s 
advice to the sons of his master R. Vidal Ha- 
Sarfati, of blessed memory, that they should not 
initiate a litigation unless certain conditions 
can be met first. 


The writer mentions that he had received 
information from R. Musa Halevi and R. Menahem 
Serero that two pairs of pants would arrive for him 
but only one pair has arrived and the matter is still 
in doubt. The writer inquires about the wellbeing 
of R. Menahem Serero’s father who was beaten by 
a non-Jew. Concerning one Joseph b. Glaqon the 
writer says he refuses to intervene since he is 
closely related to him and that if he must be 
removed it is better to have someone else do it. 


R. Jacob Ibn Zur mentions a new liturgical 
piece that he has composed; as soon as it is 
prepared he will make it available to R. Menahem. 
The writer notes that R. Menahem complains that 
the former never refers to the latter’s children in 
his correspondences. R. Jacob responds that R. 
Menahem never inquires concerning the wellbe- 
ing of the writer’s grandchild, Mattitya. R. Jacob 
informs R. Menahem that the latter's cousin Saul 
will soon be married to a young maiden, an 
orphan, of the Ben Ezra family. Saul was a son of 
R. Menahem’s late uncle, of blessed memory. 




A fragment containing the concluding part of a

A novel interpretation is given to the biblical 
verse, Genesis 2:20, “As for Adam, he did not find 
a helper who worked at cross purposes to him.”

A man has been charged with burning a pillow 
and R. Jacob says that as soon as the owners of 
the pillow are discovered the guilty party shall 
make restitution. Regards are sent by R. Jacob 
Zadok to R. Menahem. 


R. Jacob Ibn Zur states that he composed a 
prayer of praise for recital at Yishtabah (a juncture 
in the morning prayer service) and another 
liturgical poem for Kaddish. The latter poem deals 
with the commandments of the Zizit (prayer 
shawl) and Tefillin (phylacteries). These poems 
were chanted publicly on the new month of Adar, 
when R. Jacob's son, Obed, was publicly initiated 
into the performance of the aforementioned 
commandments. The writer informs R. Menahem 
that he includes a copy of these liturgical poems 
in the present letter, to be used especially for 
youngsters on their introduction to the com- 
mandments. R. Jacob requests that the poems be 
read on the occasion of the initiation of his 
brother’s son called Reuben, which will take place 
either on the new month of Nisan or thereafter. 
Also David b. Pargon received a copy of the 
poems. If anyone who is a payytan (a master of 
liturgical compositions) desires to copy these 
poems R. Menahem is informed to tell David b. 
Sigron to make them available to them, for they 
were composed for the benefit of all. The letter is 
signed by R. Jacob Ibn Zur. The address appears 
on page 144a and the following six lines appear on 
page 144b. “From the money that you collected, 
give some to Esther Arzawiya, a linen curtain to 
Judah, acousin, and buy for me two linen curtains

naming of various creatures that were brought

the naming of the various creatures, but he was in

beings were not in accord with God's desire to

An edict against unfair pricing 




Three judges of the Rabbinic Court of Fez, acting 
for the community, have issued an edict against 
unfair pricing. The undersigned rabbis are R. 
Jacob Serero, R. Jacob Ibn Zur, and R. Reuben 
Serero. This legislation proscribes using dis- 
honest weights and measures. The butchers are 
pointed to as prime violaters. Even if they increase 
the price only by pennies, they are guilty of theft 
and of robbing the poor. The members of the

The neighbors are acting within their rights when 
they try to prevent any alteration of the existing

the Code of Jewish Law, chapter 132, by the 
Maharshakh. The author of Hut ha-Meshulash, 
responsum number 17, makes the point that 
even if modifications are made they can fall 
into disrepair and therefore no new installa- 
tions shall be added. The judgements of Ramban 
and Rashba that are cited by R. Joseph Caro, 
in chapter 154, paragraph 16, of the Code of 
Jewish Law, are also against such installation. No 
names of rabbis or individuals contemporaneous

A letter to R. Yedidia Monsonyego of Fez 




This letter, which was sent to R. Yedidia Mon- 
sonyego, discusses a halakhic matter which is not 
easy to comprehend since the script is not easy to 
decipher. Some of the authorities that are cited 




A responsum concerning claims made on an old 
loan by inheritors of the late creditor shall be 
honored if the upheavals of the times make it 
impossible for the original claim to be made 




Many years before, a creditor, designated as X, 
had two bills of claim where land was stipulated as 
being pledged against a debtor, Y. Those who 
have now inherited the bills of claim after two 
generations want to make a claim against the 
debtor’s family of inheritors, can they do so? The 
counter argument of the debtor’s family, that the 
debts were probably paid because the creditors’ 
family never made any claim during all those 
intervening years, does not stand because of the 
upheavals that transpired during the days of the 
arch-enemy Sahiq Tamia Galul. He it was who 
pillaged the area of the inheritors of R. Aaron Ha- 
Kohen and the records disappeared until they 
were unearthed at a later date. The creditor 
complained to the King Mulay Slieman and he 
was subsequently killed and his claims con- 
fiscated. The inheritors of the debtor tried to 
claim that their inheritance could not be tampered 
with in such a situation, whereas the inheritors of 
X claimed that since the land was placed as a 
pledge for non-payment the claim did stand. If the 




are the Maharashdam, the Maharshakh, and the 
work Tumat Yesharim. It is conceivable that the 
subject relates to a litigation concerning proper- 
ties.

letter. 




latter are vindicated, then they question whether 
they may claim the value of the produce from the 
date of death of Y, who received the loan initially? 


The response is given in favor of the inheritors 
of X, the creditors, with regard to the debts. 
However, the rabbis are notso sure as to theclaim 
on the produce. They base themselves on the 
Code, Tur Shulhan Arukh, chapter 61, who bases 
himself on the Rosh, his father. The Beit Yosef, 
Rabbi Caro’s commentary, is also mentioned. 
Also the Haggahot Ha-Tur 13:14 and the Rash- 
dam are cited. A distinction is made in the afore- 
mentioned citations between an indication of 
falsification of a claim that has lapsed over a 
period of time, and one where the circumstances 
are such that the claim may still be pending 
because of upheavals which made the particular 
documents of proof previously inaccessible so 
that it could not be acted upon. 


A more recent decision is cited which is more 
similar in its circumstances to the case before us. 
The judges in that case are the Rabbis Saul 
Serero, Judah ibn Attar, and Raphael lbn Zur. The 
last two are recorded to have been deceased at 
this time. The year of this document is given as 
1874. The signatories are Aaron Ha-Kohen Skali 




and Samuel Gayni.

A letter from the Holy Land to emissaries 




This letter was sent by R. Samuel Ha-Kohen of the 
Holy Land to the emissaries R. Mimun Aflalo and 
R. Jacob ibn Danan in Fez, on the eighth of 
Heshvan 1684. A part of the letter is written in 
Judaeo-Arabic words. A document from the 
widow of R. Azriel Ashkenazi has been sent to the 
emissaries. R. Samuel informs them that the 
monies will be personally apportioned. Some 
money has been sent with the emissary R. Hayyim 
Ashkenazi; other money with R. Moses Wagil and 




82 




R. Mahlouf ibn Hamo, but until now no response 
has been. received from them. Additional funds 
should be sent to the judge R. Benjamin Duran, to 
the city of Algiers, upon the reception of letters 
with requests sent by the writer. It is important to 
avoid tardiness in these matters. A new emissary, 
R. Joseph Ha-Kohen, is being appointed in the 
hope that he will be blessed with greater success. 
Prayers are recited for all at the Kotel (Western 
Wall of the Temple compound) and in the acade- 
my during studies. The address is given on the 
other side of the page.

A scholar reproves the rabbis of Fez for not

This letter is written to the Rabbis Elijan Ha- 
Sarfati and Matitya Serero of Fez by ascholar who 
is in great distress economically. The writer 
berates the aforementioned rabbis for not paying 
attention to his plight. He appears to be in transit 
or to have recently moved, since his books are not 
available for him to quote textual sources for his 
comments which, he claims, abound in rabbinic 
sources. He reproves the rabbis for not arousing 
the compassion of the populace to his needs. This 
activity on their part would serve to arouse the 




Novellae on Jewish law and a responsum 




On pages 160a and 160b, novellae on the Codes of 
Jewish Law are recorded. The subject “Ain 
Shaliah Le-Devar Averah” (the power of agency 
does not apply in the case of perpetration of 
transgression) is discussed.

A correspondence from R. Mordecai Berdugo 
that includes two Halakhic queries 




This letter is written by R. Mordecai Berdugo (of 
Meknés) to R. Abraham Monsano of Fez. He also 
sends greetings to R. Immanuel (probably a 
Monsano). A letter had been written, but returned 
and the present letter incorporates the contents of

between one half and one third of that which the 
seller paid for it himself. This was done because 
the Maymeran family was very pressed financially 
at that time. Therefore Samuel asks the under- 
signed to write to R. Jacob !lbn Zur to intercede on 
his behalf with R. Shalom. R. Samuel feels that 
only then will justice be done. The two under- 
signed are Abraham b. David Hasin and Hananiah 
b. Zikhri. 




multitude to acts of charity. Furthermore, he has 
always helped those in need such as was the case 
when some had to journey from Fez to Larache. If 
the rabbis are desisting from helping him because 
they feel intimidated, he tells them that the very 
opposite should be the case. The people are 
wondering why the rabbis have not issued a call 
for aid. In the days of the Hasmoneans one feared 
intimidation, but not in “our days,” he says. He 
states that he is prepared to sell whatever he 
possesses to pay his debts; however, more funds 
are needed. He informs his correspondents that 
the Nagid has placed additional taxes on him. AR. 
Jacob Halevi is also mentioned. The author of 
this letter may be R. Jacob Ibn Zur. 




other objects that come later) and “Ain Osin 
Mitzvot Havildt Havildt,” are discussed. 


On pages 162a to 164a a responsum is pre- 
sented concerning one who interrupted the 
blessings of the Sh’ma in order to respond to a 
“Davar She-be-Qedusha” and then neglected to 
recite the blessing “Ga-al Yisroel” and immediate- 
ly began to recite the Amida. 


All the texts from page 160a through page 164a 
are written by the same hand. 




the previous letter as well. The writer adds that ifa 
letter has already been sent to R. M. Adhan, at 
Tetuan, then another note should be sent 
concerning a Torah Scroll belonging to R. Elazar 
Zadok that is in the synagogue of R. M. Adhan. 
This letter should be so written as if R. Abraham 
Monsano initiated it himself. He should write that 
when he was in Meknés a plea was made to him to 
do so. Inquiry is also made concerning the 




wellbeing of Rabbi Yaabez who was known to 
have been ill. Greetings are sent toR. Samuel. The 
writer notes that he sent a decision to R. Jacob 
concerning Moses A Sayaig and he requests it or 
at least a copy of it. He also asks that a purchase of 
some material should be made for him, since he 
has heard that a scholar from the ibn Siqron 
family acquired it from one Levi ibn Lahdav. The 
writer asks that it should be sent with R. Y. Rosilio 
and the former will make immediate payment or 
he will send the money. 


R. Mordecai asks that the replies to two 
questions should be sent to him through 
Maharibez (R. Jacob Ibn Zur) but if he is not free 
to reply then he should ask Maharsha (R. Samuel! 
Elbaz) to do so. The first question concerns two 
partners; whether their contract is to be con- 
sidered like all writs of obligation so that one 
cannot state “| bought your interest,” or is it to be 
treated only like a deposit, in which case he can 
say that he paid half of it back? Then what force 
does the original contract have? If it is to have 
legal force, surely he should be able to collect 
even from inheritors or one who might have 
bought that portion of the partnership. R. 
Mordecai notes that this is an old dispute and it 
requires resolution. 


The second question refers to two Jews who 
had houses in a courtyard belonging to a non- 
Jew. The two houses fell in and the non-Jewish 
owner of the courtyard wanted to take down 
whatever remained standing and to appropriate 
the beams. However, he said if there was a 




A plea to review a previous judicial decision which 
was reversed by rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur as a result of 
the submission of new evidence 




R. Jacob Toledano writes this letter in response to 
an authority, who remains unnamed, concerning 
a transaction that became a subsequent case for 
litigation. The case concerns a gift that Re’SH’M 
gave to Re’SHa’kH. The latter was the previous 
year in Meknés. Then a dispute arose between 
Re’SH’M and R. M. Edery and those who inherited 
from R. Saadya Kohen. Presently, R. Toledano is 
asked to recall what transpired at the time that the 
gift was given. Was the gift given by the instru- 




customer who would buy the courtyard he would 
not take down the remaining beams. Reuben, one 
of the two Jewish owners of the houses, lived in 
geographic proximity to the non-Jew, but Simeon 
had moved away. Reuben wanted sufficient time 
to inform Simeon and to ask whether he would 
like to buy the courtyard. The non-Jew was 
impatient and wanted to leave the city and said 
that if they did not acquire the courtyard 
immediately he would take everything apart. 
Reuben, pressed as he was, decided to buy the 
courtyard rights by himself from the non-Jew, 
excluding Simeon entirely. He had witnesses 
attest to the fact that this was his intention. Now 
Simeon has come with a claim against Reuben 
demanding that his rights in the courtyard should 
stand and saying that he will pay Reuben for half 
of it. Reuben has countered that Simeon has no 
Claim, since if Reuben had not bought the rights, 
everybody would have lost the courtyard. 


Rabbi Mordecai supposes a hypothesis. If a 
third party had bought the courtyard from the 
non-Jew, would that purchaser have acquired the 
courtyard with all its buildings levelled? Since this 
would have been the position for the non-Jew 
with respect to the building rights, the only rights 
that Reuben and Simeon should have extend only 
to the price of the bare land on which their 
buildings once stood.

cai Berdugo is visible, at the conclusion of the

ment of a document or was it given orally? R. 
Toledano replies that he doesn’t recall whether a 
contract was formally drawn up or whether it was 
an oral transaction. His colleagues who joined 
him on that occasion also have poor recollections 
of those events. The writer states that a request to 
confirm a decision rendered by R. Hasan ibn 
Lahsin has still not been responded to. The latter 
has been informed that R. Jacob Ibn Zur once 
wrote opinions on the case because new evidence 
had become available, thus making it like a new 
query and not the questioning of an earlier 
decision. R. Toledano asks the one to whom he is 
writing to seek one of the litigants who dwells in

his vicinity who has acopy of the ruling that he (R. 
Toledano) and other scholars had rendered. 
Perhaps that litigant also has a copy of the ruling 
rendered by R. Jacob Ibn Zur? Even though the 
scholars of the west rely upon R. Jacob Ibn Zur, R. 




R. Mordecai Berdugo responds to R. Jacob Ibn 
Zur concerning a dispute over an inheritance 
amongst the members of the D’Avila family 




This letter is in response to a previous Cor- 
respondence sent by R. Jacob |bn Zur concerning 
an inquiry about wine barrels that one R. Judah 
D’Avila was said to have had in his possession. 
The wife of Moses, son of Jacob D’Avila, has 
replied saying that R. Judah left no more than 
three barrels in his storage from days gone by. 
Apparently, her husband, Moses, is a grandson of 
R. Judah D’Avila, as is the present claimant, 
Judah D’Avila. The aforementioned Moses has 
begun to curse vilely all those making inquiry into 
the extent of R. Judah D’Avila’s estate. R. 
Mordecai Berdugo, wanting some factual infor- 
mation, has suggested that two people should 




R. Mordecai Berdugo has received a legal 
decision from Jacob Ibn Zur and he asks that R. 
Jacob help to achieve a compromise 




R. Mordecai Berdugo informs R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
that he has received the latter's written legal 
decision and that he is happy to note that R. 
Jacob’s decision is in agreement with R. 
Mordecai’s account book and not on the first book 
as Harit (R. Jacob Toledano) would have it. The 
writer says that the custom of Castilia remains the 
final guide for R. Jacob Ibn Zur. The first woman 
involved pleaded with R. Mordecai to initiate 
moves that would produce a compromise. The 
writer states that he will not do anything until he 
receives permission from R. Jacob Ibn Zur. 
Therefore, the writer pleads with R. Jacob !bn Zur 
that he call to the maiden Shazbona and persuade 
her to be willing to compromise. R. Mordecai has 
assured her that the result of the compromise 
would leave her with a higher sum, while R. 




86 




Toledano writes, perhaps another insight can be 
arrived at by his correspondent thereby preser- 
ving his own earlier decision. R. Toledano asks 
that a new ruling based on such an insight should 
be forwarded to him. 




enter the storage area to see for themselves that 
such is indeed the number of barrels, i.e. not more 
than three. R. Mordecai mentions that he has tried 
to achieve a reconciliation whereby Judah D’Avila 
would receive a certain number of barrels, 
because he wants to acquire the barrels 
elsewhere if necessary before the winepressing 
season is over, with R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s permis- 
sion. It seems that the Maharit (R. Jacob 
Toledano) also wrote a ruling on the matter which 
would leave Judah D’Avila empty-handed. R. 
Mordecai Berdugo asks R. Jacob Ibn Zur to 
decide either in accordance with the former’s 
ruling or with the Maharit’s ruling. In either case R. 
Mordecai requests a speedy reply. Both rulings 
are included in this correspondence. [An aspect 
of this case is discussed in Ms.119—page 168a, 
which is a subsequent correspondence from R. 
Mordecai to R. Jacob Ibn Zur.] 




Mordecai now notes that only a smaller sum 
would be available. R. Mordecai says that he will 
not act unless he can first hear what R. Jacob Ibn 
Zur intends to do. R. Mordecai suggests that it 
would be best if a compromise could be reached 
because Harit (R. Jacob Toledano) is stubborn 
while the women who are involved in the litigation 
are incurring losses. Therefore, R. Mordecai feels 
that R. Jacob Ibn Zur should persuade the second 
woman to be a party to a compromise which 
would bring the litigation to a quick conclusion. 
R. Jacob is asked to inform the writer as soon as 
he is able to convince the woman to agree to 
compromise. 


Concerning the barrels [see Ms.1718, page 
167a] R. Mordecai states that he purchased five of 




‘them and when they arrive he will send them toR. 




Jacob Ibn Zur with the first sojourner. The writer 
signs as Mordecai Berdugo. 


In a postscript R. Mordecai writes that when 
ReSHakH comes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur he will speak 




at length concerning the matter and he will bringa 
document which R. Jacob should ignore or even 




A correspondence from Raphael Halevi to R. 
Solomon Ibn Zur of Fez 




Raphael Halevi commences his correspondence 
by noting that he has received a letter from R. 
Solomon Ibn Zur. He states that he is confronted 
with the problems of old age and that this affects 
his writing. The information that R. Solomon Ibn 
Zur has provided concerning R. Y. Simhon’s 
account is news indeed. The writer informs R. 
Solomon that on a number of occasions R.

This legal document was formulated by R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur in the month of Adar 1744 at Fez. The 
principals who agreed to serve as guarantors are 
Reuben the son of R. Jacob b. Aharpi, who is 
known as Ben Shaiya, and Samuel the son of 
Mas'’ud ben Aharpi, called Ben Shaiya. These men 
admit that they received a certain sum of money 
from Masuda the daughter of Israel ben Aharpi, 
called Ben Shaiya. They agreed to make payment 
to an orphan, Luna, the daughter of Musa ben 
Aharpi, called Ben Shaiya. An attic was given asa 




An enactment by the community of Sefrou 
concerning the dispensation of charity 




The Rabbis Hayyim Elijah (Gayni) and Saul ibn 
Elbaz write to the rabbis Raphael lbn Zur and 
Aaron Ha-Kohen of Fez concerning an enactment 
that the elders of the community of Sefrou have 
passed with regard to charitable contributions. 




A court action guarantees a compromise 




Mordecai ibn Abraham ben Zazun brought a 
claim against Mimun ibn Ayush ben Halfon based 
on a bill of debt that the latter owed the former for 




destroy. The writer signs the postscript with his 
initials Marbiz. 




Hayyim ibn Danan has written to say that an

more activity. The writer, Raphael, states that 
upon his return from Meknés he will communicate 
with him. R. Solomon’s report that Mas’tUd “built 
his house” (got married) is again news. Raphael 
extends blessings to R. Solomon Ibn Zur’s only 
son who bears the same name as the writer, i.e. 
Raphael. The writer reminds R. Solomon that 
when he was in Rabat he wrote that he was not 
intending to return to Fez. 




pledge by the aforementioned Reuben and 
Samuel to the aforementioned Masuda. It is 
adjacent to the yard owned by David b. Amozag in 
the Mellah of Fez, with all other rights of tenancy 
applying to her. 


Apparently this document was drawn up with 
only one witness in attendance. Thus R. Im- 
manuel Monsano and Elijah ben Zimra have 
certified this document thereby correcting this 
situation. The addendum which was written for 
this correction also states that one called Israel, 
the son of Saadya (a brother of the aforemen- 
tioned Reuben) acted on behalf of his uncle, while 
Samuel acted for himself. Those present 
reiterated all the foregoing with Masuda in the 
presence of the court. 




Whenever a scholar arrives from Fez for a 
charitable collection he should present an official 
receipt issued by the rabbis of Fez for the amount 
of money which the community of Fez gave to 
him. He will automatically receive one-third of 
that amount from Sefrou. This does not apply to 
what individuals should desire personally to give 
the emissary. 




the purchase of an item in the sum of 300 ugiot. 
Mimun brought a counter-claim against Mordecai 
saying that the item he purchased was defective 
and as aresult he incurred losses. A mediator has 
now been able to negotiate a compromise

between the contending parties. The terms of the 
compromise stipulate that Mimun should pay one 
hundred and forty ugiot over the amount that was 
already paid to Mordecai, thereby freeing himself 
from any subsequent claims that might be made. 
Mimun also agrees to drop any counter-claims. 
However, since Mimun is fearful that Mordecai 
will violate the terms of the compromise, the latter 
has stated in the presence of a rabbinic tribunal 
that he agrees to uphold the terms of the 
compromise and has engaged in legal forms to 
show his intentions. The agreement between the 
parties is now formulated in a legal document. 
Dates are stipulated for Mimun to complete his 
payments to Mordecai, who is also reminded of 
Mimun’s devotion in not handing Mordecai over 
to the authorities for producing a faulty product. 
The court will act in this matter with the power of 
“that which the court declares ownerless so shall 
it remain.” If any protest is registered against the

An emissary from Safed arrives in Sefrou and

Jacob Ibn Zur of Fez, informing the latter of his 
arrival in Sefrou ten days earlier. The writer 
informs R. Jacob that on Sunday he will journey to 
Meknés. The writer also wants R. Jacob to cor-

All this was completed on Sunday, the twenty- 
fifth day of Nisan 1725 at Fez. The undersigned 
are Moses Asulin and Jacob the son of R. Joseph 
of blessed memory, Busida. 


A formal statement is added on page 173b 
stating that even though this document deals with 
a compromise, where a formal renunciation of all 
protestations that would make this arrangement 
null and void is not necessary, still the under- 
signed include such a renunciation with the 
power of ‘that which the court declares ownerless 
shall be ownerless.” The undersigned to this

This letter which is written to the rabbis of

and R. Moses Berdugo, by lsaac Nah6n, concerns

author of this letter on some other occasions. 
However, no response has been forthcoming; 
perhaps the exigencies of time have prevented 
such a response. When the parents of the woman 
heard that R. Saadya Halevi and R. Shem Tob ibn 
Walid were leaving the community for Meknés 
they asked them to intercede on her behalf that 
she might be granted justice. Thus, R. Isaac 
Nahon, the writer of the letter, asks the rabbis to 
begin to act on the matter. 




Aaron Halevi of Safed who had aclaim against his 
nephew but refused to press it as long as he could 
earn a living. However, now that he is poverty- 
stricken he has no recourse but to press his claim. 
The writer asks R. Jacob to study the case and, if 
the claim is true, to expedite the matter. Also R. 
Moses Berdugo is asked to give his opinion on the 
case. 




widow of R. Reuben is concerned about the future 
welfare of her daughters, lest they should meet 
with death or some other terrible fate because of 
the adversity that prevails. The author is appeal- 
ing toR. Samuel to aid the unfortunate widow and 
her daughters. A second subject is also brought to 
the attention of R. Samuel: a query that is being 
sent by R. Jacob Bibas. [This query is presented

letter. ]

This letter of consolation is sent by the under- 
signed, Hayyim Toledano, Aaron the son of 
Judah Halevi, and Jacob Bibas, to Raphael Obed 
Ibn Zur, the son of R. Jacob Ibn Zur, on the death 
of his father. The aforementioned rabbis (of Salé) 
eulogize the late great Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur in 




accord with his many talents and the excellence 
that he manifested in all those fields of endeavor. 
They offer consolation to the bereaved family and 
praise R. Raphael as the one who will succeed his 
late father. In a one line postscript mention is 
made of some books that were placed in safe- 
keeping and it is asked whether they should be 
forwarded to R. Raphael. This letter was written 
in 1753.

A court action reprimanding a scribe for assum- 
ing the authority to serve as a judge 




This document is a court action rendered in 
agreement with the communal leaders against 
Jacob ibn Malka who for many years assumed 
judicial power by signing his name to responsa 
and legal documents without having received any 
authority to do so. Since he was a scribe he 
utilized the opportunity to add his signature to 
legal documents that he had occasion to com- 
pose, thereby giving the impression that he was 
appointed as a judge with the other undersigned 
judges. 


A decree is thus handed down that Jacob ibn 
Malka shall never add his signature to any legal 
decision or responsum either by himself or with 
other scholars. Nor shall he communicate with 
scholars of other countries concerning any 
matters pertaining to law. He shall not exceed his 
authority as a scribe of the court in accord with 
the practice of other scribes who are in the service 
of the court. He is only permitted to arbitrate and 
to compose documents of arbitration. If he 
violates any of the aforementioned terms then he 
shall be judged accordingly and the Nagid, the lay 
leader of the Jewish community, Samuel Halevi 
ibn Yulee, shall order him to pay a fine as he sees 
fit. This court document is dated Heshvan 1732 at 
Fez. The rabbis signing the documents are R. 
Judah ibn Attar, R. Jacob Ibn Zur, R. Shalom 
Edery, R. Abraham ibn Alel, and R. Samuel Elbaz. 
The document is affirmed by R. Moses ibn 
Maman, R. Aaron ibn Saadon, R. Judah ibn 
Moses, R. Moses b. Abraham ibn Ashikh, R. 
Moses ibn Shitrit, R. David Aspag, and R. Israel 
Adhan. The two signatures certifying this docu- 




ment are those of Joseph Sigqron and Mimun b. 
Joseph Busidan. The document gives the follow- 
ing background information. 


When the Great Rabbi (Judah ibn Attar) died, 
the rabbis instituted a practice that two lectures 
should be recited each day at morning and 
afternoon services in his memory for a period of 
thirty days. R. Jacob ben Malka did not attend 
either to lecture or to listen, nor did he even visit 
the cemetery. This was considered an affront 
since R. Judah ibn Attar, as holder of the title Av 
Bet Din (head of the court), and as the greatest 
rabbi of the generation, was considered to be the 
great master and all his students (including R. 
Jacob ben Malka) were obliged to pay respects to 
his memory. 


Three months later Jacob ibn Malka called 
all the scholars and communal leaders to his 
synagogue to hear his lecture. He used the occa- 
sion to insult the scholars by intimating that he 
was superior to all of them, adding that the mem- 
bers of the court were also his inferiors. He after- 
wards lobbied members of the community to 
give him a document stating that he had legal 
standing as a judge. However, they were not 
persuaded to do so. He also asked them to attest 
to his impeccable character. In fact, incidents 
were enumerated to demonstrate the opposite. 


Jacob was known, for example, to have con- 
tradicted the rulings of the head of the court, 
and on another occasion he had cursed the 
grandson of the Rabbi. In the year 1731 the Rabbi 
(Attar) rendered his response to a query from 
Sefrou which he signed together with the mem- 
bers of the court, but when the document reached 
the hand of Jacob ibn Malka the response was 
contradicted and the decision reversed. On many

occasions Jacob ibn Malka had been noted for

negative attitude became evident it was taken 
from him. Even then he would not acknowledge 
that the stipend was a grant, but viewed it as a debt 
owed to him by the community.

A plea to the rabbis of Fez to enforce a judgement 
against a runaway husband if he refuses to return

This document is written to the rabbis of Fez and 
to the scholar R. Moses Grimeau asking them to 
render justice on behalf of a woman, Miriam, the 
daughter of R. Joseph Navét. Her husband, R. 
Isaac, the son of R. Daniel Sas, has made her a 
living widow for the past five years by abandoning 
her and her small son without any financial 
support. An earlier correspondence to the rabbis 
depicted the abject condition of this neglected 
wife. The writer of this document notes that on 
this same day the woman found her husband to be 
unfaithful to her. The rabbis of Fez are asked to

named Muhammad A\I-Haji, who is the bearer of

this purpose. If the husband remains intransigent 
then the rabbis are asked to ensure that he will pay

the amount of 4500 golden denari, her dowry and, 
in addition, all the unpaid support that is coming 
to her from previous years. Also a proper bill of

confronted the debtors who had no funds 
available to make payment. However, the debtors 
were able to send 100 uqiot which is a portion of 
the debt. The money was given to R. Hayyim ibn 
Mas’ud ibn Magirz, who dwells in R. Jacob Ibn

the author’s community, with instruction to hand 
it to the creditor.

Fez. The latter promised to pay the debt to David 
Sasportas in the amount of 140 weights of silver, 
as Stated in the bill of debt. Meanwhile, David’s 
creditors are pressing him for payment of a debt 
owed to them. Therefore, R. Judah ibn Attar is 
being called upon to come to David's aid against

A court document containing testimony concer- 
ning a Jewish bandit 




Abraham, the son of Moses called Hazit, and Isaac 
Slieman ben ATurgeman, of Tafilalet, came 
before the Rabbinic Tribunal in Fez to register a 
complaint against Yom Tob ibn Saadon bar 
Yissakhar, a gangster terrorizing the area of 
Tafilalet by committing the most vile kinds of 
crimes. He has engaged in immoral sexual acts to 
satisfy his lust thereby causing many husbands to 
divorce their wives. He also is known to function 
as an informer against the Jews to non-Jewish 
leaders and the Jews suffer the consequences. A 
case in point is the suffering he has brought upon 
the people of Sefrou, and this is well Known to 
those who dwell at Fez. His lust for money has 
contributed substantially to the suffering of the 
Jews.

at Marrakesh. 




contract was composed at Marrakesh, in the year 
1649. The signature of R. Ezra De Pardosh the 
scribe appears at the top of page 199a. [The same

else. Furthermore, if he should be the cause of any 
obstacle to the marriage taking place he agrees to 
pay fifty uqiot of silver. Similarly if the bride will 
not be given to the groom in marriage at the 
appointed time agreed upon, then the bride’s 
father agrees to pay the groom fifty silver ugiot for 
his disgrace. This document was drawn up on 
Monday, the twenty-sixth of the month of Nisan, 
in the year 1649. A piece of land was given as agift 
by Legima, the mother of the groom. 




after he was freed from prison, he threatened to 
inform further against the Jews to revenge his 
imprisonment. The aforementioned men who 
testified against him at the rabbinic court claim 
that he wants them to bear false testimony against 
those witnesses who earlier spoke against him, 
namely, against R. Mahlouf ibn Simhon, R. Moses, 
the latter’s son, and R. Ayush b. Attias. They state 
that they will not bear false testimony. In fact, they 
maintain that any testimony they might have 
given heretofore must be suspect as having been 
given under compulsion. 


Afterwards, Mordecai Boutboul of Tafilalet 
came to the court at Fez and testified concerning 
the character of Yom Tob saying that he was 
responsible for causing monetary losses to many 
Jews all the time that he was in Tafilalet. Another 
who testified against Yom Tob was Joseph the 
son. of Abraham, the son of Shitrit, of Tafilalet, 
now residing in Fez, who stated that Yom Tob 
informed on the Jews, thus causing them 
monetary losses. 




A dowry in the tradition of the Toshavim 




This dowry is part of the booklet of recorded 
dowries [see Mss. 139 to 141, on pages 197-199]. 
The name of the bride is given as Simha (daughter 
of R. Slieman ibn Meshash) and that of the groom 
as R. Joseph (son of R. Mimun ibn Harbon). The 
total amount of the dowry is valued at 4800 uqiot 
of silver. The custom of the Toshavim is to be 
followed. This document was composed on 




Wednesday, the seventh of Nisan 1649. The 
father of the groom has also given land to his 
son. Two signatures appear at the end of this 
document. The first signature, although blurred, 
appears to be that of aperson called Jacob Halevi, 
while the second signature is that of Ezra Di 
Paridosh, the scribe whose signature is found on 
the top of page 199a of Ms.1417. In all probability 
this document was composed in Marrakesh. [The

This letter was sent by Ha-Zevi Me’at Devash of 
Jerusalem to Raphael Ibn Zur, of Fez on the 
twelfth day of Heshvan 1873. The writer mentions 
that two volumes of the Code, Hoshen Mishpat 
(on civil law) with all the commentaries, as well 
as the work Netivot Mishpat and the book Kezot 
ha-Hoshen, were until recently unavailable, but 
now he has been able to acquire them. He has 
also acquired the Code Even ha-Ezer. The price 
for books has increased. A certain edition of 
the Scriptures is still unavailable. 


The books which are being sent by the writer 




to R. Raphael are arriving via Gibraltar through 
the agency of Moses Halevi. Two other books that 
are arriving are Ginzei Hayyim and Birkhat 
Mo’adekha L’Hayyim, Part Il, by the author 
Hayyim Palaggi, of blessed memory. They are 
being sent by the son of the author of those works, 
R. Abraham Palaggi, head of the Academy, at 
Izmir, Turkey. In a postscript the writer informsR. 
Raphael that the aforementioned R. Abraham 
Palaggi sent his father’s books to R. Raphael, but 
that the latter never responded or sent any money. 
The author's stamp appears on this letter. It has a

A legal document concerning a paternity suit 




This document, which is signed by the rabbis 
Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati and Raphael Ibn Zur of 
Fez, was written on the twenty-fifth day of Tishri 
1876. After the death of her husband Joseph, a 
woman called Leah and her two daughters were 
given refuge at the home of the valorous woman 
Simha, the daughter of the late Hillel ibn Samuel, 
and a relative. Leah was soon discovered to be 
pregnant. Leah testified that she became preg- 
nant from Moses, the son of Judah ibn Samuel, 




and that she had had no sexual relations with 
anyone else. Moses was sent for and he admitted 
to having had relations with Leah, except that he 
claimed that she seduced him at the house of the 
aforementioned Hillel. He stated that he thought 
that she was a wayward woman. Leah claimed 
that Moses seduced her. The court, after having 
established his guilt, punished him severely for 
taking advantage of the woman and for not marry- 
ing her. He was flogged and fines were exacted 
from him. [Calculations appear on page 204b 
as well as the name of Jacob ibn Simhon.]

Tevet 1834-35. It concerns a woman whose 
husband has been dead for twelve years. The

because he was still too young she was not sent to 
him. Subsequently, another two candidates have

on Tuesday, the tenth of Kislev 1841. The writer

judges of Tetuan: R. Judah Abudarham, R. Judah 
Coriat, and R. Solomon Abudarham. The litiga- 
tion concerns R. Elijah Monsano who is disputing 
with his uncle, Hayyim Monsano, and a cousin 
over property which seems to be related to an 
inheritance. The rabbinic court in Fez has not 
been able to deal with the matter since the 
authorities are related to the disputants, and are 
thus disqualified. R. Elijan Monsano had invited

departed from Gibraltar before the writer’s arrival 
there knew the son to have been in the Holy Land 
and to be a prosperous scholar of note. R.A. 
Biton did not write concerning Joseph because of 
his poor health. Additional information concer- 
ning the son can be derived from R. Hayyim 
Romano if R. Raphael Menahem would write to 
him. The writer also reminds R. Raphael about a

that justice will be done. The writer offers to

Abudarham, and the young R. Abraham Mon-

adjudicate the matter where both parties have 
now agreed the matter shall be dealt with. The 
rabbis of Fez, Samuel Ibn Zur and Saul Serero, 
ask the rabbis of Meknes to complete the 
judgement, in the year 1788. This document was 
certified by Judah Ha-Kohen and Raphael Moses 
Elbaz on a subsequent occasion, because the 




matter was not adjudicated until many years later.

The Nasi complains to the rabbis of Fez about the 
breakdown of authority and the injustices of the 
times 




This letter was written in Judaeo-Arabic to the 
rabbis of Fez, Raphael Ibn Zur, Isaac ibn Danan, 
and Solomon ibn Danan, on the fourth of 
Heshvan 1880. The writer (the Nasi) complains 
about the injustices that are rampant in the 
jurisdiction of the above-named rabbis and 
further, blamed them on these rabbis and other 
members of the community. One such incident 
reported to the writer by Jacob Ohana concerned 
the injustice perpetrated by Judah ben Agrir. 
Judah had gone to the ruler to inform on a Jew 
who owed him nothing more than rent. What is 
more, he bribed the ruler with twenty Real and the 
man was put in prison for four days without a trial 
and then locked out of his house. All this 
transpired on the eve of the New Year. False

A litigation that resulted in a compromise 




This legal document was written in Sefrou, onthe 
day of the new month of Marheshvan 1868. It was 
signed by the judges of Sefrou, the rabbis Hayyim 
Joseph Gayni and Hayyim Eliyahu. It discusses a 
dispute between David, (son of Jacob, son of 
Wahnish) and Moses (son of Abraham, son of 
Siso). The aforementioned David has presented a 
business contract and demanded that Moses 
make payment on the principal and the dividends 
according to its terms. Moses, on the other hand, 
claims that he has incurred many losses and that 
the conditions of the contract are therefore null

witnesses were also produced, among them, 
Joseph ANizzam, who was forced to tell lies. 


On another occasion Mimun b. Haroush told 
Elijah Kasiba to take a kilo of meat for him. Elijah 
didn’t take the meat and was beaten for it until he 
was near death. Then there was the neighbor of 
Jacob Ohana’s aunt who received a flogging 
when ben Agrir tried to force him to attend a 
rabbinic court. When he refused the claimant, 
David Edery, demanded that they go to the ruler. 
The aforementioned ben Agrir forced him there 
bodily. After hearing David Edery’s complaint the 
ruler imprisoned the plaintiff and refused to let 
him go. 


All of the aforementioned troubles have arisen 
because disputants go to the ruler instead of to 
the rabbinic courts. The Nasi, head of the Jewish 
community, registers these complaints with the 
rabbis who now undertake to intercede in the 
matter to help this unfortunate Jew who has the 
highest references from Meknés.

law is in accord with him with regard to profits 
provided he swears that he didn’t make any. 
Moses further claims that he left sacks as security 
with David who has sold them without Moses’ 
knowledge or permission. Moreover, a number of 
the sacks that he gave to David are missing. After 
much bickering they have compromised in the 
following manner: Mahlouf, Moses’ brother, has 
bound himself to pay a’sum of forty mitkalim (one 
mitkal equals ten of the smallest coin denomina- 
tion of the realm) to David. David has dropped his 
claim against Moses and accepted responsibility 
for the lost sacks. All further claims are dropped.

The settlement of an estate by a mother and her 
daughter has implications for the daughter’s 
forthcoming marriage 




R. Solomon Kohen (son of R. Jacob Kohen o.b.m. 
Skali, of Debdou) died, leaving a widow, Masuda 
(daughter of Salem Ha-Kohen) of Fez and a small 
daughter, Esther. Masuda’s marriage contract 
was in accord with the customs of Castilia 
whereby she was obliged to divide the whole 
estate, movable and immovable property, in half 
between herself and her daughter. After a time 
Masuda married Judah (son of Simon ben Betito, 
called Askouri) and brought as her dowry that 
remaining from her first husband’s estate. There 
remained in Debdou a certain amount of movable 
property and land. 


Now her daughter Esther has attained a 
marriageable age and become betrothed to 
Joseph (son of Mordecai Saba o.b.m.) of Fez. 
However, Joseph has discovered that his bride- 
to-be has only about twenty uqiot for her dowry

This letter was written by R. Judah ibn Attar to R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur, circa 1720. R. Judah states that he

and he wants to break the engagement, even 
though he is promised her portion of what 
remains of the estate in Debdou. 


There is no alternative but to divide in half also 
that portion that the mother has taken, and what is 
in Debdou must also be equally divided between 
mother and daugnNter. Originally, the mother took 
the best part of the estate for herself and left the 
daughter that part which would only realize its 
true value over a period of time because it wasina 
more remote place. Masuda and her second 
husband, Judah, now persuade the groom not to 
break the engagement, promising to withdraw all 
claims to any further part in the properties at 
Debdou and to give all of it to Esther for her 
dowry.

this document, which was written in Fez, it un-

ing. One of these contracts had been written for 
Mas’Ud ben Isaiah who resided in Meknés. One 
day the son of the aforementioned Mas’td, 
Samuel, had approached him asking for the 
contracts because he was acting for his mother. 
R. Judah did not have the contracts with him at 
that time so Samuel asked that they be sent to 
Meknés as he was leaving Fez. The contracts 
found their way into the possession of a young 
man, Judah ibn Jacob Saba and subsequently

Jacob Ibn Zur concerning the case of an agunah,

that R. Jacob Ibn Zur is the writer of this letter.] 
It is written by Jacob Ibn Zur for the scholarly 
R. Abraham Halevi (son of Barukh Halevi, a 
descendant of the author of the Tosafot Yom 
Tob) who is engaged in collecting funds for the 
redemption of captives. The writer asks that 
every comfort, hospitality, and charitable offering 
be extended to this lofty guest as he travels for the 
worthiest of causes. If he, in turn, should appoint 
an emissary, then similar treatment should be 
accorded the emissary. It appears that R. 
Abraham Halevi comes from the Holy Land. 




into the possession of R. Reuben ben Isaiah at 
Meknés. The rabbis of Meknes are now asked to 
obtain Mas’Ud’s contract so that it might be 
forwarded to his wife before Reuben ben Isaiah 
leaves Meknés. Mas’td has left the area for a 
distant place, so the contracts had been sent to 
Reuben, who is his son-in-law, according to the 
instructions of Samuel. Originally, a letter had 
been brought from the mother by her son Samuel 
instructing that the contracts be sent to her but, R. 
Judah ibn Attar notes, it is not the practice to 
engage in these legal transactions with a woman 
and therefore the son was sent to act in his 
mother’s stead. The rabbis of Meknés are asked 
to oblige Reuben, the son-in-law, by surrendering 
the contracts to his mother-in-law. 




one witness who can testify to the husband’s 
death although normally two witnesses are 
needed. At first R. Mordecai wanted to prohibit 
her from marrying by contending that the 
testimony of one witness was_ insufficient. 
However, he now feels that one witness is 
sufficient. R. Mordecai asks R. Jacob to offer 
arguments in support of his decision. R. Abraham 
Monsano will bring this letter to R. Jacob Ibn Zur.

A correspondence concerning some legal mat- 
ters and misunderstandings which have arisen 
between the Jewish communities of Fez and 
Meknés 




R. Joseph Elmaleh writes this letter to R. Raphael 
Berdugo concerning misunderstandings 
' between Jewish communities on certain matters 
and also about some cases in Jewish law which 
are of mutual interest to both scholars. The writer 
states that he is replying to a previous letter from 
R. Raphael although he intended not to send any 
additional letters since these letters only tend to 
exacerbate the situation of strife that earlier 
letters produced. R. Elmaleh states that his 
decision in one case was based on the ruling of R. 
Y. Asulin who will respond to R. Raphael and to 
the scholars of Meknés on another occasion. R. 
Elmaleh asks that the rabbis of Meknés should 
respond by writing their views on the matter so

A business transaction between a Christian and a 
Jew which is guaranteed by other Jews who 
become totally responsible for the completion of 
the transaction 




Many commercial terms in this document are of a 
Spanish origin. The case involves one called R. 
Abraham who had once entered into a small 
business transaction with a Christian when no 
contract was necessary. However, when Abraham 
entered into a bigger transaction with the same 
gentile, a contract became necessary to protect 
his interest, especially considering that he was a

by R. Jacob Ibn Zur and written in the acrostic 
form of the author’s name. A third poem commen- 
cing with the words “Hida Tamah” is written on 
page 231b. It is composed by R. Y. Najara, of 
blessed memory. The page is in a poor condition.

R. Jacob Ibn Zur, appear in Ms.84, pages 111a

that there should no longer be misunderstandings 
between the two communities of Meknés and Fez. 
A parable is introduced to demonstrate that the 
leaders should not repeat the follies of those 
whom they lead by increasing the existing strife. 


A disgraceful act perpetrated by the communi- 
ty of Salé against two emissaries from Jerusalem 
is reported. One emissary is lsaac Amzalag and 
some scholars of Rabat were also involved. 
Comments are made about the dispute such as, 
“the falsifiers turn truth to folly. It doesn’t pay to 
fight for justice against a majority who support 
injustice.” The writer states that it is difficult fora 
court to reverse a decision which has already 
been handed down in another court. Concerning 
a decision rendered in a case involving a widow 
and one called Mahlouf, the writer states that he 
agrees with R. Berdugo’s decision. To serve the 
cause of justice R. Berdugo is asked to intercede 
in a case of a disputed inheritance involving R. Y. 
Legimi, who acted unjustly to his younger brother. 




stranger in the land. He persuaded some wealthy 
Jews to guarantee the contract for him against 
any false claims that might arise and paid them a 
large sum of money for this service. These 
arrangements were made with witnesses in the 
presence of the non-Jew. The persons acting as 
guarantors, known by the name Ibn Susan, have 
written to R. Abraham telling him to acquire the 
merchandise from the gentile. He has responded 
that he will not deal directly with the gentile 
anymore and since they have committed 
themselves to the transaction, it is their job to deal 
with him. The guarantors say that Abraham 
should at least send an agent to act on the matter.

Abraham retorts that they are not only agents 
guaranteeing a transaction but by their silence at 
the time of their agreement with him they have 
tacitly admitted full responsibility for the transac- 
tion. Otherwise, R. Abraham says he would not 
have set up this transaction at all. 


It is finally agreed that R. Abraham will no 
longer have to deal directly with the Christian, 
since an agent cannot change the terms to which 
he originally agreed without accepting total 
liability. This is in accord with the ruling of R.

After R. Judah ibn Attar has related the adversities 
which his community (of Fez) faces, he continues 
this letter to the rabbis Jacob Ibn Zur and Moses 
Berdugo (at Meknés) on behalf of R. Isaac Roti. 
R. lsaac is forced to travel abroad in his oid age to

Joseph, once acquired an article from the

“whoever gives money to his agent to act for him

incurred.” There are many more citations that 
could be noted, but there is no point in reciting 
them here. The document concludes with the 
hope that the wealthy guarantors will perform the 
right action for R. Abraham, who is not in good

estate. The conclusion reached is as follows: if, 
when the houses were assigned to each party, 
land for access was part of that evaluation, then 
no further claims to access rights can be made. If, 
however, no such rights were included then a 
consideration must now be made for such rights 
to be extended.

before the non-Jewish court and the judgement 
rendered was that Roti would have to pay a 
stipulated amount of money by a certain date. A 
number of additional expenses had also been 
incurred. R. lsaac had neglected to mention his 
great need to R. Judah when travelling through 
his area because of his shame, but he had been 
informed of the old man’s plight by the son.

A transaction involving the sale of a mule 




This legal document records a transaction 
involving Gideon ibn Sa’id Ha-Kohen who ac- 
quires a mule from Yahya the son of Abraham ibn 
Arwah for 180 uqiot: The vendor has already 
received the payment and Gideon has acquired 
the animal. They hereby agree that if any non-Jew 
should win a claim in the non-Jewish court 
against Gideon for owning the animal then Yahya 
shall restore to Gideon 60 ugiot from the amount 
of the sale, but Gideon will lose the remaining 
120 ugiot. If the non-Jew does not win his claim 
in the non-Jewish court then any loss that Gideon 
might incur in payment for his legal defence may 
accrue to the total price of the animal, plus an 
additional 20 uqiot. If the expense should exceed 
the amount then Yahya agrees to pay only half 
of the additional amount. Both parties agree to

Novellae on Rashi’s Talmudic Commentary 
pertaining to the monetary options available to 
the wife upon the husband’s death 




Rashi, the eleventh century commentator, offers 
two ways to explain the statement of the master, 
R. Abba in the Talmud, pertaining to the options 
available to the widow as to how she may receive 
what is due to her monetarily upon the death of 
her husband. Either she receives the monetary 
value stipulated in her marriage contract, or R. 
Abba maintains that she receives an equal portion 
to that which each son receives besides what she 
receives as the value of her marriage contract, 
called the Ketubba. This second view is main- 
tained even though the amount that each son 
would receive exceeds the value of the marriage

A chronicle, commencing from Rosh Hashanah, 
1775 




The first thirteen lines of this document record the 
rainfall between the Jewish New Year and the 
month of Tevet. On the day after the minor festival 
of Hanukah a public fast is declared because the 




this stipulation. (This provision was necessary 
because a mule is half a horse and Jews were not 
allowed to keep horses, only donkeys. The horse 
was considered a noble animal and only non- 
Jews were allowed to own them. Therefore, it was 
possible that Gideon might be challenged in the 
courts for owning a ‘half-noble’ animal.) 


The contract stipulated that any payments due 
under its provisions should not be subject to the 
law of the remission of debts in the Sabbatical 
year. The responsibility for fulfilling all its terms 
should also apply to those who stand to inherit the 
Principals involved in the transaction. This 
contract was composed on the twenty-first day of 
Tammuz, in the year 84 (according to the dating of 
contracts), circa 1624. This document was signed 
for the benefit of Gideon, in Fez, by Jacob the son 
of Joseph ibn Danan. The document was certified 
by the latter signing his name, Jacob, a second 
time. 




contract. The wife still receives both. 


Another way to explain the text is that the sons 
will give her a portion equal to their portion and 
she forfeits thereby what she would have received 
from the Ketubba. According to this explanation 
the widow would stand to lose much, but this 
would depend on the situation. For instance, if 
there were to be more children and the land which 
she will acquire is limited to what the husband 
possessed at a particular time, then she stands to 
lose a great deal, unlike the sons who would not 
have a time limitation placed on them. However, it 
is also possible that the number of heirs could be 
reduced through death before the demise of the 
husband, in which case the widow would con- 
ceivably receive more money than was originally 
anticipated. 




rain supply is far from ample. The non-Jews in Fez 
cry to God for rain all the eight days of Hanukah 
and they ask the Jews to pray for rain. The 
gentiles have stopped planting seeds because of 
the lack of rain. A Torah is brought forth during 
the morning service and scriptural reading for fast 
days is also read at the afternoon service.

A plea to the judges of Fez to attempt to bring

The scholars of Sala write this letter in the form of 
a court document to the rabbis of Fez in reply to 
an earlier correspondence. The case pertains to 
R. Moses, the son of Isaac |bn Zur, and the marital 
problems that he has had with his spouse. The 
husband wants to grant a divorce to his wife, while 
she is desirous of a reconciliation regretting that 
she originally wanted a divorce. The wife has 
asked that an agent be appointed to plead for her 
and to respond to the claims that her husband is 
filing against her. If the husband refuses to arrive 
at a reconciliation, then the claims he is making 
should be investigated by the rabbis of Fez with 
the presentation of witnesses under oath. 
Afterwards a monetary settlement should be 
made based on what the wife brought to the

reaffirm that oath at the pleasure of R. Jacob and 
to fulfill all the terms of indebtedness that the oath 
implies. This document was composed on the first 
day of the week (Sunday), the twentieth day of 
Tevet 1717, at Fez. The document was signed and 
affirmed by Jacob, the son of Joseph, the son of 
Malka. The signature of Aaron Halevi ibn Safed 
appears in a lighter shade of ink at the end of the 
document as one who served as a witness.

all the money has been collected. Raphael goes 
on to say that he wonders why R. Solomon sends 
him no news, and that he has heard that another 
R. Raphael has had a dispute with an Ashkenazi. 
The news that R. Judah Ha-Kohen gave a lecture

Isaac ibn Mahlouf Abitbol, who is in a poor 
economic situation and whose brother, Abraham, 
took a loan from a non-Jew. Abraham lives in R. 
Jacob’s vicinity. lsaac was a contracting guaran- 
tor, a’reb Kabb’lan, for the aforementioned 
transaction. The non-Jew recently passed on and 
his children rose against Isaac and held him and 




his wife as hostages, even torturing them. They 
are willing to free Isaac and his wife if Isaac will 
pay the amount of forty uqiot to them. Isaac’s wife 
is being held by them as a hostage until Isaac 
returns from his brother Abraham with the stated 
amount. 


R. Judah now asks R. Jacob to intercede on 
behalf of Isaac by speaking to Abraham to make 
the stipulated amount available so that the 
husband and wife may be freed. Isaac and his wife

Raphael Obed Ibn Zur writes to R. Moses Ibn

Raphael Obed Ibn Zur informs R. Moses ibn 
Maman of Fez that he suffers a multitude of 
misfortunes, too numerous to record on paper. 
Even if he did record them, he fears that they 
would be read by those who were not intended to 
know about them. He states that he did not heed 
the advice of his masters and he went in ways 
against which they had warned him. He lost his 
possessions because he gave his capital to 
entrepreneurs to invest for him. He accepts God’s 
judgement and declares that he never sought 
benefit in his life except for his basic necessities. 
Whatever monies he had, he used for his travelling 
expenses. 


He is now destitute and located in the House of 
Study in Meknés. That community had offered 
him the stipend that they make available to 
resident scholars, but he had refused it on several

not disclosed Abraham’s whereabouts to the 
creditors so they will not be able to demand the 
whole debt from Abraham. Therefore Abraham 
would best be advised to send the money 
requested lest Isaac’s wife sends the creditors to 
him to get herself freed. Isaac and his wife have 
achieved the best compromise for all concerned 
so Abraham should send the money. This docu- 
ment was signed by R. Judah ibn Attar, on the 
tenth of Adar 1720.

Rachel, the daughter of the late Mas’Ud Aludi. The 
aforementioned Mahlouf should only be obliged 
to participate in the Haliza ceremony, which 
would free him and the woman Rachel from the 
levirate duties. The overriding reason for their 
decision is that Mahlouf already has a wife, sons, 
and daughters, and they all suffer from destitu- 
tion. If he should be obliged to take an additional 
wife his economic situation would become even 
more serious. This document was composed in

occasions. The people of Meknés insisted that if 
he did not accept the stipend they would be given 
a bad name for not supporting scholars. He had 
finally been persuaded to take the stipend but 
only as a loan to be repaid. This money he 
received every Friday, but eventually the amount 
of the stipend had been reduced to nothing at all 
because business conditions were bad. The writer 
decided not to take any more stipends even if they 
were available, when times improved. Friends had 
implored him to take the stipend but he had 
refused because he views his poverty as a sign of 
Divine chastisement. 


In his letter he asks R. Moses Maman to extend 
a loan of two hundred uqiot to help him support 
his family. He has his eye on an investment which 
someone would manage for him and expects to 
live off the profits. He assures the prospective 
creditor (R. Maman) that he will repay the loan. He 
has agreed to compose a written contract of 
obligation for the loan, putting up land in Meknes 
as collateral, and will repay the loan immediately

A booklet of Halakhic riddles in the form of 
responsa 




This booklet contains amusing queries which 
may be characterized as riddles on subjects of 
Jewish law. In fact, the first page, 251a, has the 
Hebrew word for riddles, “Hidot,” as a title. The 
work is attributed to R. Yedidia Monsonyego, of 
blessed memory, by his son-in-law who remains 
anonymous. The author utilizes the literary form 
of Responsa literature. The responsa refer to the 
works of the medieval Halakhists known as 
Rishonim. Among them Maimonides, Ravad, the 
Responsa literature of R. Solomon ibn Adret, and 
the Code of Jewish Law of R. Joseph Caro, as well 
as his encyclopaedic work Beit Yosef, are men- 
tioned. 


On page 251a the author informs us that his 
son inquired about how one can be permitted to 
remarry his wife whom he divorced after she 
subsequently married another person, when this

ion Attar, R. Samuel Ha-Sarfati, R. Saadya b. 
Mimun Aflalo, and R. Isaac Ha-Sarfati, is a 
testimony to the bonafide need for financial 
support for the scholar R. Isaac Melamed of 
Jerusalem. The scholar has showed them a letter 
which notes his misfortunes. They further state in 
this document that financial aid should be

is contrary to biblical law? The writer responds 
that this query is already treated by R. Solomon 
ibn Adret in his Responsum, number 1,209, and 
the writer elaborates. Later authorities, 
designated Aharonim, such as the Levush, are 
also noted in the response to the first query. The 
second question which appears on page 251b 
pertains to a hypothetical case of a legally married 
woman who was unfaithful to her husband yet 
was permitted to live with him according to the 
law. The response is given that if she was a minor 
at the time of her marriage, in accord with the 
Ravad’s view that the seduction of a minor is not 
considered a culpable act, then her husband can 
legally retain her as his wife. This view is recorded 
by R. Joseph Caro in chapter 175 of Even ha-Ezer. 
Several cases pertaining to the relations between 
men and women are discussed. They are followed 
by several cases that relate to matters in civil law. 
It is apparent that this type of Halakhic work was 
composed to sharpen the student’s mind. [Page

whenever he comes to Fez. Apparently, at the time 
this document was written the economic situation 
in Fez was not at all good for the Jews, but the 
Arabs were faring much better. The expression 
“The maidservant inherited the role of the 
mistress,” (the former referring to Hagar the 
maidservant of Sarah, the mistress) is used by the 
rabbis to characterize the relations between 
Arabs and Jews and their respective conditions at 
this time. It seems that the scholar from the Holy 
Land could not receive adequate funds on this 
occasion. The rabbis pray that economic con- 
ditions will improve so that the scholar will receive 
his proper due.

In this correspondence R. Judah ibn Attar replies 
to the rabbis Jacob Ibn Zur and Moses Berdugi of 
Meknés, that upon receiving their ietter he called 
for the wife of Mimun ibn Didi and for her brother 
Abraham ibn Shaprut and he read the letter to 
them. R. Judah states that Mimun has no legal 
basis for taking another wife, since his present 
wife is of sound mind and body and also is 
pregnant by him. Mimun’s claim that his daughter 
is a cripple is unfounded and R. Judah has 
testimony to prove that the opposite is the case. 


Mimun will not be able to take another wife 
until his present wife gives birth. If a healthy male 
child is born then he cannot take an additional 
wife. If a female child is born then a judgement will 
be rendered and he will be informed what course

This document which is signed by the following 
three rabbis of Tetuan, R. Isaac Abudarham, R. 
Jacob Halevi, and R. Hananiah Arubash, is sent to 
the rabbinic scholars of Fez concerning an estate 
which belonged to R. Moses ibn Maman, of

the rabbis of Tetuan, is very poor. He informs

A letter from the rabbis of Fez to all communities 
to alleviate the plight of a fellow Jew. Also a note 
to the judges of Sefrou 




This letter was composed for the honorable 
Mimun ben Amozig by the following rabbis of Fez 
who signed it: R. Judah ibn Attar, R. Jacob b. R. 
Reuben Ibn Zur, and R. Shalom Edery. Mimun is 
one of the leading taxpayers of Fez, known for his 




of action to pursue. Meanwhile the wife is making 
a counter claim of abandonment and non-support 
against her husband from the time that he left (for 
Meknés). The writer asks the rabbis Ibn Zur and 
Berdugi to compel the husband to return to his 
wife immediately. The letter was here concluded 
but before signing it, the writer added an 
additional eight lines testifying to the woman’s 
good state of health and reporting that both she 
and her brother testified to her being pregnant. 
Meanwhile, the husband must send his wife 
financial support since she is penniless. 


R. Judah mentions another case in the same 
letter concerning R. Jacob Ibn Zur. The widow of 
R. Isaac ibn Amara has implored R. Judah to write 
to R. Jacob to entreat the Nagid about a sum of 
money that he levied upon Solomon ibn Amara. 
The latter has struggled to find the wherewithal to 
pay a portion of the sum and her plea is that the 
Nagid should be asked to forego the remainder of 
the sum. 




Fez for many years, left an estate to him. However, 
the courtyard which belonged to Moses was given 
in pledge to the king for the sum of four hundred 
uqiot. Isaac asks that the pledge be paid and the 
balance be paid to him. The rabbis of Tetuan ask 
the rabbis of Fez to expedite the matter, since R. 
Isaac is in dire need of the money and is otherwise 
unable to support himself. This document is dated 
Wednesday, the second third of the month of 
Heshvan, in the year 1647. [See page 268a for 
another document signed by R. Hananiah Aru- 
bash, in the same year, which is related to this

benevolence. Now his economic misfortunes 
require that he ask others to aid him, but as he has 
never been in this predicament before, nor is he 
forward because of his plight, the rabbis are 
asking others to come to his aid in accord with his 
station. The date of this document is 1731. The 
rabbis Jacob Ibn Zur and Shalom Edery sign a 
postscript to the scholars and judges of Sefrou 
and to R. Judah Saba and R. David Harar saying 
they should make a speedy response to this letter.

The community of Fez draws up a contract to sell 
a concession because it is in need of funds 




This document was drawn up on the seventeenth 
day of Tammuz, 1709. It is signed by the following 
rabbis of Fez: Judah ibn Attar, Samuel Ha-Sarfati, 
Abraham ibn Danan, and Jacob b. Reuben Ibn 
Zur. Since the community of Fez is in need of 
cash, it is selling a concession involving the sale 
of fruit for the processing of alcoholic beverages, 
to R. Daniel Toledano, (son of the scholar R. 
Phineas, of blessed memory) for twenty litres of 
cochineal. The period of the concession is one 
year from the first day of Tishri. The terms set 
forth are that the purchaser, the aforementioned 




Ascholar writes that one of the parties to a dispute

[This correspondence which was written by R. 
Moses ibn Hamo (of Sefrou) to R. Menahem 
Serero (of Fez) commences on page 266a and 
concludes on page 265b; which is really part of 
the same page.] A response is made to R. 
Menahem’'s letter which had been received by the 
writer a day before. R. Menahem stated that R. 
Jacob D’Avila was guilty of obstructing justice by 
not appearing before the court (at Fez). R. Moses 
states that this charge is without foundation 
because the letter signed by R. Mimun has just 
been received by the writer. Furthermore, R. 
Jacob thought it best to remain at home for the 
Sabbath as he was not in good health. On 
Tuesday he began his journey but he was turned 
back midway by people from R. Serero’s own 
community who informed him that those who 
would dispute him would soon arrive in his town. 
They also noted his poor physical condition. 
When R. Jacob returned home it was 
suggested that he send his son, Meir, in his place 
with all the proper testimonies, but he still insisted

weight of grapes one uqia and from every pur-

and any other produce from which liquor can be 
produced, one half uqia, according to the old 
system of currency. This price schedule applies 
when the weight of grapes is measured to potfuls. 
However, if it is in the volume of basketfuls and 
if it weighs up to one and one half talents, then 
one uqia shall be paid. If itis found to weigh more, 
then one uqia, according to the earlier system 
of currency, shall be paid for each talent. These 
terms are in accord with the community’s deci- 
sion. The community will protect the purchaser 
of the concession from any claims that might be 
laid against him. 




that he would go himself to R. Serero’s communi- 
ty. R. Moses Hamo asks that the matter be 
resolved quickly. After a careful examination of 
the evidence R. Moses feels confident that it will 
be found to be in R. Jacob’s favor. The deceased 
woman about whom the controversy revolves has 
apparently nullified all the conditions of the 
marriage contract that pertain to the Megérashim 
(exiles of the Castilian communities). The sig- 
nature of this document, which is found on page 
265b, is followed by a postscript wherein the 
writer asks that a message should be transmitted 
to his friend, R. Joshua, requesting a copy of the 
Talmudic tractate Niddah. It seems that a student 
has asked to borrow that text and the writer has 
already lent two copies to others. Now he relates 
that he studies the tractate Hullin after the 
morning service in the academy. At midnight, 
another study session is held with the participa- 
tion of more than twenty scholars, among whom 
are excellent students who analyze the subject 
well. There are also average students who stand 
and study together. Again the writer requests that 
a copy of the Talmud tractate Niddah be sent to 
him, and if it is in a bad condition R. Moses says 
that he will repair it. He signs the postscript with 




‘the words, “also these are the words of Moses.”

R. Judah Ibn Attar writes to the scholars of 
Meknés concerning one who violated a pre- 
marital agreement. R. Jacob Malka concurs with 
R. Attar’s judgement 




This document was written by R. Judah ibn Attar 
on the nineteenth of lyar 1728. However, the 
matter was held off until the twenty-third of lyar 
when the incident was better substantiated, so 
that the letter was not sent until afterwards. A 
postscript is written to this effect with a second 
signature by R. Judah ibn Attar. 


The case involves Elazar ibn Asulin who 
became betrothed to a widow against legal 
practice and not in accord with the wishes of his 
relatives because he was already engaged, in Fez, 
to the daughter of Levi ibn Amara. In accord with 
practice, a high penalty must be paid if he violated 
the terms of that arrangement. Elazar’s brother, 
Moses ibn Asulin, a guarantor of the pre-nuptial 
contract, was very angry over his brother’s 
actions, especially as he had a monetary obliga- 
tion arising from the matter. Because he suffered 
from an ailment which prevented him from 
travelling on animals, he was personally unable to 
confront his brother. Another brother, Mas’Ud, 
went to confront Elazar and to oblige him to 
nullify his relationship with the widow on the 
strength of R. Judah’s letter, in which the rabbis of 
Meknés were asked to persuade Elazar to divorce 
the widow. If he refused, then he should pay his 
brother Moses for the latter’s indebtedness on his 
behalf and also the fiancée who would be 
disgraced by his actions. In a postscript dated the 
twenty-third of lyar, R. Judah states that the 
brother Moses had heard things that might 
require the rabbis of Meknés to secure a bill of 
divorce by force. In spite of his ailment Moses had 
decided to travel to confront Elazar.

continues on the top of page 267b.] Jacob agrees 
with R. Judah ibn Attar that there are grounds to 
force Elazar to withdraw from “the wicked woman 
who ensnared him.” He has violated a rabbinic 
enactment which requires that one who marries 
must do so under the jurisdiction of the- local 
scholar. Furthermore, the marriage ceremony 
was performed by the bridegroom himself, 
without the benefit of clergy, in the presence of 
ten young sheep (young boys) who came from the 
communites of Meknés, Fez, and Salé, which are 
all under the jurisdiction of the aforementioned 
enactment. One who has violated the rabbinic 
enactment may be beaten until he submits. 
Apart from the above he has been guilty of 
disgracing his elder brother and shaming his 
fiancée. He cannot marry, in any case, until he 
makes restitution to his brother Moses. Elazar is 
also regarded as a scholar and he has disgraced 
his calling by his actions, as well as besmirching 
the honor of his family. Therefore, his relationship 
with the widow should be nullified in accordance 
with the opinion of the Tur (in chapter two of Even 
Ha-Ezer). However, the fact that the widow was 
married two or three times previously should not 
be the basis upon which Elazar is forced to 
withdraw from her. Rabbinic literature states that 
if one marries a woman who is not fitting for him 
then Elijah (the prophet) forces him to withdraw 
from her. The widow had previous husbands who 
died while they were married to her and this would 
justify the nullification of Elazar’s marriage to her. 
An opinion is expressed that when a woman is 
divorced from three husbands it is a basis for 
nullification of a subsequent marriage. R. Jacob 
b. Malka indicts Elazar for abandoning a maiden 
from a good family in favor of a wealthy widow. He 
notes that tradition has unkind things to say about 
one who marries for an ulterior motive such as the 
acquisition of money. The signature of Jacob b. 
Malka is given at the conclusion of this document.

Rabbi Rahamim Joseph Gayni writes to Rabbi 
Raphael Ibn Zur, of Fez. The introductory portion 
of the letter includes a prayer for peace and the 
advent of the Messiah so that the Jews will no 
longer suffer persecution. Regards are sent to 
Maharash Ibn Zur and a prayer is offered for his 
health. The writer informs R. Raphael of the arrival 
of R. Hayyim ibn Zikhri who is coming to inquire 
about a legal matter. He brings with his many 
written statements from the rabbis of the city of 
Heleb. R. Rahamim asks R. Raphael to review the 
judgement in all its minutest details as quickly as 
possible. As for himself he no longer wants to 
have anything to do with this bad situation. He 




An emissary corresponds from Sefrou with Ham-

The writer of this letter, who is an emissary from 
the Holy Land, commences his letter with a 
flowery introduction. Then he invites R. Raphael 
to come to the Galilee to live (the writer is 
probably from Safed). He informs R. Raphael (Ibn 
Zur of Fez) that he is presently in Sefrou 
collecting funds and that in spite of a dispute in 
the town amongst the Jewish inhabitants, he was 
able to collect five Durham. He expects to visit R. 




A court decision concerning the erection of a 
structure that impedes the public right of way and 
commerce 




In the past, vendors of fruit who had shops in the 
marketplace called Sug Al-Ksasin had wanted to 
construct a roof out of matted reeds to protect

of the estate which Isaac ibn Maman inherited. ] 




expects that R. Raphael will finally bring the 
matter to a conclusion by rendering his judge- 
ment. 


In an addendum, R. Rahamim mentions a case 
involving one called Maharash Hota who had 
shared an inheritance with his mother. Upon her 
demise the community wanted to claim the 
mother’s portion. A letter was sent to the rabbis 
of Fez who judged that the mother had no authori- 
ty over the object which she controlled while she 
was alive, which apparently was in the syna- 
gogue. The reason that the son, Maharash Hota 
granted it to his mother was because it was his 
duty to support her, but after her death it reverted 
back to the son. Therefore, no individual or com- 
munity can claim authority over the item in ques- 
tion. This decision was never copied nor is it to 
be found in the possession of the writer, nor is 
he able to acquire a copy of it, yet, he does recall 
that such a decision was rendered.

states that while he is asking for money for his

that this was the main purpose of the letter. 
Rather, the letter was prompted by his friendly 
concern. Regards are then sent to R. Solomon, R. 
Hayyim Kohen, and to R. Abraham. In an 
addendum the writer inquires about a sum of 
money that was sent through the person of Jacob 
ibn Zimra, to Gibraltar (which is spelled in one 
word, not as in the Arabic) wondering whether it 
arrived safely. He asks for a response to his letter.

yards complained that such a structure would 
block the view of their windows which faced the 
public thoroughfare. The undersigned rabbis 
responded that there was no substance to their 
claim and they could not impede the construction. 
Subsequently, the awning was constructed. 




Some members of the community had tried to 
impede the construction on the grounds that 
damage might occur to passers-by on the public 
thoroughfare when rainfall accumulated on the 
awning and dripped on them, thereby preventing 
passers-by from access to the street. The rabbis 
rule that this claim has merit and even though 
construction has already taken place, that does 




A court document (from Sefrou) toR. Raphael Ibn 
Zur of Fez to serve as an interim overseer of the 
estate of the late Raphael Ha-Kohen 




This document is written to R. Raphael Ibn Zur at 
Fez, and signed by the rabbinic tribunal com- 
posed of R. Hayyim Elijah (Gayni), R. Raphael 
Moses Elbaz, and R. YeKutiel ibn Elbaz. They ask 
R. Raphael to accept the appointment of overseer 
of the estate of the late R. Raphael Ha-Kohen, of 
blessed memory, for the benefit of the orphans, 
until such time when a trustee shall be appointed 




R. Raphael Ibn Zur (of Fez) is informed of the 
appointment of a trustee for the estate of Raphael 
Ha-Kohen o.b.m. (Cf. Ms.203) 




This document [which is related to Ms.203 and 
follows it chronologically and in the order in 
which it appeared in the Bension collection] 
informs R. Raphael Ibn Zur of the appointment of 
Isaac ibn Shitrit as the trustee of the estate of the 
late Raphael Ha-Kohen, o.b.m. He will serve the 
interests of the orphans, negotiate with the 
deceased’s partners, and collect the debts in- 
curred by non-Jews. If it is desirable that another 
trustee be appointed in addition to Isaac, this will 
be satisfactory provided that the delay will have 




A letter of reconciliation written to R. Reuben Ibn 
Zur by Elijah Utmazgin 




We are informed by the writer, Elijah Utmazgin, 
that R. Reuben Ibn Zur is not in good health, but 
that he has sons. The writer prays for R. Reuben’s 
well being and implores him not to be angry with 
him. The writer wrote to R. Reuben on a previous 
occasion but has received no reply. The writer 




not give those who are having it built the legal 
right to assert their claim (called Hazaka) that the 
awning shall remain as it was constructed. This 
document was signed on the twentieth day of 
Adar II, in the year 1851. It was signed by R. 
Reuben Serero, R. Judah Elbaz, and R. Yedidia 
Monsonyego. 




for the estate. In this capacity R. Raphael is 
requested to examine the financial accounts of 
the departed and to call the deceased’s partners 
to settle the matter of the partnership, as well as to 
take care of the keys of the shop. He will arrange 
to hire an artisan to seal the doors of the house of 
the deceased and R. Raphael shall keep the keys 
with him, “for one does not know what a day will 
bring.” The last sentence is written in Judaeo- 
Arabic in this document. The document was 
composed in Sefrou, although it is mentioned in 
the text. 




no adverse effect upon the welfare of the orphans 
and the widow. Furthermore, the widow can seek 
someone who can act in her behalf if time is not of 
the essence. In that case, all that is contained in 
the apartment will not be opened until the widow 
secures one whowill act on her behalf. R. Raphael 
is asked to send to the undersigned certain items 
that R. Raphael left with Isaac ibn Shitrit, as well 
as the account book, so that a proper evaluation 
of the estate can be arrived at. A copy of the 
account book can be sent so that the original may 
remain with Rabbi Raphael. The rabbis who 
signed the document (at Sefrou) are R. Hayyim 
Elijah (Gayni), R. Raphael Moses Elbaz, and Ri: 
YeKutiel Elbaz. 




insists that there is no reason why R. Reuben 
should bear any ill-feeling towards him. If R. 
Reuben continues to act in this manner he will be 
guilty of afflicting the downtrodden. Instead he 
should renew his warm friendship of earlier days. 
R. Elijah adds a postscript after his signature 
wherein he prays for the welfare of R. Reuben.

A correspondence from Ish Zair of Fez to the 
Alliance Israelite at Paris 




The author, Ish Zair, commends the famous 
organization Alliance Israelite, based in Paris, for 
publishing the Responsa of R. Asher. Then he 
states his desire to write and his disappointment 
at not receiving a reply; therefore, he held back 
from writing further until he became possessed by 
the muse of the written word and he was obliged 
to correspond.

the Nagid and the community and, the writer says, 
he has had to mediate between them. It reached

wife of Mordecai ibn Adhan, known as Ben Aiyna,

A request is made for the appointment of a 
representative for Jewish matters to reside in Fez, 
as was done in Lebanon where it was successful. 
This would be an effective way of improving the 
condition of the Jews. The writer mentions having 
been in Gibraltar where money was raised for 
Jewish causes. Unfortunately, it is difficult to 
fulfill such a philanthropic goal in Fez because 
economic conditions, aggravated by the drought, 
have regressed considerably such that bread has 
increased in price three and fourfold.

money to her and her children who were suffering

This letter, which was sent by R. Judah ibn 
Attar to R. Jacob Ibn Zur, refers to the aforemen- 
tioned Mordecai who wandered away from his 
home to R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s area and left his wife 
and her children without food or drink or means 
by which they could support themselves. R. 
Judah asks R. Jacob to aid the woman in her 
plight by asking Samuel and Abraham to return all 
the money to Mordecai and to compel him to

that he is obliged to do so since no one else is

casting suspicion on the just. 




A correspondence to R. Abraham Pariente asking

This letter, which is partially written in the 
alliterative form, is sent to R. Abraham Parienté 
asking him to intercede for the writer in a 
judgement with a person identified as R. Reuben. 
The writer mentions having received a letter from 
the aforementioned R. Abraham who fulfilled all 
that he was asked to do. He again asks R. 
Abraham to try to persuade R. Reuben to do his

The alliterative form of literary expression 
appears in the flowery introduction when the 
Hebrew alphabetical letter “Mem” is prominently 
used from the beginning of line 3 through line 7. 
The writer pleads poverty in matters of poetic 
metre and he concludes with four more lines 
commencing each word with the letter Mem, from 
line 20 through line 23. He also expresses his 
suffering and tribulations and he looks forward to 
the coming of the Messiah, the son of David.

Establishing trust in business contracts 




The legal forms for establishing a basis of trust in 
various kinds of contracts are given on this page. 
The city of Tafilalet is mentioned on page 281a in 
one of the forms and one concludes that these 
forms were drawn up for use in commercial 
intercourse in that city. Also given is the legal 
form for granting gifts which are acquired by the 
same mechanism applying to other commercial 
acquisitions. This kind of gift excludes those 
granted by a person on his death bed. The forms 
that apply for pledges are given as well. 


On page 281b a case is presented involving 




one called Reuben who is below the age of twenty 
and who desires to engage in a business 
transaction to sell property that he has inherited. 
According to the law, one who has not attained 
the age of twenty cannot engage in commercial 
acts involving legal transactions. In order to 
protect the purchaser of the property Reuben is 
required to take an oath that he will not demand 
the nullification of the purchase when he attains 
the legal age. It is also necessary to ascertain that 
Reuben understands all the ramifications of the 
transaction before the oath can be administered. 
This oath is unrelated to the act of acquisition 
itself.

A creditor's claim against the estate of the late 
Dinar B. Amram 




[This document is related to Ms.214, which 
precedes it on page 284a. It informs us of some 
other transactions that took place with the same 
piece of real estate.] Testimony is given to the 
existence of a bill of indebtedness for a huge sum 
owed to R. Jacob Halevi of the town of Sale (son of 
R. Samuel Halevi, of blessed memory) and 
charged against Dinar (son of Amram) Known as 
ben Tata. Dinar declares his trust in Jacob, and 
those acting for Jacob, with regard to the 
authenticity of the bill of debt and the payment 
thereof without any oath requiring to be taken. 
This admission is made on the twentieth of Tevet, 
in the year 77 (1717).

possession of the aforementioned Hayyim. It was 
signed on Wednesday, the seventeenth of Tevet 
1734, at Fez. é 




Another transaction is reported in this docu-

Hayyim bar Mas’ud bar Hanun ben Magirz for one 
thousand ugiot, on the fifteenth of Ab, in the year 
93 (1733). Therefore, Hayyim ben Magirz in-

(mentioned in Ms.24), excluding the house, 
belonged to those acting for the estate of R. 
Mimun ben Adhan, may his soul repose in 
Paradise. The other half belonged to Aaron ben 
Haroush. Miriam, the wife of Dinar ben Tata, sold 
part of her dowry and bought a half-interest in the 
courtyard that had belonged to R. Aaron ben

A claim against one who has taken domicile in a 
house illegally 




One known as Mordecai ibn Amozag took up 
residence for over six months in a dwelling and 
paid no rent whatsoever. Mahlouf Boutboul was 
asked to act for the claimant against Mordecai, 
but was unsuccessful. Mordecai subsequently 
wrote a letter stating that he could not be sued 
since his brother Azriel had given him permission 
to live in the house and any claims should 
henceforth be brought against Azriel. Mordecai 
was warned to vacate the premises but he ignored

turned to R. Jacob Ibn Zur to order Mordecai’s

bill of debt drawn, and his books were given to the 
claimant (the writer of this letter) as a pledge. 
After five or six years had passed, R. Shem Tob

scriptures with Ibn Ezra’s commentary. Hayyim 
permitted the writer to lend that text to R. Shem 
Tob. The writer says that this was done with the 
creditor, R. Moses’ permission also. R. Shem Tob 
passed away soon after and the text is now in the 
hands of his inheritors. It is not known whether 
Hayyim ever asked that his books should be 
returned. There was a copy of the work called 
Minhot ha-Luhot written only on paper and 
because of dampness the text was ruined. The 
writer states that he placed it in the Genizah. In the 
rest of the letter the writer informs R. Jacob Ibn

his journey and at his home. The last few lines of

A plea for charitable aid 




Zikhri Meshash commences the first half of his 
letter to R. Ham-Malakh Raphael Ha-Sarfati_ (of 
Fez) with a flowery and poetic introduction. He 
then expresses his sorrow for not having followed 
R. Raphael’s, advice to him. Since Zikhri left R. 
Raphael’s community he and his family have 
suffered much privation, especially during the 
past winter, when sufficient clothing was not 
available to them. Zikhri was apparently involved 




Court action is taken in Fez and Meknés 
concerning the non-payment of a debt 




The rabbis Saul ibn Danan and Raphael Obed Ibn 
Zur (of Fez) wrote to the rabbis Jacob Toledano 
and Mordecai Berdugo (of Meknés) in the year 
1760, concerning the payment of a debt. The 
original transaction and bill of debt was dated the 
twenty-seventh of Tammuz 1754. It was to be 
paid in installments. The principals in the present 
state of affairs are Moses ben David-Ve-Joseph 
and Yedia ibn Lahbari who brought this debt 
owed by Simeon b. Mordecai Wahnunu, to the 
attention of the rabbis, so that Joseph (son of R. 
Moses Amiel) who is the creditor, will receive the 
sum of two hundred uqiot. This is done because 
the appointed time of the installment payments 
was the twenty-second of Sivan 1755, and still no 




Four poems with an introduction by Moses B. 
Aaron Attiya, of the nineteenth century 




The author of the poems, Moses ben Aaron Attiya, 
commences with a three-page introduction which 
is followed by four pages of poetry. He moralizes 
about the fact that the power of speech can be 
utilized for negative purposes and that it should 
rather be ennobled through religious expression 
in poetry. He quotes scripture, from the Psalms, 
and a rabbinic text to this effect. He notes that 
there are numerous occasions for poetic expres- 
sion such as on the Sabbaths, at festivals, Bar

in a disputed transaction which left him without 
any monetary resources. He tried to reach a 
compromise on the matter but could not find the 
other party. As Passover is coming very soon he is 
in dire straits and he is depending onR. Raphael’s 
merciful nature. Zikhri blames his adversity on 
having departed from his ancestral home, but he 
states that he cannot turn to the masses for 
charitable aid for, while they are gracious in the 
amount of ridicule that they offer to those who 
turn to them for aid, they offer little benevolence 
in return. 




payments are forthcoming. Now Isaac b. Hayyim 
is delegated to act for the creditor, Joseph, to 
make Simeon pay his debt. The writer asks the 
rabbis to aid Isaac in his attempt to collect the 
debt. 


R. Jacob Toledano (of Meknes) signs the 
second document, which is given as a response 
below the earlier document. He cites from Hoshen 
Mishpat 73:8, the following words of R. Joseph 
Caro, “If one took an oath to pay his debt at a 
stipulated time and when that time arrived the 
creditor didn’t claim it, the debtor is not obliged to 
pay it until the creditor claims it.” The Semais also 
recorded as in accord with this opinion. The latter 
quotes R. Solomon ibn Adret, 0.b.m., as saying 
that the debtor is not obliged to pay the wife or the 
children of the creditor until such time as the 
creditor demands his money. 




Mitzvot, and wedding celebrations. 


The writer informs us that he composed and 
wrote many poems on individual pieces of paper 
and because he did not collect them into one 
volume they were lost and he could not recall 
them. He therefore composed, for posterity, this 
work called “Yashir Moshe” to record those 
poems that he still remembered. He also added 
explanations of terms in the text. All the texts 
contained in this work were approved by R. Abner 
Israel Ha-Sarfati. He mentions that he was asked 
to compose appropriate words of verse for a 
pleasant Arabic tune so as to elevate the melody 
from its secular state to the holy. 




The first liturgical poem consisting of eight 
stanzas is composed in honor of the New Month—

nature and is appropriately to be recited during 
periods of distress. The third prayer characterizes

R. Hasdai Almosnino writes, in the year 1715, 
to the scholars Judah ibn Attar and Jacob Ibn 
Zur (of Fez) asking them to intercede on behalf of 
the widow and orphans of R. Abraham Attiya, may 
he repose in paradise, by contacting R. Solomon 
ibn Yaish to aid her in her plight. After initial 
attempts nothing has yet been accomplished 
on her behalf. A young man, Moses (son of Isaac 
Ha-Kohen), had negotiated a loan from the late 
R. Abraham Attiya and he still has not made pay- 
ment on it. Previously this young man lived in R. 
Hasdai’s area (Tetuan), but now he has moved 
to Fez. The late R. Abraham’s brother-in-law, 
Isaac Sarfati, came to Fez with the bill of debt 
and managed to collect part of it but forty-six-

the yearning for restoration of the holy places in 
Zion. The fourth prayer is supplicatory in nature 
dealing with the plight of exile which Jews suffer. 
A call for their redemption is sounded and their 
oppressors are to be dealt with so that the Throne 
of God will be complete. 




a bride called Esther. Each verse concludes with 
the Hebrew word “Hen”—“Grace.” The last 
paragraph mentions the name of the groom as 
Saul. The writer, who appears to be a rejected 
suitor of the bride, is Elijah Utmazgin. He offers 
his best wishes to the newlyweds. 




and-a-half uqiot are still outstanding. R. Hasdai 
now asks the rabbis (of Fez) to summon Moses 
to pay the outstanding amount. 


In the second case, a fettered wife, an Agunah, 
Haita, the sister of the aforementioned late 
Abraham Attiya, and the wife of R. Aaron Azirad, 
is brought to the attention of the rabbis of Fez, 
since Aaron is in their area. Aaron, who had 
incurred debts, fled eleven years previously, and 
his wife was held captive by the non-Jews for a 
long time because of non-payment. Haita’s 
brother and relatives had to pay the outstanding 
debts in order to free her. Her husband has even 
married another woman, thereby violating his 
marital oath to Haita. She now demands that he 
pay the value of her marriage contract and grant 
her a divorce immediately. Previous cor- 
respondence on the matter has not received a 
response, which is not the kind of treatment one 
would expect from a sizable Jewish community 
such as Fez, which has rabbinic courts. The writer 
closes with a remark that this is aclassical case of 
a fettered wife which should be dealt with by the 
rabbis (at Fez). 




R. Jacob Ibn Zur has left (Fez) for some reason 
that is, at best, hinted atin this letter from R. Judah 
ibn Attar. The latter takes pains to keep R. Jacob's 
confidence a private matter. R. Judah alludes toR. 
Jacob’s present economic privation and to a 
disorganized state of affairs that affects the 
Jewish community as possible causes for R. 
Jacob’s departure (to Meknés). R. Judah states

that he was never in favor of R. Jacob’s move 
(from Fez) because of his responsibilities to his 
many children and because it is not in the best 
interests of a scholar such as R. Jacob to wander 
from place to place. R. Judah writes that he would 
only take up the matter with local communal 
officials upon R. Jacob’s return (to Fez). 


R. Judah continues that one day R. Solomon 
ibn Danan, R. Solomon Cabaliero, and the latter's 
partner, Mas’Ud ibn Samuel, came to see himona 
matter of litigation and while there brought up the 
subject as to whether R. Jacob Ibn Zur (referred 
to, by them, as Ploni-anon) had written anything 
to him about the move to Meknés. Then they 
showed him a signed letter sent to them by R. 
Jacob Aspag, Mas’td ibn Adhan, and Saadya 
Lahaboz in which they were asked to persuade 
the anonymous party (R. Jacob) to write to the 
Nagid so that he, in turn, would persuade anon to 
return home (to Fez). Many signatures of com- 
munity members were attached to this letter. At 
this juncture in the conversation R. Judah could 
not restrain himself any longer so he blurted out, 
“must anon (R. Jacob) initiate the process of 
conciliation and appeasement with a note of good 
will when he suffers so much privation because of 
the situation?” He then writes that he showed R. 
Jacob's letter to the assembly, who then agreed to 




Commentaries on two Aggadic texts

R. Judah’s evaluation of who should initiate the 
conciliation. Then R. Judah hid the letter and did 
not discuss the matter with them until some 
further action could be taken. 


The Nagid had sent a note to R. Judah 
concerning the appointment of R. Saadya 
Lahaboz as financial overseer of the community. 
R. Judah informs R. Jacob that he responded to 
the go-between of the Nagid by stating that the 
community did not want R. Saadya to fill that 
position. It prefers that two other people should 
be appointed as overseers of the community’s 
finances, namely, R. Mordecai Dery and R. Saul 
Kohen. At this time R. Judah inquires whether a 
note was sent to the Nagid to appease Anon (R. 
Jacob)? R. Judah has been informed that R. 
Moses ibn Adhan was given oral instructions to 
serve as a go-between to reconcile the Nagid and 
Anon (R. Jacob). R. Judah expresses his opinion 
that because of the situation and the personalities 
involved there can be no realistic improvement in 
their relations unless R. Jacob confronts the 
Nagid face to face. Only then will the matter be 
restored and R. Jacob will not have to exist in 
exile, as it were. R. Judah concludes his cor- 
respondence with a prayer that God will give R. 
Jacob good counsel.

to take place. No copyists’ names are mentioned

A correspondence from David Meshash 




This letter was written by David Meshash on 
the seventh of Tishri 1871. The first part of this 
unusual rhythmic letter is very cryptic. A portion 
of the second part of this letter is written in 
Judaeo-Arabic. The writer explains why his 
response to aprevious letter is late in coming. The 
letter was first directed to another person by 
mistake since the present writer’s name was not 
indicated on the envelope. Furthermore, the

A letter from Joseph Sasson of Jerusalem to R.

books 




Joseph Sasson of Jerusalem writes to R. Raphael 
lbn Zur of Fez asking him to reply concerning a 
list of books that he supplied at R. Raphael’s 
request and upon which the latter has neglected 
to act. Joseph also asks for payment of some 
books that were ordered and delivered through

occasion. He also asks that the present list of 
books and the money for them should be given to 
R. Jacob Ha-Kohen, who would deliver both on

from whom he would like to receive a reply. A 
request is made by the writer that a beautiful 
citron should be sent to him through the first 
available person. Any price should be paid for it, 
as he has been unable to acquire any. The writer 
asks that regards be sent to R. Raphael Agayni 
and he excuses himself to R. Raphael for not

Israel Jacob Ha-Levi is an emissary engaged ina

Mekneés, R. Isaac Yitah, has claimed that it was

this had never been agreed to or discussed prior 
to the campaign. In fact, on the day of the 
fundraising effort, the assembled people stated

that they had no claim on any portion of what was 
collected. The writer says that he lost seventeen 
mitkalim as a result of the perfidy of the group 
who later supported the Nagid’s claim in the name 
of the community of Meknés. He lost, besides, 
other sums that were pledged but not paid to 
Israel. Other injustices were also perpetrated 
against the writer. He now asks R. Raphael Ha-

rabbis in Fez saying that since the matter had 
already been adjudicated by a rabbinic tribunal 




and a decision rendered they could do nothing 
further. Hayyim claims, however, that the previ- 
ous judgement was rendered while he was under 
duress and that he was forced to agree to an 
unfair decision by threats. Immediately there- 
after a copy of a document was produced which 
provided that the aforementioned object, which 
was now in the possession of the Monsano 
brothers, did, indeed, belong to himself. The

The writer informs Ham-Malakh Raphael of a

him through the agency of Moses Ha-Levi of

A letter from the rabbis of Fez introducing an 
emissary from Tiberias to the communities 
surrounding Tafilalet 




This document, which was composed in Tammuz 
1838, was sent by the following rabbis of Fez: 
Jacob Serero, Jacob (Ibn Zur), and Hayyim 
Abraham Ha-Sarfati to the communities in the 
region of Tafilalet, and as far away as Tidga 
(currently referred to as Taghaoust in the far 
south-western corner of the Anti-Atlas). They are 
asked to support the efforts of the emissary from 




undersigned rabbis, Jacob (Toledano) and 
Mordecai Berdugo, suggest that the rabbis (in 
Fez) should help to reopen the case. This letter 
is addressed to the following rabbis: Saul ibn 
Danan, Raphael Obed Ibn Zur, Elijah Ha-Sarfati, 
and Matitya Serero asking them to oblige one 
of the Monsano brothers to come (to Meknés) 
so that justice will finally be done and tranquility 
will again prevail. 




all the commentaries, and two books composed 
by R. Abraham Palaggi. Excluding the two works 
by R. Abraham, the other books cost the sum of 
ten durham and they come via Jaffa. The last 
edition of Hoshen Mishpat, volume 3, has just 
become available to the writer and it costs four 
durham. The total cost of the books is fourteen 
durham. The writer notes that he has incurred 
additional expenses and that he would like to be 
informed as soon as the books arrive. He con- 
cludes by stating that he is always at the service

had brought with him a letter from Tiberias. The 
rabbis of Fez proclaim a malediction and excom- 
munication on those who would refuse to extend 
aid, and a blessing on those who will grant it. The 
rabbis ask that all amenities should be extended 
to the emissary, since his journey is quite 
dangerous and he can use all possible support.

A plea for a divorce to be granted to the daughter 
of Abraham Ibn Danan, who was abandoned by 
her husband, who resides in Meknes 




This letter was written by R. Judah ibn Attar to R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur, in Meknés, in the month of Kislev 
1722. Esther (daughter of Abraham ibn Danan) of 
Fez has been abandoned by her husband, Saul 
Joseph b. R. Moses Ha-Kohen, who has recently 
taken up residence in Meknés. The tax collector 
continues to oppress her by constantly reminding 
her that she owes the payments that her husband 
has not met. Only by getting her husband to grant 
her a divorce, through the power of agency, will 
she no longer be subject to the threats of the tax 
collector for non-payment of taxes. 


It is true that on an earlier occasion when the 
husband was willing to grant divorces to both his 
wives, R. Judah states that he was not of the 




The rabbis of Meknes write to the rabbis of Fez 
concerning one who is unfit to take a second wife 
since he does not possess the financial means 
and he is not mentally well 




This document was sent by members of the 
rabbinic tribunal in Meknés to the rabbis of Fez, in 
the year 1867. The former relate that Joseph 
Nizzam, of their city, who desires to take asecond 
wife (in addition to his first wife) is not mentally 
balanced nor is he even capable of supporting his 
first wife. He also mistreats his first wife in every 
way imaginable. (A similar case involving a 
decision by R. Raphael Berdugo, of blessed 
memory, contained testimony prohibiting one 
from taking a second wife when he could not 
support her.)

opinion that a divorce would have been the proper 
course of action. However, since the tax collec- 
tors do not accept the fact that the husband is 
unable to pay and continue to treat the wife 
mercilessly, the need for a divorce is now urgently 
requested. The aggrieved father, Abraham ibn 
Danan, mentions in his addendum to this letter 
that R. Judah ibn Attar had written to R. Moses ibn 
Attar (of Meknés) to intercede. However, since the 
latter was apparently unsuccessful, R. Abraham 
appeals to R. Jacob Ibn Zur to do his best to 
facilitate the divorce. R. Abraham notes that while 
R. Judah states that the husband has no money, 
he does possess land from which payment should 
be made towards his daughter’s marriage con- 
tract. R. Abraham will abide by whatever action R. 
Jacob takes. R. Abraham sends regards to Rabbi 
Jacob Ibn Zur’s family and R. Jacob’s wife’s sister 




also sends her regards to them. 




The rabbis of Meknés state that as they have 
already written, even if the first wife is pregnant 
the husband will still be permitted to take a 
second wife if the pregnancy is the only grounds 
on which to prevent the second marriage from 
taking place, since at present there is no living 
male offspring from this wife. What is, however, at 
issue in this case is the husband’s inability to 
support a second wife. If he does have means of 
support, in accord with testimony given before 
the rabbis of Fez, then he should make available 
land or movable property in the value of his first 
wife’s marriage contract and the second wife 
could live with him while the first wife would have 
the option of suing for divorce. This ruling is in 
accord with the author of Beit Yehuda (R. Judah 
Ayyash) in responsum no. 5, where he quotes the 
Ribash. 




The first wife’s brothers have brought forward 
two groups of witnesses who have testified that 
her husband is unable to support two wives. This 
testimony is in direct contradiction to that given 
on the husband’s behalf in the court at Fez. The 
wife’s witnesses are deemed superior by their 
number in a case where estimations, not facts, are 
being presented. 


Support must include the provision of food, 
clothing, and furniture in accord with 
Maimonides’ ruling in his code, Yad ha-Hazakah, 
in the section dealing with the Laws concerning 




A response to Aaron Ibn Zur’s request for a Ktav 
Yuhasin—a family tree, on the occasion of his 
daughter’s wedding, is reluctantly given 




Aaron Ibn Zur desires to produce his family tree 
called Ktav Yuhasin, on the occasion of his 
daughter’s marriage. He receives a response to 
this request from his brother who apparently does 
not want his name divulged for reasons of 
security. The brother extends his best wishes and 
prays that the parents of the bride will lead their 
other sons and daugNters to the wedding canopy. 
The writer does not particularly want to divulge 
the historical-biographical information and 
prefers the dead to be left in peace. 


The writer associates his family’s origins with 
the rabbis and scholars of Castile of whom he 
numbers five generations. He begins with R. 
Moses Ibn Zur, 0.b.m., who was known as 




A husband alleges that his young wife is 
rebellious and he wants the matter to be ad- 
judicated 




Rabbi Raphael Moses Elbaz writes to R. Raphael 
Ibn Zur in the month of Tammuz 1877 about a 
husband, R. Meir ben R. Isaac called Asbag, also 
known as ibn Asaboni, who had asked that R. 
Raphael !bn Zur be informed about Meir’s wife, 
the daughter of R. Moses called Asayaig, who 
dwells in Fez. The husband presented a claim 
against his wife, in R. Elbaz’ court, saying that she 
was rebellious and that she deserted him for a 




Married Life, Hilkhort Ishut, chapter 14:3. This 
ruling is also in accord with R. Jacob in his Code, 
Tur, chapter 76. Thus, when this mentally 
unbalanced man comes to the rabbis in Fez they 
are asked to evaluate his real wealth and they 
should not permit him to marry a second woman 
until he appears in Meknés and reaches financial 
settlement according to the law, as R. Raphael 
Berdugo, 0.b.m., decided. This document is 
signed in Meknés by the rabbis, Matityah Ber- 
dugo, Abraham Amar, and Jacob Berdugo. 




Abraham the Hebrew, his only son the luminary, 
R. lsaac, 0.b.m., and then he mentions the second 
R. Moses o.b.m., the son of Jacob, 0.b.m., who is 
the fifth generation. “We are the scion of the 
saintly Rabbi Reuben, o.b.m., the son of the 
aforementioned R. Jacob, who was a brother toR. 
Moses Il. At that point in history the family 
branched out into six groups.” The writer in- 
dicates a family tradition which maintains that the 
ancestors are buried (in Spain) in the place where 
the Edict of Expulsion of 1492 was declared. In 
any event he reiterates that his brother has good 
cause to be proud of his family tree. The writer 
implores that after the letter’s contents are read to 
Mordecai ibn Go it should be torn into a thousand 
pieces and then burned. Aaron is also exhorted 
not to divulge who is the source of his informa- 
tion. The. letter was composed on Purim day,

lengthy period. The party pleading the wife’s case 
disclaimed the charge against her as unfounded. 
Furthermore, he argued, the husband probably 
had a prospect for another bride and so had 
trumped up a false claim against his present wife. 
It was decided that the matter should be judged 
on the testimony of witnesses to see which claim 
was correct. 


The cross-examination of witnesses for both 
parties produced the same stalemate as before. 
The young wife was a minor and her alleged 
rebelliousness could not be ascertained. The case 
was recessed indefinitely. At about this time her 
mother was about to give birth in Fez, so she

asked her daughter to come to Fez to help her. 
The husband, Meir, prevented his wife from going 
to her mother’s aid. When she finally went to Fez 
her father would not give her leave to return to her

R. Raphael Moses Elbaz writes to R. Raphael Ibn 
Zur about R. David ben R. Elazar called Adhan, 
who has moved to Sefrou under the pressure of

off area and subsequently sent a bill of divorce to 
his first wife. After the divorce, she arrived in R. 




A query concerning the custom (in Fez) gover- 
ning one who acquires groves, fields, or gardens if 
he also acquires the right of domicile therein? 




Rabbi Raphael Moses Elbaz inquires of R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur concerning the custom, in Fez, 
governing the acquisition of groves, fields, and 
gardens, as to whether the owner also acquires 
the right of domicile therein, particularly when 
they are outside the city limits. This question 
applies also to cases where the property is 
received as a pledge or is rented by Jews from 
non-Jewish owners. What prompts this question 
is that many Jews rent or take as a pledge gardens 
and groves, and then find that the non-Jewish 
owners also rent them to others and no one is able 
to do anything about this practice. 


The writer also inquires about a particular case 




An Halakhic enquiry is posed concerning the 
possibility of rendering a lenient decision in a 
case dealing with a levirate

relations with him at night, she still could serve 
him in other capacities during the day. R. Raphael 
Elbaz asks R. Raphael Ibn Zur to try to arrange a 
compromise between them but if he is un- 
successful, the matter will have to be made 
subject to litigation. 




Elbaz’s jurisdiction with their son and when the 
husband saw his son and his former wife he was 
moved to compassion for them. He divorced his 
new wife and now desires to remarry his former 
wife and this is where the problem begins. An 
enactment was promulgated in R. Elbaz’s locality 
which said that a man who is a stranger, who 
comes from another land, cannot marry a woman 
in the community (of Sefrou), for well known 
reasons. Therefore, the writer was instructed by 
the man to correspond with R. Raphael Ibn Zur 
concerning the entire matter. 




concerning a garden outside the city limits and 
the house belonging to it that adjoins the wall of 
the city. The garden was completely enclosed and 
given on pledge to a Jew by its non-Jewish 
owners. Presently the non-Jewish owners decid- 
ed to build an inn in the garden. Now the writer 
asks whether the Jewish owners have rights of 
domicile in the garden, called Hezkat ha-Yishuv. 
Or, he says, do we Say that since the Jews never 
thought about claiming rights of domicile until the 
present situation arose that they have no such 
claim? If the Jews try to change the terms of the 
agreement to establish their rights of domicile by 
the fact that the garden is pledged to them and 
they have sowed vegetables thereon fora number 
of years so that they can demonstrate a solid 
claim to the land, can they prevent the building of 
this inn? The need for a response to this query is 
pressing. 




R. Raphael Ibn Zur that in the course of his travels 
he arrived at the community called Klaya, 
amongst the towns of the Rif. A question was 
raised with regard to the practice of the law of the 
Levirate. Since few books are available here 
except for the Code Even ha-Ezer, wherein a 
minority opinion is mentioned on this particular 




subject, the writer refuses to render a lenient 
decision based on that citation. He asks R. 
Raphael to provide a basis for a lenient decision 
on the subject of the Levirate and to render a 
speedy reply. The writer refers to the strange 




One who was in debt gave the creditor securities 
in excess of the value of the debt and he demands 
that an oath be taken if the creditor denies 
receiving the securities 




R. Judah ibn Attar responds to the letters that had 
been previously sent to him by R. Hasdai 
Almosnunia concerning a bill of debt that Jacob 
Konsina held against Saadya Lahabusi. Jacob 
collected some of the debt, but claiming that there 
was still money owing, he gave his power of 
attorney to Solomon ibn Amara to collect the 
amount that was still outstanding. Subsequently, 
he gave Solomon half of a bolt of woolen material 
to deliver to Saadya but, wielding his power of 
attorney, Solomon confiscated it as payment for 
the remainder of the debt. All these details had 
been included in the letter sent by R. Hasdai. 


R. Judah now writes that he summoned 




An inquiry is made as to the availability of 
documents which can substantiate the claim of 
inheritors which has a bearing on the redemption 
of captives 




R. Judah ibn Attar writes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
concerning deeds of the inheritors of Isaac and 
Ephraim ibn Amara that were deposited with the 
latter. He asks R. Jacob to send them to him 
because the courtyard containing a new ritual 
bath, which was built by Isaac ibn Amara, is 
presently held in the possession of R. Joseph 
Adhan as a pledge and the descendants of R. Levi 
ibn Amara, may his soul repose in paradise, are 
pressing their claim to it based on the existence of 
the aforementioned deeds. R. Judah’s court tried 
to render a decision in the nature of acompromise 
so that the claimants, the descendants of R. Levi 
ibn Amara, should agree to monetary settlement 
and cease pressing any further claim. This 




customs that the people of this locale practice, 
especially with regard to Levirate procedures. 
Regards are sent to R. Abner Ha-Sarfati. This 
letter was written on the eighth day of Tammuz 
1877. 




Saadya and read him the contents of the letter 
which R. Hasdai had sent him. Saadya replied that 
he had given securities to Jacob which were 
worth in excess of the sum that was supposed to 
be outstanding so how could Jacob claim that the 
debt was not fully paid? Saadya further suggested 
that Jacob and his friend Moses Marago should 
take an oath stating that they did not receive the 
whole sum of the debt in the form of securities, 
and that this oath should be recorded. Afterwards, 
Saadya said, he would challenge R. Solomon in 
the courts concerning the way he had exercised 
his power of attorney. R. Judah tells R. Hasdai he 
must now summon R. Jacob and R. Solomon to 
inform them of Saadya’s reply and that affirmation 
of their oaths should be forwarded by the first 
available courier. Then Saadya can enter into 
litigation with Solomon. A speedy reply is awaited 
from R. Hasdai. 




decision will remain in force as long as deeds of 
ownership are not produced. If they are produced 
then a judgement can be rendered accordingly. 
Until such time judgement will be suspended. 
Thus, the court, having written to R. Jacob on two 
or three occasions, awaits the forwarding of those 
documents by R. Jacob. 


Concerning other documents held by R. 
Jacob, R. Joseph Adhan needs to produce a 
pledge in order to redeem himself with its value 
because he and his two brothers are being held by 
a non-Jew who causes them grief and has placed 
them in confinement on his property for over two 
weeks. The non-Jew caught the young son with 
the intention of converting him to Islam. The non- 
Jew freed them on the condition that cash would 
be made available to him immediately. The 
adversity of the times makes it impossible for 
others to help so that the pledge must be 
redeemed. For this reason Joseph Adhan sends 
his eldest son, Mimun, to R. Jacob to receive the

documents from him directly since Joseph is in 
such an oppressed situation. The son will not

available. If perchance the documents have been 
destroyed, R. Jacob should make this information 
available at once so as not to prolong any false 




A final exhortation of Isaac Ibn Amara to produce 
deeds in substantiation of his claim or the 
judgement will remain in Joseph Adhan’s favor 




R. Judah ibn Attar writes to R. Shalom ibn 
Lakhraif concerning a judgement which was 
discussed in Ms.250, on page 318a. A favorable 
decision concerning the redemption of the pledge 
was given to Joseph Adhan against the claims of 
Isaac ibn Amara, the son of Mimun, who resides in 
the vicinity of R. Shalom. Thus, the descendants 




Abraham Ibn Amara is in trouble with the ruling 
authorities and he can only redeem himself by 


Calling in all debts owed to him and by what he can 
realize from what is due to him from a partnership 




The rabbis Judah ibn Attar and Jacob Ibn Zur, at 
Fez, signed this document which they wrote to the 
rabbis Isaac Nahon and Isaac Halevi, the com- 
munal leaders, and also to R. Samuel Abudarham 
and Joseph Abudarham (at Tetuan). The case 
concerns R. Abraham ibn Amara who holds a bill 
of debt owed to him by Mordecai ibn Amozag in 
the amount of one thousand uqiot. The creditor, 
Abraham, received his claim through Jacob ibn 
Ramukh and his wife who received the money as 
part of her dowry. Jacob’s wife was the daughter 
of Solomon ibn Danan, of blessed memory, who 
held a bill of debt against the aforementioned 
Mordecai, which became Jacob’s wife’s portion of 
the inheritance from her late father. 


Abraham ibn Amara is now in dire straits with 
the ruling authorities and requires large sums of 
money to redeem himself from his poverty and his 
oppressors. The king’s agents were about to 
descend on him to demand their money, but he 
managed to put off their arrival until a response 
should be forthcoming to this letter. Therefore, a 
reply should be sent on receipt of this letter as to 




132 




hopes, since this case involves the religious act of 
redemption of captives. If the deeds are not 
available then R. Jacob might be able to offer 
testimony or produce witnesses concerning them 
in hopes that some benefit will arise from this kind 
of evidence in lieu of the missing deeds. 




of R. lsaac ibn Amara have had to admit that the 
pledge held on the land in the yard of Zerah ibn 
Pargin belongs to Joseph, since a thirty-day 
period and every opportunity was given for 
documentary evidence to be presented but it 
never was. R. Judah asks R. Shalom to send for 
Isaac and to read to him all that is contained in this 
letter as a final warning that he either shall 
immediately produce all pertinent documents or 
else Joseph Adhan can immediately begin to 
appropriate the pledge for his own needs. 




whether the money will be readily paid, or, if the 
debtor is not able to pay the debt immediately, 
what other arrangements can be made. As soon 
as payment is received the bill of debt will be 
destroyed. The debtor is warned that if he does 
procrastinate then the money will be collected by 
force. Any additional expenses incurred as a 
result of the coercive measures will be added to 
the total amount of the loan. 


Abraham ibn Amara also has a contract of 
partnership with Abraham Adrutiel in a meat 
concession, for one year, to be renewed every 
month. Both parties have agreed to divide the 
profits on the basis that R. Adrutiel will run the 
business’s day-to-day transactions, while Abra- 
ham ibn Amara will keep the accounts, rendering 
exact reports to R. A. Adrutiel whenever he asks 
for them. R. Adrutiel has placed complete trust 
in R. Amara in all matters and no note can be 
drawn up to disturb the legal force of the contract 
for the duration of the time therein stipulated. The 
partnership shall extend from the seventeenth 
of Av 1727 until the month of Av 1728. The con- 
tract of partnership registers that R. Solomon 
Abudarham will pay for the hides. The under- 
signed ask their correspondents to compel R. 
Adrutiel to make payment to R. Amara of monies 
that he still owes him for this year’s receipts. 




Abraham ibn Amara also holds a bill of debt 
against R. Mas’Ud ibn Israel ibn Haroush. Under 
its terms payments should be forthcoming on 
demand and any expenses incurred should be 
paid. The writers state that R. Mas’Ud ibn Haroush 
should now be compelled to pay R. Abraham ibn 
Amara what he owes. If these debtors are not able 
to make payment then the order of law shall pre- 
vail, officers will be sent, and the debtors will be

raise funds by appealing to others. The impor- 
tance of supporting such an undertaking is 
underscored by the statement “that even a Torah 
Scroll should be sold for the purpose of Torah 
study or for marriage.” Not only should financial 
aid be made available to the bearer of this letter 
but he should be accorded hospitality that is 
fitting for his station. A prayer is inscribed at the

between two partners that has been submitted to 
litigation. Apparently the litigants presented their 




R. Judah Ibn Attar writes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
about two different cases in Jewish Law 




R. Judah ibn Attar writes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
about two different cases. The first case deals 
with a woman who claims that a pledge given fora 
loan was redeemed on her behalf. The plaintiff, 
Solomon ibn Yaish is now claiming that the 
pledge is unredeemed and he is pressing his claim 
against her. The first part of this correspondence 
is written in Ladino. The woman has not been 
permitted to take an oath to support her statement 
since there is cause for questioning her 
testimony. R. Judah gives her fifteen days to 
defend her position which is that she has already 
redeemed the pledge from her son-in-law, Isaac, 
and that she has subsequently torn it up. The 
woman has agreed that if she cannot offer 
additional evidence in the allotted time, then 
Solomon ibn Yaish’s claim will stand. The pledge 
is supposed to have been deposited with R. 
Samuel Arwaz. 


The second case originates in Debdou. With 
the authorization of his community, Jacob Kohen 
of Debdou has brought a complaint, against 
Samuel Kohen stating that the latter has sworn 




134 




them of his campaign. The date of this letter is 
given as the month of Adar 1760. The name of the 
author, Immanuel Monsano, appears in the letter 
in the form of an acrostic. 
It may very well be that all the letters in this 
collection were composed by Immanuel Mon- 
sano. 




arguments in the presence of the writer but since 
a decision was not reached the parties are willing 
to submit to the decision of another authority, 
which is R. Jacob. The particulars of the dispute 
were forwarded to R. Jacob but they are not stated 
in this correspondence. The writer asks for a 
comprehensive and speedy reply as he has 
received on several other occasions when he 
turned to R. Jacob to render a judgement. 




falsely. But, from the reaction of R. Joseph Ha- 
Kohen, R. Judah ibn Attar deduces that Samuel is 
being unjustly charged, especially since the 
scholar who was reported to have signed the 
charge against Samuel, namely, R. Joseph has 
actually signed nothing. The claimants, led by 
Jacob Kohen, have made many attempts to oblige 
Samuel to pay a penalty for his huge debts that 
they claim are outstanding. Furthermore, R. 
Judah says, Jacob is acting presumptuously in 
that he refuses to obey his own authority in Fez 
and is demanding that the case be heard in 
Meknés. Once before R. Judah had washed his 
hands of the affair, because Jacob was so 
contemptible, but Samuel’s pleadings oblige him 
once again to involve himself in the case. He will 
attempt to achieve asettlement of the dispute by a 
compromise, whereby Samuel would pay a 
certain sum for every book of recorded accounts 
that was at the base of the dispute. However, he 
fears that Jacob has taken an uncompromising 
position just to hurt Samuel and to cause bad 
reports to be spread about him. Samuel is known 
for his intelligence, and his charitable nature has 
gained him much renown, so he has become the 
victim of animosity because others are jealous of 
him. 




A chronicle 




[Portions of this chronicle were recorded by 
Saadya ibn Danan and the final copyist was 
Immanuel, son of Joshua Serero. The major 
portion of page 326a is written in Judaeo-Arabic. 
What follows is a translation of the Hebrew 
portion of page 326a and the entire page 326b.] 


“It is written in the hand of my grandfather R. 
Samuel ibn Danan o.b.m., that the Castilian 
expulsion transpired in the year 1497. Lest | forget 
the date | have recorded it here. Saadya ibn 
Danan. Also he (R. Samuel ibn Danan) records 
that the expulsion that transpired in Fez Albali 
(the old city of Fez) to the Toshavim took place in 
the year 1438. The expulsion that befell the Mellah 
occurred in the year 1465. (Recorded by) Saadya 
ibn Danan.” 


“In the year 1636, on the seventh of the month 
of Adar II, an earthquake was heard which caused 
a great panic in Fez. People grabbed weapons and 
they attacked one another in confusion. This was 
recorded by Saadya ibn Danan and it was copied 
by Immanuel Serero.” A solar eclipse is also 
recorded and the amount of sunlight is measured. 
Stars were seen in the afternoon on the twenty- 
eighth of Nisan, circa 1630. A great quake was felt 
in an early morning of 1624, whereupon a great 
number of houses and towers were demolished in 
Fez Albali and about 3,500 people were killed. 
More people were injured after the quake because 
of the weakened condition of the houses. It was 
regarded as a miracle that not one Jew was killed 
although their houses were demolished, especial- 
ly as their houses were not so well constructed as 
those of the non-Jews. The reason why this event 
was recorded is stated as follows, “to make known 
to future generations the magnitude of this 
miracle that occurred.” The author is recorded as 
Saadya, the son of Abraham, the son of Samuel 
ibn Danan, o.b.m. All this transpired on the 
occasion of the reading of (the portion of the 




scroll) “and | remembered my covenant with 
Jacob.” 


“Another incident that is reported to have 
occurred on Wednesday, the eve of Shavuot 
(Pentecost), 1624, is that the sky darkened and 
small creatures fell from the sky. The upper 
portion of their bodies were like that of a locust 
and the bottom like a worm. At the same time a 
storm of large (hail) stones fell from the sky. One 
stone weighed four uqiot and inall probability the 
stones were larger before they reached the 
ground. People who were in the marketplace were 
hurt by the falling stones. One stone came 
through the window of R. Moses Almosni’s house 
and it broke a vessel. It was also reported that a 
lion entered the Giza gate of Fez Albali and killeda 
donkey and he took another donkey with him. It is 
not known whether this is true but most of the 
non-Jews Say that it transpired. In the courtyard 
of Mahmoud ben Gidar two cats fought and one 
ate the other. 


“All the foregoing were copied from Saadya 
ibn Danan’s Ms., by Immanuel b. R. Joshua 
Serero in the month of Heshvan 1724.” 


[Page 330a and b is part of Ms.258 which is 
found on page 326a and b. At the bottom of page 
330a historical information is recorded in Judaeo- 
Arabic and it continues on page 330b and page 
326a, which are actually the same page.] The 
contents of page 330a are given below. 


As well as Fez the communities of Marrakesh, 
Dera, Tafilalet, and their environs are mentioned. 
A prediction of events based on when the New 
Year will fall is offered for the cities of Morocco. 
Brigands will abound and wars will be fought. The 
end of the year will be appreciably better than the 
early part. Plentiful rain will reduce the price of 
wheat. The day on which the New Year will occur 
will affect weather conditions, health conditions, 
and also whether difficulties will be encountered 
with the crops. This type of forecasting reminds 
one of a kind of Almanac.

Exposition of an Aggadic text from the Talmud 




Various Aggadic interpretations are offered for a 
text found in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate 
Gittin, folio 36b. The text is as follows: “Those 




R. Mordecai Birdugo asks R. Jacob Ibn Zur to set 
the record straight in a dispute concerning two 
widowed women 




This letter deals with the case of the first widow of 
Jacob Pariente who is undergoing much anguish. 
R. Mordecai wants R. Jacob Ibn Zur toinform him 
whether the woman’s suffering resulted from a 
decision and action taken by R. Jacob Ibn Zur or 
whether the second wife, who is a person of a 
bitter disposition, is the cause of the first wife’s 
suffering? If the former is the case then why does 
R. Jacob not inform R. Mordecai about it? At least 
R. Jacob should respond to R. Mordecai’s last 
correspondence wherein the latter proposed a 
settlement in favor of the first wife. 


If R. Jacob Ibn Zur does not agree with R. 




An exhortatory prayer, called Tokheha, com- 
posed by R. Bahya Ibn Paquda and copied by R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur 




R. Jacob Ibn Zur states, in his introduction to this 
liturgical poem, called Tokheha, that it was 
composed by the author of the Hovot ha-Levavot, 
R. Bahya ibn Paquda. The latter states in the 
aforementioned work that he composed this 
poem as an exhortation to the soul. R. Jacob

Serero, of blessed memory. The mourners to 
whom the letter is written are R. Reuben Serero, R. 
Matitya Serero, R. Shalom Serero, and R. Joshua 
Serero. The praises of the departed are for- 
mulated into four paragraphs, each one commen- 
cing with the word Zaddik and concluding with a 
popular saying culled from Talmudic literature. 
The letter was composed in the year 1855-56. 




who are insulted but do not return insults in kind 
to those who insulted them act out of love (of 
God) and they rejoice with the portion which the 
Almighty meted out to them.” [For page 330a and 
b, see Ms.258.] 




Mordecai’s viewpoint then “he should have sent 
her forth with nothing, as naked as the day that 
she was born.” Furthermore, R. Mordecai would 
surely abide by R. Jacob’s decision because of the 
esteem in which R. Jacob is held. R. Mordecai 
asks, “why was it necessary to introduce the non- 
Jewish ruling authority into the situation?” It is 
the writer's intention to attempt to arrange a 
settlement between the disputing parties. 
However, if the second wife took the action that 
she perpetrated without R. Jacob’s permission 
then he should denounce her, since because of 
her actions the first wife was obliged to come 
before the authorities and she continues to incura 
great loss. Therefore, a speedy reply is expected 
from R. Jacob wherein he should set the record 
straight. 




further states that this composition subsequently 
appeared in Mahzorim (High Holy Days prayer 
books) and it is also noted in the work Sha’arei ha- 
Teshuvah. He desired to possess a copy of this 
composition, until the day he happened to find it 
in an edition of the Mahzor of Rome which was 
filled with a multitude of liturgical pieces referred 
to as Yozrot, Krovot, and Tokhehdt. R. Jacob 
copied this text for his friend, the scholar R. 
Nehemiah Ha-Kohen, as a gift of remembrance. 




A letter from Ha-Zevi Me’at Devash to R. Raphael 
Ibn Zur concerning the availability of books for 
purchase 




This letter was sent in response to R. Raphael Ibn 
Zur’s request for aset of the Codes of Jewish Law.

Zevi Judah Birdugo asks that certain conditions 
stipulated for an estate be nullified so that he may 
utilize the estate for capital to enable him to settle 
in the Holy Land 




[This letter was sent after a previous letter which 
is found in Ms.11, on page 22a.] R. Zevi Judah 
Birdugo, who resides in Jerusalem, requires 
funds which he can realize from his portion of an 
estate left by his grandfather. The latter stipulated 
certain conditions, namely, that the land should 
not be used in payment for a claim originating 
from a marriage contract nor should it be sold or 




A letter of consolation on the demise of R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur, o.b.m. 




This letter of consolation is written by Joseph 
Israel on the death of the great Rabbi Jacob Ibn 
Zur. The writer appears to curse those aspects 
that are related to the decay of mortals rather than 
to death itself. In fact, he characterizes death itself 
as “good” for it liberates the soul and enables it to 
ascend to those celestial spheres where it will 




R. Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur is asked to make 
available a copy of a decision rendered by another 
scholar that he possesses, which may serve as a 
precedent in a case that must presently be 
adjudicated

Zur to provide a copy of a lega! judgement that 
was rendered by Mahari Mas’td, of blessed

R. Raphael that, while recently there was an 
overabundance of this work, supply of this edition 
has now virtually been exhausted. However, no

Once the books are located they will be sent to

order to maintain the estate in perpetuity so that 
the descendants would be able to benefit from the 
land’s produce. 


R. Zevi Judah’s brother waived his family’s 
rights to the land in favor of the former. R. Zevi 
Judah asks R. Solomon Ibn Zur and the young 
scholar R. Y. Monsonyego to render a favorable 
judgement which will render null and void the 
conditional element of the deed so that he can sell 
the land to acquire what he needs; especially 
since he is utilizing it for the religious duty of

which is needed to resolve a pressing problem in

of the roof lose their rights to the roof or not? An 
answer to a similar problem was rendered by 
Mahari Mas’Ud and therefore a copy of his 
judgement is called for.

A plea to the rabbis Yedidia Monsonyego and 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur to right an injustice 
perpetrated against a dead orphan 




A woman called Rebecca, the wife of R. Isaac 
Afriat, was shattered by the death of her grand- 
son, the youth Ayush ibn Joseph ben Haroush 
who was the son of her daugNter, especially since 
she had no money with which to provide him with 
shrouds, burial needs, a candle for his soul, or the 
recital of memorial prayers on his behalf. The 
grandmother had to borrow money in order to get 
all the paraphernalia that was necessary for his 
burial. Two months later the creditor came to 
collect his due and the grandmother could no 
longer put him off. Therefore she came before the 
rabbis Matitya ibn Zikhri and Raphael Moses 
Elbaz asking them to write to the rabbis (of Fez) 
(Yedidia Monsonyego and Solomon Elijah Ibn 




A plea is written to R. Solomon Ibn Zur on behalf 
of Mordecai Elbaz who is destitute. A claim that a 
debtor should pay the additional penalty for a 
debt paid late 




Rabbi Raphael Moses Elbaz asks R. Solomon 
Elijah Ibn Zur to extend aid to R. Mordecai Elbaz, 
who is a relative of the writer, and whose family 
has recently, become afflicted with poverty and 
hunger. R. Mordecai has never had to depend 
upon the help of others before and has always 
lived a frugal life. He still devotes himself to Torah 
study constantly and especially to the study of 
Zohar. 


A second subject is dealt with in this letter. The 
case involves a debt that had to be paid in two 
installments by Reuben to Simeon. There was an 
agreement between both parties that if the 
payments were not made on time then Reuben

Zur) to support her claim. 


The deceased youth had been in partnership 
with Joseph Saba and with Moses Yalu, and 
during this time, his father, Joseph, had been 
killed by non-Jews. The grandmother has heard 
from reliable sources that Moses Yalu took: the 
money that was given in recompense for the 
murder of the father of the dead youth. The rabbis 
(of Fez) are asked to summon Moses Yalu to make 
payment with the money that was given on behalf 
of the murdered father to cover the loan for the 
burial expense of the dead son; for, indeed, the 
latter was the rightful heir. Were it not for her 
advanced age and her weakened condition the 
grandmother would travel (to Fez) to enter into 
litigation with Moses Yalu. The rabbis (at Fez) are 
asked to render judgement on the grandmother's 
behalf for the court is the proper caretaker of the 
orphan and the widow. The address directs this 
letter to Fez. 




would be obliged to pay an additional amount of 
money as a penalty. Reuben made the first 
payment on time but, just before the second 
payment was due Simeon left town. Reuben 
delivered the money that he owed, to the court 
stating that the creditor was not presently 
available. When the creditor returned he demand- 
ed that the penalty should be paid since he 
received the money after the deadline. R. Raphael 
Moses Elbaz presently inquires of R. Solomon 
what decision should the court render? The writer 
refers R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur to Hoshen Mish- 
pat, chapter seventy-three, paragraph 8, and he 
cites the Sema on that text. He also mentions 
the responsa of the Rashba cited by the Beit 
Yosef, chapter seven; also the Kelalei Ha-Rdésh, 
Kelal No. 8, paragraph 6; and finally the work 
Avodat ha-Gershtni, part |, chapter 7. A speedy 
reply is requested. 




R. Raphael Maman inquires about a daughter's 
share of her father’s estate after his demise 
although he had previously granted her an 
inheritance as she was a child from a previous 
marriage 




This query was sent to R. Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur 
at Fez, by R. Raphael Maman. A daughter from a 
first marriage who benefitted by receiving an 
inheritance from her father’s estate is now entitled 
to receive an additional inheritance from her 
father’s estate after his demise in accordance with 
the enactment referred to as ‘Isur Nikhsei,’ which 
means a tenth of the property. What amount is she 
entitled to receive if there is a second wife and 
sons who survive the deceased father? For 
example, if for argument’s sake there are one 
hundred silver pieces to be divided, do we give 




A divorcée claims that she is the victim of an 
unjust decision concerning the financial settle- 
ment that she received for her marriage contract 
and she wants to press a claim against a third 




party 




R. Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur had previously written 
to R. Matityah (ibn Zikhri) concerning a divorcée 
who is claiming that the financial settlement of her 
marriage contract was unfair and is now deman- 
ding a more just and equitable settlement. R. 
Elijah states that since the woman and her three 
daughters are in economic distress a more 
favorable settlement should be accorded to her. 
R. Raphael Maman, the writer of this letter, 
responds to R. Elijah Solomon, of Fez, to clarify 
for the latter why the original judgement should 
stand. 


This woman deserves no special considera- 
tion in respect of her marriage contract for the 
following reasons. Firstly, she and her former 
husband were involved in collusion by trying to 
coerce others to divest themselves of property 
which was originally accorded to her in her 
marriage contract but was sold to others a long 
time ago. Her husband would remarry her once 




this daughter ten pieces of silver and divide the 
remainder between the second wife and her 
sons? If that were done, then the wife would re- 
ceive fifty percent of what remains, which is forty- 
five silver pieces, and the remaining forty-five 
pieces of silver would be divided amongst the 
sons. Or, does the second wife receive fifty per- 
cent of the total estate at the outset which gives 
her fifty silver pieces and the remainder divided 
as follows—ten silver pieces to the daughter and 
the remaining forty pieces to the sons? Perhaps 
the second wife’s portion does not enter into the 
calculation of ‘Isur Nikhsei’ at all, in which case 
the daughter is only entitled to one tenth of what 
the male and female issue receive, which is a 
considerably smaller sum. The writer states that 
this is an actual case that is pending and he 
requires that a decision be rendered. A speedy 
reply is desired. 




she had extracted the money from the third party 
under false pretense. Secondly, her marriage 
contract was mortgaged for a debt so that she has 
no rights to negotiate on the strength of her 
marriage contract. Furthermore, a compromise 
settlement could have been reached were she 
willing to waive any future claims on her marriage 
contract. R. Y. Adhan sought such a compromise 
and it was only out of respect for him that there 
was a willingness to entertain such an arrange- 
ment. Strictly according to the law, no com- 
promise should have even been introduced. 
When the woman saw that she could get no 
satisfaction she turned to the ruler to try to obtain 
a ruling in her favor. The divorcée charged that a 
bad judgement had been rendered against her. 
The ruler decreed that the case should be sent 
(from Meknés) to the rabbis of Fez for review. The 
charges that this woman made must be proven to 
be unfounded so as to clear the court of any false 
accusations in the way they had rendered their 
verdict. The writer himself is involved in this 
litigation with the divorcée as the third party that 
acquired the property which she claims belongs 
to her. That is why Raphael Maman responds toR. 
Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur instead of R. Matityah 
(Zikhri), to whom Ibn Zur wrote originally. The

writer does not desire to elaborate any more to R. 
Ibn Zur except in a face to face confrontation. IfR. 
Elijah Solomon stills wants to grant the divorcée 
and her children some funds as a result.of the 
earlier compromise, the writer is not averse to her 
receiving some aid, especially since the orphans, 
the children of the divorcée, are cousins to the 
writer. However, the writer refuses to permit this 
grant to be given a guise of legality in the form ofa 
compromise, since the cause of justice will not be 
served in that manner.

The first of two allegories relates the tale of a

only to abandon her again and leave her shattered 
and forlorn. A sage warns her against him and

takes issue with R. Elijah Solomon who cited a 
ruling of R. Judah ibn Attar o.b.m., that witnesses 
should write their testimony that they saw a bill of 
pledge. He states that even R. Judah ibn Attar 
would have agreed that where the bill of pledge is 
still in force such written testimony is irrelevant. 
The writer states that he follows Maimonides’ 
ruling in this case. The writer also notes that the 
Rema’s view expressed in Hoshen Mishpat 115:5 
is rejected by most authorities, especially sinceR. 
Caro is in disagreement with that view. [The 
address to Fez is on the other side of this letter. ] 




Raphael ibn Arzi, asks R. Solomon Elijah to 
ensure that the community extends a helping 
hand to R. Jacob. He also requests that since the 
rainy season will soon commence the fundraising 
effort should be expedited as soon as possible, so 
that the scholar can return home. [The address 
to Fez is given on the other side of the page.] 




only to that individual. The writer asks R. Solomon 
to affirm the decision so that the matter can be 
concluded. Raphael Maman mentions another 
case that was brought to litigation, and informs 
R. Solomon that he wrote to Raphael Agayni to 
make payment in accord with the decision ren- 
dered. [The address to Fez is given on the other 
side of the page.] 




The second tale relates the story of how a 
virtuous young man was able to succeed in the 
moral battle and how he avoided the clutches of 
wayward women who desired to ensnare him. 
One woman, however, succeeded with her wiles 
and the young man succumbed to her charms and 
wed her. However, she proved to be unfaithful to 
him and he reviled her. Yet he wanted her to 
receive her just desserts so he went to seek her 
out. On the way he encountered her but she did 
not appear at all familiar to him. The woman 
fabricated a story that her husband had been 
imprisoned for more than ten years. After this 
chance encounter she had twins and she justified 
her ways before her unknowing husband. 


Sixteen verses follow which characterize 




women. They are penned by Raphael Arzi, the 
author of the aforementioned allegories. Another 
six verses similar in style to the previous verses 
were composed by Hayyim Toledano. 


The final text in this group of writings is by 
Raphael Arzi and is an epistle to R. Judah, the 
father of Samuel and Amram (Elbaz), in a 




A chronicle recorded by Immanuel Monsano 




The chronicler commences with a lament about 
the unfortunate times in which he lives. “In the 
year 1739 no rain fell in the month of Adar | until 
the seventeenth day of the month. On the 
eighteenth day prayers of thanksgiving were 
recited. In the month of Adar II no rain fell until 
the seventh day at which time a public fast was 
declared, although some people were fasting 
anyway because it was the anniversary of Moses’ 
death. At the morning service supplicatory 
prayers and scriptural verses were read. At the 
afternoon service the Torah scroll was read and 
additional prayers were recited. On Thursday, the 
ninth day of Adar II, a public fast was again 
declared. At the morning service supplicatory 
prayers were offered, including ‘Our Father Our 
King.’” 


The head of the academy and leading rabbi of 
the community delivered a lecture after which the 
service was concluded. The lecture stressed that 
the denial of rain was directly related to the sin of 
neglecting Torah study, since Torah study leads 
to good behavior. The speaker also stated that 
gossip and other improper exercise of speech 
cause the rains to cease; this is based on 
interpretation. Public violation of Sabbath laws, 
especially by the vendors of liquor, is also a factor. 
Therefore, an enactment was made to the effect 
that even if only one witness saw a vendor sell 
liquor, whether to Jew or non-Jew, on the Sab- 
bath, then he should pay a fine to be used on 
behalf of the poor. Another lapse recounted by 
the scholar was that Jewish women go to Fez to 
work for the non-Jews and remain there day and 
night and on the Sabbaths. They must behave in 
accordance with the code that Jewish women are 
accustomed to live by. It was decided that an 
emissary should make them return and if they 




metaphorical literary style. Raphael Arzi writes 
that he feels he has been unjustly treated by R. 
Judah and he affirms his love and friendship for 
him and his two sons. This is a unique letter of 
reconciliation wherein Raphael asks that their 
quarrels should cease. Even in this text the female 
figure is used to symbolize waywardness. 




refused then the ruler should -be asked to 
intervene to oblige them to do so. R. Azriel ibn 
Amozag was appointed overseer in these matters. 


In that same day good news arrived for the 
Jews concerning Ahdwan Al-Wadaya, one of the 
infamous bands during the days of King Mulay 
Mahmad ibn La-Ariba. There was an eclipse of the 
sun during the latter's reign. Many of the 
misfortunes of this period were recorded in the 
chronicles of R. Immanuel Monsano. The non- 
Jew Mahmad ibn Abu ibn Sa’id suffered a terrible 
death at the hands of King Mulay Lamuztadi, at 
Meknés. There was tranquility in the land during 
the latter’s reign. His accession was in Tammuz, 
1738, and he was declared king, in Fez, on Friday, 
the eighth of Av. 


“In the same day it became cloudy and very 
windy, So much so that we thought it appropriate 
to recite the ‘Great Hallel’ prayer at the afternoon 
service. The scriptural text of Vayehal was 
followed by supplicatory prayers at the afternoon 
service. We must praise the giver of life for He sent 
rain on Sunday, the twelfth of Adar. All day rain 
fell on and off, the sun shone and set, and much 
rain fell in the evening. Great thundering was 
followed by the appearance of the rainbow. It 
again became cloudy with much rain falling on 
the night of the thirteenth (of Adar).” A prayer 
follows that rain may be sent by God. On the 
fourteenth, which is the Festival of Purim, after the 
customary gifts were sent, the rabbi took a Torah 
scroll in his arms and Piyyutim (liturgical poems) 
were read. The price of wheat was still exorbitant. 
A prayer for economic sustenance and the 
coming of the Messiah is recorded, followed by 
the name of the chronicler, Immanuel Monsano. 
The chronicler continues on: 


“On Sunday, the sixteenth of Shevat, 1740, 
while we were engaged in Torah study, a man 
informed us that King Mulay Lamuztadi had 




141 




Ms. 275

fled to Fez and the entire city was in an uproar 
because of the reign of terror that would follow, 
especially for the Jewish populace, which was the 
usual course of events during unsettled times. 
That same day R. Jacob Monsonyego was 
wounded in the arm and head and as a result lost 
much blood. The king left the city and fled 
eastward since he saw no relief in Fez. On 
Tuesday, the eighteenth of Shevat, Mulay Ab- 
dallah was declared king. This was his third term 
as ruler. The supporters of the king who had 
fled, Known as LeBukhari, went after him to try 
to persuade him to return. In the month of Tishri 
1740, the ruling king arrived at Mekneés. When the 
Al-Wadaya heard of the king’s arrival at Meknés 
they rebelled against him for two months, during 
Tishri and Heshvan, and they still maintained the 
state of rebellion after that. On the twenty-fifth of 
Heshvan, the king sent his representative to them 
with an offer of amnesty. They refused to trust the 
king.” A prayer is added that the Messiah might 
come. The name of Immanuel Monsano con- 
cludes the statement. 


“In the middle of the month of Kislev, 1740, the 
king's officers went to Argil to give warning to the 
Al-Wadaya. They accepted the king’s authority 
because they received a stern warning. On Sun- 
day, the twenty-first of Kislev, they went to meet 
the king who received them and a reconcilia- 
tion was effected. 


“In the year 1758-59 no rain fell from the 
fifteenth of Tevet until the beginning of Adar. 
Clouds began to appear on Tuesday, the thirtieth 
of Shevat followed by much rain. Consequently, 
the prayer of thanksgiving was recited. However, 
the rain ceased again and the gentiles asked the 
Jews to pray for rain; so the court decreed a public 
fast for Monday, the twentieth of the month, for 
old and young, men and women, alike. Penitential 
and supplicatory prayers were recited at the 
morning service. The people went to the cemetery 
and recited prayers at the graves of the saints. 
Psalms were recited at the grave of the Great 
Rabbi Judah ibn Attar. Rabbi Elijah Ha-Sarfati 
gave a lengthy discourse. Afterwards, penitential 
prayers were recited between the gates of the city, 
at the graves of those who were murdered there. 
Then the entourage proceeded to the adjoining 
burial grounds at Al-Karsalin to recite Psalms 




142 




there. They returned, in great distress, to the 
Synagogue of the Toshavim where they recited 
Psalms. The entire congregation assembled there 
for the afternoon service at which time Rabbi 
Saul ibn Danan addressed the people. 


“On Wednesday, the twenty-second, rain fell 
the first part of the day and then ceased: The 
rabbinic tribunal decreed a fast for Monday, the 
twenty-seventh, to be observed in similar fashion 
to the earlier fast. Rabbi Elijah Ha-Sarfati ad- 
dressed the people in the morning while Rabbi 
Raphael Ibn Zur addressed the people at the 
afternoon service. After the Torah reading, seven 
circuits were made around the reader’s stand. At 
each circuit the twenty-ninth Psalm was recited 
and a poem from the Hoshanah Rabbah liturgy 
was read. Penitential prayers were again recited 
but no relief came. On Wednesday, the twenty- 
ninth of the month, on the eve of the New Moon, a 
decree was issued by the court for a fast and each 
group prayed in its own synagogue. The after- 
noon service followed a fast day ritual. That same 
day it became cloudy. On Friday, the second of 
Nisan, towards evening, rain fell. On the Sabbath, 
after midday, great winds and thunder and light- 
ning were followed by much rain and hail which 
affected the fields. Then, no rain fell from that 
day until Sunday night, the third eve of the inter- 
mediate days of Passover, at midnight, when 
much rain fell until the morning.” A blessing for a 
prosperous year concludes this section. 


“After the conquest of the city of Fez by the 
King Muhammad ben Mulay-Abdallah, on Friday 
the twenty-sixth of Av 1760, he brought acannon 
to the Mellah and placed it in the cemetery. He 
told the troops to fill it with gunpowder and to 
shoot it in order to see what distance the missile 
would attain. On Sunday, the New Month of Av, 
the ruler made an inspection of the cannon. When 
he returned home he was welcomed by cheering 
women and he received gifts from the populace. 
On the eve of the New Month of Elul, which was a 
Monday, astorm wind arose and one could almost 
feel the earth quaking. This was followed by 
thunder, lightning, and rain.” The king's tent is 
described as being very big. Another tent of lesser 
size fell from the impact of the storm. More than 
two hundred Al-Wadaya who were imprisoned 
and who subsequently fled, were given amnesty, 




money, and seed for planting by the ruler. Hesent Theruler finally went to Marrakesh and left Mulay 
them to dwell in the environs of Meknés where the Idris in charge. The Jews suffered much at the 
children of the leader were living off brigandage. hands of Mulay Idris.

A Ketubbah from Sefrou in the tradition of the 
Megorashim 




This handwritten Ketubbah (legal marriage 
contract), which is the only one appearing in the 
Bension Collection, was composed in the city of 
Sefrou, Morocco, on the fifth day of the month of 
Nisan, 5603 (1843). The groom’s name is given as 
Abraham the son of Mahlouf and the bride is 
called Esther the daughter of Mordecai. The 
witnesses whose signatures appear on the 
document are Amram Elbaz and Elijah Azulai. The 
total value of the Ketubbah is given as eight 
thousand and eight hundred ugiot. This contract 
stipulates that the groom will never oblige the 
bride to leave the city of Sefrou against her will 
and that he will not take an additional wife unless 
the bride is willing to give her assent. If he violates 
the last two stipulations then he will be obliged to 
pay her the aforementioned sums and he must 
immediately grant her a valid bill of divorce. This 
Ketubbah follows the practices of the community 




A letter by an emissary asking for aid for the 
scholars of Tiberias 




This correspondence is sent by R. David b. 
Abraham Gigi, in the year 1776, to Yauda Franko 




A letter by the emissary R. David Gigi to 
R. Joseph Ha-Kohen 




This letter is written by the emissary R. David b. 
Abraham Gigi to the rabbinic scholar and judge R. 
Joseph Ha-Kohen. The writer informs R. Joseph 
that he suffered a fall from which he is presently 
convalescing in the town of Slieman. [He 
probably fell from his mule which was of the male 
gender. That is why in subsequent letters he is 
insistent that only a mule of the female gender 
should be made available to him for his return 
journey to the Holy Land.] R. David describes the 
treatment he is receiving which consists of 
constantly being bled by a series of physicians 
and this has weakened him considerably. Another 




146 




of Castilian exiles of the city of Fez. 


This Ketubbah was originally pasted on the 
inside cover of the bound manuscript volume of 
The Kelalei ha-Rosh, the responsa collection of R. 
Asher b. Yehiel, which is found in the Bension 
collection [cf. Ms.292.] 


The upper left hand corner of the Kewbpah 
was torn away from the inside corner of the Ms. 
volume Kelalei ha-Rosh; that portion of the 
Ketubbah still remains therein. 


The upper third of the Ketubbah is artfully 
decorated by the process of rubrication. The main 
body of the text of the Ketubbah consists of 
nineteen lines including the signatures of the 
witnesses. The Ketubbah measures 33 x 18 cm. 
Portions of the written text have been affected by 
the depredations of time. 


A package containing correspondences, 
novella, and Midrashic texts composed by the 
emissary of Tiberias, R. Hayyim David b. Abra- 
ham Gigi, and one letter written to him, are now 
presented in the following Mss. 




asking him to extend support to the scholars of 
the community of Tiberias, in the Holy Land. The 
writer's distinctive signature is given at the 
conclusion of the epistle as David b. Abraham 
Gigi. 




form of treatment involves the barbecuing of meat 
which is placed onR. David’s shoulder. During the 
past fifteen days, R. David states, he has been 
staying in the home of R. Judah Balish in Slieman, 
where he is convalescing. 


R. Judah’s father stayed at R. David’s home on 
one occasion for several months and the son, R. 
Judah, is now repaying the kindness. 


R. David states that were it not for his present 
misfortune he would have spent some time at 
the home of R. Solomon Alfasi. The writer asks R. 
Joseph Ha-Kohen to extend himself in behalf of R. 
David and the mission which he serves, by 
collecting some monies that are due. R. David 
would not trouble R. Joseph if he was well. As itis, 
he only relates a small part of the tribulations that 
he suffers.

A list of expenses and calculations composed by

treating his injured hand over a period of three

An emissary requests that a mule should be 
purchased for him 




This letter is written in Judaeo-Arabic to R. 
Abraham ibn Paroz by R. Hayyim David Gigi. The 
latter who serves as an emissary for the communi- 
ty of Tiberias informs R. Abraham that he lacks 
nothing. R. Hayyim asks R. Abraham, however, to 
request of Moses ibn Hayon that he sell him his 
mule since R. Hayyim is accustomed to that 
particular animal, having used it on a previous 
occasion. It would be a favor to R. Hayyim 
because he is going to be obliged to purchase 




R. Hayyim David Gigi inquires of R. Moses Hayon 
whether he will sell him his mule 




R. Hayyim David Gigi is preparing to return to the 
Holy Land after having completed his mission as 
an emissary and he requires a mule. He asks the 
prosperous R. Moses Hayon if he will perform an 
act of kindness by selling a female mule to him for 
this purpose. R. Hayyim is preparing to embark on 
Thursday, therefore, he would like the animal to 




Receipts that the emissary David Gigi composed 
for charitable donations given by the community 
of Kanaya 




R. David Gigi, the emissary of Tiberias, declares 
that the fixed sum of money that was pledged by 
the holy community of Kanaya was paid in full by 
their prosperous members. The members of the 
community have further pledged to give asum of 
money over the next four years which will amount 
to five gerush a year per householder may they be 
doubly rewarded from heaven. The author 




months. The wages he had to pay to one who Ms. 279 




assisted him, are also recorded. Incidental 
expenses for religious articles, food, clothing, and 
other items are noted as well. 


This list is also revealing in that an emissary 
was held accountable for any sum that was spent. 
Therefore exact records had to be kept. 




another animal in any event. The writer states that 
he had acquired two horses but they did not 
satisfy his needs. If Moses refuses to part with the 
animal then the writer asks Abraham to acquire 
another animal from someone else. R. Hayyim 
states that he will arrive on Thursday since the 
campaign (for charity) has gone well in his 
present location. R. Hayyim prefers that a female 
mule should be bought, and figures the price to be 
twelve or thirteen mitkalin. R. Hayyim inquires 
about the well-being of Abraham’s son, Samuel. 
On previous occasions R. Hayyim signed his 
name David, but now he has added the name 
Hayyim to his signature. 




be delivered to him before that day. Upon delivery 
of the animal R. Moses will be paid. If R. Moses 
cannot himself bring that animal, or another 
female mule that would be suitable, then he 
should give the animal to R. Abraham ibn Paroz 
who will deliver it. In his introduction to the letter 
R. Hayyim sends greetings to the distinguished R. 
Aaron Arwaz and to the members of his 
houséhold, as well as to R. Moses Hayon. This 
letter is written in Judaeo-Arabic. 




concludes this receipt with a multitude of 
blessings. [This document was composed and 
signed by the writer David b. Abraham Gigi in 
Kanaya, at the end of the month of Elul 1776.] 
Another receipt states that the emissary of 
Tiberias, R. David Gigi, attests that he received 
from the chosen citizens of the holy community of 
Kanaya and from the hand of the prosperous 
scholar R. Hayyim Kustantin, the sum of one 
hundred gerush. This sum made up the thirty-five 
gerush that was owed according to the previous 
pledge and twenty gerush towards the new

The writer, Mahmoud Zikhri ibn Yahya refers to 
him as the ‘Avrekh’ David Gigi. [The term “Av- 
rekh” is usually bestowed on one who is a young 
scholar.] The writer, who has rendered a decision 
concerning a betrothal contract that is being 
disputed, maintains that it should be adjudged 
in agreement with his view which is in accord 
with Jewish law. If the contract is invalidated

b. Moses is mentioned as in support of the writer’s 
contention. The rumor that declares the docu- 
ments to be faulty and says that the writer took 
a bribe to support its validity, is regarded as too 
much to bear and the violators should be sepa- 
rated from the community (excommunicated). 
Therefore R. Hayyim David is asked to support 
the claim of Reuben b. Mas’Ud for the Ketubbah of 
his daughter which obliges that she shall receive 
sustenance for three years. Isaac b. Judah had

turned away empty-handed. The writer pleads

This letter is written by R. David b. Abraham Gigi, 
from Acco. It is difficult to ascertain to whom this 
letter is written because much of the letter is torn 
away. R. David states that he is again going ona 
mission as an emissary and he prays for divine

months that have passed there has been no

There was a sum of seven uqiot which Joseph 
owed to Judah. If Joseph will take an oath that he 
received this sum from Judah and give that 
amount in payment to the elementary school 
teacher in lieu of tuition fees, then the matter will 
be concluded. If, however, Joseph refuses to do 
this, then he will be obliged to pay it as one who 
received a loan. All other matters outstanding.

R. Hayyim David states that since he could

for the sum of twenty gerush so that they could 
still participate with adjacent communities in 
these important charitable undertakings. The

fulfil an annual pledge of three gerush per annum 
which they will pay to the emissary of Tiberias 
who will come to collect it. The emissary’s

A copy of the text of a Halakhic query sent by R. 
Abraham Laredo of Gibraltar and the response 
thereto 




One day, Reuben, who was ill and bedridden, 
sent for the wealthy Simeon and for some others 
and related to them that when he was financially 
well off many years ago, two Ashkenazi Jews 
stayed with him leaving money in the sum of 
four thousand darham for safekeeping. They 
stipulated that if they returned then the money 
should be given to them, but if not then the money 
should be utilized for some religious purpose. The 
Ashkenazi gentlemen never returned. In the 
course of time, Reuben said, he lost his wealth 
and the aforementioned money was mixed 
together with his own, now all of which was spent. 
Subsequently, however, he managed to put some 
money aside, and now he would like Simeon to 
administer a special fund of four thousand dar- 
ham, which is to be invested, and any dividend 
income used to maintain Torah scholars and a 
house of study in the city of Rabat. 


The writer, R. Abraham Laredo, states that he 
was concerned as to what form the act of 
possession should take when Simeon received 
the money from Reuben. The symbolic form of 
affirming possession by the handing over of an 
object from one to the other of the contracting 
parties, called halifin, which is also referred to as 
‘Kinyan Sudar,’ would not be applicable in this 
case, for this procedure involved the transference 
of actual money to which the procedure for 
acquiring objects did not apply. Furthermore, in 
order to ensure the acquisition by transference of 
ownership through the use of an object, the 
governmental authorites would have to record the 
sale and this would only lengthen the procedure 
and would require additional expense. The writer 
therefore decided that Reuben should transmit 
the money directly to Simeon and thereby obviate 
all the aforementioned procedures and dif- 
ficulties. This had been agreed to by Reuben and 
Simeon. 


A technical problem had arisen, since the 
money was hidden in the sides of a box and 
because it was not easy to remove the money it 




150 




had been decided that Simeon should pick up the 
box. There was more money in the box than the 
four thousand darham and Reuben was asked if 
this money, as well should be used for the 
establishment of the academy, to which he replied 
in the affirmative. The aforementioned transac- 
tion was duly recorded. Reuben also stipulated 
that his other properties should be used to 
support his wife and his daughter and if these 
properties came to be exhausted then the wife 
and daughter should share in the dividends of the 
four thousand darham that was designated for 
the scholars. This transaction took place in the 
spring of the year 1841. 


A few days after the aforementioned transac- 
tion took place, Reuben reneged. He demanded 
that Simeon return the box and the money to him, 
and maintained that he had previously promised 
to pay his father-in-law a sum of money that they 
had both agreed upon. However, since he did not 
have the money at that time, it was incorporated 
into the additional sum that was stipulated in his 
wife’s marriage contract. Therefore, he was now 
obliged to make that money available to his wife. 
Simeon was not moved by Reuben’s claim. 
Shortly thereafter the scribes of the non-Jewish 
governmental courts informed Simeon that if he 
did not return the box and the money to Reuben 
immediately then the authorities would seize all 
his household goods and he would be imprisoned 
for theft since the transaction (which was not 
affirmed by the non-Jewish authorities) was 
performed in an unofficial manner. Simeon, who 
was sufficiently frightened, returned the money 
and the box to Reuben, who died thereafter. 


R. Abraham Laredo who supervised the 
aforementioned transaction and recorded all the 
details now composes several queries pertaining 
to this case for which he awaits a reply. One is: did 
Reuben have the right to renege on his original 
commitment and if so, did he also have the right to 
the additional amounts over the four thousand 
darham? Does the wife take precedence in 




collecting for her marriage contract or not? 




. R. Abraham Laredo adds the following before 
he concludes his query. He states that anything 
that he records relating to this case should not be 
regarded as testimony since he writes what he 




recollects and there is a measure of doubt in his 
report. He notes that he did not see the actual 
transmission of the money between the parties to 
the transaction, only the handing over of the box. 
R. Abraham regards himself as the student of the 
anonymous authority to whom he directs this 
query. This query is dated at Jebel Tor (Gibraltar) 
in the month of Sivan 1841.

A manuscript volume of R. Asher B. Yehiel’s 
responsa known as Kelalei Ha-Rosh 




The manuscript volume Kelalei Ha-Rosh, which 
was composed by R. Asher b. Yehiel, is a unique 
compilation since it bridges the cultures of the 
Franco-German Tosaphist schools of Ashkenazic 
Jewry and the Spanish halakhic system of the 
Sephardim at the beginning of the fourteenth 
century. R. Asher had enjoyed a distinguished 
career as a rabbinic leader in Germany before R. 
Solomon ibn Adret welcomed him to Barcelona. 
Subsequently, R. Asher served as rabbi in Toledo. 
He joined the anti-philosophic camp of the 
Talmudic traditionalists and supported R. 
Solomon ibn Adret’s ban on the study of 
philosophy by anybody under the age of twenty- 
five. 


The manuscript volume of the Kelalei ha- 




Rosh, which is written in Sephardic Mashait 




script, was probably located at one time in Sefrou, 
Morocco since a marriage contract from that city, 
dated 1843, was found pasted in the inside cover 
of this work [cf. Ms.276]. The text of this manu- 
script volume follows to a certain extent the 
text of the first printed Constantinople edition of 
1522 which consists of one hundred and eight 
chapters, numbering one thousand responsa. 
The manuscript volume commences with chapter 
four in the middle of law twenty-one, as the first 
four chapters are missing. The text that is extant 
contains one hundred and sixty-seven pages, and

responsa known as Teshuvot Ha-Rashba 




The appearance of two manuscript volumes of 
Responsa in the Bension collection, namely, the 
Kelalei Ha-Rosh (Ms.292) and the Teshuvot 




The anonymous scholar notes at the outset of 
his response that this matter has not yet been 
brought to litigation by the descendants of 
Reuben, yet he feels obliged to deal with the 
controversy to satisfy the query of the scholar R. 
Abraham and the wealthy Simeon. [While we 
possess twelve pages of response there are 
indications that more pages were written. ] 




is written on folios a and b. The text concludes 
with chapter ninety, the laws of Pledges, law 
number six. There is no colophon. The manu- 
script volume can be dated c. the fifteenth cen- 
tury. There are thirty-three lines to a page and 
the size of each page is 39 x 22 cm. The text is 
written on vellum. While no pagination is given the 
heading on each page notes the particular section 
and law that is being discussed on that page. 




The copyist added texts in the margins of the 




manuscript. These notes were originally com- 
posed by R. Asher b. Yehiel and they provide 
additional material, some of which do not appear 
in the printed editions. The additional texts 
appear on pages 66; 86; 11a [is incorporated in the 
printed edition]; 13a [is incorporated in the 
printed edition at the end of Kelal “Yud’-“Aleph” 
p. 146, but in a truncated version while the Ms. 
contains a more complete text]; 72a [is incor- 
porated in the published edition on p. 41a and b]; 
page 101a [is incorporated in page 54b and 55a of 
the published work, but in chapter 58 instead of 
chapter 57, see below]; and 133a. The arrange- 
ment of the Kelalim (chapters) differ in the Ms. 
version and the published edition. Thus, chapter 
57 in the Ms. volume is chapter 58 in the pub- 
lished edition. The variants between the manu- 
script and the published edition, as well as the 
change in the order of chapter classification, 
including additional elements that appear in the 
Ms. volume, make it a valuable addition to the field 
of responsa literature. 




ha-Rashba (Ms.293), makes it characteristic 
of its time and place, since the early masters of 
Sephardic culture prepared many such collec- 
tions for their own scholarly needs. This effort 
which began in Spain was perpetuated by North 
African scholars who copied earlier collections

Ms. 292 




Ms. 293 




of Responsa while also making original con- 
tributions to the field. 


R. Solomon ben Abraham ibn Adret (1235- 
c.1310) served as rabbi in Barcelona for more 
than four decades. His scholarly acumen gained 
him a reputation while he was still a young man 
and queries in matters of Jewish law were sent 
to him from all the countries of Europe, North 
Africa, and the Middle East. R. Solomon's corre- 
spondences exceeded ten thousand responsa. 
This well preserved corpus on Jewish law left 
its imprint on the Codes known as Shulhan Arukh. 


This new collection of Adret’s responsa (Ms. 
293) is a welcome addition to other collections 
of his responsa that are presently extant. The text 
was written in Sephardic mashait script. In the 
absence of any colophon it could probably be 
dated as a product of pre-expulsion Spain c. the 
fifteenth century. There are sixty-seven pages 
and the writing appears on folios a and b, apart 
from the Index. There are thirty-four lines on 
each folio. The work commences with an Index of 
seventeen pages and thirty-four folios, which 
records the subject of each responsum. Although 
the first three sections, and a part of the fourth 
section of the Index are deleted, the major portion 
of the Index which originally contained twenty- 
five sections, referred to as “Batim,” houses, is 
extant. The fact that the first chapters of the Index 
are missing is not a great loss since the contents 
of these sections are given in their entirety in the 
main body of the text. The main body of the text is 




given plenum only until Dinei Shkhiv-Me’ra, part © 




of responsum number four. The main sections will 
now be presented, along with the numbers of 
those responsa which do not appear in the 
published editions of the Rashba’s responsa.

The Index which is written in double columns 
on each folio enumerates one thousand and 
thirty-nine responsa which originally comprised 
this collection. Two hundred and fifty responsa 
are given plenum with pagination. These extant 
responsa are valuable because their variant 
readings, when compared to the published 
responsa, are very illuminating in helping to 
establish a critical text. 


It is probable that Ariel Bension, the compiler 
of this entire collection, penned the correspond- 
ing citations in the margins of the pages of this 
manuscript indicating where the _ particular 
responsum can be found in the published edition 
of the same work. A similar script appears at the 
beginning of the first page of the Yalkut Roiim. It is 
important to note that the sequence of the 
responsa in the manuscript volume is entirely 
different from that of the published editions.

the sixteenth century. In 1543 R. Ishmael felt 
obliged to leave Tunis because of the difficult 
political situation that had developed there and 
made his way to Egypt where he served as chief 
rabbi. The synagogue which R. Ishmael fre- 
quented in Egypt subsequently became known as

the Tanuji synagogue. 


R. Ishmael completed his work, Sefer ha- 
Zikkaron in Egypt upon his arrival, in 1543. The 
author formulated this work as a Code of Law by 
classifying the halakhic rulings which he ex- 
trapolated from the text of the Talmud according 
to the order of the Tractates In his introduction to 
his work the author states “| desired to compose a 
concise digest of all the laws that pertain to our 
times [thereby excluding those laws which would 
pertain to the practices during the days when a 
Temple would be established] that are found 
in the Talmud according to the order of the 
Tractates. This digest should serve as an intro- 
duction to the Talmud and the legal decisions 
rendered by the Rif, [R. Isaac Alfasi of the elev- 
enth century].” The author became aware of the 




A manuscript collection of fragments of 
Maimonides’ commentary on the Mishnah 




R. Moses b. Maimon (1135-1204) composed his 
Commentary on the Mishnah, during the early 
years of his scholarly career. It was his intention 
to present the basic principles of the various 
halakhic topics discussed in the Talmudic Trac- 
tates and their rulings for those who might find the 
rambling discussions of the Talmud too difficult 
to follow. In his introductions to the various trac- 
tates he launched into theological formulations 
which could serve as a guide to the general reader 
in an age when polemic forced the various faith 
systems to present their beliefs in a concise and 
orderly fashion. Thus, the Jew would be able 
to respond to a wide range of questions such 
as the Judaic view on an afterlife, the concept 
of God, the psychological function of ethics, and 
the role of prophecy and revelation, among other 
topics which were discussed in the age of belief. 


In his design of the Commentary on the 
Mishnah one could already discern the begin- 
nings of the formulation of Maimonides’ later 
works such as his halakhic code called “Mishneh 
Torah” and his philosophic magnum opus, 
“Guide of the Perplexed.” Throughout his works 
concise definition of terms and classification of 
topics are his hallmark. In his introduction to the 
tractate on ethics called “Avot,” Ethics of the

tioned that work in his manuscript. 


The text of the Sefer ha-Zikkaron which is 
found in the Bension collection is a copy of the 
first printed edition of this work. According to the 
colophon it was published in Ferrara, on a 
Tuesday, the twenty-sixth day of Av 1555 by the 
publisher Abraham ibn Usque, Sefardi. R. Judah 
Doron aided in the production of this work. The 
ruler of the duchy is noted to be Don Herculi 
Diasti. No pagination is given and the first part of 
the work is missing. The book commences with 
the laws which conclude the first chapter of the 
Tractate Megillah. The rest of the work is 
complete. The size of a page is 19.2 x 14cm. The 
Original cover and binding of the book appears 
to be intact. 




Fathers, Maimonides attempts to harmonize 
Aristotelian ethical thought with Talmudic ethical 
teachings. 


Maimonides completed his commentary to the 
Mishnah, called Siraj, in 1168, at the age of thirty- 
three. 


The fragments that comprise the manuscript 
of Maimonides’ Commentary on the Mishnah 
which are found in the Bension Collection 
[Ms.295] consist of twenty-eight pages, folios 
a and b, and they are written in Temanic Mashait 
script. Many of the pages are in a damaged 
condition. There is no colophon available and no 
pagination is given. There are generally about 
twenty-six lines to a folio. The script is large and 
clear and the average size of the letters of each 
word is one-half centimeter. The length of each 
page is twenty-three centimeters with a width of 
eighteen centimeters, except where the pages are 
truncated. On the whole the texts that are 
presented are legible except where the pages 
are torn or perforated. The Commentary which 
follows each Mishnah is written in Judaeo-Arabic. 
The fragments can be regarded as having been 
written in the fourteenth century. The following 
are the contents of the available texts. [Albeck’s 
edition of the Mishnah was used as the basis for 
numbering the respective Mishnayot.] 




Tractate Shabbat 


Chapter one commences with the commentary to 
the first Mishnaic text, while the page containing 
the Mishnah text itself is missing. In chapter one, 
Mishnayot two to four inclusive are given. The 
concluding portion of the first chapter is also 
given. No introduction is available to the Order of 
Mo’ed in this collection. The fragments contain 
pointillation for the Mishnah text up to chapter 
seven. 


Chapter two contains Mishnayot one, two, 
five, six, and seven, with the commentary given. 


Chapter three contains only the text of Mish- 
nah six and its commentary. 


Chapter four appears to be given in its greater 
part. Mishnah one is given complete with com- 
mentary but the commentary on Mishnah two is 
truncated. 


Chapter five is almost entirely deleted except 
for some concluding lines of the commentary to 
the last Mishnah text of that chapter. 


Chapter six is given in full with the entire 
commentary. 


Chapter seven is given almost in its entirety 
except for a few concluding lines of the commen- 
tary to the last Mishnah. 


Chapter eight has the first four Mishnayot 
missing. The last portion of the commentary to 
the fourth Mishnah is available followed by 
Mishnayot five, six, and seven which conclude the 
chapter. 


Chapter nine commences with the first Mis- 
hnah and its commentary, but Mishnayot two and 
three and their commentaries are missing. A few 
concluding lines of the Commentary to Mishnah 
three are available, followed by Mishnayot four to 
seven inclusive, with commentary. The lines of 
the commentary to the seventh Mishnah are badly 
blurred. 


Chapter ten is given in full, except that 
Mishnah five appears as two Mishnayot in the 
manuscript. 


Chapter eleven also appears in its entirety. 
Diagrams are provided in the commentary to the 
second Mishnah. The third and fourth Mishnayot 
are combined in the third Mishnah of the 
manuscript edition. 


Chapter twelve is given in full, but the fifth 
Mishnah is very blurred except for the last line. 




Chapter thirteen is also given in full except that 
part of the fourth Mishnah is partly missing and 
the writing is blurred. No more text is available on 
the Tractate Shabbat. 




Tractate Yoma [Dealing with legislation per- 
taining to the Day of Atonement.] 


Several pages of fragments on the Tractate Yoma 
are found in the collection. There are, however, no 
texts available of the first four chapters. 


The first fragments on Yoma commence with 
chapter five where Mishnayot one and two appear 
as one Mishnah. Otherwise chapter five appears 
in its entirety; parts of the pages however, are 
torn, perforated, or blurred. 


Chapter six is complete except that the final 
passages of the eighth Mishnah commenced with 
the words “Rabbi Ishmael” were deleted by the 
copyist and then restored in the left hand column 
in a different script. 


Chapter seven is given in full. The fourth and 
fifth Mishnayot are combined in one text. 
Maimonides provides, in his commentary to the 
last Mishnah, a diagram of the sequence in which 
the names of the tribes appear on the stones of the 
Ephod. 


Chapter eight has, as the only text available in 
the Tractate of Yoma, the concluding (ninth) 
Mishnah and commentary prefaced by some of 
the lines which conclude the commentary to the 
eighth Mishnah. The upper portion of this text is 
blurred and a portion of it is torn away; there are 
also perforations. 


The Tractate Yoma is concluded with the 
benediction “Barukh Notain Laya-aif Ko’ah U-le- 
ain Onim Ozmah Yarbeh.”—“Blessed be He who 
gives strength to the weary and to the powerless 
He imparts much might.” Excluding the first word 
(Barukh) the rest of the text is a passage from 
Isaiah 40:29. This blessing is also given in Judaeo- 
Arabic. Folio b of this page commences with the 
Tractate Sukkah. 




Tractate Sukkah [Laws pertaining to the con- 
struction of booths for the festival of Taber- 
nacles. ] 


The first Mishnah of the first chapter of the 
Tractate Sukkah is given with the commentary 
which contains diagrams pertaining to the 




155 




Pr. 296 




construction of a Sukkah. The Mishnah is blurred 
and perforated, and a portion of the text is torn 
away. 




Tractate Ta’anit 


The available fragment from the Tractate Ta’anit 
contains the commentary to the first Mishnah of 
the fourth chapter followed by the second and 
third Mishnayot, including their commentary. The 
third Mishnah is divided into two Mishnayot in the 




An early printed edition of the Tur Shulhan Arukh, 
Yoreh De’ah. This is an incunable and a unicum. 




R. Jacob ben Asher, more popularly known by his 
major work “The Arba’ah Turim,” or “The Ba’al 
ha-Turim,” arrived in Spain from Germany [c.f. 
Ms.292] at the beginning of the fourteenth cen- 
tury with his scholarly father R. Asher ben Yehiel, 
R. Jacob was concerned that individual Jews and 
communities should be guided by the corpus of 
halakha, Jewish law, in all their activities. In order 
to facilitate his aim, because he found that the 
available works on Jewish law were unsatisfac- 
tory, he formulated the whole field of Jewish law 
into a code which contained four subdivisions. 


Volume |, which he designated as Orah Hay- 
yim, in 697 chapters sets forth the laws dealing 
with daily duties of Jews and the legislation 
pertaining to blessings, prayers, holidays, fasts, 
and the Sabbath day. 


Volume II, Yoreh De’ah, contains 408 chapters 
which deal with legal decisions pertaining to ritual 
law. In the purview of ritual law are such subjects 
as the dietary laws, mourning for the dead and 
their preparation for burial, organic deficiencies 
in animals which prohibit them for human 
consumption, laws on usury, the menstrual cycle, 
and many other topics. 


Volume lil, Even ha-Ezer, deals with laws 
involving the legal relationships between men and 
women, such as marriage and divorce, and 
contains 178 chapters. 


Volume IV, Hoshen Mishpat, is a corpus on all 
matters pertaining to civil law.

manuscript fragment. The first part of the third 
Mishnah is almost entirely obliterated and the 
upper part of the text is torn away. No other texts 
from the Tractate Ta’anit are extant in this 
collection of Mishnaic fragments. . 


Variant readings are noted when _ the 
manuscript fragments of Maimonides’ Commen- 
tary on the Mishnah are compared to the texts of 
the printed editions on the same work. 




The printed edition of the Tur, Yoreh De’ah, 
which is available in the Bension Collection is 
from the late fifteenth century. The first part of 
the work is missing and itcommences in the midst 
of chapter fifteen. Chapter sixteen is designated 
by the letters “Yud” and “Vav.” The volume 
concludes with chapter 298, the Law of Orlah. In 
some editions the Law of Orlah is recorded under 
chapter 294. This discrepancy can be explained 
by the fact that the Spanish editions of the Tur, 
Yoreh De’ah, follow one Ms. tradition while the 
Ashkenazi tradition follows a different Ms. text 
which was used by the Jewish printers in Italy, 
as may be noted when one examines the Soncino 
edition of 1490. 


The size of a page is 30 x 21.5 cm. No pagina- 
tion is given. There are thirty-six lines to a page 
with two columns to each folio. While the work is 
sewn together the book’s covers are missing. 
No colophon is available and both the beginning 
pages and those at the end of the book are miss- 
ing. The publisher used Sephardi Mashait type 
except at the beginning of new chapters and 
paragraphs when Sephardi Square type is used. 
This type differs from that in the Guadalajara 
edition of 1482 by the publisher Solomon ibn Al- 
Kabiz, and from that of Eliezer Atlantansi’s Ixar 
edition of 1487. While the latter was produced 
in long lines rather than double columns, it con- 
forms in all other respects with the layout of the 
text in the Bension Collection edition. The source 
of both works appears to be the same Ms. Unlike 
the Italian editions, which contain 403 chapters, 
the Sephardic Text contains 408 chapters. 




A first edition of the Sefer Abudarham, 
Lisbon, 1489. 




R. David b. Joseph Abudarham was a Spanish 
rabbinic author of the early fourteenth century 
who was concerned about the lack of understan- 
ding, by his co-religionists, of prayer, it origins, 
and its structure. He therefore wrote his commen- 
tary on Jewish liturgy which traced the origin of 
prayer to its Talmudic and Gaonic sources. He 
explained ritual procedures and elaborated on the 
meaning of various prayers. His works cited 
the following authorities who wrote on the sub- 
ject of prayer, such as the author of the Manhig, 
R. Abraham ben Nathan ha-Yarhi of Lunel, R. 
Asher ben Yehiel, and the latter's son R. Jacob, 
author of the Turim, who was contemporaneous 
to R. David, among other authorities. 


R. David was also perceptive in his discern- 
ment of the various traditions that were 
perpetuated by different communities. The Sefer 
Abudarham was completed in Seville in 1340. 
Appended to the work were a section explaining 




A manuscript volume of Samuel Ibn Tibbon’s 
Hebrew translation of Maimonides’ “Guide of the 
Perplexed,” known as Moreh Nevukhim 




Maimonides, the luminary of Jewish scholarship 
during the twelfth century, is represented in the 
Bension Collection by two of his works. His 
halakhic work is represented by fragments of 
his Commentary to the Mishnah [cf. Ms.295]. 
Moses b. Maimon as philosopher is represented 
by his magnum opus which was originally written 
in Arabic as Dalalat al-Ha’rin, “Guide of the Per- 
plexed.” It appears in the Bension Collection in 
the Hebrew translation of Samuel Ibn Tibbon 
entitled “Moreh Nevukhim.” The fact that Mai- 
monides prepared most of his major works in 
Arabic is indicative of the familiarity that Jews 
had with that language in the twelfth century, 
apart from the fact that Maimonides’ literary 
activity was produced in Islamic lands, namely, 
Spain, North Africa, and Egypt. 


Moses ben Maimon, after studying Aristoteli- 




the various benedictions, calendrical tables, anda 
commentary on the Passover Haggadan. The first 
edition was published in Lisbon in 1489. The 
edition in the Bension Collection is a copy of 
the first edition, and an incunable. Another copy 
was recently acquired for the Jacob M. Lowy 
Collection in the National Library, Ottawa. The 
work is preserved almost in its entirety. Each 
page measures 29.5 cm in length and 19.5 cm 
in width. No pagination is given. The author’s 
introduction and the first two sections designated 
as ha-Sha’ar ha-Rishon and ha-Sha’ar ha-Sheni 
are missing. These sections discuss the time of 
the performance of the Sh’ma and the institution 
of prayer, respectively. 


The first few pages of the Sha’ar ha-Shlishi, 
which deals with the laws concerning blessings 
recited upon the performance of commandments, 
are also deleted. At the conclusion of the book, 
Tables of Calculations are given. 


This is the second book printed in Lisbon; 
an edition of Nahmanides’ Biblical Commentary 
preceded it by a few months. 




an philosophy, felt his Jewish faith, which is 
based on God’s revelation of Himself to man, 
confronted by the challenge of knowledge, which 
is based on human reasoning. Moses Maimonides 
tried to meet the challenge by seeking ways of 
achieving a reconciliation between the systems 
of faith and reason. Similar efforts at reconcilia- 
tion were attempted by Muslim theologian-phi- 
losophers and by Christian scholastics who 
followed Maimonides, such as Thomas Aquinas, 
who is known to have been influenced by him. 
Maimonides devoted portions of the “Guide” 
to presenting a philosophic interpretation of 
scripture, defining terms related to God in scrip- 
ture, and discussing the problems of God's unity 
and Divine attributes, the proof of God’s exist- 
ence, unity and incorporeality; theories on crea- 
tion, the nature of prophecy, evil, and Divine 
Providence; and finally a substantial section dis- 
cussing the reasons for the biblical command- 
ments. While Maimonides made a valiant effort 
to achieve the sought-after reconciliation be- 
tween religion and philosophy he paid a price 




157 




Pr. 297 




Ms. 298 




for engaging in that pursuit. He was seduced 
by the Aristotelian view of ethics which placed 
the subject in a subordinate role. For Maimonides, 
as for Aristotle, morality is only the third perfec- 
tion, while the dianoetic virtues are for them the 
fourth and highest perfection. Thus does Mai- 
monides state in the concluding chapter of the 
“Guide,” 11:54, “The third type of perfection is 
more closely connected with man himself... It 
includes moral perfection, the highest degree 
of excellency in man’s character. Most of the 
precepts aim at producing this perfection; but 
even this kind is only a preparation for another 
perfection... The fourth kind of perfection is the 
true perfection of man; the possession of the 
highest intellectual faculties; the possession of 
such notions which lead to true metaphysical 
opinions as regards God.” 


Fortunately, among the post-Maimonidean 
philosophers of the thirteenth century, Shem Tob 
ibn Palqera refused to accept Maimonides’ view 
on ethics even though he defended the latter’s 
approach, which sought to achieve a reconcilia- 
tion of revelation with reason. After all, the God of 
biblical tradition revealed Himself as the activator 
of mercy and grace, and not as the detached Mind 
thinking thoughts. Thus Palqera, who was 
primarily an ethical and a pedagogic philosopher 
in the authentic Judaic tradition, would not permit 
himself to be seduced by Aristotelianism on this 
vital point. Even Maimonides felt the tension of 
the biblical ethical protest pitted against sterile 
intellectualism when he stated, (Mishneh Torah, 
hilkhot De’ot, 5:1), “The scholar must be 
recognizable by his activities.” 


The manuscript volume of the Moreh contains 
one hundred and fifty pages and three hundred 
folios, two columns to a page and thirty lines to 
each column, which are written on vellum in 
Provengal-Sephardic Mashait script, of pre- 
expulsion Spain. The largest complete page 
measures 29.8 x 23.5cm. However, since the work 
was written on vellum even the measurements of 
complete pages vary. Where the pages are not 
torn as a result of wear or decay, they have been 
cut away to be utilized as writing material. Many 
pages were cut almost to the bottom line or 
margin of the text. No pagination is given. The 
work commences with Samuel ibn Tibbon’s 




158 




Thesaurus of Philosophic Terms which consists 
of twenty pages. The first four introductory pages 
to ibn Tibbon’s Thesaurus are missing, as well as 
the following sections of the alphabetical terms: 
from the term “Kamut” at the end of letter “Khaf” 
to the term “Kotev” in the section of the letter 
“Koof.” The remaining terms classified under the 
letters “Raish,” “Shin,” and “Tof” are complete. 


The aforementioned text concludes with anew 
paragraph consisting of four lines which are 
written in Maaravic Cursive script wherein the 
following is stated: 


“Il composed this section [The Thesaurus] ona 
ship which was located four miles from the coast 
of Al-Akliba and a distance of one and one-half 
day’s travel from Tunis, on my journey from 
Alexandria [Egypt], in the month of Tammuz, in 
the year 4973 from creation [1213], may the 
Almighty return our group in peace to our city and 
our homes.” 


We often dismiss the translator as merely the 
secondhand instrument of the author of the 
original text. This attitude towards translators, 
especially one of the caliber of Samuel ibn 
Tibbon, must be dispelled. After Maimonides had 
composed the “Moreh” in Arabic, R. Jonathan ha- 
Kohen of Lunel approached Samuel ibn Tibbon 
asking him to render a service to the scholars of 
the Provence by translating the “Moreh” into 
Hebrew. Although Samuel possessed excellent 
credentials as a translator (he was the son and 
student of the master translator Judah ibn 
Tibbon) he still approached the task of translating 
Maimonides’ “Moreh” with trepidation. The 
Hebrew language had to be recast to express 
philosophical terms which were the products of a 
culture that was foreign to medieval Judaism until 
that time. Not only the translator but the Hebrew 
language was put to a severe test. 


Samuel ibn Tibbon maintained personal 
communication with Maimonides so that the 
author could clarify his intended meaning for the 
benefit of the translator. Finally, Samuel 
journeyed to Egypt to receive Maimonides 
personal confirmation of his work. Fourteen days 
before the demise of Maimonides, on November 
30, 1204, the translation was completed at Arles. A 
cataclysmic revolution commenced as ibn Tib- 
bon’s translated work was rapidly disseminated. It

became an instant best-seller as it served as fuel 
for the conflagration which burst out between 
traditional conservatives and those who were 
adherents of a liberal intellectualist tradition in 
the Jewish and, subsequently, the Christian faith 
systems. The Dominicans officially consigned the 
“Moreh” to the flames at Paris. Thereafter, the 
Dominican Thomas Aquinas enhanced the value 
of the “Moreh” in scholastic circles. While Samuel 
ibn Tibbon was engaged in his meticulous effort 
to produce a precise translation, Judah Al-Harizi 
was urged to offer his Hebrew translation of the 
“Moreh.” The latter’s work was notas technical an 
effort as was that of ibn Tibbon. 


It may be that Samuel ibn Tibbon realized that 
his more technical language might be an obstacle 
to the serious student who was unfamiliar with the 
nuances of philosophical Hebrew terminology 
that he had devised, so he attempted to remedy 
the situation by offering a Thesaurus of Philo- 
sophical terms as an aid to the reader. Thus, we 
are informed in his concluding paragraph, after 
the Thesaurus, that he completed it in the year 
1213; 


We noted above that the script of the con- 
cluding paragraph to the Thesaurus was written 
in Maaravic Cursive script while the main body of 
the text before and after this paragraph, which 
serves as a colophon to the Thesaurus, was 
written in Provengal-Sephardic Mashait script. 
This oddity can be explained in the following 
manner. We often use a Cursive script and sud- 
denly we switch to a square script. This same 
technique was practiced by the copyist. Before 
the expulsion from Spain there was no clear 
distinction in the writing style between those 
Sephardic Jews who lived on either side of the 
Strait of Gibraltar and Provengal Jewry. When 
subsequently the cultural connection was sev- 
ered the Jews indigenous to each geographic 
location developed their own peculiar writing 
styles. One could be tempted to speculate that 
since ibn Tibbon was from the Provence, he might 
have been the copyist of the manuscript, es- 




160 




pecially since he states in the concluding para- 
graph to the Thesaurus, “I composed this 
section,” instead of the usual “Samuel ibn Tibbon 
said.” Furthermore, why would the copyist 
change the nature of the script unless he was, 
indeed, Samuel ibn Tibbon, who desired to 
personalize the text? If we accept this theory then 
this manuscript would have to be dated as early 
as 1213. However, since this is improbable, we 
must at least conclude that this manuscript dates 
from the period of pre-expulsion Spain. How- 
ever, the mystery concerning the change of script 
remains. 


Samuel ibn Tibbon’s preface to the work 
which follows the problematic four lines is now 
written by the copyist in the same script with 
which he began the Thesaurus of Philosophical 
Terms. This preface is given almost in its entirety 
with only the last few lines missing. The last part 
of Maimonides’ Introduction to the Moreh, in 
Hebrew translation, is also available on two 
pages. The next section commences with almost 
the entire first part of the Moreh, chapters 1 to 76. 
Chapters 14, 15, 16 of Part One are missing in 
their entirety, and half of chapter 46. While most 
of the pages are intact and they are sewn together, 
some pages have been severely torn. At the end 
of chapter thirty of the First Part, a note is given 
by the copyist which does not appear in printed 
editions of the Moreh. It consists of twelve lines 
which were written in a similar but smaller size 
script than that which is available in the main 
body of the text. This note appears in the main 
body of the text, not in the margin. The following 
chapters are missing in Part Two of the Moreh— 
chapters 8, 9, and 10; otherwise Part Two is 
complete. Sections of chapters 21, 24, and 50, 
and chapters 52, 53, and 54 in their entirety, are 
missing from Part Three. Variants are noted 
throughout the text when it is compared with the 
printed edition. No colophon other than the para- 
graph after the Thesaurus is available. While 
many of the pages are bound together, other 
pages are severed from the text.

An early printed edition of the homiletic work 
called Menorat ha-Ma’or 




R. Isaac Aboab was a noted rabbinic author and 
preacher who lived towards the end of the 
fourteenth century. His major literary achieve- 
ment was the Menorat ha-Ma’ér, which is to this 
day among the most popular ethico-Aggadic 
works of Judaism. This work has undergone more 
than seventy editions, with the first edition 
published in Constantinople in 1514 and the latest 
Hebrew edition published in Jerusalem in 1961. 
The Menorat ha-Ma’or was subsequently 
translated into Spanish, Ladino, Yiddish, and 
German. Preachers and study groups in syn- 
agogues found this work to be an indispensable 
source of aggadic material and a basic text for 
ethical instruction. 


The author sought to restore Aggada to its 
rightful place as an essential part of rabbinic 
tradition. Until his own time only the legal materi- 
al of the Talmudic tradition, known as Halakha, 
was deemed a necessary object of study for 
Jewish survival. Thus, it was his desire to com- 
pose the kind of structured work for Aggada 
which would oblige scholars to notice its intrinsic 
value. R. Isaac utilized the symbol of the seven- 




A volume of the printed edition of the biblical 
commentary Zuf Devash 




The volume known as Zuf Devash is acompilation 
of four works of biblical commentary by R. Vidal I 
Ha-Sarfati (1631-1703) of Fez, the son of R. Isaac 
Ha-Sarfati and the grandson of Vidal | Ha-Sarfati. 
[The Encyclopaedia Judaica, 14:879, Jerusalem 
1973, is in error when it ascribes the authorship of 
Zuf Devash to Vidal I.] The first work, Zuf Devash, 
is acommentary on the Pentateucnh. It appears on 
pages 1 to 19. The second work which appears on 
pages 19 to 32 is entitled Megilat Setarim, a 
commentary on the Scroll of Esther. The third 
work is Ha-Za’at Rut, acommentary on the Scroll 
of Ruth, which is found on pages 32 to 42. A fourth 
work by R. Vidal Il Ha-Sarfati, called Ozar 
Nehmad, a commentary on the Psalms, is found 
on pages 42 to 60. 




branched candlestick of the biblical Tabernacle 
as the central image of his work, which in English 
translation means “Candlestick of Light.” 


R. Isaac Aboab provided a special service to 
scholars by making available to them passages 




from aggadic works which are no longer extant’ 




and by citing from variants of Talmudic and 
Midrashic texts which were utilized in the 
Spanish-North African schools and which 
differed from those texts used by scholars of the 
Franco-German tradition. R. lsaac Aboab was 
eclectic in his use of sources. He utilized texts 
from the rational philosophic tradition as well as 
from the halakhic and mystical traditions. Among 
the authors from whose works he quoted we have 
Alfasi, Rashi, the Tosafists, Abraham ibn Ezra, 
Maimonides, Abraham ibn David, Jacob Anatoli, 
Nahmanides, Solomon ibn Adret, Abudarham 
Bahya’s Hovot ha-Levavot, Joseph Gikatilla’s 
Sha’arei Orah, Asher b. Yehiel, and Jacob b. 
Asher’s Tur. Aboab’s use of sources belies his 
own world view which appears to have been 
syncretic, since he co-mingles Kabbalistic views 
with philosophic notions. Religious practices 
were also explained in his moralistic work. 


The Menorat ha-Ma’or in the Bension Collec- 
tion is a complete printed volume of the 1623 
Venice edition. 




Another work which appears at the end of this 
volume was composed by R. Aaron Sarfati, a 
grandson of the author R. Vidal Il Ha-Sarfati. The 
title of the work is Misgav ha-Imahot, a commen- 
tary on Eshet Ha’Yil, the Woman of Valor, which is 
found on pages 60 to 65. Another grandson of R. 
Vidal Il, who was a noted scholar, was R. Samuel 
Ha-Sarfati, author of the work Sefer Nimukei 
Shmuel. 


The manuscript of the work Zuf Devash which 
was published in Amsterdam in the year 1718, was 
brought to that city by R. Isaac b. R. Joseph 
Bueno De Mosquita. He came to Amsterdam 
which was a center of scholarship to pursue his 
studies. This information is made available in the 
colophon to the work. The publisher was R. 
Solomon b. Joseph Kohen-Zedek Proops. The 
work was published two columns to a folio and 
contains sixty-five pages.

A manuscript fragment of Nahmanides’ biblical 
commentary on the Decalogue 




R. Moses b. Mahman (1194-1270), who was also 
known as the Ramban, was born in Gerona in the 
province of Catalonia, Spain where he maintained 
an academy. R. Moses was proficient in many 
scholarly fields but his special renown was 
established in the fields of Kabbala, biblical 
exegesis, and in Jewish law. R. Moses was 
acknowledged as the leading halakhic authority 
of his age, and one of his most outstanding 
students was R. Solomon ibn Adret of Barcelona 
[cf. Ms.293). 


Nahmanides is the latinized form of R. Moses’ 
name. He composed his biblical commentary 
when he was advanced in years. While most of the 
work was completed in Spain, the finishing 
touches were applied after R. Moses b. Nahman 




A Ms. fragment of a philosophic text 




This one-page fragment appears to be acopy ofa 
philosophic text by Hasdai Crescas from his 
“Or Adonai.” Each folio contains twenty-four 
lines and the size of the fragment is 27 x 15 cm. 




Manuscript fragments of a Talmudic text 




Two manuscript fragments of a Talmudic text 
which were composed in a beautiful Sephardic 
Mashait script, c. late fourteenth century, are 
available in the Bension Collection. The pages 
measure 35.9 x 12 cm with thirty-five lines to a 
page. The text appears on two pages, folios a and 
b and it is quite worm-eaten. The subject that is 
recorded in these texts corresponds to the 
material that is under discussion in the Babylo- 
nian Tractate, Yebamot, pages 36b to 38a. 
However, these fragments do not just contain 
Talmudic texts. The author intersperses the views 
of medieval commentators such as R. Zerahiah 
Halevi, Rabbenu Tam, Rashi, and Rav Alfasi, on 
parallel texts to the topics that are under discus- 
sion,

arrived in the Holy Land, in 1263. The author fled 
to the Holy Land as the result of a disputation he 
had with the apostate Pablo Christiani, over 
whom he was victorious. The Dominicans, who 
initiated the disputation, were disappointed with 
the outcome especially since the victor’s views 
were subsequently recorded at the request of the 
Bishop of Gerona. The Dominicans requested 
that Pope Clement IV should intervene and 
request that Nahmanides be punished for his 
calumny against the Church. It was at this point 
that Nahmanides fled from Spain. 


The manuscript fragment was written in 
Sephardic Mashait script in pre-expulsion Spain. 
It is considerably damaged and worm-eaten. The 
commentary that is extant gives an exposition on 
the last words of Deuteronomy 4:25—5:5. The 
fragment, which bears writing on both sides, 
measures 25.5 x 17.3 cm. 




The copyist wrote in Sephardic Mashait script of 
the fifteenth century. In this fragment the author 
dwells upon the nature of the leader and the 
effects that he has upon those whom he governs. 
The Hebrew term ‘“Munhagim” which appears to 
be peculiar to Crescas’ style is noted in the text. 




fragments is the case of awoman awaiting levirate 
marriage who inherited property; both the 
schools of Shammai and Hillel agree that she may 
sell it or give it away and the action will be re- 
garded as valid. However, if she passes away, 
what will be done with her marriage contract 
[Ketubbah] and other properties that come and 
go with her [designated Nikhsei Melog]? In this 
case the School of Shammai maintains that the 
heirs of the deceased’s husband share in her 
estate together with her father’s heirs. The School 
of Hillel maintains that her property designated as 
“Zon barzel,” the wife’s property which upon her 
death or divorce the husband must restore 
entirely, falls equally to the first husband's heirs 
and the father’s heirs; while the Ketubbah falls to 
the first husband's heirs, and the property that 
comes in and goes out with her belongs to the 
father's heirs. The views of Amoraic authorities

Ms. 304 Manuscript collections of liturgical poems and a 




mahzor from Morocco 




It can be stated that the field of liturgical poetry 
is a preoccupation of Moroccan Jews ofall ages. 
Unlike the Ashkenazi Jew who has little occasion 
to innovate or to alter the program of the daily, 
Sabbath, or Holiday services, the Sephardi, who 
draws from a vast storehouse of liturgy, did not 
give up his creativity in this field in the early 
sixteenth century. Rather, Moroccan Jewish 
masters of liturgical poetry continued to compose 
new poems for sad and joyous occasions as well 
as for the prayer services throughout the syna- 
gogue calendar. On the occasion of my marriage 
in 1969, in the town of Tivon, in Israel, the leader 
of the Sephardi congregation of Moroccan Jews 
signalled a halt to the routine of the regular Sab- 
bath service as he sang songs of joy for the wed- 
ding occasion. These beautiful religious com- 
positions lasted for more than a half-hour before 
the regular service routine was resumed. 
Among the most celebrated authors of litur- 
gical literature noted in the several collections 
of the first section of this manuscript, the follow- 
ing are mentioned; Solomon Haluah, David b. 
Aaron b. Hasin, Shalom Zur, Solomon ibn Gabirol, 
Israel Najara, Jacob Ibn Zur, Isaac ibn Haluah, 
Moses b, Ezra, Abraham ibn Ezra, Mimun b. Solo- 
mon, Jacob Adhan, and Moses b. Jacob Adhan. 
Several poems in these collections are unpub- 
lished and have not heretofore been mentioned 
in liturgical reference works. The complete manu- 
script text, which is bound together with a prayer 
book, consists of two sections. The first section 
contains ninety-seven pages of collections of 
liturgical poems and it appears before the text of 
the printed edition of the prayer book. The poems 
are written on sides a and b and the size of the 
pages in this section vary. Some pages were 
measured at 14.5 x 10.5 cm while others measured 
15.8 x 10 cm. The second section, which appears 
after the conclusion of the printed edition of the 
prayer book, consists of forty-seven pages and 
contains Penitential prayers known as Selihot, 




164 




Bava Batra. Finally, the decisions of medieval 
authors called Rish6nim are given. 




which are recited before the High Holy Days, and 
a Mahzor for Rosh Hashanah. The writing ap- 
pears on folios a and b of each page which meas- 
ures 16.1 x 11 cm. The manuscript dates from the 
late eighteenth century. This work originated in 
Morocco and the signature of Abraham ibn 
Adhan is written on the inside cover of the book. 
Most of the prayers are written in Maaravic 
Mashait script. One collection is written in 
Maaravic Square script. 


The types of liturgical compositions are 
Piyyutim, Pizmonim, and Bakashot. Piyyut is the 
name applied to liturgical poetry which is usually 
composed for recital at the synagogue service. 
Pizmon is a hymnal poem which concludes with 
a refrain after each verse. It is sung by the reader 
and repeated by the congregants. Bakashah is a 
prayerful petition representing the relationship 
between God and the people of Israel. The Angel 
of Mercy, Throne of Glory, and Torah are calied 
upon to intercede for Israel. A detailed analysis 
of the contents of this manuscript follows. 


The first page of the manuscript is part of an 
incomplete liturgical piece but what is available 
in the acrostic indicates that the author was R. 
Solomon Haluah. The letters of the acrostic are 
given twice; part of the page is torn away. The 
Piyyut on the other side of the page (1b) was also 
composed by R. Solomon Haluah according to 
the acrostic. The first stanza is as follows: 


“Ashir Shirah Ne’emanah, Le-Zur; dar 


Me’onah, Yom Zeh Al Siyyum Mishnah, Ba- 


Kol Shemurah Mefo’arah Tehorah Barah, 


Ev’en Yekarah.” 


In the preface to a poem given on this page it is 
reported by the author, R. Solomon Haluah, that 
he composed this piece in honor of the scholars 
R. Yekutiel Berdugo, his sons and sons-in-law, 
and in honor of R. Solomon Toledano. The work 
commences with the words, “Or ha-Ne’erav, 
Mizrah Ma’arav. ...” A poem on the exalted nature 
of the Almighty, which follows on pages 3a to 
4a was also composed by R. Solomon Haluah. 


R. Solomon Haluah composed a poem on the 
occasion of his completion of the study of the 




Tractate Ketubbot, which appears on page 5a. 
He also composed a poem (page 5b) which was 
based on the following text from the first chapter 
of the Tractate Eruvin, “Kol Davar Dibbur Al 
Ofano Ta’amo Ve-Nimuko Emo.” 


On page 6a a new series of supplicatory 
prayers are introduced under the title Bakashah. 
The first part of the first prayer is missing. The 
second prayer under this title was composed by 
David b. Aaron b. Hasin according to the acrostic. 
[See Davidson, Thesaurus of Medieval Hebrew 
Poetry, Vol. |, 1970, P. 115, No. 2435.] This prayer 
concludes on the bottom of page 7a. It may be 
that the copyist did not know that the authorship 
of this text was by Hasin, since he made no effort 
to reveal the acrostic. The Bakashah at the top of 
page 7b, “Shima Tefilatee ha-Shem Ve-Shavati 
ha-Azayna...” was attributed by scholars to one 
called Isaac. The final prayer, called Bakashah in 
this section, which commences at the bottom of 
page 7b-8b, is “Ereh Yomi U-Mitrahek Ve- 
Hapoalim Azaylim...” 


The next section, commencing in the middle 
of page 8b, begins a series of prayers introduced 
by the word Piyyut. They are given below.

Ne’imah Ayuma Ke-

This poem which is not 


noted in Davidson’s 


Thesaurus, it would seem, 


concludes this section of 


liturgical poetry. How- 


ever, pages 14a and b 


appear to be reversed. 


What in fact did occur was 


that page 14a which com- 


mences the new section 
with an artfully framed 
design surrounding the 
first prayer was to be 
treated as a title page and 
the second side was left 


blank. Subsequently, a

This prayer is treated in

of the same text in some

More collections of Piyyutim follow and some 
of them which are repeated were noted in the two 
aforementioned collections that were analyzed. 


The next collection is written in a beautiful and 
clear Maaravic Square script. These poems ap- 
pear from pages 40a to 47a. The Piyyutim were 
composed by Solomon Haluah and David b. 
Hasin. David b. Aaron [Hasin]’s poem Mashiah, 
mentioned in the previous collection, appears 
again; also a poem by Shalom [Zur], a Piyyut for 
evening, and a Piyyut by David b. Aaron Hasin. 
The last Piyyut in this collection was composed 
by Solomon Haluah on the occasion of the per- 
formance of the Mitzvah of Milah. 




47b-48b A Piyyut.is offered which 
belongs to a new 
collection but it is 
incomplete and written in 
Maaravic Mashait script. 
Several pages are missing 
thereafter.

Tikkun Hazot, commences 
with elegies called Kinot. 


60a-79b Midrash Ha-Ne’elam on 
Aikha [Lamentations] 
and followed on pages 
70b to 79b by Parshat 
Lekh Lekha. This material 
is Zoharistic. 


80a-97b Bakashot are commenced 
at this point. R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur is mentioned as 
the author of the 
Bakashah on page 93a. 




At this point the printed Siddur commences. 
After the conclusion of the printed Prayerbook 
text the penitential prayers preceding the Holy 
Days of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, 
are presented in manuscript form. The printed 
1968 edition of the Mahzor “Zekhor Le-Avraham,” 
in accordance with the Sephardic ritual, was used 
as a basis of comparison with the text of the 
manuscript. 


The Penitential prayers commence on page 
98a [this pagination is used as a continuation of

edition of the prayer book], and conclude on 
page 113b. The order of Hatarat Nedarim, Release

The order of the evening service for Rosh Hash-

An unbound manuscript volume of a High Holy 
Days Mahzor with penitential prayers and 
fragments of Hoshandot 




This manuscript volume was found unbound 
and in fragmented sections. It was written in 
Sephardic Square script on vellum with lineation 
called “Shirtut,” and pointillation. The size of 
each page is 23 x 17.8 cm except where the pages 
are truncated. The text is given on sides a and b 
of each page. No pagination is given but the 
special Piyyutim were numbered in sequence 
by the scribe. There are ninety-five pages and 
introductory sections to the Rosh Hashanah, 
Yom Kippur, and Hoshanét services are written 
in Judaeo-Arabic in a script which is indigenous 
to the Eastern Mediterranean. While no colophon 
is given, this manuscript appears to be a product 
of the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. 
Several of the liturgical poems are not noted in 
Davidson’s Thesaurus nor do they seem ever to 
have been published. It can be ascertained by 
a review of this volume that anumber of the pages 
are missing. 


A perusal of the authors of the Piyyutim found 
in this Mahzor reveals that they span a period of 
over one thousand years. A composition by the 
celebrated and the earliest of the known liturgical 
poets of c. the fifth century, who is given the 
appellation Yose b. Yose Kohen Gadol, of the 
Holy Land, appears at one end of the spectrum 
and a composition by R. David ibn Abi Zimra 
(1479-1573) appears at the other end of this time 
span. R. David was born in Spain and it is sur- 
mised that his family left via Fez for the Holy Land 
and he arrived in Safed when he was still a teen- 
ager. Finally, he made his way to Egypt where he 
ascended to the rabbinic leadership of that com- 
munity. The time period in which R. David lived 
enables us to ascertain that the Mahzor could not 




170 




monim of the morning services for both days of 
Rosh Hashanah begin on page 121a while the 
morning services conclude on page 134b. The 
Musaf service commences on page 134b and 
concludes on page 144b, which is also the con- 
clusion of this manuscript. 




be earlier than from the end of the sixteenth 
century. 


Other authors whose compositions appear in 
this Mahzor are representatives of the classical 
schools of French, Provengal, and Spanish litur- 
gical poetry of the tenth to the thirteenth cen- 
turies. Among them are the following authors; 
Joseph ibn Abitur, c. tenth century, who was the 
first Sephardi to compose a Ma’amad prayer; Levi 
b. Jacob Altabban; David b. Elazar ibn Bakuda; 
Abraham ibn Ezra; Moses ben Ezra; Solomon ibn 
Gabirol; Isaac b. Judah Gerondi; Isaac ibn Ghay- 
yat; Judah Halevi; Joseph Hazan; Benvenist 
ha-Katan bar Hiya; Isaac Halevi bar Zerahiah 
Yarondi (Gerondi); Joseph b. Isaac of Orleans; 
Joseph Kimhi; Judah b. Samuel; Moses Katan 
b. Jacob of Grenoble; Rabbenu Nissim; and 
Joseph b. David ibn Suli. 


The terms Pizmon, Piyyut, and Bakashah, 
which are different types of poems that appear 
in this volume, | have already defined in Ms. 304. 
In addition to those types of poems, there appear 
also the Tokhehah, a type of poem which contains 
self-chastisement in the form of prayerful expres- 
sion, and Selihah, a penitential prayer wherein 
one seeks Divine forgiveness. This last type is 
usually recited on occasions for fasting, on the 
nights before the High Holy Days, and also on the 
Day of Atonement. The poems of this manuscript 
volume were checked against Davidson’s 
Thesaurus of Mediaeval Hebrew Poetry for 
variants, as well as to see if they were extant in 
other collections. Most of the poems in this manu- 
script are in accord with Spanish and North 
African rites. The first section commences in the 
middle of the Ma’amad for the seventh night. 
The term Ma’amad hearkens back to temple times 
when representatives of the Jewish people stood 
by as the offerings were made and they recited 
scriptural passages. This term eventually was

At this point in the manuscript volume, the 
next nine liturgical poems are missing and the 
Selihot section for the days preceding Rosh 
Hashanah concludes. An introduction to the 
Rosh Hashanah services follows in a Judaeo- 
Arabic script of the Eastern Mediterranean area. 
The concluding prayer of the Shaharit Amida 
for Rosh Hashanah is followed by the service for 
the blowing of the Shofar. The Musaf Amida 
follows without any special piyyutim noted. The 
usual sections of Malkhiyét Zikhréndét and 
Shofardt are given.\ Direction for the conclusion 
of the Musaf service is given in Judaeo-Arabic 
as well as directions for the Minhah service of 
Rosh Hashanah and the Fast of Gedaliah. The 
aforementioned introduction and prayers appear 
on fourteen pages. 


The next section is introduced with directions 
for the recital of the Minhah service before the 
eve of Yom Kippur, and the Confessional that is 
added to this service is given. Additional direc- 
tions are given in Judaeo-Arabic pertaining to 
the conclusion of the Minhah service and the 




introduction of the Ma’ariy service which com- 
mences with the text of Kol Nidrei which is given. 
The text of the evening service follows. Three 
liturgical pieces in fragmented form, are pre- 
sented at the end of the Ma’ariv service, but only 
the following Selihah is identified. 




“Ya’aseh Tevuah U-Feri, Tahanun Tiknu 
Emunai.. .” 


Author: Isaac [Ghayya]. This text was known 
in Spain. 




The last part of liturgical composition No. 151 


follows. 


Poem No. 152 Bakashah. “Selah Bor-ee Avon Ish 
Zed Ve-Hata.. .” 


The next poem follows under the heading 


“Pesukei De-rahmei.” 


Poem No. 153 “Lekha Ha-Shem ha-Zedakah 
Ve-Lanu Voshet ha-Panim...” 


The balance of the evening Selihdt follows with 


the last liturgical piece which is now noted. 


Poem No. 157 Pizmon. “Ha-Melekh Adon-ai 
Rom Ve-Tahat Koneh Hegdilu 
Emunim be-Noam Shir U- 
Ma’aneh...” 
It is interesting to note that this 
text is generally recited as a Piyyut 
for blowing the Shofar and here it 
appears as the concluding portion 
of the Selihdt for the evening 
service of Yom Kippur. 


It is customary in many communities to recite 
additional prayers after the regular evening 
service on Yom Kippur. These are given next.

All the poems from Nos. 177 to 189 are miss- 
ing. An introduction in Judaeo-Arabic is given 
before the next section, which is designated as 
Ma’amad Le-Shaharit. The Nos. 190 to 192 are 
contained in this section, while the poems 193 
to 200 have been deleted. Additional liturgical 
poems, Nos. 201 to 208, are given. Number 208 
commences a section designated as Ma’amad 
Le-Minhah, special poems for the afternoon 
service of Yom Kippur Day. Poems Nos. 209 to 
211 are missing while Nos. 212 to 218 are given. 
Poem No. 218 Bakashah. On the “Yud-Gimel 


Yesddét,” the thirteen principles 
of faith, “Ve-Eser Sephirét,” and

Adon-ai, Adon-ai, Zevaot Asher 
Asher Eheyeh Elohay Yisrael

This text is at variance with other 
texts of this prayer and the text 
of the prayer is lengthy. 


Poem No. 220 “Viddui Le-Rabbend Nissim 
Zale 
“Ribono Shel Olam Kodem Kol 
Ain Lee Peh Le-Hashiv.. .” 
This text contains many variants 
of this prayer which was 
disseminated in Italy, Spain, North 
Africa, and the Middle East. 


Some poems have the section containing their 
numbers cut away. They are given below. 


The following two texts pertain to the descrip- 
tion of the Yom Kippur service during Temple 
days which is read in the part of the Musaf service 
known as Seder Avodah. 


“Reshut Le-Seder Avodah Le-R. 
Solomon ibn Gabirol Z.”L. 
“Aromimkha Hezki Ve-Helki be- 
Voee Ve-Rov Davki Ve-Dafki...” 
This text was known to the Jewish 
communities of the 
Mediterranean. 


On the other side of this page is contained 
the “Seder Avodah Le-R. Yose ben Yose Kohen 
Gadol.” “Atah Konanta Olam Me-Kedem Yisadeta 
ha-Kol ve-ha-Kol Pa’alta U-Viryot Yazarta.. .” 
Many variants are noted in this text. Davidson 
writes in his Thesaurus, Volume |, the letter 
“Aleph,” No. 8816, that the author of this famous 
text is unknown. Yet, in our text, Yose ben Yose 
Kohen Gaddl is declared to be the author. 


Eight pages contain the text of the 
aforementioned Seder Avodah. 
An unnumbered Pizmon is 
recorded on another page. 
“Pizmon Le-R. Solomon ibn 
Gabirol N[ishmato] “E[den]. 




“Ashrei Ayin Ra’atah Kol Aileh, 
ha-lo Le-Mishma Ozen Da’avah 
Nafshaynu ...” 


Davidson notes that Solomon ibn 
Gabirol’s Pizmon commences 
from the second line of our text 
“Ashrei Ayin Ra’atah Shoshanat 
ha-Sharon Ve-ha-Kavod 
Mehofef,” rather than from the 
aforementioned first line. This 
poem is an addition to the Seder 
Avodah. 


Additional psalms and poems follow the Musaf 
Service and some of them are numbered, from 
234 to 253. Among these poems are supple- 
mentary piyyutim and selihdét for Rosh Hashanah. 
The last numbered poem is No. 253, “Barukh 
She’amar Le-Yom Zom Kippur.” “Barukh El Adir 
ba-Meromim Ve-Lo Ye-Khalkeluhu .. .” This 
poem is recorded as a Pizmon in other collec- 
tions. 


Two liturgical poems which are not numbered 
are very significant since the copyist also gave 
the names of their authors; something which we 
find but rarely in this manuscript volume. They 
are given below. The first is, “Nishmat Le-R. 
Joseph B. R. Isaac Z.Z.L.” “Ashkimah Shahar 
Yom Yee-hadetow Le-Zom Heh-Asor...” The 
author of this work is Joseph Kimhi. 


The next text is titled, ‘“Ve-Ailu Finu Malei Le. 
R. Abraham ben Ezra, Z.Z.L.” The opening line 
is now given; “Ve-Ailu Finu Malei, Ve-Ailu Finu 
Malei, Shir Zur Lo Ye-Suleh...” This poem is 
not noted in Davidson’s Thesaurus. Thus, we 
have discovered a poem by the celebrated poet 
of the twelfth century, Abraham ibn Ezra, which 
has heretofore been unknown. 


The last section, which contains several 
pages, is in a poorly fragmented condition. It 
contains supplementary prayers called Hoshanot 
which are read in the synagogue on the festival 
of Tabernacles. While most of these prayers are 
available in other collections they have variants 
which will be of scholarly interest. Some of the > 
texts are not referred to in liturgical reference 
works. Unlike most of the prayers contained in the 
Mahzor no numeration of these prayers is avail- 
able.

Ms. 306 A manuscript volume of the kabbalistic work 




Ez Hayyim 




R. Hayyim b. Joseph Vital Calabrese (1542-1620) 
was one of the great Kabbalists and a principal 
disciple of the founder of Ari Kabbalism, R. |saac 
Luria. R. Hayyim devoted his literary activities 
to elaborating on the teachings of Isaac Luria 
in a compulsive manner. He hoped to be the sole 
transmitter of what he comprehended to be the 
authentic ideas of Lurianic Kabbala, to the exclu- 
sion of all other interpreters of the master. A 
group of disciples followed R. Hayyim even 
though he demanded acertain amount of secrecy 
from them. When R. Hayyim left the inner circle 
at Safed, for Jerusalem, where he served as rabbi 
and head of an academy from 1577 to 1585, the 
group dissolved. During this period R. Hayyim 
composed his final version of the Lurianic system. 


R. Hayyim returned to Safed and remained 
there for several years. During this period it is 
reported that he became ill, and while he was 
unconscious, some scholars of Safed bribed his 
younger brother Moses to allow them to copy 
six hundred pages of Hayyim Vital’s writings 
which were subsequently circulated. Hayyim’s 
youngest son, Samuel, inherited all the manu- 
scripts containing his literary output. The two 
major works Ez Hayyim and Ez ha-Da’at were 
disseminated in several versions. The various 
treatises were divided into “Gates,” “She’arim.” 
Even during R. Hayyim’s lifetime many of the 
copies of his works in circulation were poorly 
arranged. 


Vital’s last version, which he prepared during 
his stay in Jerusalem, was discovered there in a 
Genizah by Abraham Azulai. During the early 
decades of the seventeenth century Jacob b. 
Hayyim Zemah, who studied Kabbala in Safed, 
arrived in Damascus where he studied Kabbala 
under the direction of Samuel, the son of Hayyim 
Vital. Jacob Zemah began to draw on Hayyim’s 
rediscovered Jerusalem manuscript for his own 
literary efforts. Meir Poppers, a disciple of Zemah, 
produced his final edition of Vital’s works in 1653. 
A colleague of Poppers, Nathan Shapira, edited 
a Kabbalistic work called Me’érét Natan. 




178 




pp. 45b-51a 




Shalom Sharabi (1720-1777), of Yemen, 
arrived in the Holy Land via Damascus. He 
studied at the celebrated Kabbalistic academy 
Beth-El, which was founded in 1737 by the Kab- 
balist Gedaliah Hayon, where prayers were 
recited according to the directives of Isaac Luria. 
Sharabi studied Lurianic Kabbala according to 
R. Hayyim Vital’s tradition as was the practice 
of other Kabbalists of Jerusalem. He succeeded 
Hayon as head of the academy after 1751. Sharabi 
wrote comments and glosses which elucidated 
much that was obscure in the works of R. Hayyim 
Vital. 


The aforementioned scholars, namely, Jacob 
Zemah, Nathan Shapira, and R. Shalom Sharabi, 
have their glosses contained in the manuscript 
volume of Ez Hayyim, Ms. 306. This work, which 
is written in Maaravic Mashait script, might have 
been copied from a late eighteenth or early nine- 
teenth century published edition of the Ez 
Hayyim. The text is written on two hundred and 
two pages, and on sides a and b. It contains the 
following sections:

Emet Tikkun Soferim 




The work Torat Emet Tikkun Soferim was in- 
tended to serve as a model text by which a scribe 
could be guided to write a scroll containing the 
text of the Pentateuch which could then be used 
for the ritual of the Torah reading at synagogue 
services. The scribe added the prophetic reading 
which is introduced at the conclusion of each 
Sabbath text. Occasional readings from the 
prophets for the festivals and the new month were 
also included. Only four of the bound Penta- 
teuchal volumes, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, 
and Deuteronomy are available. Genesis is miss- 
ing. According to the title pages to the books of 
Numbers and Leviticus, these four volumes were

Although the manuscript is complete, no 
colophon is given. The bibliophile Ariel Bension, 
the originator of this Collection, would have 
developed an avid interest in this manuscript 
because his family was quite involved in the 
movement of the Beth-El mystical community of 
Jerusalem where this type of literature was in- 
tensively studied. Bension also composed a pub- 
lished work on Sar Shalom Sharabi. The influence 
that Ari Kabbalism had in the past and its echoes 
that still reverberate in theosophical literature 
and in Hasidic movements, is ample testimony 
to the important role that R. Hayyim Vital played 
as the penman of Kabbalism. 




written by a scribe in the city of Meknés. 


The text, which is probably from the eight- 
eenth century, is given in Sephardic Square script 
throughout. No pagination is available. Scribal 
lines called “Shirtut” are given. All four volumes 
are written on vellum and they follow the Sep- 
hardic ritual. Sentence endings are also desig- 
nated. Each volume will be described separately. 


The Exodus volume The title page is torn 
away almost entirely. The size of each page is 
13 x 10 cm. After the text of the first Haftorah 
(prophetic reading) for the section of Exodus, 




‘the scribe introduces a second prophetic reading 




from the sixteenth chapter of Ezekiel. He prefaces 
that text with the remark that it is in accord with 
the view of the Rif and the Rosh, and that is why 
he included this reading. The work concludes 




with the prophetic readings for the Arba Parshiyot 
and the blessings which are recited before and 
after the prophetic section. Notes for the cantilla- 
tion are given on side a of the last page. On side b 
the names of Daniel Toledano and Raphael 
Legimi appear. The scriptural passage from 
Ecclesiastes 7:23 is quoted. No pointillation is 
given in this volume. 


The Leviticus volume The work commences 
with a title page. The names Raphael Legimi and 
Mimin Legimi appear on the first page. In addi- 
tion, a list of names with numbers in the form of 
alphabetical letters are given. Some of the names 
that are distinguishable are Mas’ud ibn Sharbit, 
Menasseh Kohen, Levi, Isaac ibn David Ohaytn, 
Shalom Edery, Musa ibn Shitrit, Mordecai ibn 
Shitrit, ibn Biri, Jonah, Isaac ibn Shalilo (Baleiro), 
Abraham, and Aaron. Calculations are given on 
the opposite page. 


The Pentateuchal and prophetic readings for 
Sabbath which falls on the New Month is given 
as well as those readings which pertain to the 
Passover festival. The Haftorah reading is given 
with the Targum (Aramaic translation) of Jona- 
than ben Uziel. A special prayer is added after 
the Haftorah reading for the first day of Passover. 
The last page, side a, gives the notes of cantilla- 
tion with pointillation. 


The Numbers volume The title page of this 
volume is the only one that is rubricated. The 
page prior to the title page contains two beautiful 
signatures by Raphael Legimi. A faded name is 
given in Square script and the name Elijah ibn 
Maman also appears. Four lines of verse appear 
on side b of the page which contains the signa- 
tures. One page containing the conclusion to 
the Haftorah of the last section of the Numbers 
reading is missing. 


The Deuteronomy volume The title page is 
missing in this volume. Side a of the first page 
is given with pointillation. At the end of this 
volume the text of the scroll of Esther is given in 




Mss. fragments of scriptural verses from Isaiah 




34:5 - 36:4 44:5 - 45:1 60:16 - 62:6 




full with the blessings which are recited both 
before and after the ritual reading of Esther. The 
prophetic readings and blessings for the High 
Holy Days and the feast of Tabernacles conclude 
this volume. 


There is some slight variation in the size of 
the pages of the four volumes. Some pages 
measure 14.3 x 10 cm while others measure 13 x 
10 cm. 


An introduction is given to the section on 
Biblical texts and fragments which appear in the 
Bension Collection Ms. 308 to Ms. 322. 


The above enumerated manuscripts are all 
part of a collection of Biblical texts which were 
written in Sephardic Square script, on vellum, 
c. the fourteenth century. The manuscript texts 
follow the Masoretic text; however variants 
abound. Pointillation is given, the conclusion of 
sentences are marked, and to a certain extent 
the Petuhét and Stumét are adhered to. There 
is no pagination or other demarcation of the 
Biblical chapters. The size of each page is 16 x 
16 cm, except where the pages have been trun- 
cated. It appears that originally all these texts 
were bound together as part of one work and they 
were composed by one scribal hand. Two col- 
umns of text appear on each side and there are 
twenty-one lines to a page. There are one hun- 
dred and three separate texts available in this 
collection. 


The classification of the manuscripts is or- 
dered according to the traditional sequence of 
the prophetic texts. Thus, all fragments of Isaiah 
are enumerated under the same classification 
number, followed by Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the 
twelve minor prophets in sequence. The only 
exception is the fragment from the Second Book 
of Kings. Originally, this collection of Biblical 
texts was larger. Additional fragments from the 
books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jonah, and Habbakuk, 
once part of this collection, are known to be 
extant.

The nature of the Hebrew script in the 
Bension collection. 




Three types of script are prominent in the Bension 
Collection. The first is used in ritual works such 
as prayerbooks, facsimiles of Torah Scrolls, and 
Biblical texts, and is designated as Sephardic 
Square script. It is noted in the descriptions of 
Ms. 304; Ms. 305; Ms. 307; Mss. 308 to 322. The 
second type most commonly found in the col- 
lection is known as Cursive script. This least 
formal of all scripts was most widely used in 
correspondences, court documents, and per- 
sonal records and notes. Most of the documents 
and correspondences in the Yalkut Roiim Manu- 
scripts Ms. 1 to Ms. 275 are characteristic in their 
use of this script. The third type is usually used in 
the more formal works not generally utilized 
for ritual purposes and this is designated as 
Mashait script. Examples of this third class of 
script can be found in major halakhic, philo- 
sophic, mystical, and liturgical works which were 
principally written in book form for study pur- 
poses. This script can be found in Ms. 292; Ms. 
293; Ms. 295; Ms. 298; Ms. 301; Ms. 302; Ms. 303; 
Ms. 304; and Ms. 306. 


At the very outset of this book we character- 
ized this collection as Sephardic. The movements 
of Sephardic Jews, after the Spanish expulsion 
of 1492, brought them to the shores of the Eastern 
and Western Mediterranean. There were also 
historical periods when Jews, whom we regard 
today as distinct from one another, were drawn 
together culturally. As they shared similar tradi- 
tions so did their script manifest similarities. 
External influences also had an effect upon 
Jewish life. Those diverse communities who lived 
under the Moorish influence, such as the Jews of 
North West Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and 




the Provence, manifested a similarity of script 
as long as they were able to share the same cul- 
tural contacts. Thus, we find in Ms. 298 two 
different scripts, by the same scribe, adjacent to 
one another. In the post-expulsion period these 
scripts were classified as Provengal-Sephardic 
and as Maaravic. In the pre-expulsion period they 
could be regarded as Sephardic scripts shared 
by three major literary contributors, namely: 
Spanish Jewry, Provengal Jewry, and the Jews 
of North West Africa. 


The scribal tradition of the Eastern Mediter- 
ranean is represented in the collection by the 
Mahzor, Ms. 305. When Jews from the Maghreb 
migrated to the Holy Land, their descendants 
developed an affectation in their script which 
developed its own characteristics. This script 
can be regarded as a Holy Land or a modern 
Western Palestinian Cursive script. Examples of 
it are manifested by Holy Land emissaries and 
book dealers whose correspondences appear in 
Ms. 30; Ms. 31; Ms. 44; Ms. 45; Ms. 54; Ms. 95; 
Ms. 99; Ms. 101; Ms. 103; Ms. 120; and Ms. 125. 
This type of script must be distinguished from the 
Temanic or Parsic types which, although con- 
temporaneous, developed their own peculiari- 
ties apart from the Western Palestinian types 
but these are not available in this collection. A 
script which seems to conform to the scribal tradi- 
tion of Egypt does appear in the Cursive script 
which introduces the different sections of the 
Mahzor in Ms. 305. 


The Cursive script was utilized by copyists 
in an ornamentalized fashion which we call 
Mashait when they sought to give their work 
the quality of a book script. An example of this 
can be seen in Jacob Ibn Zur’s poetic composi- 
tions which appear in Maaravic Mashait script 
in Ms. 84. A peculiar development took place in 




187 




Appendix 




Appendix 




modern Holy Land Mashait script of the nine- 
teenth century when the writer tried to achieve 
an ornamental effect similar to printed works, 
even in his correspondences such as shown in 
Ms. 56. The ornamentalized form can also be 
detected when formal documents for certifica- 
tions of officials such as ritual slaughterers were 
composed, as may be noted in Ms. 16. Authors 
and copyists of Chronicles also wrote those texts 
in a more ornate Mashait script as may be noted 
in Ms. 87. 


Signatures were developed into a special 
art form especially in the North African com- 
munities. Note the listings of signatures in the 
Index of Subjects. One of the many examples 
of signatures can be noted in Ms. 43, a product 
of the mid-seventeenth century. Few examples of 
the signatures indigenous to writers of the Holy 
Land communities are available in this collection 
(cf. Ms. 100). However, these writers did develop 
a distinctive signature type, though it was less 
elaborate than those of the Moroccans. 


In the past the tendency was to designate 
what we call Mashait script as rabbinic script. 
This developed because most of the scholarly 
tomes that were read by Jews were halakhic 
works whose authors wrote in a specialized 
scribal style which had to be less painstakingly 
produced than the traditional square script if 
voluminous works were ever to reach completion. 
This “rabbinic” script was even adopted by the 
nascent printing industry in the late fifteenth 
century. 


One halakhic work in the collection which 
dates from the fourteenth century and is written 
in a Temanic Mashait script is Ms. 295, Mai- 
monides’ Commentary on the Mishnah. Each 
text of the Mishnah is translated into Judaeo- 
Arabic. Several documents of this collection are 




188 




written wholly or partially in Judaeo-Arabic, 
which is the Arabic language in Hebrew charac- 
ters. Different Arabic dialects can be detected 
and the script in which they are written usually 
indicates whether the Arabic is a North Western 
African dialect or an Egyptian dialect. 


Occasionally, liturgical poems known as 
Piyyutim are written in square script, but most 
Piyyutim, especially of Morocco, are written in 
Cursive or Mashait script. This genre of literature 
was used extensively at prayer services; since 
many of the collections of Piyyutim were not 
published they were recorded by many individu- 
als who had neither the time nor the inclination 
to render them in an ornate script. 


It sometimes occurs that a copyist will render 
a text, that originally was written in another locale 
and in a different script, into his own script. 
Therefore the reader must consider whether the 
text before him is an original text or correspond- 
ence, or a copy of the original. An example of 
this can be noted in Ms. 4, where letters from the 
Holy Land were copied by a Moroccan scribe into 
Maaravic script. When a colophon is offered by 
the writer or copyist it gives valuable information 
concerning the provenance of the text and other 
details. However, sometimes a colophon might be 
copied as well; as may be the case in Ms. 298. 


Certain types of script seem to endure through 
the centuries. This is particularly true with regard 
to those used by scribes who write texts which are 
used as ritual items such as Torah Scrolls. How- 
ever, when Jewish migrants come under new 
influences, scripts are inclined to change. The 
first generation might retain the script of their 
previous land, but new or syncretic forms of 
writing usually evolve among their descendants, 
and often come to dominate. When political con- 
ditions are relatively static, the uniformity of a 




script can endure for a few centuries. The trained 
eye can detect a certain uniformity of style in 
Ms. 292; Ms. 293; Ms. 298; Ms. 301; and Ms. 303. 
They were all produced before the end of the fif- 
teenth century and under the influence of the 
Sephardic Mashait script. While there are diver- 
gences among the texts, there are certain features 
in the writing which places them together in a 
group. The trained eye can recognize the work of 
certain copyists even though no clear indicators 
are available other than the script. In collections 




Appendix 




of correspondences such as appear in the Yalkut 
Roiim one can notice the evolution of a particular 
individual’s script or signature when a series of 
documents or epistles by the same author are 
offered spanning decades. Such is the case with 
the signature of R. Raphael Moses Elbaz (cf. 
Introduction). One can study the evolution of 
R. Jacob ibn Zur’s signature over half a century. 
The effects of age on handwriting can be noted 
in one document and one letter by Hayyim 
Joseph Gayni in Ms. 158 and Ms. 159.

(Note: Numbers without parentheses indicate that the docu- 
ment was despatched from or received in that city, or that 
the city is definitely indicated in the text. Numbers in paren- 
thesis mean that it is not certain that the city was involved, 
but that it most probably was so. For example, in Ms. 162, 
R. Judah ibn Attar wrote to R. Jacob Ibn Zur in the year 1720. 
Even though no cities are mentioned it is known that R. Jacob 
established his residence in Meknés during that period while 
R. Judah lived in Fez. Therefore we classify the document 
under Fez [162] and Meknés [162].)
