A letter of reconciliation called Divrei Shalom 
Ve-emet 




This letter of reconciliation is written to R. 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur, the son of the Torah 
scholar R. Jacob Ibn Zur, by Abraham the son of 
Saul Ibn David Ve-Joseph. The writer intends to 
set the record straight as well as to achieve a 
reconciliation. That is why he calls the letter 
Divrei Shalom Ve-Emet, which means “Words of 
Peace and Truth.” 


Abraham claims that he was falsely accused 
by R. Solomon Elijah. He appeals to the latter not 
to believe these false accusations: “R. Samuel (R. 
Solomon’s sister’s husband) informed me of that 
which you accuse me, namely, that | took letters 
of correspondence that belonged to you and your 
grandfather, Solomon, of blessed memory, which 
would destroy a long friendship.” Abraham’s son 
is ill He asks R. Solomon to recite prayers in 
behalf of his son; since R. Solomon is descended 
from such an illustrious line of rabbis his prayers 
will have especial merit. 




A ms. copy of a collection of letters called Kitvei 
Ha-Qodesh pertaining to Halukah 




The collection of letters is called Kitvei Ha- 
Qodesh because all the letters relate to the needy 
communities in the Holy Land. The first letter of

Abraham does not hesitate to exhort R. 
Solomon to improve his own character. On page 
5a, the writer states that R. Solomon Ibn Zur is 
married to his sister. He also prefaces a poem of 
friendship, “Shir Yedidut,” that he includes in the 
letter in honor of R. Solomon. The writer gives his 
full name as Abraham bar Saul David Ve-Joseph, 
in acrostic form. The authorship of the poem he 
attributes, however, to R. Raphael Jacob Ibn 
Simhon, who was still living when this letter was 
composed. The poem consists of twenty-two 
lines. The letter was written in the month of lyar 
1846 (see page 6a). The writer states that his 
epistle was not concluded for quite a while after it 
was commenced since his son had already 
recovered from his illness before the letter was 
sent. In the last part of the letter the writer 
discusses a litigation in which he was involved 
with one called Abraham Ibn Zagen. It was finally 
decided by R. Jacob Serero. R. Jacob |bn Zur, the 
father of R. Solomon, refused to judge the case on 
an earlier occasion because he was angry with the 
writer. 




this collection commences with a short excursus 
on Jewish history leading to the religio-historical 
importance of Tiberias. The one who is men- 
tioned in connection with fund raising for the 
great academy of the Jewish community of 
Tiberias, which is in dire need of funds, is the 
Haham Kollel R. Moses Pinto, the son of Isaac, 




0.b.m., who is descended from R. Jacob Pinto. 
The latter composed the work “Miqdash Melekh.” 
The date of this epistle is given as Shevat 1828. 
The debt had grown to over 300,000 gerush. The 
conditions were exacerbated by plagues of 
locusts. 


The second letter in this collection was written 
to the members of the community of Tetuan. They 
are informed that the great academy of Tiberias is 
maintaining the traditions that were set in Tiberias 
from the days of the Talmudic masters. Many 
misfortunes have created a great need for money 
for food and clothing and to pay debts including 
the interest that had accrued. The emissary who 
was sent was called R. Abraham ha-Cohen 
Duwayk. The date of this epistle is given as 1834 
and it was written at Tiberias. 


The third letter is to the scholars and com- 
munal officials of Fez, from Safed, the location of 
the tomb of R. Simeon bar Yohai. Money is 
needed to repair the holy synagogues, in par- 
ticular, the synagogue called “Ba’al Teshuvot,” 
where repentant sinners gain forgiveness. The 
structure is falling into great disrepair. R. Hayyim 
Ashkenazi is sent to the diaspora to raise the 
funds necessary for the rehabilitation project. The 
latter is a descendant of the author of “Pithei 
Levahoh” and “Hiddushei Shnei ham-Me6érét.” 
The leaders of Fez are asked to accompany the 




A ms. copy of a letter sent by R. Raphael Jacob 
Ibn Simhon on behalf of R. Samuel Koskaso 




The first four lines of this letter contain a poem 
commencing with the acrostic which spells out 
the name Raphael. It was written by R. Raphael 




A ms. copy of a letter written by R. Yedidia 
Monsonyego on behalf of R. David Monsano 




R. Yedidia Monsonyego writes this letter extolling 
tne virtues of R. David Monsano. The writer 
compares R. David to the biblical David who 




aforementioned emissary from house to house 
and that one gerush be donated for every member 
of the household to this special reconstruction 
fund. This letter is dated in the month of Elul 1835, 
and it is signed by the rabbis of Safed. 


The fourth letter is from the Sephardic 
communities of Jerusalem for the community of 
Ashkenazim Midrash Perushim, consisting of 
three houses of prayer and study. The misfor- 
tunes that have befallen the community include 
natural calamities such as an earthquake in 
Galilee as well as physical attacks from 
marauders. Great losses have been incurred both 
in money and in people, particularly by the 
Ashkenazim. The scholar R. David Devash, who 
was a Sephardi and a Jerusalemite, has been sent 
as an emissary. The communities are asked to 
extend him hospitality and to help him in his fund 
raising endeavor. The letter is signed for the 
directors of the Kollel Ashkenazim Midrash 
Perushim in the month of Tammuz 1842, at 
Jerusalem, by Nathan the son of R. Menahem 
Mendel of blessed memory. 


The fifth and final letter by this copyist is from 
the rabbis of Safed to Shalom b. Malkaasking him 
to receive the emissary R. Simeon Ha-Kohen and 
to extend to him all necessary aid and financial 
support in his endeavor to collect money to help 
rebuild the city of Safed. 




Jacob Ibn Simhon on behalf of R. Samuel 
Koskaso who has fallen upon hard times and 
requires financial aid. This letter of reference is 
written to the Jewish communities to help R. 
Samuel pay his debts. The epistle concludes with 
the prayer that the Messiah should come and that 
he shall remove the burden of the tax collectors. 




suffered tribulations because of Saul’s enmity. R. 
Yedidia notes that R. David suffered economic 
adversity because “two kings cannot wear one 
crown.” R. David Monsano was forced to seek his 
fortunes elsewhere because of Saul. The writer 
asks that financial support should be extended to 
R. David Monsano.

An Halakhic query concerning a sale with an

This query was sent to R. Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur, 
of Fez, by R. Samuel Ibn Elbaz of Sefrou. A house 
was sold by David ben Elijah Moses Ha-Kohen, 
his mother, and his brother, to Azuz Ha-Kohen 
with a provision that the vendors could 
repurchase the house at the same price, in the 
fifth year from the time of purchase. The

Tangier. A campaign is now organized by the 
rabbis at Fez to aid R. Barukh in his mission. The 
community of Debdou is also advised to follow 
the practice of Fez in this matter while the same 
applies to outlying villages. Even if any emissaries 
should appear from the Kollelim of Hebron, the 
emissary from Jerusalem shall take precedence.

deceased and the agreement did not include their 
inheritors. R.J. Caro states this ruling in Hoshen 
Mishpat 209:6; namely, that the descendants shall 
also be included in the terms of the transaction. 
The Maharshakh, Part Il, No. 32 and Beit Judah, 
Hoshen Mishpat, No. 14, state that at the time of 
the original transaction the term “to me and to my 
inheritors,” should have been included. R. Samuel 
Elbaz asks R. Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur to contact 
Azuz, who now resides in the latter’s jurisdiction, 
to resolve the matter, perhaps by reaching a 
compromise. 




that it should not be used as apayment for aclaim 
on a marriage contract, nor should it be sold or 
given as a pledge. It should always remain as a 
family inheritance so that future generations 
might benefit from the land’s produce. Judah has 
left Morocco and settled in Jerusalem, but while 




on a visit to Meknés, his brother granted him his 
portion of land as agift according to law. He wants 
to sell it because he really needs the money and 
since he resides in the Holy Land he wants to 
assure the purchaser that no claim will arise 
against the sale by any of the other relatives. 


R. Judah argues that the original contract does 
not actually contain the aforementioned stipula- 
tion, even though it might be claimed that sucha 
stipulation is indeed implied. He feels this is 
particularly the case, as the proper legal form of 
stipulating a condition, a “T’nai Kafull,” a double 
stipulation [an agreement stating both alterna- 
tives and their eventual consequences], is not

An Halakhic query asking if one partner marries

Also an enactment concerning ritual slaughter 




This letter was addressed to R. Solomon Ibn Zur 
of Fez by R. Rahamim Joseph Gayni of Sefrou in 
the year 1871. The date is given in two different 
ways in this epistle. After two introductory 
paragraphs the writer poses a legal question and 
supplies an answer himself inthe third paragraph. 
The question is posed in the following manner: “If 
one of two partners weds, must the other partner 
refrain from transacting any business during the 
traditional seven days of post-nuptial festivities, 
just as one would be obliged to in the case of 
seven days of mourning? The work “Pri Hodosh 
Matei Aharon” is cited in the answer given, which 
states that if the younger of two brothers who are 
business partners marries, the older brother may 
transact the business, only the bridegroom must 
refrain. 




given. This is not a case of actual claimants as the 
present situation stands. Therefore, R. Judah 
turns to R. Solomon Ibn Zur of Fez to render a 
decision on the matter. R. Judah reminds R. 
Solomon that R. Yedidia Monsonyego is also 
available to R. Solomon for consultation. Inciden- 
tally, Judah offers books on Responsa literature 
to R. Solomon at a fair price. He also informs R. 
Solomon that a speedy response would be 
appreciated since he is obliged to return to the 
Middle East. [This letter was sent prior to another 
letter on the same subject which was sent in 1862. 
The second letter appeared in the original volume 
on page 334a, Ms.265.] 




took and that is now found in the possession of a 
third party? This would be in accord with Moram 
[Rema] in his amendment to Even ha-Ezer, 
chapter 160:3. Or can she not use the dowry for 
her support until the levirate marriage comes into 
force when the prospective husband becomes of 
age? This view would be in accord withR. Joseph 
Caro. R. Matitya states that he has heard that R. 
Solomon agrees with the former authority and 
wants to know if such is indeed the case? He asks 
for a speedy reply. 




In the last paragraph of the letter an enactment 
is presented concerning the ritual slaughter of 
animals and fowl. The main points of the 
enactment are as follows: 


“(1) Because people make light of the ex- 
amination of the knife of the ritual slaughterer and 
of the animal’s lungs, henceforth at least two 
people shall examine the knife and at least two 
people shall examine the lungs. 


(2) No ritual slaughter of animals or fowl shall 
commence before the hour when the morning 
services are completed, since those who are in the 
service of the abattoir use this as an excuse not to 
attend morning services. 


(3) Any ritual slaughterer violating the 
aforementioned enactments by slaughtering or 
examining lungs unaccompanied by another 
individual will mean this animal being declared 
unfit for human consumption. These rules do not 
apply to the slaughter of fowl which the ritual 
slaughterer can be trusted to do himself.”

usual type of inquiry. The writer supplied 
documents that were apparently of interest to R.

A court action legalizing the transfer of land from 
a non-Jew to a Jew for the welfare of the Jewish 
community 




Unscrupulous people are taking advantage of the 
poor by building shops on land that belongs to the 
non-Jew Al-Hawaja. This individual places all the 
purchasers of the shops at his mercy by ignoring 
all claims that they bring against him. He acts in 
this manner because he desires to destroy all 
those structures which house these shops. 
Sometimes he dismantles them and then claims 
the material as his own. The shopkeepers can do 
nothing to stop him and they suffer a complete 
loss.

An Halakhic exposition on succession to rabbinic 
leadership when a leader is temporarily in- 
capacitated 




Rabbi S. Atazi acceded to the role of rabbinic 
leader when his predecessor was temporarily 
incapacitated. The latter is now able to resume his 
duties and Rabbi S. Atazi’s future role is in 
question. The author of this legal opinion 
disagrees with the decision of the authority to 
whom he writes who had argued that a com- 
promise should be achieved similar to that which 
prevailed at the accession of R. Eleazarb. Azariah 
and R. Gamliel. He had based his decision on the 
version of the Talmud in the Propes edition, which 
requires that the honor of the second authority 
should be taken into consideration. 


The author of this expositon refers to the 
decision rendered by R. Joseph Caro in his codes, 
Orah Hayyim, 153:22, and Hoshen Mishpat, 149.

the writer. The latter states that he will not eat 
anything but fowl, even on the Sabbath, unless 
the aforementioned enactments are fulfilled and 
he is present during their implementation. He 
states that he will not buy meat from the butchers 
on any occasion. The writer gives his signature as 
Rahamim Joseph Gayni. 




ing the transfer of the land to R. Joseph 
Almosnino who has acquired it from the 
aforementioned Al-Hawaja. R. Joseph will sell the 
shops to the vendors at a fair price. Whoever 
refuses to abide by this arrangement loses the 
shops which revert back to Joseph. There is also 
the danger of a precedent being established 
whereby other unscrupulous people will ap- 
propriate land, as Al-Hawaja did, unless it is 
bought from him. It is noted in an addendum to 
this document that the chaotic political situation 
justifies this action being taken. This document 
was composed in the month of Nisan 1757 at Fez. 
The three rabbis who served as the tribunal were 
Saul Ibn Danan, Raphael Obed !bn Zur, and Elijah 
Ha-Sarfati. 




“If one lost the right to perform a ritual, the honor 
for which he paid in the past, because he is 
poverty-stricken, that right shall be returned to 
him when he again has the money to pay for the 
honor. The one who had the honor in the interim 
loses it completely.” R. Caro’s view is in accord 
with the Mordecai, Pereq Hezqat, No. 533. It is 
also in contradiction to the Propes edition of the 
Talmud. 


A further proof favoring the first appointed 
rabbi over the second is the case of the High Priest 
when temporarily disqualified. When the condi- 
tion which disqualified him passes he is restored 
to his previous position to the detriment of the one 
who replaced him. A further distinction is made by 
the author: when a monetary loss is incurred, 
such as in this situation, Rabbi S. Atazi should not 
even be considered. Whereas, in the performance 
of rituals, as was cited by R. Caro, no loss of 
money is involved. 




A certificate for one to serve as a ritual 
slaughterer, given at Fez, foraresident of Debdou 




A beautifully hand-written certificate, issued in 
Fez, authorizes Yamin Kohen ben Ishak of 
Debdou to serve as a Ritual Slaughterer. The 
candidate must agree to review all the laws 
thereto pertaining according to the ruling of 
Maharil and Maharash. The reason for issuing 
such a certification is given in the text as follows: 




A Jewess collects a debt from the niece of King 
Mulay Rashid which results in complexities 




The wife of David ben Tata engaged in commer- 
cial dealings with some non-Jews. One of them 
was known as Musa ben Abd Laziz against whom 
she had a claim in the non-Jewish court. She has 
also acquired the right to collect a debt from Lala 
Sharif, the niece of the King Mulay Rashid. Lala 
had sold the wife of David half of an upper floor in 
exchange for the amount of the loan that she 
owed. The non-Jew, Musa, bought the other half 
of the upper floor. 




A letter of adulation written in honor of R. Elijah 
Ha-Sarfati and his son Jacob 




This epistle was written in honor of R. Elijah Ha- 
Sarfati and his son R. Jacob. A poem in honor of 
the former appears on page 30a and a second 
poem in honor of the latter appears on page 30b. 




The rabbis at Meknés intervene in a judgement 
rendered by the rabbis at Fez 




R. Jacob Ibn Zur rendered a decision in a certain 
matter. 


R. Samuel Labaz is also involved in this 
litigation. One of the disputants has refused to 
abide by the judgements of R. Jacob Ibn Zur and 
the matter has been brought to the attention of the 
rabbis of Meknés, namely, R. Hayyim Toledano, 
R. Jacob Toledano, and R. Mordecai Berdugo, all 




“Villagers who required the services of a Ritual 
Slaughterer would ask a sojourner if he was well- 
versed in the laws pertaining to Ritual Slaughterer 
whereupon he would answer in the affirmative, 
even if he was totally ignorant and he would then 
be guilty of providing the Jewish community with 
prohibited food. In order to avoid this situation, 
the scholars of an earlier period made a require- 
ment that a Ritual Slaughterer was to present a 
document from them attesting to his ability and 
knowledge.” 




A Jew known as Saadya Lahakhusin ben R. 
Moses purchased the half that belonged to the 
non-Jew. The undersigned rabbinic tribunal 
comprising the rabbis Judah ibn Attar, Samuel 
Ha-Sarfati, and Abraham ibn Danan gave assent 
and support to Saadya’s legal right so that no one 
should register a claim against it. Even if the 
owners of the land raised sufficient funds within 
the year from the date of this decree, they should 
not disturb the purchaser, nor should he be 
obliged to return the land to them. This document 
was composed at Fez, the seventeenth day of 
Tammuz 1707. 




R. Solomon Abitbol is mentioned as the one who 
was to deliver the letter. R. Benjamin LakKhraif, 
who was alive on this occasion, is also mentioned. 
Some remarks attributed to R. Hayyim Alfandari, 
from the introduction of his commentary to 
Genesis, are noted. An additional text pasted on 
to page 30b contains the text of an amulet which 
was intended to protect one from plagues. 




of whom signed this document. They speak with 
the highest regard for the authority of R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur and are chagrined at the disregard and 
disrespect that is being shown to him. The 
attackers who demean R. Jacob Ibn Zur falsify 
the judgement and produce weak testimony in 
their defense, they say. All this ttmeR. Samuel has 
remained silent according to his pious nature 
when he might have been able to illumine the 
matter with his testimony. R. Samuel, by his 
silence, has given approval to those attacking R.

A controversy concerning a Torah scroll 




On the Intermediate days of the Passover Festival, 
in the year 1734, the author of this text accom- 
panied Yaabez [Rabbi Jacob ibn Zur] to the 
synagogue of R.Y. Busidan to collect a Torah 
scroll which was to be taken to Yaabez’s syna- 
gogue from which it had been borrowed. It be- 
longed to R. Hayyim ibn Magirz who was also of 
the party with a whole assembly of people. When 
they entered the synagogue, they opened the ark, 
and asked the incumbent reader, R. Hayyim Al- 
Atabi, to point out the right Torah. Al-Atabi 
claimed he didn’t know which it was, a most 
improbable state of affairs. Two hours later the 
sexton was brought and he also claimed not to be 
able to identify the scroll. The man who prepared 
the parchments said that he wasn’t able to identify 
it either, so another Torah was given in its place. 


Subsequently R. Hayyim [Al-Atabi] wrote to 
his brother Mimun who normally shared his 
duties as reader in the synagogue but who was 
on a visit to Mekneés at the time, whereupon 
Mimun began to spread slander against Yaabez. 
Yaabez, he said, had waited for him, Mimun, to 
leave for Meknés before claiming that the scroll 
should be returned to his synagogue, and Yaabez 
had forced Hayyim ibn Magirz into returning the 
scroll against his will. All these damaging state- 
ments were made against Yaabez but none of the 
scholars or communal leaders reprimanded R. 
Mimun. 


In response to the aforementioned attacks, on 
the eighth of lyar, witnesses testified that for more 
than a year Hayyim ibn Magirz had wanted to 
return the scroll to Yaabez’s Synagogue. He had 
procrastinated, however, because he wanted to 
be accompanied by R. Moses ibn Maman so that 




46 




decision-making process of the rabbinic courts. If 
R. Samuel feels that his wrath justifies his silence 
then steps should be taken to appease him so that 
he will report the necessary information. ff, 
however, he does not accept the counsel of the 
rabbis of Meknés then they will be forced to 
exercise all measures to uphold the honor of R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur. 




he could save face. But R. Moses was always 
preoccupied and so the Torah had not been 
returned until the present. Upon R. Mimun’s 
return from Meknés he begged forgiveness from 
Yaabez for treating the latter unjustly. Yaabez was 
magnanimous in accepting the apology, which 
was in accord with his forgiving nature, and 
Hayyim ibn Magirz returned to pray at Yaabez’s 
synagogue which had been the place of prayer of 
his forebears. 


[The story behind the controversy over the 
Torah, as gleaned from the manuscripts, is an 
interesting one. Hayyim’s grandfather, Hanun 
ben Magirz, had prayed with Yaabez from the time 
that he moved his residence from Al-Arsa to the 
Mellah until his death, at which time Yaabez 
eulogized him as he had Hanun’s wife at her 
passing. Hanun’s son, Mas’ud, also frequented 
Yaabez’s synagogue until his death and Hayyim 
himself had celebrated his Bar Mitzva there. Only 
after Yaabez had left Fez and established his 
residence at Meknes, had Hayyim moved to the 
synagogue of R. Mimun Al-Atabi. Eventually 
Yaabez returned to take up residence again in Fez 
and because there had been a period of misfor- 
tune and famine during his absence Yaabez was 
not surprised to find Hayyim no longer among the 
worshippers; many had died or moved away. 
Then one day Yaabez noted Hayyim’s name 
among the parties involved in a litigation. He 
inquired if Hanun was his grandfather. When this 
fact was established, he convinced Hayyim he 
should return to the synagogue of his forefathers 
according to the legal tradition. The Torah Scroll 
was to be returned as well. 


So eventually R. Mimun was ordered to return 
all the vestments belonging to Hayyim’s Torah.] 


This judgement was rendered in the tenth of 
lyar 1734.

A letter of consoiation to Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur on 
the death of his son Samuel 




This letter was written to Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur 




A correspondence from R. Jacob Ibn Malka to 
Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur 




R. Jacob ibn Malka informs R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
that in spite of his many duties and the exigencies 
of time he has been able to prepare certain docu- 
ments which have been signed by rabbinic 




A scholar demands that certain legal actions ina 
litigation should be taken before a final judge- 
ment is rendered 




R. Hasdai Almosnino is involved in a case where 
the litigants are R. Joseph Ha-Sarfati and his 
uncle. The uncle, R. Joseph, who previously 
resided in R. Hasdai’s community Tetuan isnow 
living in Fez. R. Joseph had also abandoned the 
members of his family who now suffer privation. 
The rabbis of Fez and Meknés have brought the 
matter under litigation to a settlement by having 
the uncle pay R. Joseph a stipulated sum of 
money. R. Hasdai notes that he had more 
evidence that was pertinent to the case but since 
the matter has already been resolved by the rabbis 




A letter of consolation to Abraham Monsano 




The brother of Abraham Monsano has passed 
away. The author of this letter of consolation to 




A case involving the expiration of tenancy ina 
domicile and property claims 




The following case was adjudicated by R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur on the twenty-fourth day of Elul 1747. 
Jacob ben Amozag, who was abroad, is at present 
a tenant of Menahem ben Amozag. The period of 




48 




consoling him, his wife, and his daughter-in-law 
on the untimely passing of his son Samuel, may 
his memory be a blessing. The letter was signed 
by Samuel ibn Adhan. 




authorities, and he sends them through a 
messenger. He apologizes for being tardy in his 
response to an earlier letter by R. Jacob Ibn Zur. 
However, two weeks passed before R. Jacob Ibn 
Malka received R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s letter. The 
former states that his function as teacher to many 
students prevents him from devoting more time to 
the transcribing of documents. 




of Fez and Meknés he will not forward it. However, 
R. Hasdai feels that the case will not be closed 
until the uncle (who is referred to as “the scholar’) 
pays an additional sum of fifty ugiot of silver, 
which would cover the amount due to R. Hasdai 
for the services that he rendered in the case 
heretofore. This demand is just since the other 
rabbis have already received payment for their 
services rendered and Joseph is too poverty- 
stricken to make the payment. The rabbis are 
asked to relay this information to the uncle. R. 
Hasdai asks that in order to insure that the 
settlement is a lasting one, the uncle should 
pardon R. Joseph for any indiscretion that might 
have arisen during the litigation. The author 
states that he is in mourning. 




Abraham Monsano is Abraham Alfasi. After an 
introductory paragraph, the author writes four 
paragraphs. The first paragraph consoles the 
wife, the second the children, the third the 
relatives, and the fourth the whole house of Israel. 




occupancy of the suite had run its course, when 
Jacob claimed that he still owned a percentage of 
two courtyards while another portion of his total 
claim had been sold against his will by his brother 
Joseph. He said that even if proof could be 
brought that Joseph had acted for him legally and 
with his knowledge, still only a portion thereof 
had been sold. Therefore, Jacob insisted that he 




still had a percentage in the courtyard that was 
not sold. Subsequently, Jacob admitted that he 
was paid additional money by Menahem so that 
he really had no claim to a percentage in either 
the longer or the smaller courtyard as he had 
previously asserted. 


In the outcome, Menahem waives the 
monetary claim for the apartment that was owed 




The rabbis of Meknés wish to apply a ban against 
another community for money that should be 
forthcoming 




R. Solomon ben Moses Maman wrote this letter in 
Judaeo-Arabic and Hebrew to the Rabbis Jacob 
lbn Zur and Moses Birdugo, at Meknés, concer- 
ning the emissary R. David Gabbai, of blessed 
memory. The aforementioned rabbis of Meknés 
claim that R. David left money with somebody in 
the other community and if the money is not 
forthcoming then they will declare a ban against 
the community. R. Solomon replies, “Let it 
therefore be known that the emissary did nothing 




Two prayers of supplication and one liturgical 
poem 




On page 40a, two prayers of supplication appear. 




The first was composed by one called Reuben. 




A Jew owes a non-Jew money and the Jew must 
collect a loan to ease his burden which affects the 
property of R. Jacob Ibn Zur 




Rabbi Judah ibn Attar wrote this letter toR. Jacob 
Ibn Zur concerning R. Aaron ibn Haroush. The 
last-named owes money to a non-Jew called ben 
Azzim Adda. The time to pay the debt has arrived 
but Aaron does not have the money available to 
make the payment. Azzim Adda is putting him 
under pressure but he is ill and has no recourse to 
money except by calling for the payment of a debt 
of 500 uqiot of silver which is owed to him by R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur. When Aaron told Azzim that the

lease for one year of domicile. Menahem also 
waives any claims for back rent that was due to 
him from Jacob after the year expired, until the 
present. Menahem further renews the lease for 
Jacob for two more years, rent-free, provided that 
Jacob promises never to make further claims on 
properties which are no longer his.

that he gave not a penny to anyone except the 
Master David Abirgil to whom he gave twelve 
mitkalin. Ten of the twelve were returned while a 
contract was made in the name of Solomon ben 
Lisha for the remaining two. A contract of 
indebtedness was made which | signed. In truth, 
forty or fifty mitkalin were given to R. Elazar 
Delouya. The aforementioned David [Abirgil] is 
not a liar or a thief, God forbid, and he is prepared 
to send the balance of the money. However, we 
must wait until he completes a transaction 
involving the sale of arak and raisins when the 
market price is higher.” 




The second prayer of supplication at the bottom 
of the page was composed by R. Yaabez, of 
blessed memory. 


A Liturgical poem appears on page 40b. 
It was composed by one called Abraham. The 
writing on 40b is quite faded. 




properties enumerated in the bill of debt as a 
guarantee more than equalled the value of the 
money owed, Azzim was happy to accept this in 
payment. These are the places enumerated in the 
bill of debt: one sixth of the courtyard adjoining 
the synagogue wherein the descendants of R. 
Immanuel Monsano pray, one sixth of R. Jacob’s 
synagogue, and one sixth of the courtyard called 
Zar Asiban. The non-Jew wants to have the option 
to sell these properties or to realize dividends 
therefrom. R. Judah notes that the property of the 
courtyards is for sale; however, not the syn- 
agogue property, as is stipulated in the bill of 
debt. This communication is dated Shevat 1721.

A request for a document of transference of 
property to be drawn 




Rabbi Judah ibn Attar writes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 




on Adar II, 1720, upon the request of Aaron ben ~ 




Moses ben Samuel. One known as Israel Ben 
Shaiya, the son of the scholar R. Jacob, has writ- 
ten a letter to Aaron in his own name and in the 
name of his brother Reuben’s wife (who dwells at 
Tafilalet) stating that Reuben has granted permis- 




-sion to transfer to Aaron the pledge of property 




which is located in Fez, in the courtyard of R. 
Solomon ibn Amiel. The value of the pledge is 
sent through the agent Jacob ibn Garton. It is 




A plea to the rabbis to innovate and support 
methods of fundraising for the Jerusalem com- 
munity as the emissary is encountering difficulties 




One who signs his name as David Ha-Katan writes 
to the rabbis informing them of many difficulties 
that he encounters in fundraising for Jerusalem. 
He asks them to support such an effort but says 




The inheritance and perpetuation of the estate of 
rabbi Solomon Samuel Ibn Zur O.B.M. 




This document, which was written in Fez, on 
Heshvan 1791, was signed by R. Abraham ben 
David Ohayun and Rabbi Saadya. The two sons of 
the rabbinic scholar Solomon Samuel ibn Zur 
were Rabbi Raphael and his brother Jacob. The 
latter who was a bachelor, desired to formulate a 
contract to deal with the terms of the estate which 
their late father had left for them and their mother. 
They agreed never to dissolve the estate until 
parted by death. Jacob would be permitted to 
draw upon the estate for marital expenses since 
he was still unmarried. If any party violated this 
agreement by desiring to dissolve it, he would

Aaron’s desire that a document of transfer be 
drawn by R. Jacob Ibn Zur stating that Aaron has 
acquired the pledge and that Israel shall assume 
the responsibility for his brother Reuben and the 
latter's wife. If Reuben will put his assent to the 
transfer in writing, then this should be submitted 
so that R. Jacob Ibn Zur can formalize the 
document. When the procedures are completed, 
the final document of ownership should be sent to 
Aaron through the agent. The monies that are 
made available for this transaction are also 
mentioned at the end of the letter. R. Judah also 
wants a reply to the letters that he senttoR. Jacob 
lbn Zur in the previous week. 




that if it will cause difficulties then the effort 
should not be expended. Help will be available 
from another place. Some practices are 
suggested for fundraising. On joyful ritual oc- 
casions such as weddings and Brit Milah (circum- 
cision), it would be appreciated if money could be 
donated for Jerusalem. The communal reader 
should remind the people; also the synagogue 
treasurers should put in more effort. 




forfeit half of the rights which accrued to him both 
before and after the death of his father. Also each 
one would make available his half for the use of 
his mother. The liability would be limited only to 
those items that came under the terms of this 
agreement. If anyone should die, to be survived by 
daughters only, the latter were to be sustained 
from the estate until such time as they married, at 
which time they would be entitled to a proper 
dowry from the estate. If any one of the brothers 
died without leaving an heir then all these benefits 
would accrue to the surviving brother. The 
brothers would be unable to pass on their rights to 
a female heiress. If either brother died then his 
wife would be sustained by the estate until such 
time as she remarried. If she did remarry then she 
might take only 15 mitkalin of silver. 




A letter of greeting from Jerusalem to Fez which 
deals with the purchase of books 




This letter was written from Jerusalem by Elijah 
ben Jacob Kasis to Rabbi Raphael, referred to as 
Ham-Malakh (The Angel), in Sivan 1863. The 
author states that he recites prayers for R. 
Raphael’s family when he visits the graves of the 
Saints and he recites blessings at the Kotel ha- 




A son has aclaim against his father, the amount of 
which can be ascertained by a document held by 
R. Jacob Ibn Zur 




This is adocument signed by the rabbis Judah ibn 
Attar and Abraham ibn Danan of Fez written to R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur requesting that he supply informa- 
tion from a legal document that he possesses. 
This information will substantiate the amount ofa 
claim by Joseph ben David Elmaleh against his 




A document of sale of a Jewish communal 
enterprise in Fez when the community needed 
funds 




The Jewish community of Fez was in need of 
money, so the rabbinic court, consisting of R. 
Judah ibn Attar, R. Mimun Alfasi, and R. Moses 
ibn Maman, acted for the community and arrang- 
ed for the sale of a communal enterprise to 
Abraham ben Mahlouf ben Yitah for 1,200 ugiot. 
This document was drawn in the month of Elul 
1729. The terms of the contract are spelled out as 
follows: Only Abraham or those he designates 
may engage in the sale of alcoholic beverages. If 
he agrees to permit Saadya Lehaboz and Moses 
ibn Reuben ben Susan to serve as vendors they 
may do so. Any other person selling alcoholic 
beverages will be obliged to pay 10 uqia for each 
one hundred kilo. Those who prepare them for 
private consumption will pay five uqiot, and for 
those alcoholic beverages produced from raisins, 
figs, dates, almonds, and rice one uqiot for each 




Maaravi (Western Wall of the Temple). The books 
that were requested by R. Solomon Alaluf for 
Rabbi Raphael are unavailable, including the 
work of Harav Hukkei Hayyim, since the author’s 
son is presently abroad as an emissary for the 
Jerusalem community. Regards are sent to R. 
Solomon Ibn Zur, R. Jacob Ha-Kohen, ha-Nagid 
R. Abraham, Rabbi Abner Ha-Sarfati, R. Joshua 
Serero, R. Samuel Ha-Kohen and his brothers R. 
Moses and R. Isaac, and to R. Israel Maymeran. 




father, David, for his portion of his deceased 
mother’s estate. David has admitted that the 
document that requires him to pay the money of 
his departed wife to his son is in the possession of 
R. Jacob Ibn Zur. Since the son is not aware of the 
amount that is due to him and what the father 
wants to give him seems a small amount, strife has 
ensued between father and son. R. Jacob can help 
to resolve the matter by sending the document to 
either one of the two judges. 




one hundred kilo. For dealers in charcoal, one 
quarter of an ugia and olive oil; one quarter of an 
uqia whether it is pressed out in the olivepress or it 
is brought into the Mellah. Different amounts 
payable are enumerated such as one hundred and 
ten uqiot to Isaac Porat, sixty ugiot to Moses Ibn 
Susan, and two hundred and seventy uqiot to be 
paid to R. Moses ibn Maman as agent of the 
community. Even if the purchaser should benefit 
beyond the sum of three thousand ugiot the 
agreement must still be honored. On page 47pb, in 
an addendum, we are informed that the original 
transaction with Abraham ben Yitah as the buyer 
was nullified. R. Judah Bibas replaced Abraham 
ben Yitah as the purchaser with all stipulations of 
the contract remaining the same as before except 
that the price rose to thirteen hundred uqiot. 
Seven hundred uqiot was to be paid to Abraham 
ben Yitah with the balance going to whomever the 
community should designate. The latter transac- 
tion took place in Fez, on the third day of Tishri 
1729. The addendum to the earlier document was 
signed by R. Jacob Ibn Zur.

R. Jacob Ibn Zur is asked to return a confiscated 
article to a litigant after a dispute is settled. R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur sends a correspondence to R. 
Jacob Toledano 




R. Jacob Toledano sent a short correspondence 
to R. Jacob Ibn Zur concerning a monetary 
dispute between one called Saiyag and Judah ben 
Zazun. R. Toledano states that since the litigation 
has been settled R. Jacob Ibn Zur should return 
an article belonging to Judah ben Zazun which 
was previously confiscated because ofthe latter’s 
non-payment. R. Jacob |bn Zur’s correspondence 
to R. Jacob Toledano also appears. This letter is 
dated from Fez to Tetuan, Tishri 1741 and in itR. 
Jacob Ibn Zur complains that R. Jacob Toledano 
has spoken harshly of him because he has left a 
percentage of income from his synagogue in 
Meknés to his son R. Raphael Obed without 
informing R. Toledano. A quarter of the income 
was allotted to R. Toledano, although he is 
claiming that only an eighth part was allotted to 
him. R. Toledano has therefore referred to R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur as a cruel person. The latter claims 
that it is a most natural act to guard one’s own 
son’s succession in preference to someone whois 
not related. Besides, R. Toledano has been given 
a percentage towards his income apart from other 
sources of income that are available to him. R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur argues that if he had left out his son 
and given all toR. Toledano, then everyone would 
consider that he had wronged his son. The only 
one R. Jacob Ibn Zur has been cruel to is him- 
self, he states, as he enumerates a variety of 
transactions concerning himself where R. Jacob 
Toledano did not act fairly. 


One such occasion transpired on the death of 
R. Mimun ben Nissim when R. Toledano per- 
suaded R. Jacob Ibn Zur to lend him close to two 
thousand ugiot and promissory notes were drawn 
for this transaction which were in R. Ibn Zur’s 
possession until the time for payment arrived. R. 
Toledano used guile to secure those notes, 
claims R. Ibn Zur, and the money remained in the 
other’s possession unjustly for many years. On 
another occasion, says R. Jacob Ibn Zur, he held 
the promissory notes of one R. Meir Bibas and 
had refused to give them to R. Toledano, but the 




52 




latter pleaded that they should be placed with him 
and as a result R. Jacob Ibn Zur was unable ever 
to collect a penny on the notes. Once during a 
dispute R. Toledano had with R.M. Maymeran, in 
Meknés, he asked R.J. Ibn Zur for money which 
was given in payment for aloan. R. Toledano gave 
some volumes of codes in return which made up 
only a portion of the loan. R. Ibn Zur wanted to 
return the books, but they were refused. Once 
when R. Ibn Zur travelled to Meknés he left money 
belonging to some orphans with his son-in-law, R. 
Menahem Serero, 0.b.m. R. Toledano persuaded 
R. Serero to receive promissory notes for the 
money. When R. Serero passed away, R. Ibn Zur 
went to Fez where he found two sacks full of 
promissory notes. RJ. Ibn Zur confronted R. 
Toledano with the notes whereupon the latter 
admitted that they were his and he offered to sell 
them and to pay R.J. Ibn Zur, but in the event he 
never paid a penny. R. Jacob Ibn Zur had a bill of 
debt against R. Solomon Al-Mishaeli which was 
held by R. Ibn Zur’s cousin, R. Judah, the brother 
of the departed, called Isaac. R. Toledano asked 
to be able to collect the debt whereupon he would 
share half with R. Ibn Zur. Instead R. Toledano 
made a deal with the one who held the debt, 
whereby he received all and R. Ibn Zur received 
nothing. 


Jacob Ibn Zur faults R.J. Toledano as the 
cause of his wanderings and his migration to 
Tetuan because he couldn’t make a living in 
Mekneés due to R. Toledano’s manipulations. 
Apparently he returned to Fez for a short time 
because of his insolvency. R. Jacob |bn Zur's son, 
R. Reuben, was obliged to accompany his father 
in the latter's quest for financial stability. R. 
Reuben’s wife was obliged to remain in Salé due 
to these circumstances. R. Jacob Ibn Zur informs 
us that his only grandson has been born, in Salé, 
and that he has not yet had a chance even to see 
him. Since his quest for economic self sufficiency 
is unsuccessful he refuses to have his daughter- 
in-law suffer hunger on his account. In spite of all 
his suffering R. Jacob is falsely accused of 
wronging R. Jacob Toledano. R. Toledano is 
maintaining that he should have the total income 
of R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s synagogue in Meknés 
instead of just a quarter, while half goes to R. Ibn 




Zur and the remaining quarter to the latter’s son 
Raphael. R. Jacob Ibn Zur retorts that R. 
Toledano owes him much money which has never 
been paid even though funds were available. Even 
if R. Toledano couldn't pay a// of his debts he 
could atleast pay a portion of them. IfR. Toledano 
claims not to have available cash or movable 
property he still owns real estate, books, and 




A ms. of the collection of tales and aphorisms 
called Divrei Hakhamim Ke-Dérbonét 




[See also page 62a and b and Ms.160 on pages 
221a to 224b.] 




The title of this manuscript, Divrei Hakhamim Ke- 
Dérbdndt, is based on a verse which is found at 
the end of the biblical work, Ecclesiastes, 12:11. It 
means, “The words of the wise are like goads.” It is 
a compilation of aphorisms of the philosophers 
and sages including riddles anda tale concerning 
the wisdom of R. Saadya Gaon which contains 
Judaeo-Arabic statements. In our collection 
called Yalkut Roiim there are two such manu- 
scripts. Ms.36, which is found on pages 50a to 
52b, should have the additional pages 62a and 
b following it. The compiler of this collection 
mistakenly separated it from the other pages. The 
earliest copyist is noted as Yaabez (R. Jacob Ibn 
Zur) who also provides comments on some texts. 
Yaabez informs us (on page 52b) that he copied 
this text from an earlier manuscript which he 
expanded upon with comments and a more 
complete text than the original. 


At the end of the third line of page 62a we are 
informed that “The material given until this point 
comes from Yaabez while the texts given 
thereafter were copied by R. Solomon Elijah Ibn 




A eulogy 




This classical form of a Moroccan eulogy was 
written by one called Yehonatan. It may be 
surmised that he wrote this eulogy and letter of 




scrolls of the Law which could be sold for cash. In 
the face of all this R.J. Ibn Zur has never made a 
claim against R. Toledano in court but R. 
Toledano has the temerity to call R.J. Ibn Zura 
cruel man. The latter notes that justice would 
prevail if R. Toledano was obliged to sell his 
properties to pay his debts, rent living quarters, 
and suffer like those whose lot it is to be poor.

end of this manuscript, on page 62b. 


There is another manuscript in the Yalkut 
Roiim (pages 221a to 224b) which is almost 
identical to Ms.36; it is another copy of Divrei 
Hakhamim Ke-Dorb6n6t. This is Ms. 160 which is 
identical to Ms. 36until page 62a, where Yaabez is 
quoted as the copyist, except that Yaabez is 
identified as Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur and as “Yaabez, 
the son of R. Reuben, of blessed memory.” 
Thereafter a text is given which does not appear in 
Ms. 36. |t is recorded as part of what is found of the 
manuscript copied by Rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur. 
Another copyist whose name _ follows is 
Yehonatan Ish Sion Monsano, the son of Rabbi 
Bezalel, of blessed memory. There follows acopy 
of Abraham ibn Ezra’s riddle on his poverty which 
was copied from a Ms. by Rabbi Elijah Ha-Sarfati. 
Page 224b is titled “Maalt ha-Emet” since the 
opening statement deals with the subject of truth 
and falsehood. A number of statements and 
anecdotes follow, one of which is attributed to the 
RASHBA, author of a volume of Responsa in the 
Bension Collection. At the end of Ms.160, on page 
224b, the last copyist mentioned by the copyist of 
this manuscript is given as R. Immanuel Mon- 
sano, of blessed memory. Our final copyist is 
noted as Yehonatan Ish Sion Monsano, the son 
of R. Bezalel.

his son Reuben appears in Ms. 217.

An Halakhic text dealing with an alteration to 
one’s property which may infringe on private or 
public property 




One has a cistern in his house and he wants to 
direct the water that is flowing into his courtyard 
into another. cistern from which Reuben is 
drawing water. The owner of the courtyard can 
construct a conduit underground at a distance of 
at least three handbreadths removed from the wall 
of the house and at a depth of two or three 
handbreadths so that the clean water shall flow 
into his cistern. This procedure may be followed 
even in a courtyard held in partnership and even 
within four cubits opposite his partner's entrance. 
This decision was rendered by Maharam Mi- 
Trani, Volume two, No. 96 and by Keneset ha- 
Gedolah, No. 153. Another ruling, that of 
Maharam Galante, No. 85, states that water drawn 
from one well to another gives one property 
rights. 


One who builds opposite a synagogue must 
allow for a greater distance (than from a house) 
because a synagogue requires more light. The 
Beit Yosef on the code Orah Hayyim cited the 
Sefer Agudah who is mentioned by the Mahari- 
Weil in his Responsa, on this subject. 




A letter from the communal leaders of Sefrou to 
the rabbis of Fez concerning fundraising 
irregularities that arose during an emissary’s visit 




Raphael Maman writes to the three rabbis (of Fez) 
Saul ibn Danan, Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur, and 
Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati concerning the funds that 
were collected by the emissary from Jerusalem, 
R. Barukh Pinto, in the author’s community. The 
author reports that the collected funds were senta 
day earlier but he felt obliged to respond to the 
communication of the rabbis as to why the money 
was held up until this late date and as to why the 
sum is less than might be anticipated. It seems 
that R. Barukh wanted a larger sum than the 
community could produce at the present time. 
The writer mentions that he was among those who 
negotiated for the emissary with the leaders of the 
community whereby a compromise was reached 




54 




A case arose concerning one who wanted to 
build near asynagogue in Salonika and the matter 
was adjudicated in accord with the Agudanh, i.e.a 
synagogue requires the allowance of a greater 
distance by the builder than from a private 
domicile. The measure of distance that must be 
maintained is discussed by the Maharad Egozi in 
his Responsa as being eight cubits. However, if 
there is sufficient light for the synagogue even 
with a four cubit separation that sufficeth accor- 
ding to R.M. Egozi. The Keneset ha-Gedolah in 
Responsum No. 154 is also in agreement. 


Reuben and Simeon are neighbors who are 
dwelling near the public thoroughfare. Simeon 
builds a new addition to his house which 
protrudes into the public thoroughfare opposite 
Reuben’s window. The latter claims that the new 
addition should be dismantled since it causes him 
the discomfort of being exposed to his neighbor's 
sight. Simeon retorts that he left the necessary 
four cubits vacant; but in order to remove the 
cause of the complaint he is prepared to build a 
fence around his addition. Reuben replies that if 
Simeon builds a fence he will obstruct Reuben’s 
view of the length of the marketplace. The law is 
decided in Simeon’s favor. Thus do we find the 
decision rendered by R. Levi ibn Habib in No. 44, 
of his work. 




but the emissary was not present on that 
occasion. The expenses incurred by the emissary 
would be deducted up to one fourth of the income 
from the collection. The emissary finally agreed to 
this arrangement after refusing to do so at first. 
The writer notes that the emissary did not lose any 
money, since more than a quarter of the total 
amount was added to the regular collection. 
When the community leaders had to settle with R. 
Barukh before his departure he refused to pay the 
twenty-five percent which had been agreed upon 
as the expense of his upkeep. The writer notes 
that he counselled the emissary not to behave in 
this way because his actions would reflect upon 
all the scholars of the Holy Land. People would 
say that these scholars were not trustworthy 
people. R. Hayyim Elijah and the author accom- 
panied the emissary out of town and they 
continued to persuade him to take the money. 




Shortly after the emissary took the money hesent 
it back to R. Hayyim Elijah, writing that he found 
less than the proper amount without an explana- 
tion as to why the amount was deficient. It is 
because of the highly improper conduct of the 
emissary that the money was subsequently 
withheld until a later date. Furthermore, every 
precaution was taken to see that the proper sum 
should be received by the emissary excluding the 
possibility of theft on the journey. R. Hayyim 
Elijah is too trustworthy to be doubted as to the 
sum that he placed in the pouch before he sent it 




Calamitous conditions and strife are recorded in 
an early sixteenth century correspondence 




This letter is written by Aaron Ha-Kohen to one 
whom he regards as his master. The author 
reports on the diligence that Joseph, his son, has 
shown in his studies which will be to the satis- 
faction of the respondent. The author then 
describes the visitation of many natural and 
political calamities that have befallen him and 
some of his compatriots. Drought conditions 
prevail and anumber of his colleagues have been 
imprisoned and beaten. Among them are men- 
tioned R. Solomon ibn Daviera and R. Samuel ibn 




An emissary informs R. Raphael Ibn Zur of the 
trials and tribulations which hindered his mission 




This letter was written on the eighth of lyar 1876 
to R. Raphael Ibn Zur by the emissary of the 
Moroccan community in the Holy Land, Joseph 
the son of Moses Arwaz. The writer's signature is 
accompanied by a seal which is composed in 
three languages; namely, Hebrew, Arabic, and in 
the center of the seal a wreath wherein the Roman 
initials J.A. are inscribed. 


This letter commences with two paragraphs of 
flowery introduction. In the third paragraph, 
Joseph apologizes to R. Raphael for not writing 
sooner; however, the tribulations of his journey 
prevented him from doing so. He then reports on 
some of the hindrances he has encountered on 
his fundraising mission. 


When Joseph arrived in Debdou he stayed at 




to the emissary; in fact, he even added more 
money from his own pocket. Regards are sent to 
the rabbis and to the emissary (who is presently at 
Fez). 


R. Hayyim Elijah added a postscript to the 
letter, which is found on page 56a. He states that 
Joseph Ha-Kohen can testify about the money 
that was sent. Also the emissary was given 
seventeen mitkallin as a loan. Another eleven 
mitkallin was given to him by Shalom Abitbol and 
another person called Abraham; additional 
money was given to him by Aaron Elbaz. 




Saiivar. The latter’s son is imprisoned because he 
entreated His Majesty the King concerning his 
suffering at the hands of the leader of the Jewish 
community, referred to as the Nagid. An allusion 
is made to Moses, the anniversary of whose death 
is commemorated on the date the letter was 
written. The author states that more could be 
reported but the time is not propitious. Aaron 
cannot comprehend why one called R. Shemaya, 
who is also a Kohen, rose up against him. 


The script appears to belong to the first half 
of the sixteenth century. It is possible that it is 
the strife between the Megorashim and Toshavim 
in Morocco that is hinted at in this letter. 




the residence of Judah ibn Susan who was allied 
with the Kohanim. The Murciano family, who 
apparently feuded with the Kohanim, made sure 
that Joseph’s fundraising efforts would not be too 
successful. If anyone wanted to give a larger 
contribution the Murciano family prevented them 
from doing so. The ones who will suffer from this 
dispute are the poor of the Moroccan Jewish 
community in the Holy Land. Joseph’s journey to 
the villages of Arif was likewise unsuccessful 
since a libelous charge had been made that aJew 
had murdered a non-Jew, so he feared to travel in 
that area. Joseph would not permit R. Judah Leib, 
his associate, to travel there either for the same 
reason. Joseph was therefore unable to meet R. 
Abner and R. Raphael (to whom this letter is 
written) and he begs for their pardon. He 
describes his journey as a very unsettling 
experience. Regards are sent to R. Hayyim 
Kohen.

ibn WalidGn and Isaac Nahon of Tetuan to the

A legal document concerning the history of Fezin

This legal document begins with a dirge which 
describes the pillage of the Mellah of Fez in the 
year 1647. The Arab destroyers vented their 
venom in particular against the synagogues. They 
wanted to level the synagogues completely and 
with this threat they extorted money from the 
Jews. They said they would not be satisfied until 
they were guaranteed a huge sum of money. The 
community agreed to sell a pair of silver Torah 
crowns, made by the artisan ibn Rivka, to the 
scholar Issac Sarfati, the son of the scholar Vidal, 
of blessed memory, in order to realize the sum of 
money that was needed. The sum that was agreed 
upon for the Torah crowns was four hundred and

This letter was written by Elijah b. Jacob Kasis in 
1868 to the rabbis Ham-Malakh Raphael and 
Jacob. He informs them that he has left money 
collected in Meknés with R. Israel Maymeran 
who is supposed to forward the sum of three 
hundred and one durham to the rabbis. The 
balance of six hundred durham should be sent by 
them to Tangiers, to Joseph Achrigi through R. 
Hayyim Yemin Ha-Kohen. The letter to Joseph 
should contain another letter which should be 
forwarded to his (the writer's) son. The writer

recently passed on and one who was not 
numbered amongst those who had her best 
interests at heart made a claim upon her estate. 
The rabbis of Fez are asked to protect the estate of 
the departed Clara, first, by supervising the 
accumulation of all her assets and then by 
sending them to the rabbis of Tetuan who will 
apportion them to her legal inheritors. Thus false 
claims against the estate or its inheritors will be 
thwarted. 




twenty uqiot, according to the old standard of 
currency. The legal formuta for this transaction is 
then elaborated upon. The document was com- 
posed on the first third of Adar Il, in the year 1647. 
The sum of one hundred and seventy ugiot was 
used to pay the ransom so that the synagogue 
walls would not be levelled and the remaining two 
hundred and fifty ugiot were given in payment for 
the Torah crowns which were held as a pledge by 
R. David Alkazabi. The Torah crowns were in the 
possession of the congregation that prayed inthe 
Great Synagogue of the Toshavim. Among the 
five signers of this historic document were: 1. 
Shem Tob ibn Ramukh; 2. Saadya bar R. Samuel 
ibn Danan; 3. Abraham ibn Danan; 4. Benjamin 
Ha-Kohen bar R. Nahman; 5. Ephraim Ha-Kohen 
bar Manasseh. 




suggests to R. Raphael that if the money is already 
available to be sent to Joseph then his letter to his 
son should be sent with it. If not, then the letter 
should be forwarded to R. Hayyim who will 
forward it to the son. He asks them to use good 
glue by which to secure the letter, since he has 
none available. The writer requests of the rabbis 
to whom he is writing, as well as of the Nagid 
Abraham, that they should prevent wayfarers 
from coming to Sefrou from Fez since they cause 
the writer a substantial loss. It has been the Nagid 
Abraham’s practice to prevent wayfarers from 
coming in the past. The writer asks R. Raphael 
to hasten to fulfill all his requests, and he sends 
regards to R. Ham-Melekh Solomon, the Nagid 
Abraham, Menahem Saba, R. Jacob Dahan, 
Azuz Ha-Kohen, R. Joshua Serero, and Aaron 
Ha-Kohen. The address to this document is

A Kabbalistic Messianic Calculation 




This is a Kabbalistic manuscript using the biblical 
text of “Timheh Zekhr Amalek” (Deut. 25:19) to 
point to the year 1688 as significant for Messianic 
events. The numerical value of Timheh equals 
5,488 which also corresponds to four sets of six 
combinations of the word “Zekhr’ as the author 
tabulates them. The sum total of the four lines is 
5,448 as each line equals 1,362. In all probability 




A dispute over the estate of the late R. Samuel 
D’Avila 




[This document commences on page 65b and 
concludes on page 65a. The compiler bound the 
page in the book in reverse order.] The document 
deals with a legal judgement concerning the 
claims of the widow of R. Samuel D’Avila against 
her son R. Eliezer D’Avila. The mother originally 
claimed that her son’s half of the inheritance 
included Torah scrolls and Torah crowns, while 
the half that belonged to her and her daughters 
consisted of properties. R. Eliezer denied this to 
be the case and he took an oath. He agreed, 
however, that half of the properties should go to

Ham-Melekh Solomon and to all the scholars, 
including Menahem Saba, R. Jacob Dahan, the 
innkeeper Azuz Ha-Kohen, and to Raphael Elijah

the page the address is given. [Page 62a and b

this text dates from 1688. Page 63b contains 
mystical calculations based upon the Holy Name 
of God. Twelve lines of computation of the 
Hebrew letters of God’s Name are set out six 
terms to a line which result in the numerical value 
of 72. Pages 64a and b contain alphabetical 
calculations of the Hebrew word Yimlokh, “He will 
reign.” The implication is that God will reign and 
the enemy will be blotted out in 1688. Twelve lines 
with four terms to each line equals the number 48

his mother in accord with the custom and 
enactment of the Jews of Castile. Presently he 
stated that he had no properties available that he 
could hand over to his mother since some had 
been sold to realize money for her maintenance 
and others sold to pay his father’s debts. 
Additional properties belonging to his father had 
been deposited with the scholar and judge Jacob 
Gedaliah. 


It was decided that these properties should be 
divided between mother and son, but the son 
subsequently refused to divide them. Instead he 
said that he would use them to pay a debt to B’nai 
Yeshurun, which never had been recorded in 
contractual form or in the presence of witnesses.

This is one of a series of letters sent by Elijah b. 
Jacob Kasis to R. Jacob Ha-Kohen and R. Ham- 
Malakh Raphael ibn Zur of Fez. Here he informs 
the rabbis that on his travels from Fez to Sefrou he 
was the guest of the munificent R. Aaron Elbaz of 
the latter city, who also aided him in the collection 
of charity. The writer excuses himself for not 
having corresponded earlier as he was preoc- 
cupied with the collection of funds. He expresses 
the hope that the rabbis to whom he writes have 
forwarded certain letters for him and that they 
have collected some monies from Jacob ibn 




A query from Debdou concerning a complex 
problem involving real estate transactions 




Simeon Jacob ben Susan, of Debdou poses a 
Halakhic query concerning real estate transac- 
tions and he asks the rabbis to resolve the matter. 
We are not informed as to who the rabbis are. 
One who is designated as Reuben held land in 
partnership with his mother and sisters which he 
subsequently sold to another called Simeon, and 
guaranteed the value of the land for acertain sum. 
Reuben had additional land in partnership with 
Simeon. Reuben sold the additional land to anon- 
Jew but, in accordance with an enactment that 
land remains intact in the hands of the previous 
owners when it is treated as confiscated property

from Jacob Gedaliah and use it for any purpose 
she deems fit. 


The aforementioned document and judge- 
ment appears to be rendered by R. Jacob ibn Zur 
even though his name does not appear anywhere 
on this document. The script is characteristic of 
his style of writing. 




Na’im. The author also asks these rabbis to speak 
with Hayyim Yamin Ha-Kohen concerning

R. Saul, R. Mattitya, R. Abner, and R. Israel. Also 
regards should be sent to the prominent citizen 
Menahem Saba, to the scholar R. Jacob Dahan,

ill. He also asks to be remembered to R. Joshua 
Serero. In a postscript he sends regards to 
Solomon Halevi and Aaron Ha-Kohen. On the

with which one may not transact, the sale was not 
valid. The non-Jew sold the land to another Jew 
called Levi. Levi acquired the property rights from 
the vendors. The sisters of Reuben made a claim 
against Simeon and they wrested the land from 
him. Simeon arose and made a claim against 
Levi with his aforementioned property rights. 
Upon further examination it was learned that one- 
sixth of the aforementioned property rights 
belonged to Reuben. An evaluation was made as 
well as a proclamation concerning these property 
rights. The result was that Simeon possessed one 
part while Reuben’s rights consisted of one part 
and one-half. 


After some years, Simeon brought a claim 
against Levi because he said that he had found 




proof that the entire rights of the property 
belonged to Reuben. Levi responded that if in fact 
it was as Simeon claimed, then he would do 
whatever was necessary to restore everything to 
Reuben and that he, Levi, should be the recipient 
of one-sixth. Simeon claimed that the sixth was 
established to be his and if Levi didn’t turn over 
the remainder then he, Simeon, would claim it

The question: Reuben possesses a structure that 
houses furnaces which is located near the home 
of Simeon. An oven is located therein which many 
people use for baking. Simeon suffers much 
physical and monetary damage because of the 
smoke that is emitted from the oven even when 
the wind is normal. The walls of his house have 
become blackened from the soot. Reuben wants 
to add another oven to the structure. Simeon, 
upon hearing of this, has made a claim to prevent

A request for information about an historical 
chronicle and a copy of that work 




This letter was written to R. Solomon Elijah !bn 
Zur in the year 1866 by Judah Zarmon. The writer 
requests that R. Solomon should secure informa- 
tion concerning a manuscript of an historical 
work that is in the possession of R. Rahamim 
Gayni of Sefrou. R. Rahamim had promised to 




according to law. The writer turns to the rabbis to 
whom he sent this letter to respond whether the 
law is in accord with Levi, in which case the sixth 
that Simeon took was in error, because he was of 
the opinion that Reuben’s property rights extend- 
ed only to a sixth, or is the law in accord with 
Simeon? This document was sent from Debdou in 
the year 1870. 




the new oven from being added since heclaims to 
suffer so much from the first one. A decision is 
requested. 


The responsum: The law is in agreement with 
Simeon’s claim and Reuben is unable to add an 
additional oven since the smoke is injurious even 
with a normal wind. Even though the property 
damage is slight, (a mere blackening of the walls) 
still Simeon can prevent Reuben from building 
any further additions. The authority of R. Joseph 
Caro is cited in Hoshen Mishpat, chapter 155. 
Also the Haggahot Maimoniyyot, chapter 11 of 
the Laws of Neighbors, law number 7, in the 
Maimonidean Code, is cited.

A letter from Joseph Sasson of Jerusalem to R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur of Fez concerning book 
purchases 




The address of this letter appears on page 73a and 
the letter appears on page 73b. The letter was 
written in the year 1880 and was sent to R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur of Fez, by Joseph Sasson of 
Jerusalem. The writer notes that he wrote to R. 
Raphael a while ago and has not received any 
reply. Now Abraham ibn Simhon and his son have 
come to make some acquisitions on behalf of R. 
Raphael. Other books, purchased previously, 
were sent through the emissary Maharam Suzan 
with a list denoting all the books that were 
purchased. The writer is in constant contact with 
the book dealers that they should supply him with 




A plea to R. Raphael Ibn Zur to uphold a claim to 
an estate 




In Elul 1861, Moses Turgeman writes from 
Tiberias to R. Raphael Ibn Zur at Fez. He relates 
that in the year of the demise of King Mulay 
Mahmad he and his son Jacob, of blessed 
memory, desired to go to settle in the Holy Land. 
However, this desire never materialized because 




62 




should be copied and then sent through Samuel 
Ibn Zur. Judah asks to be informed of the cost of 
the copyists’ work and he will pay well. When he 
has perused the ten or fifteen pages he will give 
the permission for the work to be completely 
transcribed. 




a number of words are given in Judaeo-Arabic. 


In the same scribal hand a vertical list of books 
is given on page 72b. Among the titles are the 
following: Mikneh Avraham, Melekhet Shlomo, 
Simhat Yehudah, Heker Lev, Ohalei Yehudah 
Naggar, Devar Emet, Zera Avraham, Elef Kesef, 
Oseh Shalom, Sha’ar Ha-Zekenim, Zekan Aaron, 
Siftei Renanot, Penei Maivin, Shoresh Yosef, Lev 
Maivin, Kehunat Olam, Yavo Ha-Levi, Minhat 
Zikkaron, and Derash Avraham. This document 
was composed in the second half of the 
nineteenth century. 




the additional works that were requested by R. 
Raphael as soon as they are available. Payment 
for the books that were sent previously should be 
given to R. Jacob Ha-Kohen excluding three 
books that were sent as a gift. One book from 
Joseph Sasson isin place of the Sha’ar ha-Melekh 
that was requested but it was unavailable, and two 
books from R. Kubo, 0.b.m. Also two books are 
sent for R. Abner. The writer wants to know if 
these have arrived. 


Joseph entreats R. Raphael concerning R. 
Yeshua Halevi who apparently owes money for 
books that his son bought. The latter has been 
unable to pay due to illness. Therefore, Joseph 
asks R. Raphael to convey his regrets, and says 
that he has also reduced the price that he would 
have otherwise charged. 




of poverty and the illness and demise of his son. In 
spite of his poor economic condition Moses 
would not permit himself to live on gifts, although 
he had only enough to make ends meet from what 
he was able to earn. 


The writer continues that he has been in- 
formed of the death of Mahmoud Turgeman, may 
his soul reside in paradise, who was his brother- 
in-law (the brother of his wife). According to law, 




part of the estate of Mahmoud should come to 
him. Meanwhile, one called Jacob ibn Zimra, a 
man of means, has taken that portion of the estate 
that should go to his, Moses’, daughters. Moses 
has asked the permission of his daughters to

This legal document is written to R. Solomon 
Elijah Ibn Zur and to R. Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati of 
Fez by three rabbis situated in Sefrou. The latter 
were R. Rahamim Joseph Gayni, R. Raphael 
Moses Elbaz, and R. Saul Elbaz. [The compiler 
placed this document in the original compilation 
in such a manner that one part is on page 76a 
and the concluding part with three rabbinic sig-

letter is found on the reverse sides of pages 
76b and 79a. They are actually one page. ]

On page 77a a dowry is fully documented. The 
dowry was for the maiden Masuda, the daughter 
of Levi Magirz. It contained linens, a pillow, a 
tablecloth, pieces of silk fabric, and various gar- 
ments that made up the bride’s trousseau. On 
the bottom half of page 77a many names are 
recorded. Among them are the following: Isaac 
Hota, Moses Solomon Susi, Ephraim Jacob bar 
Moses, Jacob Maymeran, ——— Solomon Yom- 
tob Saadon, ——— Ephraim bar Solomon Susi,

Moses therefore appeals for justice for his 
daughters. He feels that since his wife has died he 
has no claims, but that his daughters’ claim 
should be upheld.

the land is in the hands of the inheritors of 
Mulayl’s wife in accordance with the ruling of the 
court in Fez. A half and an eighth of the upper 
levels of the structure are owned by the aforemen- 
tioned R. Elijah but they were further placed asa 
pledge in the hand of R. Yeshua Elbaz for more 
than three years. Other adjoining attics were 
given in pledge to Simha, the widow of R. Salim 
ben Hamo, and the pledge ended up in the 
possession of Elijah ben R. Solomon ben Asulin 
for the two upper stories. Elijah Asulin also held 
debts against the estate. The creditors of Sefrou 
demand prior payment by having the land 
evaluated and apportioned. They should be paid 
before Elijah since they have prior claims. The 
rabbis who are addressed are asked to compel 
Elijah to come to court or to send his agent so that 
prior claims can be paid and justice done.

Two Halakhic queries to R. Jacob Ibn Zur. The 
first concerns a possible levirate. The second 
concerns an inheritance 




[This letter commences on page 84b and con- 
cludes on page 84a.] Two halakhic queries are 
written to R: Jacob ben R. Reuben, of blessed 
memory, Ibn Zur, on Shushan Purim, in the year 
1749. 


The first query concerns a woman who gave 
birth to a baby prematurely at seven months and 
the baby died nineteen days later. The baby had 
hair and nails. The woman’s husband died 
subsequently. Is she obliged to go through the 
levirate ceremony? The one who poses the 
question notes that the code Even ha-Ezer,

This letter is written by Isaac Sabag to R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur, at Fez. The writer informs R. Jacob about 
all the vicissitudes he has suffered: loss of limb, 
destitution, and the death of his son. He mentions 
the tribulations that transpired on his way to 
Marrakesh. He states that he was the beneficiary 
of the hospitality of R. lsaac Morigon, who 
supports poor wayfarers at his table. Three of 
them ask for alms from door to door. The writer 
mentions that he is ashamed to ask his host to aid 




A correspondence from R. Judah Ibn Attar to R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur 




This letter was written by R. Judah ibn Attar to R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur on the twenty-first of Adar Il in the 
year 1720. R. Judah informs R. Jacob that he was 
chagrined to learn of R. Jacob’s illness and he 
prays for his speedy recovery. The writer also 
informs R. Jacob of drought conditions (in Fez) 
which necessitated the declaration of fasts, public

chapter 166:4, deals with the subject. 


The second query concerns an inheritance. A 
woman brought her possessions as her dowry to 
her husband’s house upon her marriage. (Her 
husband can hold these possessions. However, 
upon her divorce or death he must restore in 
specie, all these possessions, and he is responsi- 
ble for their loss or deterioration. This property is 
designated as Nikhsei Zon Barzel.) This woman 
has died and so has her husband, who was in 
another country. The woman had stated in her will 
that she wanted her niece, her brother's daughter, 
to inherit. The question posed is can the niece, 
who is poor, inherit the aunt’s possessions? The 
anonymous person who poses this question 
states “that the law is in accord withR. Jacob (Ibn 
Zur) everywhere.” 




his plight. The writer requests that R. Jacob ibn 
Attar should be asked to give aid to the members 
of the writer's family in his absence, since they are 
in a poverty-stricken condition. There was 
another person named R. Jacob Ibn Zur who died 
and the writer appeals to R. Jacob Ibn Zur to act 
on behalf of the widow. R. Jacob is asked to write 
to Elazar Arwah and one called David to help 
secure property that once belonged to Yahya 
Lekra for the deceased Jacob Ibn Zur’s heirs. R. 
Moses Berdugo can’t act for the heirs since he is 
at presentvery ill. The writer asks R. Jacob lbn Zur 
to pray that he may return home safely from his 
journey.

R. Jacob that two weeks ago he hurt himself in

The rabbis of Tetuan ask the rabbis of Fez to 
uphold the claim of Abraham Ibn Zerah to the 
estate of his sister , 




This letter was sent by R. Jacob ibn Malka and R. 
Moses Bibas of Tetuan to the rabbinic judges of 
Fez, and signed by the former on the fourteenth 
day of HWeshvan 1756. The subject of this 
document is the claim of Abraham ibn Zerah 
called Musi, for his sister Donna, the widow of R. 
Yaabez, whose legacy fell to him after she passed 
on. Abraham’s brother Solomon was missing and 
therefore was not included in the legacy. 
Abraham claims that there were properties of the 
estate recorded in her marriage contract with her 
second husband apart from what was stipulated 
for her in her marriage contract with her first 
husband. 


The rabbis of Fez are asked to support 
Abraham against R. Raphael lbn Zur who is a 
stepson of Abraham’s deceased sister. Both claim 




R. Saul Serero protests a ban placed by the Holy 
Land communities against the community of 
Tetuan for appropriating charity in times of need 




This is a copy of a manuscript originally com- 
posed by R. Saul Serero to the rabbis in the Holy 
Land who have unjustly pronounced the ban 
against the community of Tetuan for withholding 
funds originally designated for charities in the 
Holy Land. The rabbis of the Holy Land are 
evidently not aware of the dire conditions and 
severe taxation prevailing in Tetuan in this most 
troubled of times. R. Joseph Bibas of Tetuan, who 
has been taken to task by the rabbis in the Holy 
Land has pleaded with R. Saul Serero to reply to 
them. R. Saul berates the rabbis in the Holy Land 
for rashly using the ban; particularly since 
rabbinic luminaries of earlier generations such as

Since the widow has decided to go to Meknés R. 
Jacob is asked to prepare her brothers for her 
arrival. 




the right to receive all the monies that are due to 
her estate. Until such time as the rabbis render 
their decision all those monies should be held by 
R. Saul ibn Danan. Any monies that R. Raphael 
might have belonging to this estate should also be 
surrendered by R. Saul ion Danan. All additional 
properties of a movable nature belonging to 
Donna, which are not stipulated in the marriage 
contracts, that are outstanding, should likewise 
be held by R. Saul ibn Danan. 


The rabbis should inquire about the second 
marriage contract that was held by R. Samuel ibn 
Elbaz, which was also attested to by the elderly R. 
Joseph ibn Attar who accompanied her when she 
married her second husband. Therefore, the 
rabbis should request the marriage document of 
the widow of R. Samuel ibn Elbaz, and upon 
reviewing all the conditions set forth therein let 
them render their final decision on the matter. A 
note of consolation is added on the recent demise 
of R. Mimun ibn Adhan, of Fez, on Saturday 
evening, the seventh of Heshvan 1756. 




R. Joseph Colon, the Rosh, and Rabbenu Tam 
permitted funds earmarked for charity to be 
appropriated for other pressing purposes in times 
of distress. Furthermore, the resident scholars of 
Tetuan should have first been informed of the 
contemplated ban. This was the procedure 
followed when the rabbis in Morocco had to 
exercise a ban against the smaller communities; 
they always informed the scholars of that com- 
munity first. R. Serero affirms the love of the 
western communities, especially Tetuan, for the 
Holy Land communities; but times are bad in the 
west so aid cannot be forthcoming at present. 
Three scrolls of the Law have already been sent to 
Algiers to be sold to pay obligations to the 
emissary of the Holy Land, Abraham Pariente. 
The letter concludes with the hope that times will 
become better and the western communities will 
again resume sending money to the Holy Land. 




R. Judah Ibn Attar implores R. Habib Toledano to 
intercede with a non-Jewish creditor on behalf of 
Abraham Ibn Danan 




This letter is written by R. Judah ibn Attar to R. 
Klabib Toledano on behalf of Abraham ibn Danan. 
In this troubled period ibn Danan owes adebttoa 
non-Jew, Lehajj Adayl, who is demanding pay- 
ment before the date the debt is due. The non-Jew 
is a candidate for a royal position as the third in 
charge of the chariots for the royal entourage. He 
therefore needs the money immediately in order

the month of Kislev 1722, to R. Jacob Ibn Zur by 
Menahem Attia in response to a letter received 
from the former. It deals with two different cases. 
The writer states that in regard to the first mattera 
compromise was finally achieved after the clai- 
mant was convinced that his claim was given 
proper consideration, especially since a decision 
had already been rendered on the matter by a 
scholar.

The importance of perfecting the skills of the 
artisan in performing tasks for preparing or re-

is discussed by Uri, the son of David Levi, of 
blessed memory. Biblical and Talmuaic texts are 
quoted in support of this viewpoint. The prepare- 
tion of the parchment to best receive the ink when 
writing Torah Scrolls is elaborated upon. It is 
noted that R. Samuel Aboab, of blessed memory, 
was concerned that the concoction used to 
prepare parchments might become an obstruc- 
tion between the parchment and the ink that 
comes into contact with it. This would invalidate

The writer states that R.Y. Caro was a con-

Zur, had it from his father, R. Solomon Samuel Ibn 
Zur 0.b.m., that he saw R.Y. Caro’s signature. R. 
Solomon Elijah records that the prophet Elijah 
revealed himself to R. Judah ibn Attar. Also that R.

in the seventh year after the demise of the 
aforementioned R. Aboab, the author claims to 
have devised a method whereby it is unnecessary 
to apply some other material to the parchment to 
achieve the desired results. He states that he 
discovered this by experimentation even though 
he is not a scribe by profession. The method is 
then fully described. 


The last section of page 119b deals with 
methods of correcting mistakes in a Torah Scroll. 
In the last paragraph the problem concerning the 
impression left by the Divine names of God is 
discussed and R. Samuel Aboab’s concern in this 
matter is mentioned. [This page is not the con- 
clusion of the subject matter under discussion

Saul b. David Serero begins by relating some 
misfortunes. A famine between 1604 and 1606 
took the lives of about eight hundred dwellers in 
Fez. More than six hundred are mentioned as 
having been .converted. The roads were dan- 
gerous because highwaymen abounded. Sui- 
cides were also reported. A lamentation was 
composed on the twentieth day of Adar 1606 for 
the community of Fez. The famine claimed the life 
of R. Jacob ibn Attar among close to three thou- 
sand souls who also succumbed.

This letter is written by Amor Abitbol to R. 
Raphael Ha-Sarfati of Fez. The writer states that 
he accompanied R. Isaac Abitbol to appease R.Y. 
Elbaz, who swore that he had only received half of 
the money in question, the other half having gone 
to his nephew Mordecai Elbaz. After being spoken 
to he was prepared to return a certain amount 
from his portion. 


R. Raphael is also informed of an enactment by 
the community of Meknés in the matter of 
inheritance laws, namely, that the inheritors have 
the prerogative of paying a widow only the value 
of her marriage contract when the estate is large. 




An appeal is made to R. Raphael Ha-Sarfati to 
convince an intransigent debtor to pay his debt

Samuel (son of Saul ibn Danan) writing on 
Thursday the tenth of Tevet 1724 reports a famine 
that lasted for three years, from 1721 to 1724, and 
a drought that continued for four years. The price 
of wheat was quoted at 135 ugiot. Every year the 
“Ba-Ha-B” circuit of fasts was constantly observ- 
ed and added to. Great convocations were ob- 
served in 1773 at Meknés, Salé, and Sefrou. Torah 
Scrolls were brought forth. Rain began to fall and 
continued for three days. The price of barley was 
reduced and wheat was quoted at 60 uqiot. In 
the month of Tevet the price went up again to 
135 uqiot. The author informs us that the misfor- 
tune in Fez was indescribable. [Another part of 
the chronicle is found on pages 127a and b.] 




lf, however, the estate is small they may divide it 
with the widow. An orphan has informed the 
writer that in his case he followed the ruling of 
Mahari Berdugo and only paid the value of the 
marriage contract. If a protest was going to be 
lodged then he would increase the amount. In the 
present case Mahari Elbaz and his nephew have 
permitted the orphan to take all that remained 
over the value of the wedding contract. The writer 
informs Mahari Berdugo that in this case the 
enactment of Meknés will not be in force since the 
woman was married in Sefrou. Even though they 
subsequently moved to Meknés the customs of 
Sefrou on these matters should prevail. The 
author states that he is aware that Mahari 
Berdugo is adamant in following the custom of 
Meknés. However, he should at least try to reacha 
compromise. In the earlier case, R.Y. Elbaz is 
vindicated. If it were possible to satisfy the orphan 
they would have done so. Now, however, the 
orphan can only be convinced to follow the law.

called Abraham ibn Azuz to pay his debts to R. 
Elbaz. Abraham lived in an apartment belonging 
to the writer for some years after 1822. The apart- 
ment has now been sold but Abraham still has 
not paid his debt. In the year 1829 he was called 
to a judgement on this matter and Abraham 
sought the help of R. Jonathan, of blessed 
memory. The latter convinced the writer to let 




Abraham pay his debt in installments because of 
the embarrassment involved. R. Raphael is in- 
formed that he will receive the bill of debt that 
will indeed show that such was the case. The

This letter, which commences with an introduc- 
tion in Hebrew followed by a Judaeo-Arabic text, 
is sent by Samuel Halevi ibn Yulee toR. Immanuel 
Monsano at Fez. Greetings are sent to R. 
Immanuel’s daughter and his son-in-law R. David. 
Also Jacob Ibn Zur is alluded to. The writer 
informs R. Immanuel that he did everything in his 
power to oblige R. Jacob ben Simhon to pay the 
money that he owed to the estate belonging to R. 
Abraham, the late father-in-law of R. Immanuel 
Monsano. R. Jacob did, however, place the 
money in the safekeeping of a third party until a 
copy of the will of the late R. Abraham could be 
made available. Samuel asks R. Immanuel either

This Aggadic exposition refers to three texts from

Each text contains a form of the Hebrew word 
“Gronum.” The subject deals with the merit of the

On page 122b a list of names appear next to 
numerals. The days Thursday and Friday are

dispute can be resolved. The contract that is in the 
possession of R. Joseph Ohanah is still awaited. 


Samuel informs R. Immanuel that the reason 
that he does not reside in his former domicile is 
because R. Sammai Masrafi made free lodgings 
available to him while the status of the previous 
dwelling was involved in a litigation. It is possible 
the case could be reopened so that there is an 
element of insecurity involved in living there. A 
book of accounts will be forwarded to R. 
Immanuel as soon as R.Y. Maragi has time to 
make certain corrections therein. The garment 
that R. Immanuel inquired about is not presently 
available, but another kind is available for pur- 
chase. The writer inquires if the book Maharam 
Zabara is available. If so it should be sent through 
the person of R. Solomon Edery or Joseph Al- 
mosnino who is coming to the writer's city. 
Samuel asks that the letter should be given to

The chronicler, Serero, reports an incident 
(one of a series, we gather), concerning the two 
wicked sons of Hamdun, a non-Jew, who entered 
the Mellah and spent the night in the house of a 
divorcée whom they raped while a few immoral 
Jews offered a musical accompaniment. Some 
brigands, attracted by the music, entered the 
house, beat the Jews, and murdered the two sons 
of Hamdun as well as a third non-Jew who was 
with them. The author feared that the wicked 
Hamdun would spend his wrath on the Jews, 
himself included, in retaliation for the lives of his 
sons. The king was not in the city, the writer 
informs us. He himself sought refuge in the house 
of an Arab official to whom he reported all that 
had transpired. He then began to send messages 
to many of the officials of the realm and to the 
Nagid, R. Jacob Roti, who accompanied the king. 
After many bribes were given, his safety was 
assured. The wicked Hamdun appealed to the 
king who informed him that his charge was false. 
It was not the Jews but the brigands who killed 
his sons and, the Qadi of Fez added, the brigands 
would probably kill Hamdun too.

Ms. 91 and Ms. 92, is part of a small collection 
of writings. It consists of about twenty-two lines 
of verse. The theme deals with a prayerful peti- 
tion to the Almighty in times of trouble. 




In the month of Heshvan 1622, the king went 
to the city of Qazzar when he heard that his 
brother Mulay Mahmad had been chased from 
there. 


The brigands finally came to the author's 
home on the fifteenth of Kislev and tried to gain 
entry through the window. The author's brother, 
R. David, noticed about ten of them and was shot 
at by arrows but he and his brother cast stones at 
the intruders until they fled. The chronicler 
informs us that he went to Sefrou in the month of 
Kislev because of the violence in Fez. He 
remained there for fifteen days whereupon the 
community sent messages on his behalf from the 
king and Officials to the Sheikh Ali, who ruled the 
village of Sefrou, to provide protection (an escort) 
to enable him to return to Fez. 


On page 127b we are informed of upheavals in 
the community of Tafilalet and how the majority 
of Jews suffered death, pillage, and starvation 
during the siege of that community. Others were 
sold into slavery and the synagogues were 
destroyed. The Nagid was hanged. 


On the eve of the new month of Sivan, King 
Mulay Abdallah became ill and on the night of the 
fourteenth of Sivan he died. After his burial, his 
brother Mulay Abd Almalkh, who was fifteen 
years old, was crowned in his stead. The political 
situation was stabilized and travel to Sefrou 
became safer except for the wicked Almatein 
who subsequently rebelled against the king in the 
month of Elul. After a Friday service the ninety- 
year-old Qadi was killed on his return from the 
king’s palace. He was reported to have been 
favorably disposed to the Jews, and they mourn- 
ed his passing. Apparently conditions grew worse 
for the Jews, since all the king’s actions were now 
influenced by the official Ali ibm Musa. He took a 
certain fixed sum of tribute from the Jews. 


On Sabbath eve, the twenty-second of lyar 
1625, there was a great rumbling and an earth- 
quake.

This document is written to R. Samuel Elbaz of 
Fez by the Rabbis Jacob Toledano and Mimun 
Adhan of Meknés concerning the claim of Isaac 
ibn Haroush against Hayyim ibn Magiruz. Isaac 
held a pledge against a portion of a courtyard 
called Zar Asbaga which Joseph ibn Amram ibn 
Tata sold for 700 uqiot of silver thereby forfeiting 
his rights to the courtyard. The time to make good 
on the pledge before it would become forfeited

four subsequent occasions Isaac sent formal 
legal claims, but no response was forthcoming. 
On his arrival in Meknés Hayyim had stated that 
when he returned to Fez he would ask R. Samuel 
Elbaz to forward additional information which 
would support his case, but Hayyim had never 
taken this action and his stalling was making a 
mockery of justice. Now if a satisfactory answer 
was not forthcoming then within a month Isaac 
would exercise his claim to all parts of the 
courtyard. Both parties to the dispute had been 
instructed by the undersigned rabbis to write toR. 
Samuel Elbaz concerning the litigation, on the 
same day that this letter was written. This would 
insure that R. Samuel could forward a speedy 
reply and the matter could be resolved.

assigned to the younger son, David. Joseph

This letter which is in metaphoric style was

Raphael by an emissary from the city of Safed. 
The writer, Abraham, informs R. Raphael that he

A letter from the Holy Land to rabbi Raphael Ibn 
Zur of Fez 




This letter was sent by Abraham ibn Walid of 
Jerusalem in 1873 to R. Ham-Malakh Raphael Ibn 
Zur of Fez and it also mentions R. Raphael’s son 
Solomon. The author apologizes for not being 
able to write sooner. He states that his brother and 
sister and her sons have just arrived from the west 
and he is busy caring for their needs. Concerning 
certain books he replies that Rabbi Zuf Devash

eighteenth day of Shevat 1874. The original was 
drawn up on the twenty-eighth day of Tishri 1873. 
The witnesses to the original will were R. Aaron 
Ha-Kohen, and R. Joseph ibn Aaron Hamo. The 
witnesses to the copy were Abraham ibn Jacob 
Ha-Kohen Skali and Solomon ibn Joseph ibn 
Hamo. 




indeed the report is true then R. Mordecai asks R. 
Samuel to substantiate the matter by providing a 
written statement of the witnesses and their 
names. If the witnesses had already been cross- 
examined by the Rabbinic Tribunal (in Fez) then 
apparently nothing could be done to reverse the 
judgement. Even so why would the plaintiff be 
encouraged by R. Samuel to inquire of the non- 
Jewish authorities to force the defendant to 
comply? R. Samuel is asked to stop the non-Jews 
from interfering in the matter, “As if we have not 
sufficiently suffered by their actions.” This letter

and to the innkeeper Mahlouf and his son. The 
author relates that he is presently in a city of 
scholars, at Sefrou, and that he enjoys their

R. Raphael to send a letter in the former's name to 
the city of Taza concerning their contribution to

A letter from the Holy Land to R. Raphael Ibn Zur

This letter is sent to R. Raphael lbn Zur asking him 
to aid an emissary who is referred to as R. Aryeh. 
The latter has been sent to collect funds for the 
purpose of building a synagogue in the Holy 
Land. The author expresses his regrets that he 
was not able to find a book that R. Raphael 
requested. It was called Torah Hadashah. The 




author of this letter states that he offers prayers 
for the health of R. Raphael at the tomb of R. Meir 
Ba’al Ha-Nes on the occasion of the anniversary 
of the death of the Saint. This letter is written in 
anticipation of the arrival of the aforementioned 
emissary in the west. The letter will be borne by 
Elijah Asulin who is returning to Fez after 
spending some time in the Holy Land. The letter 
cannot be too lengthy since Elijah Asulin has to

Aresponse is given to the query as to what point in 
time one attains his majority, in a lengthy letter 
written to R. Menahem Serero 




This correspondence was written toR. Menahem 
Serero, at Fez, on the twelfth day of Adar, in the 
year 1719. The author is R. Jacob |bn Zur who was 
situated in Meknes when he wrote the letter. The 
author informs us of his inability to take solid or 
liquid nourishment because of his illness and of 
his need to take medicine before prayer services 
and before recital of the Kiddush on Sabbath 
morning. Then he takes up the issue as to when 
one attains one’s majority. Whether it is on the 




first or second day of the fourteenth year which is 
thirteen years and one day or thirteen years and 
two days. “It is obviously attained by the age of 
thirteen and one day and far be it for me to have 
stated that it was thirteen and two days. The next 
question is, must a full twenty-four hours of the 
first day transpire before the majority is attained 
or as soonas the first hour of that day commences 
is it attained?” The author admits to having erred 
because of the influence of his illness when it 
was noted that he stated that the day of birth was 
regarded as belonging to the thirteenth year when 
it is indeed common knowledge that it belongs to 
the fourteenth year. The name of Judah ibn

Mahmias is noted as the messenger who 
transmitted the erroneous calculations of the 
author that misled R. Menahem Serero. Before the 
author had a chance to correct his error the 
messenger was gone. The writer mentions that 
his son Reuben fell and remained in a stupor for 
a long time but is now recovered. The writer asks 
R. Menahem Serero to transmit the former’s 
advice to the sons of his master R. Vidal Ha- 
Sarfati, of blessed memory, that they should not 
initiate a litigation unless certain conditions 
can be met first. 


The writer mentions that he had received 
information from R. Musa Halevi and R. Menahem 
Serero that two pairs of pants would arrive for him 
but only one pair has arrived and the matter is still 
in doubt. The writer inquires about the wellbeing 
of R. Menahem Serero’s father who was beaten by 
a non-Jew. Concerning one Joseph b. Glaqon the 
writer says he refuses to intervene since he is 
closely related to him and that if he must be 
removed it is better to have someone else do it. 


R. Jacob Ibn Zur mentions a new liturgical 
piece that he has composed; as soon as it is 
prepared he will make it available to R. Menahem. 
The writer notes that R. Menahem complains that 
the former never refers to the latter’s children in 
his correspondences. R. Jacob responds that R. 
Menahem never inquires concerning the wellbe- 
ing of the writer’s grandchild, Mattitya. R. Jacob 
informs R. Menahem that the latter's cousin Saul 
will soon be married to a young maiden, an 
orphan, of the Ben Ezra family. Saul was a son of 
R. Menahem’s late uncle, of blessed memory.

Zadok to R. Menahem. 


R. Jacob Ibn Zur states that he composed a 
prayer of praise for recital at Yishtabah (a juncture 
in the morning prayer service) and another 
liturgical poem for Kaddish. The latter poem deals 
with the commandments of the Zizit (prayer 
shawl) and Tefillin (phylacteries). These poems 
were chanted publicly on the new month of Adar, 
when R. Jacob's son, Obed, was publicly initiated 
into the performance of the aforementioned 
commandments. The writer informs R. Menahem 
that he includes a copy of these liturgical poems 
in the present letter, to be used especially for 
youngsters on their introduction to the com- 
mandments. R. Jacob requests that the poems be 
read on the occasion of the initiation of his 
brother’s son called Reuben, which will take place 
either on the new month of Nisan or thereafter. 
Also David b. Pargon received a copy of the 
poems. If anyone who is a payytan (a master of 
liturgical compositions) desires to copy these 
poems R. Menahem is informed to tell David b. 
Sigron to make them available to them, for they 
were composed for the benefit of all. The letter is 
signed by R. Jacob Ibn Zur. The address appears 
on page 144a and the following six lines appear on 
page 144b. “From the money that you collected,

An edict against unfair pricing 




Three judges of the Rabbinic Court of Fez, acting 
for the community, have issued an edict against 
unfair pricing. The undersigned rabbis are R. 
Jacob Serero, R. Jacob Ibn Zur, and R. Reuben 
Serero. This legislation proscribes using dis- 
honest weights and measures. The butchers are 
pointed to as prime violaters. Even if they increase 
the price only by pennies, they are guilty of theft 
and of robbing the poor. The members of the

The neighbors are acting within their rights when 
they try to prevent any alteration of the existing 
furnace. A decision was rendered on this matter in 
the Code of Jewish Law, chapter 132, by the 
Maharshakh. The author of Hut ha-Meshulash, 
responsum number 17, makes the point that 
even if modifications are made they can fall 
into disrepair and therefore no new installa- 
tions shall be added. The judgements of Ramban 
and Rashba that are cited by R. Joseph Caro, 
in chapter 154, paragraph 16, of the Code of 
Jewish Law, are also against such installation. No 
names of rabbis or individuals contemporaneous

A letter to R. Yedidia Monsonyego of Fez 




This letter, which was sent to R. Yedidia Mon- 
sonyego, discusses a halakhic matter which is not 
easy to comprehend since the script is not easy to 
decipher. Some of the authorities that are cited 




A responsum concerning claims made on an old 
loan by inheritors of the late creditor shall be 
honored if the upheavals of the times make it 
impossible for the original claim to be made 




Many years before, a creditor, designated as X, 
had two bills of claim where land was stipulated as 
being pledged against a debtor, Y. Those who 
have now inherited the bills of claim after two 
generations want to make a claim against the 
debtor’s family of inheritors, can they do so? The 
counter argument of the debtor’s family, that the 
debts were probably paid because the creditors’ 
family never made any claim during all those 
intervening years, does not stand because of the 
upheavals that transpired during the days of the 
arch-enemy Sahiq Tamia Galul. He it was who 
pillaged the area of the inheritors of R. Aaron Ha- 
Kohen and the records disappeared until they 
were unearthed at a later date. The creditor 
complained to the King Mulay Slieman and he 
was subsequently killed and his claims con- 
fiscated. The inheritors of the debtor tried to 
claim that their inheritance could not be tampered 
with in such a situation, whereas the inheritors of 
X claimed that since the land was placed as a 
pledge for non-payment the claim did stand. If the 




are the Maharashdam, the Maharshakh, and the 
work Tumat Yesharim. It is conceivable that the 
subject relates to a litigation concerning proper- 
ties.

letter. 




latter are vindicated, then they question whether 
they may claim the value of the produce from the 
date of death of Y, who received the loan initially? 


The response is given in favor of the inheritors 
of X, the creditors, with regard to the debts. 
However, the rabbis are notso sure as to theclaim 
on the produce. They base themselves on the 
Code, Tur Shulhan Arukh, chapter 61, who bases 
himself on the Rosh, his father. The Beit Yosef, 
Rabbi Caro’s commentary, is also mentioned. 
Also the Haggahot Ha-Tur 13:14 and the Rash- 
dam are cited. A distinction is made in the afore- 
mentioned citations between an indication of 
falsification of a claim that has lapsed over a 
period of time, and one where the circumstances 
are such that the claim may still be pending 
because of upheavals which made the particular 
documents of proof previously inaccessible so 
that it could not be acted upon. 


A more recent decision is cited which is more 
similar in its circumstances to the case before us. 
The judges in that case are the Rabbis Saul 
Serero, Judah ibn Attar, and Raphael lbn Zur. The 
last two are recorded to have been deceased at 
this time. The year of this document is given as 
1874. The signatories are Aaron Ha-Kohen Skali 




and Samuel Gayni.

A letter from the Holy Land to emissaries 




This letter was sent by R. Samuel Ha-Kohen of the 
Holy Land to the emissaries R. Mimun Aflalo and 
R. Jacob ibn Danan in Fez, on the eighth of 
Heshvan 1684. A part of the letter is written in 
Judaeo-Arabic words. A document from the 
widow of R. Azriel Ashkenazi has been sent to the 
emissaries. R. Samuel informs them that the 
monies will be personally apportioned. Some 
money has been sent with the emissary R. Hayyim 
Ashkenazi; other money with R. Moses Wagil and 




82 




R. Mahlouf ibn Hamo, but until now no response 
has been. received from them. Additional funds 
should be sent to the judge R. Benjamin Duran, to 
the city of Algiers, upon the reception of letters 
with requests sent by the writer. It is important to 
avoid tardiness in these matters. A new emissary, 
R. Joseph Ha-Kohen, is being appointed in the 
hope that he will be blessed with greater success. 
Prayers are recited for all at the Kotel (Western 
Wall of the Temple compound) and in the acade- 
my during studies. The address is given on the 
other side of the page.

This letter is written to the Rabbis Elijan Ha- 
Sarfati and Matitya Serero of Fez by ascholar who 
is in great distress economically. The writer 
berates the aforementioned rabbis for not paying 
attention to his plight. He appears to be in transit 
or to have recently moved, since his books are not 
available for him to quote textual sources for his 
comments which, he claims, abound in rabbinic 
sources. He reproves the rabbis for not arousing 
the compassion of the populace to his needs. This 
activity on their part would serve to arouse the 




Novellae on Jewish law and a responsum 




On pages 160a and 160b, novellae on the Codes of 
Jewish Law are recorded. The subject “Ain 
Shaliah Le-Devar Averah” (the power of agency 
does not apply in the case of perpetration of 
transgression) is discussed.

A correspondence from R. Mordecai Berdugo 
that includes two Halakhic queries 




This letter is written by R. Mordecai Berdugo (of 
Meknés) to R. Abraham Monsano of Fez. He also 
sends greetings to R. Immanuel (probably a 
Monsano). A letter had been written, but returned 
and the present letter incorporates the contents of 




84 




between one half and one third of that which the 
seller paid for it himself. This was done because 
the Maymeran family was very pressed financially 
at that time. Therefore Samuel asks the under- 
signed to write to R. Jacob !lbn Zur to intercede on 
his behalf with R. Shalom. R. Samuel feels that 
only then will justice be done. The two under- 
signed are Abraham b. David Hasin and Hananiah 
b. Zikhri. 




multitude to acts of charity. Furthermore, he has 
always helped those in need such as was the case 
when some had to journey from Fez to Larache. If 
the rabbis are desisting from helping him because 
they feel intimidated, he tells them that the very 
opposite should be the case. The people are 
wondering why the rabbis have not issued a call 
for aid. In the days of the Hasmoneans one feared 
intimidation, but not in “our days,” he says. He 
states that he is prepared to sell whatever he 
possesses to pay his debts; however, more funds 
are needed. He informs his correspondents that 
the Nagid has placed additional taxes on him. AR. 
Jacob Halevi is also mentioned. The author of 
this letter may be R. Jacob Ibn Zur. 




other objects that come later) and “Ain Osin 
Mitzvot Havildt Havildt,” are discussed. 


On pages 162a to 164a a responsum is pre- 
sented concerning one who interrupted the 
blessings of the Sh’ma in order to respond to a 
“Davar She-be-Qedusha” and then neglected to 
recite the blessing “Ga-al Yisroel” and immediate- 
ly began to recite the Amida. 


All the texts from page 160a through page 164a 
are written by the same hand. 




the previous letter as well. The writer adds that ifa 
letter has already been sent to R. M. Adhan, at 
Tetuan, then another note should be sent 
concerning a Torah Scroll belonging to R. Elazar 
Zadok that is in the synagogue of R. M. Adhan. 
This letter should be so written as if R. Abraham 
Monsano initiated it himself. He should write that 
when he was in Meknés a plea was made to him to 
do so. Inquiry is also made concerning the 




wellbeing of Rabbi Yaabez who was known to 
have been ill. Greetings are sent toR. Samuel. The 
writer notes that he sent a decision to R. Jacob 
concerning Moses A Sayaig and he requests it or 
at least a copy of it. He also asks that a purchase of 
some material should be made for him, since he 
has heard that a scholar from the ibn Siqron 
family acquired it from one Levi ibn Lahdav. The 
writer asks that it should be sent with R. Y. Rosilio 
and the former will make immediate payment or 
he will send the money. 


R. Mordecai asks that the replies to two 
questions should be sent to him through 
Maharibez (R. Jacob Ibn Zur) but if he is not free 
to reply then he should ask Maharsha (R. Samuel! 
Elbaz) to do so. The first question concerns two 
partners; whether their contract is to be con- 
sidered like all writs of obligation so that one 
cannot state “| bought your interest,” or is it to be 
treated only like a deposit, in which case he can 
say that he paid half of it back? Then what force 
does the original contract have? If it is to have 
legal force, surely he should be able to collect 
even from inheritors or one who might have 
bought that portion of the partnership. R. 
Mordecai notes that this is an old dispute and it 
requires resolution. 


The second question refers to two Jews who 
had houses in a courtyard belonging to a non- 
Jew. The two houses fell in and the non-Jewish 
owner of the courtyard wanted to take down 
whatever remained standing and to appropriate 
the beams. However, he said if there was a 




A plea to review a previous judicial decision which 
was reversed by rabbi Jacob Ibn Zur as a result of 
the submission of new evidence 




R. Jacob Toledano writes this letter in response to 
an authority, who remains unnamed, concerning 
a transaction that became a subsequent case for 
litigation. The case concerns a gift that Re’SH’M 
gave to Re’SHa’kH. The latter was the previous 
year in Meknés. Then a dispute arose between 
Re’SH’M and R. M. Edery and those who inherited 
from R. Saadya Kohen. Presently, R. Toledano is 
asked to recall what transpired at the time that the 
gift was given. Was the gift given by the instru- 




customer who would buy the courtyard he would 
not take down the remaining beams. Reuben, one 
of the two Jewish owners of the houses, lived in 
geographic proximity to the non-Jew, but Simeon 
had moved away. Reuben wanted sufficient time 
to inform Simeon and to ask whether he would 
like to buy the courtyard. The non-Jew was 
impatient and wanted to leave the city and said 
that if they did not acquire the courtyard 
immediately he would take everything apart. 
Reuben, pressed as he was, decided to buy the 
courtyard rights by himself from the non-Jew, 
excluding Simeon entirely. He had witnesses 
attest to the fact that this was his intention. Now 
Simeon has come with a claim against Reuben 
demanding that his rights in the courtyard should 
stand and saying that he will pay Reuben for half 
of it. Reuben has countered that Simeon has no 
Claim, since if Reuben had not bought the rights, 
everybody would have lost the courtyard. 


Rabbi Mordecai supposes a hypothesis. If a 
third party had bought the courtyard from the 
non-Jew, would that purchaser have acquired the 
courtyard with all its buildings levelled? Since this 
would have been the position for the non-Jew 
with respect to the building rights, the only rights 
that Reuben and Simeon should have extend only 
to the price of the bare land on which their 
buildings once stood.

the last part of the famous signature of R. Morde- 
cai Berdugo is visible, at the conclusion of the 
letter. ] 




ment of a document or was it given orally? R. 
Toledano replies that he doesn’t recall whether a 
contract was formally drawn up or whether it was 
an oral transaction. His colleagues who joined 
him on that occasion also have poor recollections 
of those events. The writer states that a request to 
confirm a decision rendered by R. Hasan ibn 
Lahsin has still not been responded to. The latter 
has been informed that R. Jacob Ibn Zur once 
wrote opinions on the case because new evidence 
had become available, thus making it like a new 
query and not the questioning of an earlier 
decision. R. Toledano asks the one to whom he is 
writing to seek one of the litigants who dwells in

his vicinity who has acopy of the ruling that he (R. 
Toledano) and other scholars had rendered. 
Perhaps that litigant also has a copy of the ruling 
rendered by R. Jacob Ibn Zur? Even though the 
scholars of the west rely upon R. Jacob Ibn Zur, R. 




R. Mordecai Berdugo responds to R. Jacob Ibn 
Zur concerning a dispute over an inheritance 
amongst the members of the D’Avila family 




This letter is in response to a previous Cor- 
respondence sent by R. Jacob |bn Zur concerning 
an inquiry about wine barrels that one R. Judah 
D’Avila was said to have had in his possession. 
The wife of Moses, son of Jacob D’Avila, has 
replied saying that R. Judah left no more than 
three barrels in his storage from days gone by. 
Apparently, her husband, Moses, is a grandson of 
R. Judah D’Avila, as is the present claimant, 
Judah D’Avila. The aforementioned Moses has 
begun to curse vilely all those making inquiry into 
the extent of R. Judah D’Avila’s estate. R. 
Mordecai Berdugo, wanting some factual infor- 
mation, has suggested that two people should 




R. Mordecai Berdugo has received a legal 
decision from Jacob Ibn Zur and he asks that R. 
Jacob help to achieve a compromise 




R. Mordecai Berdugo informs R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
that he has received the latter's written legal 
decision and that he is happy to note that R. 
Jacob’s decision is in agreement with R. 
Mordecai’s account book and not on the first book 
as Harit (R. Jacob Toledano) would have it. The 
writer says that the custom of Castilia remains the 
final guide for R. Jacob Ibn Zur. The first woman 
involved pleaded with R. Mordecai to initiate 
moves that would produce a compromise. The 
writer states that he will not do anything until he 
receives permission from R. Jacob Ibn Zur. 
Therefore, the writer pleads with R. Jacob !bn Zur 
that he call to the maiden Shazbona and persuade 
her to be willing to compromise. R. Mordecai has 
assured her that the result of the compromise 
would leave her with a higher sum, while R. 




86 




Toledano writes, perhaps another insight can be 
arrived at by his correspondent thereby preser- 
ving his own earlier decision. R. Toledano asks 
that a new ruling based on such an insight should 
be forwarded to him. 




enter the storage area to see for themselves that 
such is indeed the number of barrels, i.e. not more 
than three. R. Mordecai mentions that he has tried 
to achieve a reconciliation whereby Judah D’Avila 
would receive a certain number of barrels, 
because he wants to acquire the barrels 
elsewhere if necessary before the winepressing 
season is over, with R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s permis- 
sion. It seems that the Maharit (R. Jacob 
Toledano) also wrote a ruling on the matter which 
would leave Judah D’Avila empty-handed. R. 
Mordecai Berdugo asks R. Jacob Ibn Zur to 
decide either in accordance with the former’s 
ruling or with the Maharit’s ruling. In either case R. 
Mordecai requests a speedy reply. Both rulings 
are included in this correspondence. [An aspect 
of this case is discussed in Ms.119—page 168a, 
which is a subsequent correspondence from R. 
Mordecai to R. Jacob Ibn Zur.] 




Mordecai now notes that only a smaller sum 
would be available. R. Mordecai says that he will 
not act unless he can first hear what R. Jacob Ibn 
Zur intends to do. R. Mordecai suggests that it 
would be best if a compromise could be reached 
because Harit (R. Jacob Toledano) is stubborn 
while the women who are involved in the litigation 
are incurring losses. Therefore, R. Mordecai feels 
that R. Jacob Ibn Zur should persuade the second 
woman to be a party to a compromise which 
would bring the litigation to a quick conclusion. 
R. Jacob is asked to inform the writer as soon as 
he is able to convince the woman to agree to 
compromise. 


Concerning the barrels [see Ms.1718, page 
167a] R. Mordecai states that he purchased five of 




‘them and when they arrive he will send them toR. 




Jacob Ibn Zur with the first sojourner. The writer 
signs as Mordecai Berdugo. 


In a postscript R. Mordecai writes that when 
ReSHakH comes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur he will speak 




at length concerning the matter and he will bringa 
document which R. Jacob should ignore or even 




A correspondence from Raphael Halevi to R. 
Solomon Ibn Zur of Fez 




Raphael Halevi commences his correspondence 
by noting that he has received a letter from R. 
Solomon Ibn Zur. He states that he is confronted 
with the problems of old age and that this affects 
his writing. The information that R. Solomon Ibn 
Zur has provided concerning R. Y. Simhon’s 
account is news indeed. The writer informs R. 
Solomon that on a number of occasions R. 




A classic legal document of guarantorship 
involving the Ben Shaiya family drawn up by R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur 




This legal document was formulated by R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur in the month of Adar 1744 at Fez. The 
principals who agreed to serve as guarantors are 
Reuben the son of R. Jacob b. Aharpi, who is 
known as Ben Shaiya, and Samuel the son of 
Mas'’ud ben Aharpi, called Ben Shaiya. These men 
admit that they received a certain sum of money 
from Masuda the daughter of Israel ben Aharpi, 
called Ben Shaiya. They agreed to make payment 
to an orphan, Luna, the daughter of Musa ben 
Aharpi, called Ben Shaiya. An attic was given asa 




An enactment by the community of Sefrou 
concerning the dispensation of charity 




The Rabbis Hayyim Elijah (Gayni) and Saul ibn 
Elbaz write to the rabbis Raphael lbn Zur and 
Aaron Ha-Kohen of Fez concerning an enactment 
that the elders of the community of Sefrou have 
passed with regard to charitable contributions. 




A court action guarantees a compromise 




Mordecai ibn Abraham ben Zazun brought a 
claim against Mimun ibn Ayush ben Halfon based 
on a bill of debt that the latter owed the former for 




destroy. The writer signs the postscript with his 
initials Marbiz. 




Hayyim ibn Danan has written to say that an

illness of the eyes prevents him from engaging in P. 169a 




more activity. The writer, Raphael, states that 
upon his return from Meknés he will communicate 
with him. R. Solomon’s report that Mas’tUd “built 
his house” (got married) is again news. Raphael 
extends blessings to R. Solomon Ibn Zur’s only 
son who bears the same name as the writer, i.e. 
Raphael. The writer reminds R. Solomon that 
when he was in Rabat he wrote that he was not 
intending to return to Fez. 




pledge by the aforementioned Reuben and 
Samuel to the aforementioned Masuda. It is 
adjacent to the yard owned by David b. Amozag in 
the Mellah of Fez, with all other rights of tenancy 
applying to her. 


Apparently this document was drawn up with 
only one witness in attendance. Thus R. Im- 
manuel Monsano and Elijah ben Zimra have 
certified this document thereby correcting this 
situation. The addendum which was written for 
this correction also states that one called Israel, 
the son of Saadya (a brother of the aforemen- 
tioned Reuben) acted on behalf of his uncle, while 
Samuel acted for himself. Those present 
reiterated all the foregoing with Masuda in the 
presence of the court. 




Whenever a scholar arrives from Fez for a 
charitable collection he should present an official 
receipt issued by the rabbis of Fez for the amount 
of money which the community of Fez gave to 
him. He will automatically receive one-third of 
that amount from Sefrou. This does not apply to 
what individuals should desire personally to give 
the emissary.

between the contending parties. The terms of the 
compromise stipulate that Mimun should pay one 
hundred and forty ugiot over the amount that was 
already paid to Mordecai, thereby freeing himself 
from any subsequent claims that might be made. 
Mimun also agrees to drop any counter-claims. 
However, since Mimun is fearful that Mordecai 
will violate the terms of the compromise, the latter 
has stated in the presence of a rabbinic tribunal 
that he agrees to uphold the terms of the 
compromise and has engaged in legal forms to 
show his intentions. The agreement between the 
parties is now formulated in a legal document. 
Dates are stipulated for Mimun to complete his 
payments to Mordecai, who is also reminded of 
Mimun’s devotion in not handing Mordecai over 
to the authorities for producing a faulty product. 
The court will act in this matter with the power of 
“that which the court declares ownerless so shall 
it remain.” If any protest is registered against the

A formal statement is added on page 173b

and R. Moses Berdugo, by lsaac Nah6n, concerns

However, no response has been forthcoming; 
perhaps the exigencies of time have prevented 
such a response. When the parents of the woman 
heard that R. Saadya Halevi and R. Shem Tob ibn 
Walid were leaving the community for Meknés 
they asked them to intercede on her behalf that 
she might be granted justice. Thus, R. Isaac

the claim is true, to expedite the matter. Also R. 
Moses Berdugo is asked to give his opinion on the 
case. 




widow of R. Reuben is concerned about the future 
welfare of her daughters, lest they should meet 
with death or some other terrible fate because of

accord with his many talents and the excellence 
that he manifested in all those fields of endeavor. 
They offer consolation to the bereaved family and 
praise R. Raphael as the one who will succeed his 
late father. In a one line postscript mention is 
made of some books that were placed in safe- 
keeping and it is asked whether they should be 
forwarded to R. Raphael. This letter was written

A court action reprimanding a scribe for assum- 
ing the authority to serve as a judge 




This document is a court action rendered in 
agreement with the communal leaders against 
Jacob ibn Malka who for many years assumed 
judicial power by signing his name to responsa 
and legal documents without having received any 
authority to do so. Since he was a scribe he 
utilized the opportunity to add his signature to 
legal documents that he had occasion to com- 
pose, thereby giving the impression that he was 
appointed as a judge with the other undersigned 
judges. 


A decree is thus handed down that Jacob ibn 
Malka shall never add his signature to any legal 
decision or responsum either by himself or with 
other scholars. Nor shall he communicate with 
scholars of other countries concerning any 
matters pertaining to law. He shall not exceed his 
authority as a scribe of the court in accord with 
the practice of other scribes who are in the service 
of the court. He is only permitted to arbitrate and 
to compose documents of arbitration. If he 
violates any of the aforementioned terms then he 
shall be judged accordingly and the Nagid, the lay 
leader of the Jewish community, Samuel Halevi 
ibn Yulee, shall order him to pay a fine as he sees 
fit. This court document is dated Heshvan 1732 at 
Fez. The rabbis signing the documents are R. 
Judah ibn Attar, R. Jacob Ibn Zur, R. Shalom 
Edery, R. Abraham ibn Alel, and R. Samuel Elbaz. 
The document is affirmed by R. Moses ibn 
Maman, R. Aaron ibn Saadon, R. Judah ibn 
Moses, R. Moses b. Abraham ibn Ashikh, R. 
Moses ibn Shitrit, R. David Aspag, and R. Israel 
Adhan. The two signatures certifying this docu- 




ment are those of Joseph Sigqron and Mimun b. 
Joseph Busidan. The document gives the follow- 
ing background information. 


When the Great Rabbi (Judah ibn Attar) died, 
the rabbis instituted a practice that two lectures 
should be recited each day at morning and 
afternoon services in his memory for a period of 
thirty days. R. Jacob ben Malka did not attend 
either to lecture or to listen, nor did he even visit 
the cemetery. This was considered an affront 
since R. Judah ibn Attar, as holder of the title Av 
Bet Din (head of the court), and as the greatest 
rabbi of the generation, was considered to be the 
great master and all his students (including R. 
Jacob ben Malka) were obliged to pay respects to 
his memory. 


Three months later Jacob ibn Malka called 
all the scholars and communal leaders to his 
synagogue to hear his lecture. He used the occa- 
sion to insult the scholars by intimating that he 
was superior to all of them, adding that the mem- 
bers of the court were also his inferiors. He after- 
wards lobbied members of the community to 
give him a document stating that he had legal 
standing as a judge. However, they were not 
persuaded to do so. He also asked them to attest 
to his impeccable character. In fact, incidents 
were enumerated to demonstrate the opposite. 


Jacob was known, for example, to have con- 
tradicted the rulings of the head of the court, 
and on another occasion he had cursed the 
grandson of the Rabbi. In the year 1731 the Rabbi 
(Attar) rendered his response to a query from 
Sefrou which he signed together with the mem- 
bers of the court, but when the document reached 
the hand of Jacob ibn Malka the response was 
contradicted and the decision reversed. On many

occasions Jacob ibn Malka had been noted for 
his insulting manner. At one time he had received 
a stipend from the community but when his 
negative attitude became evident it was taken 
from him. Even then he would not acknowledge 
that the stipend was a grant, but viewed it as a debt 
owed to him by the community.

A plea to the rabbis of Fez to enforce a judgement

This document is written to the rabbis of Fez and 
to the scholar R. Moses Grimeau asking them to 
render justice on behalf of a woman, Miriam, the 
daughter of R. Joseph Navét. Her husband, R. 
Isaac, the son of R. Daniel Sas, has made her a 
living widow for the past five years by abandoning 
her and her small son without any financial 
support. An earlier correspondence to the rabbis 
depicted the abject condition of this neglected 
wife. The writer of this document notes that on 
this same day the woman found her husband to be 
unfaithful to her. The rabbis of Fez are asked to

this purpose. If the husband remains intransigent 
then the rabbis are asked to ensure that he will pay

the amount of 4500 golden denari, her dowry and, 
in addition, all the unpaid support that is coming 
to her from previous years. Also a proper bill of

confronted the debtors who had no funds 
available to make payment. However, the debtors 
were able to send 100 uqiot which is a portion of 
the debt. The money was given to R. Hayyim ibn 
Mas’ud ibn Magirz, who dwells in R. Jacob Ibn

the author’s community, with instruction to hand 
it to the creditor.

Sasportas in the amount of 140 weights of silver, 
as Stated in the bill of debt. Meanwhile, David’s 
creditors are pressing him for payment of a debt 
owed to them. Therefore, R. Judah ibn Attar is

Abraham, the son of Moses called Hazit, and Isaac

complaint against Yom Tob ibn Saadon bar 
Yissakhar, a gangster terrorizing the area of 
Tafilalet by committing the most vile kinds of 
crimes. He has engaged in immoral sexual acts to 
satisfy his lust thereby causing many husbands to 
divorce their wives. He also is known to function 
as an informer against the Jews to non-Jewish 
leaders and the Jews suffer the consequences. A 
case in point is the suffering he has brought upon 
the people of Sefrou, and this is well Known to 
those who dwell at Fez. His lust for money has 
contributed substantially to the suffering of the 
Jews.

obstacle to the marriage taking place he agrees to 
pay fifty uqiot of silver. Similarly if the bride will 
not be given to the groom in marriage at the 
appointed time agreed upon, then the bride’s 
father agrees to pay the groom fifty silver ugiot for 
his disgrace. This document was drawn up on 
Monday, the twenty-sixth of the month of Nisan, 
in the year 1649. A piece of land was given as agift 
by Legima, the mother of the groom. 




after he was freed from prison, he threatened to 
inform further against the Jews to revenge his 
imprisonment. The aforementioned men who 
testified against him at the rabbinic court claim 
that he wants them to bear false testimony against 
those witnesses who earlier spoke against him, 
namely, against R. Mahlouf ibn Simhon, R. Moses, 
the latter’s son, and R. Ayush b. Attias. They state 
that they will not bear false testimony. In fact, they 
maintain that any testimony they might have 
given heretofore must be suspect as having been

came to the court at Fez and testified concerning 
the character of Yom Tob saying that he was 
responsible for causing monetary losses to many 
Jews all the time that he was in Tafilalet. Another 
who testified against Yom Tob was Joseph the 
son. of Abraham, the son of Shitrit, of Tafilalet, 
now residing in Fez, who stated that Yom Tob 
informed on the Jews, thus causing them 
monetary losses. 




A dowry in the tradition of the Toshavim 




This dowry is part of the booklet of recorded 
dowries [see Mss. 139 to 141, on pages 197-199]. 
The name of the bride is given as Simha (daughter 
of R. Slieman ibn Meshash) and that of the groom 
as R. Joseph (son of R. Mimun ibn Harbon). The 
total amount of the dowry is valued at 4800 uqiot 
of silver. The custom of the Toshavim is to be 
followed. This document was composed on 




Wednesday, the seventh of Nisan 1649. The 
father of the groom has also given land to his 
son. Two signatures appear at the end of this 
document. The first signature, although blurred, 
appears to be that of aperson called Jacob Halevi, 
while the second signature is that of Ezra Di 
Paridosh, the scribe whose signature is found on 
the top of page 199a of Ms.1417. In all probability 
this document was composed in Marrakesh. [The

Ha-Zevi Me’at Devash corresponds with R.

books 




This letter was sent by Ha-Zevi Me’at Devash of 
Jerusalem to Raphael Ibn Zur, of Fez on the 
twelfth day of Heshvan 1873. The writer mentions 
that two volumes of the Code, Hoshen Mishpat 
(on civil law) with all the commentaries, as well 
as the work Netivot Mishpat and the book Kezot 
ha-Hoshen, were until recently unavailable, but 
now he has been able to acquire them. He has 
also acquired the Code Even ha-Ezer. The price 
for books has increased. A certain edition of 
the Scriptures is still unavailable. 


The books which are being sent by the writer 




to R. Raphael are arriving via Gibraltar through 
the agency of Moses Halevi. Two other books that 
are arriving are Ginzei Hayyim and Birkhat 
Mo’adekha L’Hayyim, Part Il, by the author 
Hayyim Palaggi, of blessed memory. They are 
being sent by the son of the author of those works, 
R. Abraham Palaggi, head of the Academy, at 
Izmir, Turkey. In a postscript the writer informsR. 
Raphael that the aforementioned R. Abraham 
Palaggi sent his father’s books to R. Raphael, but 
that the latter never responded or sent any money. 
The author's stamp appears on this letter. It has a 
picture of the Western Wall of the Holy Temple 
compound at its center, with the writer's name 
and domicile at Jerusalem stated on the border of 
the seal.

A legal document concerning a paternity suit 




This document, which is signed by the rabbis 
Abner Israel Ha-Sarfati and Raphael Ibn Zur of 
Fez, was written on the twenty-fifth day of Tishri 
1876. After the death of her husband Joseph, a 
woman called Leah and her two daughters were 
given refuge at the home of the valorous woman 
Simha, the daughter of the late Hillel ibn Samuel, 
and a relative. Leah was soon discovered to be 
pregnant. Leah testified that she became preg- 
nant from Moses, the son of Judah ibn Samuel, 




and that she had had no sexual relations with 
anyone else. Moses was sent for and he admitted 
to having had relations with Leah, except that he 
claimed that she seduced him at the house of the 
aforementioned Hillel. He stated that he thought 
that she was a wayward woman. Leah claimed 
that Moses seduced her. The court, after having 
established his guilt, punished him severely for 
taking advantage of the woman and for not marry- 
ing her. He was flogged and fines were exacted 
from him. [Calculations appear on page 204b 
as well as the name of Jacob ibn Simhon.]

Tevet 1834-35. It concerns a woman whose 
husband has been dead for twelve years. The

because he was still too young she was not sent to 
him. Subsequently, another two candidates have

on Tuesday, the tenth of Kislev 1841. The writer

A dispute concerning real estate involving the

judges of Tetuan: R. Judah Abudarham, R. Judah 
Coriat, and R. Solomon Abudarham. The litiga- 
tion concerns R. Elijah Monsano who is disputing 
with his uncle, Hayyim Monsano, and a cousin 
over property which seems to be related to an 
inheritance. The rabbinic court in Fez has not 
been able to deal with the matter since the 
authorities are related to the disputants, and are 
thus disqualified. R. Elijan Monsano had invited

A. Biton, who had not been well and who informed 
him that the emissary R. Hayyim Romano, of 
Hebron, who is presently in Tetuan, having 
departed from Gibraltar before the writer’s arrival 
there knew the son to have been in the Holy Land 
and to be a prosperous scholar of note. R.A. 
Biton did not write concerning Joseph because of 
his poor health. Additional information concer- 
ning the son can be derived from R. Hayyim 
Romano if R. Raphael Menahem would write to 
him. The writer also reminds R. Raphael about a 
litigation concerning the prosperous Isaac Ben 
Zaqen to which he should turn his attention so 
that justice will be done. The writer offers to

apparently the parties from Fez had failed to

Abudarham, and the young R. Abraham Mon-

adjudicate the matter where both parties have 
now agreed the matter shall be dealt with. The 
rabbis of Fez, Samuel Ibn Zur and Saul Serero, 
ask the rabbis of Meknes to complete the 
judgement, in the year 1788. This document was 
certified by Judah Ha-Kohen and Raphael Moses 
Elbaz on a subsequent occasion, because the 




matter was not adjudicated until many years later.

The Nasi complains to the rabbis of Fez about the 
breakdown of authority and the injustices of the 
times 




This letter was written in Judaeo-Arabic to the 
rabbis of Fez, Raphael Ibn Zur, Isaac ibn Danan, 
and Solomon ibn Danan, on the fourth of 
Heshvan 1880. The writer (the Nasi) complains 
about the injustices that are rampant in the 
jurisdiction of the above-named rabbis and 
further, blamed them on these rabbis and other 
members of the community. One such incident 
reported to the writer by Jacob Ohana concerned 
the injustice perpetrated by Judah ben Agrir. 
Judah had gone to the ruler to inform on a Jew 
who owed him nothing more than rent. What is 
more, he bribed the ruler with twenty Real and the 
man was put in prison for four days without a trial 
and then locked out of his house. All this 
transpired on the eve of the New Year. False

A litigation that resulted in a compromise 




This legal document was written in Sefrou, onthe 
day of the new month of Marheshvan 1868. It was 
signed by the judges of Sefrou, the rabbis Hayyim 
Joseph Gayni and Hayyim Eliyahu. It discusses a 
dispute between David, (son of Jacob, son of 
Wahnish) and Moses (son of Abraham, son of 
Siso). The aforementioned David has presented a 
business contract and demanded that Moses 
make payment on the principal and the dividends 
according to its terms. Moses, on the other hand, 
claims that he has incurred many losses and that 
the conditions of the contract are therefore null

On another occasion Mimun b. Haroush told 
Elijah Kasiba to take a kilo of meat for him. Elijah 
didn’t take the meat and was beaten for it until he 
was near death. Then there was the neighbor of 
Jacob Ohana’s aunt who received a flogging 
when ben Agrir tried to force him to attend a 
rabbinic court. When he refused the claimant, 
David Edery, demanded that they go to the ruler. 
The aforementioned ben Agrir forced him there 
bodily. After hearing David Edery’s complaint the 
ruler imprisoned the plaintiff and refused to let 
him go. 


All of the aforementioned troubles have arisen 
because disputants go to the ruler instead of to 
the rabbinic courts. The Nasi, head of the Jewish 
community, registers these complaints with the 
rabbis who now undertake to intercede in the 
matter to help this unfortunate Jew who has the 
highest references from Meknés.

law is in accord with him with regard to profits 
provided he swears that he didn’t make any. 
Moses further claims that he left sacks as security 
with David who has sold them without Moses’ 
knowledge or permission. Moreover, a number of 
the sacks that he gave to David are missing. After 
much bickering they have compromised in the 
following manner: Mahlouf, Moses’ brother, has 
bound himself to pay a’sum of forty mitkalim (one 
mitkal equals ten of the smallest coin denomina- 
tion of the realm) to David. David has dropped his 
claim against Moses and accepted responsibility 
for the lost sacks. All further claims are dropped.

The settlement of an estate by a mother and her 
daughter has implications for the daughter’s 
forthcoming marriage 




R. Solomon Kohen (son of R. Jacob Kohen o.b.m. 
Skali, of Debdou) died, leaving a widow, Masuda 
(daughter of Salem Ha-Kohen) of Fez and a small 
daughter, Esther. Masuda’s marriage contract 
was in accord with the customs of Castilia 
whereby she was obliged to divide the whole 
estate, movable and immovable property, in half 
between herself and her daughter. After a time 
Masuda married Judah (son of Simon ben Betito, 
called Askouri) and brought as her dowry that 
remaining from her first husband’s estate. There 
remained in Debdou a certain amount of movable 
property and land. 


Now her daughter Esther has attained a 
marriageable age and become betrothed to 
Joseph (son of Mordecai Saba o.b.m.) of Fez. 
However, Joseph has discovered that his bride- 
to-be has only about twenty uqiot for her dowry

and he wants to break the engagement, even 
though he is promised her portion of what 
remains of the estate in Debdou. 


There is no alternative but to divide in half also 
that portion that the mother has taken, and what is 
in Debdou must also be equally divided between 
mother and daugnNter. Originally, the mother took 
the best part of the estate for herself and left the 
daughter that part which would only realize its 
true value over a period of time because it wasina 
more remote place. Masuda and her second 
husband, Judah, now persuade the groom not to 
break the engagement, promising to withdraw all 
claims to any further part in the properties at 
Debdou and to give all of it to Esther for her 
dowry.

this document, which was written in Fez, it un-

The transmission of contracts from Fez to Meknés 




This letter is written by R. Judah ibn Attar to the 
rabbis of Meknés concerning three contracts that 
had been placed in his possession for safekeep- 
ing. One of these contracts had been written for 
Mas’Ud ben Isaiah who resided in Meknés. One 
day the son of the aforementioned Mas’td, 
Samuel, had approached him asking for the 
contracts because he was acting for his mother. 
R. Judah did not have the contracts with him at 
that time so Samuel asked that they be sent to 
Meknés as he was leaving Fez. The contracts 
found their way into the possession of a young 
man, Judah ibn Jacob Saba and subsequently

It is written by Jacob Ibn Zur for the scholarly 
R. Abraham Halevi (son of Barukh Halevi, a 
descendant of the author of the Tosafot Yom 
Tob) who is engaged in collecting funds for the 
redemption of captives. The writer asks that 
every comfort, hospitality, and charitable offering 
be extended to this lofty guest as he travels for the 
worthiest of causes. If he, in turn, should appoint 
an emissary, then similar treatment should be 
accorded the emissary. It appears that R. 
Abraham Halevi comes from the Holy Land. 




into the possession of R. Reuben ben Isaiah at 
Meknés. The rabbis of Meknes are now asked to 
obtain Mas’Ud’s contract so that it might be 
forwarded to his wife before Reuben ben Isaiah 
leaves Meknés. Mas’td has left the area for a 
distant place, so the contracts had been sent to 
Reuben, who is his son-in-law, according to the 
instructions of Samuel. Originally, a letter had 
been brought from the mother by her son Samuel 
instructing that the contracts be sent to her but, R. 
Judah ibn Attar notes, it is not the practice to 
engage in these legal transactions with a woman 
and therefore the son was sent to act in his 
mother’s stead. The rabbis of Meknés are asked 
to oblige Reuben, the son-in-law, by surrendering 
the contracts to his mother-in-law. 




one witness who can testify to the husband’s 
death although normally two witnesses are 
needed. At first R. Mordecai wanted to prohibit 
her from marrying by contending that the 
testimony of one witness was_ insufficient. 
However, he now feels that one witness is 
sufficient. R. Mordecai asks R. Jacob to offer 
arguments in support of his decision. R. Abraham 
Monsano will bring this letter to R. Jacob Ibn Zur.

A correspondence concerning some legal mat- 
ters and misunderstandings which have arisen 
between the Jewish communities of Fez and 
Meknés 




R. Joseph Elmaleh writes this letter to R. Raphael 
Berdugo concerning misunderstandings 
' between Jewish communities on certain matters 
and also about some cases in Jewish law which 
are of mutual interest to both scholars. The writer 
states that he is replying to a previous letter from 
R. Raphael although he intended not to send any 
additional letters since these letters only tend to 
exacerbate the situation of strife that earlier 
letters produced. R. Elmaleh states that his 
decision in one case was based on the ruling of R. 
Y. Asulin who will respond to R. Raphael and to 
the scholars of Meknés on another occasion. R. 
Elmaleh asks that the rabbis of Meknés should 
respond by writing their views on the matter so

A business transaction between a Christian and a 
Jew which is guaranteed by other Jews who 
become totally responsible for the completion of 
the transaction 




Many commercial terms in this document are of a 
Spanish origin. The case involves one called R. 
Abraham who had once entered into a small 
business transaction with a Christian when no 
contract was necessary. However, when Abraham 
entered into a bigger transaction with the same 
gentile, a contract became necessary to protect 
his interest, especially considering that he was a

by R. Jacob Ibn Zur and written in the acrostic

page 231b. It is composed by R. Y. Najara, of

that there should no longer be misunderstandings 
between the two communities of Meknés and Fez. 
A parable is introduced to demonstrate that the 
leaders should not repeat the follies of those 
whom they lead by increasing the existing strife. 


A disgraceful act perpetrated by the communi- 
ty of Salé against two emissaries from Jerusalem 
is reported. One emissary is lsaac Amzalag and 
some scholars of Rabat were also involved. 
Comments are made about the dispute such as, 
“the falsifiers turn truth to folly. It doesn’t pay to 
fight for justice against a majority who support 
injustice.” The writer states that it is difficult fora 
court to reverse a decision which has already 
been handed down in another court. Concerning 
a decision rendered in a case involving a widow 
and one called Mahlouf, the writer states that he 
agrees with R. Berdugo’s decision. To serve the 
cause of justice R. Berdugo is asked to intercede 
in a case of a disputed inheritance involving R. Y. 
Legimi, who acted unjustly to his younger brother. 




stranger in the land. He persuaded some wealthy 
Jews to guarantee the contract for him against 
any false claims that might arise and paid them a 
large sum of money for this service. These 
arrangements were made with witnesses in the 
presence of the non-Jew. The persons acting as 
guarantors, known by the name Ibn Susan, have 
written to R. Abraham telling him to acquire the 
merchandise from the gentile. He has responded 
that he will not deal directly with the gentile 
anymore and since they have committed 
themselves to the transaction, it is their job to deal 
with him. The guarantors say that Abraham 
should at least send an agent to act on the matter.

Abraham retorts that they are not only agents 
guaranteeing a transaction but by their silence at 
the time of their agreement with him they have 
tacitly admitted full responsibility for the transac- 
tion. Otherwise, R. Abraham says he would not 
have set up this transaction at all. 


It is finally agreed that R. Abraham will no 
longer have to deal directly with the Christian, 
since an agent cannot change the terms to which 
he originally agreed without accepting total 
liability. This is in accord with the ruling of R.

After R. Judah ibn Attar has related the adversities 
which his community (of Fez) faces, he continues 
this letter to the rabbis Jacob Ibn Zur and Moses 
Berdugo (at Meknés) on behalf of R. Isaac Roti. 
R. lsaac is forced to travel abroad in his oid age to 
seek funds because an apostate Jew has made 
false claims against his family. R. lsaac’s son, 
Joseph, once acquired an article from the

“whoever gives money to his agent to act for him

incurred.” There are many more citations that 
could be noted, but there is no point in reciting 
them here. The document concludes with the 
hope that the wealthy guarantors will perform the 
right action for R. Abraham, who is not in good 
economic circumstances. [The first part of this

estate. The conclusion reached is as follows: if, 
when the houses were assigned to each party, 
land for access was part of that evaluation, then 
no further claims to access rights can be made. If, 
however, no such rights were included then a 
consideration must now be made for such rights 
to be extended.

before the non-Jewish court and the judgement 
rendered was that Roti would have to pay a 
stipulated amount of money by a certain date. A 
number of additional expenses had also been 
incurred. R. lsaac had neglected to mention his 
great need to R. Judah when travelling through 
his area because of his shame, but he had been 
informed of the old man’s plight by the son. 
Therefore, R. Judah writes this letter to the rabbis 
at Meknés asking them to come to the aid of R. 
Isaac Roti. This letter was written in the year1719.

A transaction involving the sale of a mule 




This legal document records a transaction 
involving Gideon ibn Sa’id Ha-Kohen who ac- 
quires a mule from Yahya the son of Abraham ibn 
Arwah for 180 uqiot: The vendor has already 
received the payment and Gideon has acquired 
the animal. They hereby agree that if any non-Jew 
should win a claim in the non-Jewish court 
against Gideon for owning the animal then Yahya 
shall restore to Gideon 60 ugiot from the amount 
of the sale, but Gideon will lose the remaining 
120 ugiot. If the non-Jew does not win his claim 
in the non-Jewish court then any loss that Gideon 
might incur in payment for his legal defence may 
accrue to the total price of the animal, plus an 
additional 20 uqiot. If the expense should exceed 
the amount then Yahya agrees to pay only half 
of the additional amount. Both parties agree to

Novellae on Rashi’s Talmudic Commentary 
pertaining to the monetary options available to 
the wife upon the husband’s death 




Rashi, the eleventh century commentator, offers 
two ways to explain the statement of the master, 
R. Abba in the Talmud, pertaining to the options 
available to the widow as to how she may receive 
what is due to her monetarily upon the death of 
her husband. Either she receives the monetary 
value stipulated in her marriage contract, or R. 
Abba maintains that she receives an equal portion 
to that which each son receives besides what she 
receives as the value of her marriage contract, 
called the Ketubba. This second view is main- 
tained even though the amount that each son 
would receive exceeds the value of the marriage

A chronicle, commencing from Rosh Hashanah, 
1775 




The first thirteen lines of this document record the 
rainfall between the Jewish New Year and the 
month of Tevet. On the day after the minor festival 
of Hanukah a public fast is declared because the 




this stipulation. (This provision was necessary 
because a mule is half a horse and Jews were not 
allowed to keep horses, only donkeys. The horse 
was considered a noble animal and only non- 
Jews were allowed to own them. Therefore, it was 
possible that Gideon might be challenged in the 
courts for owning a ‘half-noble’ animal.) 


The contract stipulated that any payments due 
under its provisions should not be subject to the 
law of the remission of debts in the Sabbatical 
year. The responsibility for fulfilling all its terms 
should also apply to those who stand to inherit the 
Principals involved in the transaction. This 
contract was composed on the twenty-first day of 
Tammuz, in the year 84 (according to the dating of 
contracts), circa 1624. This document was signed 
for the benefit of Gideon, in Fez, by Jacob the son 
of Joseph ibn Danan. The document was certified 
by the latter signing his name, Jacob, a second 
time. 




contract. The wife still receives both. 


Another way to explain the text is that the sons 
will give her a portion equal to their portion and 
she forfeits thereby what she would have received 
from the Ketubba. According to this explanation 
the widow would stand to lose much, but this 
would depend on the situation. For instance, if 
there were to be more children and the land which 
she will acquire is limited to what the husband 
possessed at a particular time, then she stands to 
lose a great deal, unlike the sons who would not 
have a time limitation placed on them. However, it 
is also possible that the number of heirs could be 
reduced through death before the demise of the 
husband, in which case the widow would con- 
ceivably receive more money than was originally 
anticipated. 




rain supply is far from ample. The non-Jews in Fez 
cry to God for rain all the eight days of Hanukah 
and they ask the Jews to pray for rain. The 
gentiles have stopped planting seeds because of 
the lack of rain. A Torah is brought forth during 
the morning service and scriptural reading for fast 
days is also read at the afternoon service.

A plea to the judges of Fez to attempt to bring

The scholars of Sala write this letter in the form of 
a court document to the rabbis of Fez in reply to 
an earlier correspondence. The case pertains to 
R. Moses, the son of Isaac |bn Zur, and the marital 
problems that he has had with his spouse. The 
husband wants to grant a divorce to his wife, while 
she is desirous of a reconciliation regretting that 
she originally wanted a divorce. The wife has 
asked that an agent be appointed to plead for her 
and to respond to the claims that her husband is 
filing against her. If the husband refuses to arrive 
at a reconciliation, then the claims he is making 
should be investigated by the rabbis of Fez with 
the presentation of witnesses under oath. 
Afterwards a monetary settlement should be 
made based on what the wife brought to the

writer, so he made his own arrangements for 
lodging. The writer suggests to the rabbis at Fez 
that scholars should not be sent from Fez to 
Debdou because the people are inhospitable to 
visiting scholars. He further states that he relates 
only asmall part of what he is enduring. He asks 
that his brother Abraham should not bother

Solomon Kaspi because R. Judah promised to 
pay the amount on R. Samuel’s behalf. If it is not 
paid now then a note should be written stating 
that the next person who arrives at Fez is to be 
given the money. 


The writer inquires if by chance the work Beit 
Shmuel and the Shakh, on the code Hoshen 
Mishpat, also the book Tosaphot Yom Tob, in the 
Amsterdam edition, are available? R. Mordecai 
Asban will pay their price for the writer since R. 
Mordecai is presently in Fez and has been 
informed that such a transaction might transpire 
during his stay. This letter was sent from Tlemcen. 




Isaac ibn Mahlouf Abitbol, who is in a poor 
economic situation and whose brother, Abraham, 
took a loan from a non-Jew. Abraham lives in R. 
Jacob’s vicinity. lsaac was a contracting guaran- 
tor, a’reb Kabb’lan, for the aforementioned 
transaction. The non-Jew recently passed on and 
his children rose against Isaac and held him and 




his wife as hostages, even torturing them. They 
are willing to free Isaac and his wife if Isaac will 
pay the amount of forty uqiot to them. Isaac’s wife 
is being held by them as a hostage until Isaac 
returns from his brother Abraham with the stated 
amount. 


R. Judah now asks R. Jacob to intercede on 
behalf of Isaac by speaking to Abraham to make 
the stipulated amount available so that the 
husband and wife may be freed. Isaac and his wife 
have already incurred many expenses which

Raphael Obed Ibn Zur writes to R. Moses Ibn 
Maman asking that a loan be extended to him 




Raphael Obed Ibn Zur informs R. Moses ibn 
Maman of Fez that he suffers a multitude of 
misfortunes, too numerous to record on paper. 
Even if he did record them, he fears that they 
would be read by those who were not intended to 
know about them. He states that he did not heed 
the advice of his masters and he went in ways 
against which they had warned him. He lost his 
possessions because he gave his capital to 
entrepreneurs to invest for him. He accepts God’s 
judgement and declares that he never sought 
benefit in his life except for his basic necessities. 
Whatever monies he had, he used for his travelling 
expenses. 


He is now destitute and located in the House of 
Study in Meknés. That community had offered 
him the stipend that they make available to 
resident scholars, but he had refused it on several

not disclosed Abraham’s whereabouts to the 
creditors so they will not be able to demand the 
whole debt from Abraham. Therefore Abraham 
would best be advised to send the money 
requested lest Isaac’s wife sends the creditors to 
him to get herself freed. Isaac and his wife have 
achieved the best compromise for all concerned 
so Abraham should send the money. This docu- 
ment was signed by R. Judah ibn Attar, on the 
tenth of Adar 1720. 




performing his levirate duties with the woman 
Rachel, the daughter of the late Mas’Ud Aludi. The 
aforementioned Mahlouf should only be obliged 
to participate in the Haliza ceremony, which 
would free him and the woman Rachel from the 
levirate duties. The overriding reason for their 
decision is that Mahlouf already has a wife, sons, 
and daughters, and they all suffer from destitu- 
tion. If he should be obliged to take an additional 
wife his economic situation would become even 
more serious. This document was composed in

occasions. The people of Meknés insisted that if 
he did not accept the stipend they would be given 
a bad name for not supporting scholars. He had 
finally been persuaded to take the stipend but 
only as a loan to be repaid. This money he 
received every Friday, but eventually the amount 
of the stipend had been reduced to nothing at all 
because business conditions were bad. The writer 
decided not to take any more stipends even if they 
were available, when times improved. Friends had 
implored him to take the stipend but he had 
refused because he views his poverty as a sign of 
Divine chastisement. 


In his letter he asks R. Moses Maman to extend 
a loan of two hundred uqiot to help him support 
his family. He has his eye on an investment which 
someone would manage for him and expects to 
live off the profits. He assures the prospective 
creditor (R. Maman) that he will repay the loan. He 
has agreed to compose a written contract of 
obligation for the loan, putting up land in Meknes 
as collateral, and will repay the loan immediately

agrees to extend the loan, it should not be sent

who will in turn send it through R. Ephraim 




A booklet of Halakhic riddles in the form of 
responsa 




This booklet contains amusing queries which 
may be characterized as riddles on subjects of 
Jewish law. In fact, the first page, 251a, has the 
Hebrew word for riddles, “Hidot,” as a title. The 
work is attributed to R. Yedidia Monsonyego, of 
blessed memory, by his son-in-law who remains 
anonymous. The author utilizes the literary form 
of Responsa literature. The responsa refer to the 
works of the medieval Halakhists known as 
Rishonim. Among them Maimonides, Ravad, the 
Responsa literature of R. Solomon ibn Adret, and 
the Code of Jewish Law of R. Joseph Caro, as well 
as his encyclopaedic work Beit Yosef, are men- 
tioned. 


On page 251a the author informs us that his 
son inquired about how one can be permitted to 
remarry his wife whom he divorced after she 
subsequently married another person, when this 




A testimony from a rabbinic court that a

entitled to financial assistance 




This document, which was signed by the follow- 
ing scholars of Fez; R. Vidal Ha-Sarfati, R. Judah 
ion Attar, R. Samuel Ha-Sarfati, R. Saadya b. 
Mimun Aflalo, and R. Isaac Ha-Sarfati, is a 
testimony to the bonafide need for financial 
support for the scholar R. Isaac Melamed of 
Jerusalem. The scholar has showed them a letter 
which notes his misfortunes. They further state in 
this document that financial aid should be 
extended to R. Isaac in accord with his station

is contrary to biblical law? The writer responds 
that this query is already treated by R. Solomon 
ibn Adret in his Responsum, number 1,209, and 
the writer elaborates. Later authorities, 
designated Aharonim, such as the Levush, are 
also noted in the response to the first query. The 
second question which appears on page 251b 
pertains to a hypothetical case of a legally married 
woman who was unfaithful to her husband yet 
was permitted to live with him according to the 
law. The response is given that if she was a minor 
at the time of her marriage, in accord with the 
Ravad’s view that the seduction of a minor is not 
considered a culpable act, then her husband can 
legally retain her as his wife. This view is recorded 
by R. Joseph Caro in chapter 175 of Even ha-Ezer. 
Several cases pertaining to the relations between 
men and women are discussed. They are followed 
by several cases that relate to matters in civil law. 
It is apparent that this type of Halakhic work was 
composed to sharpen the student’s mind. [Page

whenever he comes to Fez. Apparently, at the time 
this document was written the economic situation 
in Fez was not at all good for the Jews, but the 
Arabs were faring much better. The expression 
“The maidservant inherited the role of the 
mistress,” (the former referring to Hagar the 
maidservant of Sarah, the mistress) is used by the 
rabbis to characterize the relations between 
Arabs and Jews and their respective conditions at 
this time. It seems that the scholar from the Holy 
Land could not receive adequate funds on this 
occasion. The rabbis pray that economic con- 
ditions will improve so that the scholar will receive 
his proper due.

In this correspondence R. Judah ibn Attar replies 
to the rabbis Jacob Ibn Zur and Moses Berdugi of 
Meknés, that upon receiving their ietter he called 
for the wife of Mimun ibn Didi and for her brother 
Abraham ibn Shaprut and he read the letter to 
them. R. Judah states that Mimun has no legal 
basis for taking another wife, since his present 
wife is of sound mind and body and also is 
pregnant by him. Mimun’s claim that his daughter 
is a cripple is unfounded and R. Judah has 
testimony to prove that the opposite is the case. 


Mimun will not be able to take another wife 
until his present wife gives birth. If a healthy male 
child is born then he cannot take an additional 
wife. If a female child is born then a judgement will 
be rendered and he will be informed what course

The rabbis of Tetuan ask the rabbis of Fez to aidR.

This document which is signed by the following 
three rabbis of Tetuan, R. Isaac Abudarham, R. 
Jacob Halevi, and R. Hananiah Arubash, is sent to 
the rabbinic scholars of Fez concerning an estate 
which belonged to R. Moses ibn Maman, of 
blessed memory. The latter’s brother, Isaac ibn

the rabbis of Tetuan, is very poor. He informs 
them that his late brother Moses, who resided in

A letter from the rabbis of Fez to all communities 
to alleviate the plight of a fellow Jew. Also a note 
to the judges of Sefrou 




This letter was composed for the honorable 
Mimun ben Amozig by the following rabbis of Fez 
who signed it: R. Judah ibn Attar, R. Jacob b. R. 
Reuben Ibn Zur, and R. Shalom Edery. Mimun is 
one of the leading taxpayers of Fez, known for his 




of action to pursue. Meanwhile the wife is making 
a counter claim of abandonment and non-support 
against her husband from the time that he left (for 
Meknés). The writer asks the rabbis Ibn Zur and 
Berdugi to compel the husband to return to his 
wife immediately. The letter was here concluded 
but before signing it, the writer added an 
additional eight lines testifying to the woman’s 
good state of health and reporting that both she 
and her brother testified to her being pregnant. 
Meanwhile, the husband must send his wife 
financial support since she is penniless. 


R. Judah mentions another case in the same 
letter concerning R. Jacob Ibn Zur. The widow of 
R. Isaac ibn Amara has implored R. Judah to write 
to R. Jacob to entreat the Nagid about a sum of 
money that he levied upon Solomon ibn Amara. 
The latter has struggled to find the wherewithal to 
pay a portion of the sum and her plea is that the 
Nagid should be asked to forego the remainder of 
the sum. 




Fez for many years, left an estate to him. However, 
the courtyard which belonged to Moses was given 
in pledge to the king for the sum of four hundred 
uqiot. Isaac asks that the pledge be paid and the 
balance be paid to him. The rabbis of Tetuan ask 
the rabbis of Fez to expedite the matter, since R. 
Isaac is in dire need of the money and is otherwise 
unable to support himself. This document is dated 
Wednesday, the second third of the month of 
Heshvan, in the year 1647. [See page 268a for 
another document signed by R. Hananiah Aru- 
bash, in the same year, which is related to this

benevolence. Now his economic misfortunes 
require that he ask others to aid him, but as he has 
never been in this predicament before, nor is he 
forward because of his plight, the rabbis are 
asking others to come to his aid in accord with his 
station. The date of this document is 1731. The 
rabbis Jacob Ibn Zur and Shalom Edery sign a 
postscript to the scholars and judges of Sefrou 
and to R. Judah Saba and R. David Harar saying 
they should make a speedy response to this letter.

The community of Fez draws up a contract to sell 
a concession because it is in need of funds 




This document was drawn up on the seventeenth 
day of Tammuz, 1709. It is signed by the following 
rabbis of Fez: Judah ibn Attar, Samuel Ha-Sarfati, 
Abraham ibn Danan, and Jacob b. Reuben Ibn 
Zur. Since the community of Fez is in need of 
cash, it is selling a concession involving the sale 
of fruit for the processing of alcoholic beverages, 
to R. Daniel Toledano, (son of the scholar R. 
Phineas, of blessed memory) for twenty litres of 
cochineal. The period of the concession is one 
year from the first day of Tishri. The terms set 
forth are that the purchaser, the aforementioned 




Ascholar writes that one of the parties to a dispute

[This correspondence which was written by R. 
Moses ibn Hamo (of Sefrou) to R. Menahem 
Serero (of Fez) commences on page 266a and 
concludes on page 265b; which is really part of 
the same page.] A response is made to R. 
Menahem’'s letter which had been received by the 
writer a day before. R. Menahem stated that R. 
Jacob D’Avila was guilty of obstructing justice by 
not appearing before the court (at Fez). R. Moses 
states that this charge is without foundation 
because the letter signed by R. Mimun has just 
been received by the writer. Furthermore, R. 
Jacob thought it best to remain at home for the 
Sabbath as he was not in good health. On 
Tuesday he began his journey but he was turned 
back midway by people from R. Serero’s own 
community who informed him that those who 
would dispute him would soon arrive in his town. 
They also noted his poor physical condition. 
When R. Jacob returned home it was 
suggested that he send his son, Meir, in his place 
with all the proper testimonies, but he still insisted

weight of grapes one uqia and from every pur- 
chaser ofa talent weight of raisins, figs, and dates, 
and any other produce from which liquor can be 
produced, one half uqia, according to the old 
system of currency. This price schedule applies 
when the weight of grapes is measured to potfuls. 
However, if it is in the volume of basketfuls and 
if it weighs up to one and one half talents, then 
one uqia shall be paid. If itis found to weigh more, 
then one uqia, according to the earlier system 
of currency, shall be paid for each talent. These 
terms are in accord with the community’s deci- 
sion. The community will protect the purchaser 
of the concession from any claims that might be 
laid against him. 




that he would go himself to R. Serero’s communi- 
ty. R. Moses Hamo asks that the matter be 
resolved quickly. After a careful examination of 
the evidence R. Moses feels confident that it will 
be found to be in R. Jacob’s favor. The deceased 
woman about whom the controversy revolves has 
apparently nullified all the conditions of the 
marriage contract that pertain to the Megérashim 
(exiles of the Castilian communities). The sig- 
nature of this document, which is found on page 
265b, is followed by a postscript wherein the 
writer asks that a message should be transmitted 
to his friend, R. Joshua, requesting a copy of the 
Talmudic tractate Niddah. It seems that a student 
has asked to borrow that text and the writer has 
already lent two copies to others. Now he relates 
that he studies the tractate Hullin after the 
morning service in the academy. At midnight, 
another study session is held with the participa- 
tion of more than twenty scholars, among whom 
are excellent students who analyze the subject 
well. There are also average students who stand 
and study together. Again the writer requests that 
a copy of the Talmud tractate Niddah be sent to 
him, and if it is in a bad condition R. Moses says 
that he will repair it. He signs the postscript with 




‘the words, “also these are the words of Moses.”

R. Judah Ibn Attar writes to the scholars of 
Meknés concerning one who violated a pre- 
marital agreement. R. Jacob Malka concurs with 
R. Attar’s judgement 




This document was written by R. Judah ibn Attar 
on the nineteenth of lyar 1728. However, the 
matter was held off until the twenty-third of lyar 
when the incident was better substantiated, so 
that the letter was not sent until afterwards. A 
postscript is written to this effect with a second 
signature by R. Judah ibn Attar. 


The case involves Elazar ibn Asulin who 
became betrothed to a widow against legal 
practice and not in accord with the wishes of his 
relatives because he was already engaged, in Fez, 
to the daughter of Levi ibn Amara. In accord with 
practice, a high penalty must be paid if he violated 
the terms of that arrangement. Elazar’s brother, 
Moses ibn Asulin, a guarantor of the pre-nuptial 
contract, was very angry over his brother’s 
actions, especially as he had a monetary obliga- 
tion arising from the matter. Because he suffered 
from an ailment which prevented him from 
travelling on animals, he was personally unable to 
confront his brother. Another brother, Mas’Ud, 
went to confront Elazar and to oblige him to 
nullify his relationship with the widow on the 
strength of R. Judah’s letter, in which the rabbis of 
Meknés were asked to persuade Elazar to divorce 
the widow. If he refused, then he should pay his 
brother Moses for the latter’s indebtedness on his 
behalf and also the fiancée who would be 
disgraced by his actions. In a postscript dated the 
twenty-third of lyar, R. Judah states that the 
brother Moses had heard things that might 
require the rabbis of Meknés to secure a bill of 
divorce by force. In spite of his ailment Moses had 
decided to travel to confront Elazar.

continues on the top of page 267b.] Jacob agrees 
with R. Judah ibn Attar that there are grounds to 
force Elazar to withdraw from “the wicked woman 
who ensnared him.” He has violated a rabbinic 
enactment which requires that one who marries 
must do so under the jurisdiction of the- local 
scholar. Furthermore, the marriage ceremony 
was performed by the bridegroom himself, 
without the benefit of clergy, in the presence of 
ten young sheep (young boys) who came from the 
communites of Meknés, Fez, and Salé, which are 
all under the jurisdiction of the aforementioned 
enactment. One who has violated the rabbinic 
enactment may be beaten until he submits. 
Apart from the above he has been guilty of 
disgracing his elder brother and shaming his 
fiancée. He cannot marry, in any case, until he 
makes restitution to his brother Moses. Elazar is 
also regarded as a scholar and he has disgraced 
his calling by his actions, as well as besmirching 
the honor of his family. Therefore, his relationship 
with the widow should be nullified in accordance 
with the opinion of the Tur (in chapter two of Even 
Ha-Ezer). However, the fact that the widow was 
married two or three times previously should not 
be the basis upon which Elazar is forced to 
withdraw from her. Rabbinic literature states that 
if one marries a woman who is not fitting for him 
then Elijah (the prophet) forces him to withdraw 
from her. The widow had previous husbands who 
died while they were married to her and this would 
justify the nullification of Elazar’s marriage to her. 
An opinion is expressed that when a woman is 
divorced from three husbands it is a basis for 
nullification of a subsequent marriage. R. Jacob 
b. Malka indicts Elazar for abandoning a maiden 
from a good family in favor of a wealthy widow. He 
notes that tradition has unkind things to say about 
one who marries for an ulterior motive such as the 
acquisition of money. The signature of Jacob b. 
Malka is given at the conclusion of this document.

Rabbi Rahamim Joseph Gayni writes to Rabbi 
Raphael Ibn Zur, of Fez. The introductory portion 
of the letter includes a prayer for peace and the 
advent of the Messiah so that the Jews will no 
longer suffer persecution. Regards are sent to 
Maharash Ibn Zur and a prayer is offered for his 
health. The writer informs R. Raphael of the arrival 
of R. Hayyim ibn Zikhri who is coming to inquire 
about a legal matter. He brings with his many 
written statements from the rabbis of the city of 
Heleb. R. Rahamim asks R. Raphael to review the 
judgement in all its minutest details as quickly as 
possible. As for himself he no longer wants to 
have anything to do with this bad situation. He 




An emissary corresponds from Sefrou with Ham-

The writer of this letter, who is an emissary from 
the Holy Land, commences his letter with a 
flowery introduction. Then he invites R. Raphael 
to come to the Galilee to live (the writer is 
probably from Safed). He informs R. Raphael (Ibn 
Zur of Fez) that he is presently in Sefrou 
collecting funds and that in spite of a dispute in 
the town amongst the Jewish inhabitants, he was 
able to collect five Durham. He expects to visit R. 




A court decision concerning the erection of a 
structure that impedes the public right of way and 
commerce

marketplace called Sug Al-Ksasin had wanted to 
construct a roof out of matted reeds to protect

of the estate which Isaac ibn Maman inherited. ] 




expects that R. Raphael will finally bring the 
matter to a conclusion by rendering his judge- 
ment. 


In an addendum, R. Rahamim mentions a case 
involving one called Maharash Hota who had 
shared an inheritance with his mother. Upon her 
demise the community wanted to claim the 
mother’s portion. A letter was sent to the rabbis 
of Fez who judged that the mother had no authori- 
ty over the object which she controlled while she 
was alive, which apparently was in the syna- 
gogue. The reason that the son, Maharash Hota 
granted it to his mother was because it was his 
duty to support her, but after her death it reverted 
back to the son. Therefore, no individual or com- 
munity can claim authority over the item in ques- 
tion. This decision was never copied nor is it to 
be found in the possession of the writer, nor is 
he able to acquire a copy of it, yet, he does recall 
that such a decision was rendered.

states that while he is asking for money for his

that this was the main purpose of the letter. 
Rather, the letter was prompted by his friendly 
concern. Regards are then sent to R. Solomon, R. 
Hayyim Kohen, and to R. Abraham. In an 
addendum the writer inquires about a sum of 
money that was sent through the person of Jacob 
ibn Zimra, to Gibraltar (which is spelled in one 
word, not as in the Arabic) wondering whether it 
arrived safely. He asks for a response to his letter.

yards complained that such a structure would 
block the view of their windows which faced the 
public thoroughfare. The undersigned rabbis 
responded that there was no substance to their 
claim and they could not impede the construction. 
Subsequently, the awning was constructed. 




Some members of the community had tried to 
impede the construction on the grounds that 
damage might occur to passers-by on the public 
thoroughfare when rainfall accumulated on the 
awning and dripped on them, thereby preventing 
passers-by from access to the street. The rabbis 
rule that this claim has merit and even though 
construction has already taken place, that does 




A court document (from Sefrou) toR. Raphael Ibn 
Zur of Fez to serve as an interim overseer of the 
estate of the late Raphael Ha-Kohen 




This document is written to R. Raphael Ibn Zur at 
Fez, and signed by the rabbinic tribunal com- 
posed of R. Hayyim Elijah (Gayni), R. Raphael 
Moses Elbaz, and R. YeKutiel ibn Elbaz. They ask 
R. Raphael to accept the appointment of overseer 
of the estate of the late R. Raphael Ha-Kohen, of 
blessed memory, for the benefit of the orphans, 
until such time when a trustee shall be appointed 




R. Raphael Ibn Zur (of Fez) is informed of the 
appointment of a trustee for the estate of Raphael 
Ha-Kohen o.b.m. (Cf. Ms.203) 




This document [which is related to Ms.203 and 
follows it chronologically and in the order in 
which it appeared in the Bension collection] 
informs R. Raphael Ibn Zur of the appointment of 
Isaac ibn Shitrit as the trustee of the estate of the 
late Raphael Ha-Kohen, o.b.m. He will serve the 
interests of the orphans, negotiate with the 
deceased’s partners, and collect the debts in- 
curred by non-Jews. If it is desirable that another 
trustee be appointed in addition to Isaac, this will 
be satisfactory provided that the delay will have 




A letter of reconciliation written to R. Reuben Ibn 
Zur by Elijah Utmazgin 




We are informed by the writer, Elijah Utmazgin, 
that R. Reuben Ibn Zur is not in good health, but 
that he has sons. The writer prays for R. Reuben’s 
well being and implores him not to be angry with 
him. The writer wrote to R. Reuben on a previous 
occasion but has received no reply. The writer 




not give those who are having it built the legal 
right to assert their claim (called Hazaka) that the 
awning shall remain as it was constructed. This 
document was signed on the twentieth day of 
Adar II, in the year 1851. It was signed by R. 
Reuben Serero, R. Judah Elbaz, and R. Yedidia 
Monsonyego. 




for the estate. In this capacity R. Raphael is 
requested to examine the financial accounts of 
the departed and to call the deceased’s partners 
to settle the matter of the partnership, as well as to 
take care of the keys of the shop. He will arrange 
to hire an artisan to seal the doors of the house of 
the deceased and R. Raphael shall keep the keys 
with him, “for one does not know what a day will 
bring.” The last sentence is written in Judaeo- 
Arabic in this document. The document was 
composed in Sefrou, although it is mentioned in 
the text. 




no adverse effect upon the welfare of the orphans 
and the widow. Furthermore, the widow can seek 
someone who can act in her behalf if time is not of 
the essence. In that case, all that is contained in 
the apartment will not be opened until the widow 
secures one whowill act on her behalf. R. Raphael 
is asked to send to the undersigned certain items 
that R. Raphael left with Isaac ibn Shitrit, as well 
as the account book, so that a proper evaluation 
of the estate can be arrived at. A copy of the 
account book can be sent so that the original may 
remain with Rabbi Raphael. The rabbis who 
signed the document (at Sefrou) are R. Hayyim 
Elijah (Gayni), R. Raphael Moses Elbaz, and Ri: 
YeKutiel Elbaz. 




insists that there is no reason why R. Reuben 
should bear any ill-feeling towards him. If R. 
Reuben continues to act in this manner he will be 
guilty of afflicting the downtrodden. Instead he 
should renew his warm friendship of earlier days. 
R. Elijah adds a postscript after his signature 
wherein he prays for the welfare of R. Reuben.

A correspondence from Ish Zair of Fez to the 
Alliance Israelite at Paris 




The author, Ish Zair, commends the famous 
organization Alliance Israelite, based in Paris, for 
publishing the Responsa of R. Asher. Then he 
states his desire to write and his disappointment 
at not receiving a reply; therefore, he held back 
from writing further until he became possessed by 
the muse of the written word and he was obliged 
to correspond. 


Increased taxes have caused friction between 
the Nagid and the community and, the writer says, 
he has had to mediate between them. It reached

This letter states that one who spoke on behalf of 
Masuda (daughter of Mimun ibn Saluha) and the 
wife of Mordecai ibn Adhan, known as Ben Aiyna, 
related how Mordecai sent her a letter telling her 
that he had been delivered into the hands of the

Saluha. Subsequently, he had been severely

ment of the two delegates who were to go to Paris. 
A request is made for the appointment of a 
representative for Jewish matters to reside in Fez, 
as was done in Lebanon where it was successful. 
This would be an effective way of improving the 
condition of the Jews. The writer mentions having 
been in Gibraltar where money was raised for 
Jewish causes. Unfortunately, it is difficult to 
fulfill such a philanthropic goal in Fez because 
economic conditions, aggravated by the drought, 
have regressed considerably such that bread has 
increased in price three and fourfold. 




by Samuel and Abraham so that they could send 
money to her and her children who were suffering 
from hunger. However, she has never received 
this money. 


This letter, which was sent by R. Judah ibn 
Attar to R. Jacob Ibn Zur, refers to the aforemen- 
tioned Mordecai who wandered away from his 
home to R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s area and left his wife 
and her children without food or drink or means 
by which they could support themselves. R. 
Judah asks R. Jacob to aid the woman in her 
plight by asking Samuel and Abraham to return all 
the money to Mordecai and to compel him to 
return to his wife in Fez immediately. 




Samuel Ibn Zur on the passing of his father. The

that he is obliged to do so since no one else is

casting suspicion on the just. 




A correspondence to R. Abraham Pariente asking 
him to intercede on behalf of the writer in a

This letter, which is partially written in the 
alliterative form, is sent to R. Abraham Parienté 
asking him to intercede for the writer in a 
judgement with a person identified as R. Reuben. 
The writer mentions having received a letter from 
the aforementioned R. Abraham who fulfilled all 
that he was asked to do. He again asks R. 
Abraham to try to persuade R. Reuben to do his

The alliterative form of literary expression 
appears in the flowery introduction when the 
Hebrew alphabetical letter “Mem” is prominently 
used from the beginning of line 3 through line 7. 
The writer pleads poverty in matters of poetic 
metre and he concludes with four more lines 
commencing each word with the letter Mem, from 
line 20 through line 23. He also expresses his 
suffering and tribulations and he looks forward to 
the coming of the Messiah, the son of David.

Establishing trust in business contracts 




The legal forms for establishing a basis of trust in 
various kinds of contracts are given on this page. 
The city of Tafilalet is mentioned on page 281a in 
one of the forms and one concludes that these 
forms were drawn up for use in commercial 
intercourse in that city. Also given is the legal 
form for granting gifts which are acquired by the 
same mechanism applying to other commercial 
acquisitions. This kind of gift excludes those 
granted by a person on his death bed. The forms 
that apply for pledges are given as well. 


On page 281b a case is presented involving 




one called Reuben who is below the age of twenty 
and who desires to engage in a business 
transaction to sell property that he has inherited. 
According to the law, one who has not attained 
the age of twenty cannot engage in commercial 
acts involving legal transactions. In order to 
protect the purchaser of the property Reuben is 
required to take an oath that he will not demand 
the nullification of the purchase when he attains 
the legal age. It is also necessary to ascertain that 
Reuben understands all the ramifications of the 
transaction before the oath can be administered. 
This oath is unrelated to the act of acquisition 
itself.

A creditor's claim against the estate of the late 
Dinar B. Amram 




[This document is related to Ms.214, which 
precedes it on page 284a. It informs us of some 
other transactions that took place with the same 
piece of real estate.] Testimony is given to the 
existence of a bill of indebtedness for a huge sum 
owed to R. Jacob Halevi of the town of Sale (son of 
R. Samuel Halevi, of blessed memory) and 
charged against Dinar (son of Amram) Known as 
ben Tata. Dinar declares his trust in Jacob, and 
those acting for Jacob, with regard to the 
authenticity of the bill of debt and the payment 
thereof without any oath requiring to be taken.

in the year 77 (1717).

possession of the aforementioned Hayyim. It was 
signed on Wednesday, the seventeenth of Tevet 
1734, at Fez. é 




Another transaction is reported in this docu-

tioned contract, made his holdings available to 
Hayyim bar Mas’ud bar Hanun ben Magirz for one 
thousand ugiot, on the fifteenth of Ab, in the year 
93 (1733). Therefore, Hayyim ben Magirz in-

(mentioned in Ms.24), excluding the house, 
belonged to those acting for the estate of R. 
Mimun ben Adhan, may his soul repose in 
Paradise. The other half belonged to Aaron ben 
Haroush. Miriam, the wife of Dinar ben Tata, sold 
part of her dowry and bought a half-interest in the

One known as Mordecai ibn Amozag took up 
residence for over six months in a dwelling and 
paid no rent whatsoever. Mahlouf Boutboul was 
asked to act for the claimant against Mordecai, 
but was unsuccessful. Mordecai subsequently 
wrote a letter stating that he could not be sued 
since his brother Azriel had given him permission 
to live in the house and any claims should 
henceforth be brought against Azriel. Mordecai 
was warned to vacate the premises but he ignored 
these demands. Therefore, the claimant has 
turned to R. Jacob Ibn Zur to order Mordecai’s 
removal. 


The claimant says, too, that R. Moses ibn 
Maman lent money to Hayyim, the son of the 
aforementioned Mordecai, and he was not paid

claimant (the writer of this letter) as a pledge. 
After five or six years had passed, R. Shem Tob

permitted the writer to lend that text to R. Shem 
Tob. The writer says that this was done with the 
creditor, R. Moses’ permission also. R. Shem Tob 
passed away soon after and the text is now in the 
hands of his inheritors. It is not known whether 
Hayyim ever asked that his books should be 
returned. There was a copy of the work called 
Minhot ha-Luhot written only on paper and 
because of dampness the text was ruined. The 
writer states that he placed it in the Genizah. In the

A plea for charitable aid 




Zikhri Meshash commences the first half of his 
letter to R. Ham-Malakh Raphael Ha-Sarfati_ (of 
Fez) with a flowery and poetic introduction. He 
then expresses his sorrow for not having followed 
R. Raphael’s, advice to him. Since Zikhri left R. 
Raphael’s community he and his family have 
suffered much privation, especially during the 
past winter, when sufficient clothing was not 
available to them. Zikhri was apparently involved 




Court action is taken in Fez and Meknés 
concerning the non-payment of a debt 




The rabbis Saul ibn Danan and Raphael Obed Ibn 
Zur (of Fez) wrote to the rabbis Jacob Toledano 
and Mordecai Berdugo (of Meknés) in the year 
1760, concerning the payment of a debt. The 
original transaction and bill of debt was dated the 
twenty-seventh of Tammuz 1754. It was to be 
paid in installments. The principals in the present 
state of affairs are Moses ben David-Ve-Joseph 
and Yedia ibn Lahbari who brought this debt 
owed by Simeon b. Mordecai Wahnunu, to the 
attention of the rabbis, so that Joseph (son of R. 
Moses Amiel) who is the creditor, will receive the 
sum of two hundred uqiot. This is done because 
the appointed time of the installment payments 
was the twenty-second of Sivan 1755, and still no 




Four poems with an introduction by Moses B. 
Aaron Attiya, of the nineteenth century 




The author of the poems, Moses ben Aaron Attiya, 
commences with a three-page introduction which 
is followed by four pages of poetry. He moralizes 
about the fact that the power of speech can be 
utilized for negative purposes and that it should 
rather be ennobled through religious expression 
in poetry. He quotes scripture, from the Psalms, 
and a rabbinic text to this effect. He notes that 
there are numerous occasions for poetic expres- 
sion such as on the Sabbaths, at festivals, Bar

in a disputed transaction which left him without 
any monetary resources. He tried to reach a 
compromise on the matter but could not find the 
other party. As Passover is coming very soon he is 
in dire straits and he is depending onR. Raphael’s 
merciful nature. Zikhri blames his adversity on 
having departed from his ancestral home, but he 
states that he cannot turn to the masses for 
charitable aid for, while they are gracious in the 
amount of ridicule that they offer to those who 
turn to them for aid, they offer little benevolence 
in return. 




payments are forthcoming. Now Isaac b. Hayyim 
is delegated to act for the creditor, Joseph, to 
make Simeon pay his debt. The writer asks the 
rabbis to aid Isaac in his attempt to collect the 
debt. 


R. Jacob Toledano (of Meknes) signs the 
second document, which is given as a response 
below the earlier document. He cites from Hoshen 
Mishpat 73:8, the following words of R. Joseph 
Caro, “If one took an oath to pay his debt at a 
stipulated time and when that time arrived the 
creditor didn’t claim it, the debtor is not obliged to 
pay it until the creditor claims it.” The Semais also 
recorded as in accord with this opinion. The latter 
quotes R. Solomon ibn Adret, 0.b.m., as saying 
that the debtor is not obliged to pay the wife or the 
children of the creditor until such time as the 
creditor demands his money. 




Mitzvot, and wedding celebrations. 


The writer informs us that he composed and 
wrote many poems on individual pieces of paper 
and because he did not collect them into one 
volume they were lost and he could not recall 
them. He therefore composed, for posterity, this 
work called “Yashir Moshe” to record those 
poems that he still remembered. He also added 
explanations of terms in the text. All the texts 
contained in this work were approved by R. Abner 
Israel Ha-Sarfati. He mentions that he was asked 
to compose appropriate words of verse for a 
pleasant Arabic tune so as to elevate the melody 
from its secular state to the holy. 




The first liturgical poem consisting of eight 
stanzas is composed in honor of the New Month— 
Rosh Hodesh. All the poems are composed in the 
acrostic form. The second poem is supplicatory in 
nature and is appropriately to be recited during 
periods of distress. The third prayer characterizes

R. Hasdai Almosnino writes, in the year 1715, 
to the scholars Judah ibn Attar and Jacob Ibn 
Zur (of Fez) asking them to intercede on behalf of 
the widow and orphans of R. Abraham Attiya, may 
he repose in paradise, by contacting R. Solomon 
ibn Yaish to aid her in her plight. After initial 
attempts nothing has yet been accomplished 
on her behalf. A young man, Moses (son of Isaac 
Ha-Kohen), had negotiated a loan from the late 
R. Abraham Attiya and he still has not made pay- 
ment on it. Previously this young man lived in R. 
Hasdai’s area (Tetuan), but now he has moved 
to Fez. The late R. Abraham’s brother-in-law, 
Isaac Sarfati, came to Fez with the bill of debt 
and managed to collect part of it but forty-six- 




R. Judah Ibn Attar writes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
about the internal politics and personalities of the 
Jewish community of Fez, which has a bearing on 
the reason for R. Jacob Ibn Zur’s departure for

the yearning for restoration of the holy places in 
Zion. The fourth prayer is supplicatory in nature 
dealing with the plight of exile which Jews suffer. 
A call for their redemption is sounded and their 
oppressors are to be dealt with so that the Throne 
of God will be complete. 




a bride called Esther. Each verse concludes with 
the Hebrew word “Hen”—“Grace.” The last 
paragraph mentions the name of the groom as 
Saul. The writer, who appears to be a rejected 
suitor of the bride, is Elijah Utmazgin. He offers 
his best wishes to the newlyweds. 




and-a-half uqiot are still outstanding. R. Hasdai 
now asks the rabbis (of Fez) to summon Moses 
to pay the outstanding amount. 


In the second case, a fettered wife, an Agunah, 
Haita, the sister of the aforementioned late 
Abraham Attiya, and the wife of R. Aaron Azirad, 
is brought to the attention of the rabbis of Fez, 
since Aaron is in their area. Aaron, who had 
incurred debts, fled eleven years previously, and 
his wife was held captive by the non-Jews for a 
long time because of non-payment. Haita’s 
brother and relatives had to pay the outstanding 
debts in order to free her. Her husband has even 
married another woman, thereby violating his 
marital oath to Haita. She now demands that he 
pay the value of her marriage contract and grant 
her a divorce immediately. Previous cor- 
respondence on the matter has not received a 
response, which is not the kind of treatment one 
would expect from a sizable Jewish community 
such as Fez, which has rabbinic courts. The writer 
closes with a remark that this is aclassical case of 
a fettered wife which should be dealt with by the 
rabbis (at Fez). 




R. Jacob Ibn Zur has left (Fez) for some reason 
that is, at best, hinted atin this letter from R. Judah 
ibn Attar. The latter takes pains to keep R. Jacob's 
confidence a private matter. R. Judah alludes toR. 
Jacob’s present economic privation and to a 
disorganized state of affairs that affects the 
Jewish community as possible causes for R. 
Jacob’s departure (to Meknés). R. Judah states

that he was never in favor of R. Jacob’s move 
(from Fez) because of his responsibilities to his 
many children and because it is not in the best 
interests of a scholar such as R. Jacob to wander 
from place to place. R. Judah writes that he would 
only take up the matter with local communal 
officials upon R. Jacob’s return (to Fez). 


R. Judah continues that one day R. Solomon 
ibn Danan, R. Solomon Cabaliero, and the latter's 
partner, Mas’Ud ibn Samuel, came to see himona 
matter of litigation and while there brought up the 
subject as to whether R. Jacob Ibn Zur (referred 
to, by them, as Ploni-anon) had written anything 
to him about the move to Meknés. Then they 
showed him a signed letter sent to them by R. 
Jacob Aspag, Mas’td ibn Adhan, and Saadya 
Lahaboz in which they were asked to persuade 
the anonymous party (R. Jacob) to write to the 
Nagid so that he, in turn, would persuade anon to 
return home (to Fez). Many signatures of com- 
munity members were attached to this letter. At 
this juncture in the conversation R. Judah could 
not restrain himself any longer so he blurted out, 
“must anon (R. Jacob) initiate the process of 
conciliation and appeasement with a note of good 
will when he suffers so much privation because of 
the situation?” He then writes that he showed R. 
Jacob's letter to the assembly, who then agreed to 




Commentaries on two Aggadic texts

Shalom Abitboul sends this letter to R. Hayyim

he met with a group of Jews from the town of 
Ouarzazat, which is located in the vicinity of 




124 




R. Judah’s evaluation of who should initiate the 
conciliation. Then R. Judah hid the letter and did 
not discuss the matter with them until some 
further action could be taken. 


The Nagid had sent a note to R. Judah 
concerning the appointment of R. Saadya 
Lahaboz as financial overseer of the community. 
R. Judah informs R. Jacob that he responded to 
the go-between of the Nagid by stating that the 
community did not want R. Saadya to fill that 
position. It prefers that two other people should 
be appointed as overseers of the community’s 
finances, namely, R. Mordecai Dery and R. Saul 
Kohen. At this time R. Judah inquires whether a 
note was sent to the Nagid to appease Anon (R. 
Jacob)? R. Judah has been informed that R. 
Moses ibn Adhan was given oral instructions to 
serve as a go-between to reconcile the Nagid and 
Anon (R. Jacob). R. Judah expresses his opinion 
that because of the situation and the personalities 
involved there can be no realistic improvement in 
their relations unless R. Jacob confronts the 
Nagid face to face. Only then will the matter be 
restored and R. Jacob will not have to exist in 
exile, as it were. R. Judah concludes his cor- 
respondence with a prayer that God will give R. 
Jacob good counsel. 




“There is no Messiah for Israel for he was

to take place. No copyists’ names are mentioned

merchandise, consisting of dates that they had 
brought with them, because they had en-

A correspondence from David Meshash 




This letter was written by David Meshash on 
the seventh of Tishri 1871. The first part of this 
unusual rhythmic letter is very cryptic. A portion 
of the second part of this letter is written in 
Judaeo-Arabic. The writer explains why his 
response to aprevious letter is late in coming. The 
letter was first directed to another person by 
mistake since the present writer’s name was not 
indicated on the envelope. Furthermore, the 
writer's duties prevented him from writing sooner.

A letter from Joseph Sasson of Jerusalem to R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur concerning the acquisition of 
books 




Joseph Sasson of Jerusalem writes to R. Raphael 
lbn Zur of Fez asking him to reply concerning a 
list of books that he supplied at R. Raphael’s 
request and upon which the latter has neglected 
to act. Joseph also asks for payment of some 
books that were ordered and delivered through 
the services of Moharam Susin on a previous 
occasion. He also asks that the present list of 
books and the money for them should be given to 
R. Jacob Ha-Kohen, who would deliver both on

whom the former sent a letter a week before and 
from whom he would like to receive a reply. A 
request is made by the writer that a beautiful 
citron should be sent to him through the first 
available person. Any price should be paid for it, 
as he has been unable to acquire any. The writer 
asks that regards be sent to R. Raphael Agayni 
and he excuses himself to R. Raphael for not 
having had time to pen a couple of lines. The

Israel Jacob Ha-Levi is an emissary engaged ina

Mekneés, R. Isaac Yitah, has claimed that it was

this had never been agreed to or discussed prior 
to the campaign. In fact, on the day of the

other sums that were pledged but not paid to 
Israel. Other injustices were also perpetrated 
against the writer. He now asks R. Raphael Ha-

rabbis in Fez saying that since the matter had 
already been adjudicated by a rabbinic tribunal 




and a decision rendered they could do nothing 
further. Hayyim claims, however, that the previ- 
ous judgement was rendered while he was under 
duress and that he was forced to agree to an 
unfair decision by threats. Immediately there- 
after a copy of a document was produced which 
provided that the aforementioned object, which 
was now in the possession of the Monsano 
brothers, did, indeed, belong to himself. The

The writer informs Ham-Malakh Raphael of a

A letter from the rabbis of Fez introducing an 
emissary from Tiberias to the communities 
surrounding Tafilalet 




This document, which was composed in Tammuz 
1838, was sent by the following rabbis of Fez: 
Jacob Serero, Jacob (Ibn Zur), and Hayyim 
Abraham Ha-Sarfati to the communities in the 
region of Tafilalet, and as far away as Tidga 
(currently referred to as Taghaoust in the far 
south-western corner of the Anti-Atlas). They are 
asked to support the efforts of the emissary from 




undersigned rabbis, Jacob (Toledano) and 
Mordecai Berdugo, suggest that the rabbis (in 
Fez) should help to reopen the case. This letter 
is addressed to the following rabbis: Saul ibn 
Danan, Raphael Obed Ibn Zur, Elijah Ha-Sarfati, 
and Matitya Serero asking them to oblige one 
of the Monsano brothers to come (to Meknés) 
so that justice will finally be done and tranquility 
will again prevail. 




all the commentaries, and two books composed 
by R. Abraham Palaggi. Excluding the two works 
by R. Abraham, the other books cost the sum of 
ten durham and they come via Jaffa. The last 
edition of Hoshen Mishpat, volume 3, has just 
become available to the writer and it costs four 
durham. The total cost of the books is fourteen 
durham. The writer notes that he has incurred 
additional expenses and that he would like to be 
informed as soon as the books arrive. He con- 
cludes by stating that he is always at the service 
of R. Raphael. The seal of the writer is applied 
at the end of the letter.

portion of the letter, which contains the acrostic 
Raphael Jacob (Simhon), the calamities that have 
befallen the community of Tiberias such as 
famine and bandits are enumerated. The emissary 
had brought with him a letter from Tiberias. The 
rabbis of Fez proclaim a malediction and excom- 
munication on those who would refuse to extend 
aid, and a blessing on those who will grant it. The 
rabbis ask that all amenities should be extended 
to the emissary, since his journey is quite 
dangerous and he can use all possible support.

A plea for a divorce to be granted to the daughter 
of Abraham Ibn Danan, who was abandoned by 
her husband, who resides in Meknes 




This letter was written by R. Judah ibn Attar to R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur, in Meknés, in the month of Kislev 
1722. Esther (daughter of Abraham ibn Danan) of 
Fez has been abandoned by her husband, Saul 
Joseph b. R. Moses Ha-Kohen, who has recently 
taken up residence in Meknés. The tax collector 
continues to oppress her by constantly reminding 
her that she owes the payments that her husband 
has not met. Only by getting her husband to grant 
her a divorce, through the power of agency, will 
she no longer be subject to the threats of the tax 
collector for non-payment of taxes. 


It is true that on an earlier occasion when the 
husband was willing to grant divorces to both his 
wives, R. Judah states that he was not of the 




The rabbis of Meknes write to the rabbis of Fez 
concerning one who is unfit to take a second wife 
since he does not possess the financial means 
and he is not mentally well 




This document was sent by members of the 
rabbinic tribunal in Meknés to the rabbis of Fez, in 
the year 1867. The former relate that Joseph 
Nizzam, of their city, who desires to take asecond 
wife (in addition to his first wife) is not mentally 
balanced nor is he even capable of supporting his 
first wife. He also mistreats his first wife in every 
way imaginable. (A similar case involving a 
decision by R. Raphael Berdugo, of blessed 
memory, contained testimony prohibiting one

opinion that a divorce would have been the proper 
course of action. However, since the tax collec- 
tors do not accept the fact that the husband is 
unable to pay and continue to treat the wife 
mercilessly, the need for a divorce is now urgently 
requested. The aggrieved father, Abraham ibn 
Danan, mentions in his addendum to this letter 
that R. Judah ibn Attar had written to R. Moses ibn 
Attar (of Meknés) to intercede. However, since the 
latter was apparently unsuccessful, R. Abraham 
appeals to R. Jacob Ibn Zur to do his best to 
facilitate the divorce. R. Abraham notes that while 
R. Judah states that the husband has no money, 
he does possess land from which payment should 
be made towards his daughter’s marriage con- 
tract. R. Abraham will abide by whatever action R. 
Jacob takes. R. Abraham sends regards to Rabbi 
Jacob Ibn Zur’s family and R. Jacob’s wife’s sister 




also sends her regards to them. 




The rabbis of Meknés state that as they have 
already written, even if the first wife is pregnant 
the husband will still be permitted to take a 
second wife if the pregnancy is the only grounds 
on which to prevent the second marriage from 
taking place, since at present there is no living 
male offspring from this wife. What is, however, at 
issue in this case is the husband’s inability to 
support a second wife. If he does have means of 
support, in accord with testimony given before 
the rabbis of Fez, then he should make available 
land or movable property in the value of his first 
wife’s marriage contract and the second wife 
could live with him while the first wife would have 
the option of suing for divorce. This ruling is in 
accord with the author of Beit Yehuda (R. Judah 
Ayyash) in responsum no. 5, where he quotes the 
Ribash. 




The first wife’s brothers have brought forward 
two groups of witnesses who have testified that 
her husband is unable to support two wives. This 
testimony is in direct contradiction to that given 
on the husband’s behalf in the court at Fez. The 
wife’s witnesses are deemed superior by their 
number in a case where estimations, not facts, are 
being presented. 


Support must include the provision of food, 
clothing, and furniture in accord with 
Maimonides’ ruling in his code, Yad ha-Hazakah, 
in the section dealing with the Laws concerning 




A response to Aaron Ibn Zur’s request for a Ktav 
Yuhasin—a family tree, on the occasion of his 
daughter’s wedding, is reluctantly given 




Aaron Ibn Zur desires to produce his family tree 
called Ktav Yuhasin, on the occasion of his 
daughter’s marriage. He receives a response to 
this request from his brother who apparently does 
not want his name divulged for reasons of 
security. The brother extends his best wishes and 
prays that the parents of the bride will lead their 
other sons and daugNters to the wedding canopy. 
The writer does not particularly want to divulge 
the historical-biographical information and 
prefers the dead to be left in peace. 


The writer associates his family’s origins with 
the rabbis and scholars of Castile of whom he 
numbers five generations. He begins with R. 
Moses Ibn Zur, 0.b.m., who was known as 




A husband alleges that his young wife is 
rebellious and he wants the matter to be ad- 
judicated 




Rabbi Raphael Moses Elbaz writes to R. Raphael 
Ibn Zur in the month of Tammuz 1877 about a 
husband, R. Meir ben R. Isaac called Asbag, also 
known as ibn Asaboni, who had asked that R. 
Raphael !bn Zur be informed about Meir’s wife, 
the daughter of R. Moses called Asayaig, who 
dwells in Fez. The husband presented a claim 
against his wife, in R. Elbaz’ court, saying that she 
was rebellious and that she deserted him for a 




Married Life, Hilkhort Ishut, chapter 14:3. This 
ruling is also in accord with R. Jacob in his Code, 
Tur, chapter 76. Thus, when this mentally 
unbalanced man comes to the rabbis in Fez they 
are asked to evaluate his real wealth and they 
should not permit him to marry a second woman 
until he appears in Meknés and reaches financial 
settlement according to the law, as R. Raphael 
Berdugo, 0.b.m., decided. This document is 
signed in Meknés by the rabbis, Matityah Ber- 
dugo, Abraham Amar, and Jacob Berdugo. 




Abraham the Hebrew, his only son the luminary, 
R. lsaac, 0.b.m., and then he mentions the second 
R. Moses o.b.m., the son of Jacob, 0.b.m., who is 
the fifth generation. “We are the scion of the 
saintly Rabbi Reuben, o.b.m., the son of the 
aforementioned R. Jacob, who was a brother toR. 
Moses Il. At that point in history the family 
branched out into six groups.” The writer in- 
dicates a family tradition which maintains that the 
ancestors are buried (in Spain) in the place where 
the Edict of Expulsion of 1492 was declared. In 
any event he reiterates that his brother has good 
cause to be proud of his family tree. The writer 
implores that after the letter’s contents are read to 
Mordecai ibn Go it should be torn into a thousand 
pieces and then burned. Aaron is also exhorted 
not to divulge who is the source of his informa- 
tion. The. letter was composed on Purim day,

lengthy period. The party pleading the wife’s case 
disclaimed the charge against her as unfounded. 
Furthermore, he argued, the husband probably 
had a prospect for another bride and so had 
trumped up a false claim against his present wife. 
It was decided that the matter should be judged 
on the testimony of witnesses to see which claim 
was correct. 


The cross-examination of witnesses for both 
parties produced the same stalemate as before. 
The young wife was a minor and her alleged 
rebelliousness could not be ascertained. The case 
was recessed indefinitely. At about this time her 
mother was about to give birth in Fez, so she

asked her daughter to come to Fez to help her. 
The husband, Meir, prevented his wife from going 
to her mother’s aid. When she finally went to Fez 
her father would not give her leave to return to her

R. Raphael Moses Elbaz writes to R. Raphael Ibn 
Zur about R. David ben R. Elazar called Adhan,

A query concerning the custom (in Fez) gover- 
ning one who acquires groves, fields, or gardens if 
he also acquires the right of domicile therein? 




Rabbi Raphael Moses Elbaz inquires of R. 
Raphael Ibn Zur concerning the custom, in Fez, 
governing the acquisition of groves, fields, and 
gardens, as to whether the owner also acquires 
the right of domicile therein, particularly when 
they are outside the city limits. This question 
applies also to cases where the property is 
received as a pledge or is rented by Jews from 
non-Jewish owners. What prompts this question 
is that many Jews rent or take as a pledge gardens 
and groves, and then find that the non-Jewish 
owners also rent them to others and no one is able 
to do anything about this practice. 


The writer also inquires about a particular case 




An Halakhic enquiry is posed concerning the 
possibility of rendering a lenient decision in a 
case dealing with a levirate

him in other capacities during the day. R. Raphael 
Elbaz asks R. Raphael Ibn Zur to try to arrange a 
compromise between them but if he is un- 
successful, the matter will have to be made 
subject to litigation. 




Elbaz’s jurisdiction with their son and when the 
husband saw his son and his former wife he was 
moved to compassion for them. He divorced his 
new wife and now desires to remarry his former 
wife and this is where the problem begins. An 
enactment was promulgated in R. Elbaz’s locality 
which said that a man who is a stranger, who 
comes from another land, cannot marry a woman 
in the community (of Sefrou), for well known 
reasons. Therefore, the writer was instructed by 
the man to correspond with R. Raphael Ibn Zur 
concerning the entire matter. 




concerning a garden outside the city limits and 
the house belonging to it that adjoins the wall of 
the city. The garden was completely enclosed and 
given on pledge to a Jew by its non-Jewish 
owners. Presently the non-Jewish owners decid- 
ed to build an inn in the garden. Now the writer 
asks whether the Jewish owners have rights of 
domicile in the garden, called Hezkat ha-Yishuv. 
Or, he says, do we Say that since the Jews never 
thought about claiming rights of domicile until the 
present situation arose that they have no such 
claim? If the Jews try to change the terms of the 
agreement to establish their rights of domicile by 
the fact that the garden is pledged to them and 
they have sowed vegetables thereon fora number 
of years so that they can demonstrate a solid 
claim to the land, can they prevent the building of 
this inn? The need for a response to this query is 
pressing. 




R. Raphael Ibn Zur that in the course of his travels 
he arrived at the community called Klaya, 
amongst the towns of the Rif. A question was 
raised with regard to the practice of the law of the 
Levirate. Since few books are available here 
except for the Code Even ha-Ezer, wherein a 
minority opinion is mentioned on this particular 




subject, the writer refuses to render a lenient 
decision based on that citation. He asks R. 
Raphael to provide a basis for a lenient decision 
on the subject of the Levirate and to render a 
speedy reply. The writer refers to the strange 




One who was in debt gave the creditor securities 
in excess of the value of the debt and he demands 
that an oath be taken if the creditor denies 
receiving the securities 




R. Judah ibn Attar responds to the letters that had 
been previously sent to him by R. Hasdai 
Almosnunia concerning a bill of debt that Jacob 
Konsina held against Saadya Lahabusi. Jacob 
collected some of the debt, but claiming that there 
was still money owing, he gave his power of 
attorney to Solomon ibn Amara to collect the 
amount that was still outstanding. Subsequently, 
he gave Solomon half of a bolt of woolen material 
to deliver to Saadya but, wielding his power of 
attorney, Solomon confiscated it as payment for 
the remainder of the debt. All these details had 
been included in the letter sent by R. Hasdai. 


R. Judah now writes that he summoned 




An inquiry is made as to the availability of 
documents which can substantiate the claim of 
inheritors which has a bearing on the redemption 
of captives 




R. Judah ibn Attar writes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
concerning deeds of the inheritors of Isaac and 
Ephraim ibn Amara that were deposited with the 
latter. He asks R. Jacob to send them to him 
because the courtyard containing a new ritual 
bath, which was built by Isaac ibn Amara, is 
presently held in the possession of R. Joseph 
Adhan as a pledge and the descendants of R. Levi 
ibn Amara, may his soul repose in paradise, are 
pressing their claim to it based on the existence of 
the aforementioned deeds. R. Judah’s court tried 
to render a decision in the nature of acompromise 
so that the claimants, the descendants of R. Levi 
ibn Amara, should agree to monetary settlement 
and cease pressing any further claim. This 




customs that the people of this locale practice, 
especially with regard to Levirate procedures. 
Regards are sent to R. Abner Ha-Sarfati. This 
letter was written on the eighth day of Tammuz 
1877. 




Saadya and read him the contents of the letter 
which R. Hasdai had sent him. Saadya replied that 
he had given securities to Jacob which were 
worth in excess of the sum that was supposed to 
be outstanding so how could Jacob claim that the 
debt was not fully paid? Saadya further suggested 
that Jacob and his friend Moses Marago should 
take an oath stating that they did not receive the 
whole sum of the debt in the form of securities, 
and that this oath should be recorded. Afterwards, 
Saadya said, he would challenge R. Solomon in 
the courts concerning the way he had exercised 
his power of attorney. R. Judah tells R. Hasdai he 
must now summon R. Jacob and R. Solomon to 
inform them of Saadya’s reply and that affirmation 
of their oaths should be forwarded by the first 
available courier. Then Saadya can enter into 
litigation with Solomon. A speedy reply is awaited 
from R. Hasdai. 




decision will remain in force as long as deeds of 
ownership are not produced. If they are produced 
then a judgement can be rendered accordingly. 
Until such time judgement will be suspended. 
Thus, the court, having written to R. Jacob on two 
or three occasions, awaits the forwarding of those 
documents by R. Jacob. 


Concerning other documents held by R. 
Jacob, R. Joseph Adhan needs to produce a 
pledge in order to redeem himself with its value 
because he and his two brothers are being held by 
a non-Jew who causes them grief and has placed 
them in confinement on his property for over two 
weeks. The non-Jew caught the young son with 
the intention of converting him to Islam. The non- 
Jew freed them on the condition that cash would 
be made available to him immediately. The 
adversity of the times makes it impossible for 
others to help so that the pledge must be 
redeemed. For this reason Joseph Adhan sends 
his eldest son, Mimun, to R. Jacob to receive the

documents from him directly since Joseph is in 
such an oppressed situation. The son will not

available at once so as not to prolong any false 




A final exhortation of Isaac Ibn Amara to produce 
deeds in substantiation of his claim or the 
judgement will remain in Joseph Adhan’s favor 




R. Judah ibn Attar writes to R. Shalom ibn 
Lakhraif concerning a judgement which was 
discussed in Ms.250, on page 318a. A favorable 
decision concerning the redemption of the pledge 
was given to Joseph Adhan against the claims of 
Isaac ibn Amara, the son of Mimun, who resides in 
the vicinity of R. Shalom. Thus, the descendants 




Abraham Ibn Amara is in trouble with the ruling 
authorities and he can only redeem himself by 


Calling in all debts owed to him and by what he can 
realize from what is due to him from a partnership 




The rabbis Judah ibn Attar and Jacob Ibn Zur, at 
Fez, signed this document which they wrote to the 
rabbis Isaac Nahon and Isaac Halevi, the com- 
munal leaders, and also to R. Samuel Abudarham 
and Joseph Abudarham (at Tetuan). The case 
concerns R. Abraham ibn Amara who holds a bill 
of debt owed to him by Mordecai ibn Amozag in 
the amount of one thousand uqiot. The creditor, 
Abraham, received his claim through Jacob ibn 
Ramukh and his wife who received the money as 
part of her dowry. Jacob’s wife was the daughter 
of Solomon ibn Danan, of blessed memory, who 
held a bill of debt against the aforementioned 
Mordecai, which became Jacob’s wife’s portion of 
the inheritance from her late father. 


Abraham ibn Amara is now in dire straits with 
the ruling authorities and requires large sums of 
money to redeem himself from his poverty and his 
oppressors. The king’s agents were about to 
descend on him to demand their money, but he 
managed to put off their arrival until a response 
should be forthcoming to this letter. Therefore, a 
reply should be sent on receipt of this letter as to 




132 




hopes, since this case involves the religious act of 
redemption of captives. If the deeds are not 
available then R. Jacob might be able to offer 
testimony or produce witnesses concerning them 
in hopes that some benefit will arise from this kind 
of evidence in lieu of the missing deeds. 




of R. lsaac ibn Amara have had to admit that the 
pledge held on the land in the yard of Zerah ibn 
Pargin belongs to Joseph, since a thirty-day 
period and every opportunity was given for 
documentary evidence to be presented but it 
never was. R. Judah asks R. Shalom to send for 
Isaac and to read to him all that is contained in this 
letter as a final warning that he either shall 
immediately produce all pertinent documents or 
else Joseph Adhan can immediately begin to 
appropriate the pledge for his own needs. 




whether the money will be readily paid, or, if the 
debtor is not able to pay the debt immediately, 
what other arrangements can be made. As soon 
as payment is received the bill of debt will be 
destroyed. The debtor is warned that if he does 
procrastinate then the money will be collected by 
force. Any additional expenses incurred as a 
result of the coercive measures will be added to 
the total amount of the loan. 


Abraham ibn Amara also has a contract of 
partnership with Abraham Adrutiel in a meat 
concession, for one year, to be renewed every 
month. Both parties have agreed to divide the 
profits on the basis that R. Adrutiel will run the 
business’s day-to-day transactions, while Abra- 
ham ibn Amara will keep the accounts, rendering 
exact reports to R. A. Adrutiel whenever he asks 
for them. R. Adrutiel has placed complete trust 
in R. Amara in all matters and no note can be 
drawn up to disturb the legal force of the contract 
for the duration of the time therein stipulated. The 
partnership shall extend from the seventeenth 
of Av 1727 until the month of Av 1728. The con- 
tract of partnership registers that R. Solomon 
Abudarham will pay for the hides. The under- 
signed ask their correspondents to compel R. 
Adrutiel to make payment to R. Amara of monies 
that he still owes him for this year’s receipts. 




Abraham ibn Amara also holds a bill of debt 
against R. Mas’Ud ibn Israel ibn Haroush. Under 
its terms payments should be forthcoming on 
demand and any expenses incurred should be 
paid. The writers state that R. Mas’Ud ibn Haroush 
should now be compelled to pay R. Abraham ibn 
Amara what he owes. If these debtors are not able 
to make payment then the order of law shall pre- 
vail, officers will be sent, and the debtors will be

Aaron Ha-Kohen) who must finance his only 
son’s wedding. Since he is poor he is obliged to 
raise funds by appealing to others. The impor- 
tance of supporting such an undertaking is 
underscored by the statement “that even a Torah 
Scroll should be sold for the purpose of Torah 
study or for marriage.” Not only should financial 
aid be made available to the bearer of this letter 
but he should be accorded hospitality that is 
fitting for his station. A prayer is inscribed at the

R. Judah Ibn Attar writes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
about two different cases in Jewish Law 




R. Judah ibn Attar writes to R. Jacob Ibn Zur 
about two different cases. The first case deals 
with a woman who claims that a pledge given fora 
loan was redeemed on her behalf. The plaintiff, 
Solomon ibn Yaish is now claiming that the 
pledge is unredeemed and he is pressing his claim 
against her. The first part of this correspondence 
is written in Ladino. The woman has not been 
permitted to take an oath to support her statement 
since there is cause for questioning her 
testimony. R. Judah gives her fifteen days to 
defend her position which is that she has already 
redeemed the pledge from her son-in-law, Isaac, 
and that she has subsequently torn it up. The 
woman has agreed that if she cannot offer 
additional evidence in the allotted time, then 
Solomon ibn Yaish’s claim will stand. The pledge 
is supposed to have been deposited with R. 
Samuel Arwaz. 


The second case originates in Debdou. With 
the authorization of his community, Jacob Kohen 
of Debdou has brought a complaint, against 
Samuel Kohen stating that the latter has sworn 




134 




them of his campaign. The date of this letter is 
given as the month of Adar 1760. The name of the

in the form of an acrostic. 
It may very well be that all the letters in this 
collection were composed by Immanuel Mon- 
sano. 




arguments in the presence of the writer but since 
a decision was not reached the parties are willing 
to submit to the decision of another authority, 
which is R. Jacob. The particulars of the dispute 
were forwarded to R. Jacob but they are not stated 
in this correspondence. The writer asks for a 
comprehensive and speedy reply as he has 
received on several other occasions when he 
turned to R. Jacob to render a judgement. 




falsely. But, from the reaction of R. Joseph Ha- 
Kohen, R. Judah ibn Attar deduces that Samuel is 
being unjustly charged, especially since the 
scholar who was reported to have signed the 
charge against Samuel, namely, R. Joseph has 
actually signed nothing. The claimants, led by 
Jacob Kohen, have made many attempts to oblige 
Samuel to pay a penalty for his huge debts that 
they claim are outstanding. Furthermore, R. 
Judah says, Jacob is acting presumptuously in 
that he refuses to obey his own authority in Fez 
and is demanding that the case be heard in 
Meknés. Once before R. Judah had washed his 
hands of the affair, because Jacob was so 
contemptible, but Samuel’s pleadings oblige him 
once again to involve himself in the case. He will 
attempt to achieve asettlement of the dispute by a 
compromise, whereby Samuel would pay a 
certain sum for every book of recorded accounts 
that was at the base of the dispute. However, he 
fears that Jacob has taken an uncompromising 
position just to hurt Samuel and to cause bad 
reports to be spread about him. Samuel is known 
for his intelligence, and his charitable nature has 
gained him much renown, so he has become the 
victim of animosity because others are jealous of 
him. 




A chronicle 




[Portions of this chronicle were recorded by 
Saadya ibn Danan and the final copyist was 
Immanuel, son of Joshua Serero. The major 
portion of page 326a is written in Judaeo-Arabic. 
What follows is a translation of the Hebrew 
portion of page 326a and the entire page 326b.] 


“It is written in the hand of my grandfather R. 
Samuel ibn Danan o.b.m., that the Castilian 
expulsion transpired in the year 1497. Lest | forget 
the date | have recorded it here. Saadya ibn 
Danan. Also he (R. Samuel ibn Danan) records 
that the expulsion that transpired in Fez Albali 
(the old city of Fez) to the Toshavim took place in 
the year 1438. The expulsion that befell the Mellah 
occurred in the year 1465. (Recorded by) Saadya 
ibn Danan.” 


“In the year 1636, on the seventh of the month 
of Adar II, an earthquake was heard which caused 
a great panic in Fez. People grabbed weapons and 
they attacked one another in confusion. This was 
recorded by Saadya ibn Danan and it was copied 
by Immanuel Serero.” A solar eclipse is also 
recorded and the amount of sunlight is measured. 
Stars were seen in the afternoon on the twenty- 
eighth of Nisan, circa 1630. A great quake was felt 
in an early morning of 1624, whereupon a great 
number of houses and towers were demolished in 
Fez Albali and about 3,500 people were killed. 
More people were injured after the quake because 
of the weakened condition of the houses. It was 
regarded as a miracle that not one Jew was killed 
although their houses were demolished, especial- 
ly as their houses were not so well constructed as 
those of the non-Jews. The reason why this event 
was recorded is stated as follows, “to make known 
to future generations the magnitude of this 
miracle that occurred.” The author is recorded as 
Saadya, the son of Abraham, the son of Samuel 
ibn Danan, o.b.m. All this transpired on the 
occasion of the reading of (the portion of the 




scroll) “and | remembered my covenant with 
Jacob.” 


“Another incident that is reported to have 
occurred on Wednesday, the eve of Shavuot 
(Pentecost), 1624, is that the sky darkened and 
small creatures fell from the sky. The upper 
portion of their bodies were like that of a locust 
and the bottom like a worm. At the same time a 
storm of large (hail) stones fell from the sky. One 
stone weighed four uqiot and inall probability the 
stones were larger before they reached the 
ground. People who were in the marketplace were 
hurt by the falling stones. One stone came 
through the window of R. Moses Almosni’s house 
and it broke a vessel. It was also reported that a 
lion entered the Giza gate of Fez Albali and killeda 
donkey and he took another donkey with him. It is 
not known whether this is true but most of the 
non-Jews Say that it transpired. In the courtyard 
of Mahmoud ben Gidar two cats fought and one 
ate the other. 


“All the foregoing were copied from Saadya 
ibn Danan’s Ms., by Immanuel b. R. Joshua 
Serero in the month of Heshvan 1724.” 


[Page 330a and b is part of Ms.258 which is 
found on page 326a and b. At the bottom of page 
330a historical information is recorded in Judaeo- 
Arabic and it continues on page 330b and page 
326a, which are actually the same page.] The 
contents of page 330a are given below. 


As well as Fez the communities of Marrakesh, 
Dera, Tafilalet, and their environs are mentioned. 
A prediction of events based on when the New 
Year will fall is offered for the cities of Morocco. 
Brigands will abound and wars will be fought. The 
end of the year will be appreciably better than the 
early part. Plentiful rain will reduce the price of 
wheat. The day on which the New Year will occur 
will affect weather conditions, health conditions, 
and also whether difficulties will be encountered 
with the crops. This type of forecasting reminds 
one of a kind of Almanac.

A letter of consolation to the Serero family from

the death of Jacob Serero, o.b.m.

Exposition of an Aggadic text from the Talmud 




Various Aggadic interpretations are offered for a 
text found in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate 
Gittin, folio 36b. The text is as follows: “Those 




R. Mordecai Birdugo asks R. Jacob Ibn Zur to set 
the record straight in a dispute concerning two 
widowed women 




This letter deals with the case of the first widow of 
Jacob Pariente who is undergoing much anguish. 
R. Mordecai wants R. Jacob Ibn Zur toinform him 
whether the woman’s suffering resulted from a 
decision and action taken by R. Jacob Ibn Zur or 
whether the second wife, who is a person of a 
bitter disposition, is the cause of the first wife’s 
suffering? If the former is the case then why does 
R. Jacob not inform R. Mordecai about it? At least 
R. Jacob should respond to R. Mordecai’s last 
correspondence wherein the latter proposed a 
settlement in favor of the first wife. 


If R. Jacob Ibn Zur does not agree with R. 




An exhortatory prayer, called Tokheha, com- 
posed by R. Bahya Ibn Paquda and copied by R. 
Jacob Ibn Zur 




R. Jacob Ibn Zur states, in his introduction to this 
liturgical poem, called Tokheha, that it was 
composed by the author of the Hovot ha-Levavot, 
R. Bahya ibn Paquda. The latter states in the 
aforementioned work that he composed this 
poem as an exhortation to the soul. R. Jacob

Serero, of blessed memory. The mourners to 
whom the letter is written are R. Reuben Serero, R. 
Matitya Serero, R. Shalom Serero, and R. Joshua 
Serero. The praises of the departed are for- 
mulated into four paragraphs, each one commen- 
cing with the word Zaddik and concluding with a 
popular saying culled from Talmudic literature. 
The letter was composed in the year 1855-56. 




who are insulted but do not return insults in kind 
to those who insulted them act out of love (of 
God) and they rejoice with the portion which the 
Almighty meted out to them.” [For page 330a and 
b, see Ms.258.] 




Mordecai’s viewpoint then “he should have sent 
her forth with nothing, as naked as the day that 
she was born.” Furthermore, R. Mordecai would 
surely abide by R. Jacob’s decision because of the 
esteem in which R. Jacob is held. R. Mordecai 
asks, “why was it necessary to introduce the non- 
Jewish ruling authority into the situation?” It is 
the writer's intention to attempt to arrange a 
settlement between the disputing parties. 
However, if the second wife took the action that 
she perpetrated without R. Jacob’s permission 
then he should denounce her, since because of 
her actions the first wife was obliged to come 
before the authorities and she continues to incura 
great loss. Therefore, a speedy reply is expected 
from R. Jacob wherein he should set the record 
straight. 




further states that this composition subsequently 
appeared in Mahzorim (High Holy Days prayer 
books) and it is also noted in the work Sha’arei ha- 
Teshuvah. He desired to possess a copy of this 
composition, until the day he happened to find it 
in an edition of the Mahzor of Rome which was 
filled with a multitude of liturgical pieces referred 
to as Yozrot, Krovot, and Tokhehdt. R. Jacob 
copied this text for his friend, the scholar R. 
Nehemiah Ha-Kohen, as a gift of remembrance. 




A letter from Ha-Zevi Me’at Devash to R. Raphael 
Ibn Zur concerning the availability of books for 
purchase 




This letter was sent in response to R. Raphael Ibn 
Zur’s request for aset of the Codes of Jewish Law. 
Ha-Zevi Me’at Devash, the writer of this letter, who 




Zevi Judah Birdugo asks that certain conditions 
stipulated for an estate be nullified so that he may 
utilize the estate for capital to enable him to settle 
in the Holy Land 




[This letter was sent after a previous letter which 
is found in Ms.11, on page 22a.] R. Zevi Judah 
Birdugo, who resides in Jerusalem, requires 
funds which he can realize from his portion of an 
estate left by his grandfather. The latter stipulated 
certain conditions, namely, that the land should 
not be used in payment for a claim originating 
from a marriage contract nor should it be sold or 




A letter of consolation on the demise of R. Jacob 
Ibn Zur, o.b.m. 




This letter of consolation is written by Joseph 
Israel on the death of the great Rabbi Jacob Ibn 
Zur. The writer appears to curse those aspects 
that are related to the decay of mortals rather than 
to death itself. In fact, he characterizes death itself 
as “good” for it liberates the soul and enables it to 
ascend to those celestial spheres where it will 




R. Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur is asked to make 
available a copy of a decision rendered by another 
scholar that he possesses, which may serve as a 
precedent in a case that must presently be 
adjudicated 




R. Matityah ibn Zikhri asks R. Elijah Solomon Ibn 
Zur to provide a copy of a lega! judgement that 
was rendered by Mahari Mas’td, of blessed

R. Raphael that, while recently there was an 
overabundance of this work, supply of this edition 
has now virtually been exhausted. However, no 
effort will be spared to fulfill R. Raphael’s request. 
Once the books are located they will be sent to 
Gibraltar, to the Halevi family. R. Raphael is asked 
to wait until they are made available. 




given as a pledge. These conditions were set in 
order to maintain the estate in perpetuity so that 
the descendants would be able to benefit from the 
land’s produce. 


R. Zevi Judah’s brother waived his family’s 
rights to the land in favor of the former. R. Zevi 
Judah asks R. Solomon Ibn Zur and the young 
scholar R. Y. Monsonyego to render a favorable 
judgement which will render null and void the 
conditional element of the deed so that he can sell 
the land to acquire what he needs; especially 
since he is utilizing it for the religious duty of 
settlement in the Holy Land. This letter was sent 
from Meknés to Fez in the year 1862.

wisdom of the author of Ecclesiastes who saw, 
according to this writer's interpretation, joy in the 
act of lament. Thus does he see the day of death 
as the day of Hilula—celebration. 


The greatness of the deceased is extolled as 
his prospective spiritual rewards in the world of

pay the expense involved in preparing the copy 
which is needed to resolve a pressing problem in 
Jewish law. The case involves the falling in of a 
roof which is mortgaged to others. Do the owners 
of the roof lose their rights to the roof or not? An 
answer to a similar problem was rendered by 
Mahari Mas’Ud and therefore a copy of his 
judgement is called for.

A plea to the rabbis Yedidia Monsonyego and 
Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur to right an injustice 
perpetrated against a dead orphan 




A woman called Rebecca, the wife of R. Isaac 
Afriat, was shattered by the death of her grand- 
son, the youth Ayush ibn Joseph ben Haroush 
who was the son of her daugNter, especially since 
she had no money with which to provide him with 
shrouds, burial needs, a candle for his soul, or the 
recital of memorial prayers on his behalf. The 
grandmother had to borrow money in order to get 
all the paraphernalia that was necessary for his 
burial. Two months later the creditor came to 
collect his due and the grandmother could no 
longer put him off. Therefore she came before the 
rabbis Matitya ibn Zikhri and Raphael Moses 
Elbaz asking them to write to the rabbis (of Fez) 
(Yedidia Monsonyego and Solomon Elijah Ibn 




A plea is written to R. Solomon Ibn Zur on behalf 
of Mordecai Elbaz who is destitute. A claim that a 
debtor should pay the additional penalty for a 
debt paid late 




Rabbi Raphael Moses Elbaz asks R. Solomon 
Elijah Ibn Zur to extend aid to R. Mordecai Elbaz, 
who is a relative of the writer, and whose family 
has recently, become afflicted with poverty and 
hunger. R. Mordecai has never had to depend 
upon the help of others before and has always 
lived a frugal life. He still devotes himself to Torah 
study constantly and especially to the study of 
Zohar. 


A second subject is dealt with in this letter. The 
case involves a debt that had to be paid in two 
installments by Reuben to Simeon. There was an 
agreement between both parties that if the 
payments were not made on time then Reuben

Zur) to support her claim. 


The deceased youth had been in partnership 
with Joseph Saba and with Moses Yalu, and 
during this time, his father, Joseph, had been 
killed by non-Jews. The grandmother has heard 
from reliable sources that Moses Yalu took: the 
money that was given in recompense for the 
murder of the father of the dead youth. The rabbis 
(of Fez) are asked to summon Moses Yalu to make 
payment with the money that was given on behalf 
of the murdered father to cover the loan for the 
burial expense of the dead son; for, indeed, the 
latter was the rightful heir. Were it not for her 
advanced age and her weakened condition the 
grandmother would travel (to Fez) to enter into 
litigation with Moses Yalu. The rabbis (at Fez) are 
asked to render judgement on the grandmother's 
behalf for the court is the proper caretaker of the 
orphan and the widow. The address directs this 
letter to Fez. 




would be obliged to pay an additional amount of 
money as a penalty. Reuben made the first 
payment on time but, just before the second 
payment was due Simeon left town. Reuben 
delivered the money that he owed, to the court 
stating that the creditor was not presently 
available. When the creditor returned he demand- 
ed that the penalty should be paid since he 
received the money after the deadline. R. Raphael 
Moses Elbaz presently inquires of R. Solomon 
what decision should the court render? The writer 
refers R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur to Hoshen Mish- 
pat, chapter seventy-three, paragraph 8, and he 
cites the Sema on that text. He also mentions 
the responsa of the Rashba cited by the Beit 
Yosef, chapter seven; also the Kelalei Ha-Rdésh, 
Kelal No. 8, paragraph 6; and finally the work 
Avodat ha-Gershtni, part |, chapter 7. A speedy 
reply is requested. 




R. Raphael Maman inquires about a daughter's 
share of her father’s estate after his demise 
although he had previously granted her an 
inheritance as she was a child from a previous 
marriage 




This query was sent to R. Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur 
at Fez, by R. Raphael Maman. A daughter from a 
first marriage who benefitted by receiving an 
inheritance from her father’s estate is now entitled 
to receive an additional inheritance from her 
father’s estate after his demise in accordance with 
the enactment referred to as ‘Isur Nikhsei,’ which 
means a tenth of the property. What amount is she 
entitled to receive if there is a second wife and 
sons who survive the deceased father? For 
example, if for argument’s sake there are one 
hundred silver pieces to be divided, do we give 




A divorcée claims that she is the victim of an 
unjust decision concerning the financial settle- 
ment that she received for her marriage contract 
and she wants to press a claim against a third 




party 




R. Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur had previously written 
to R. Matityah (ibn Zikhri) concerning a divorcée 
who is claiming that the financial settlement of her 
marriage contract was unfair and is now deman- 
ding a more just and equitable settlement. R. 
Elijah states that since the woman and her three 
daughters are in economic distress a more 
favorable settlement should be accorded to her. 
R. Raphael Maman, the writer of this letter, 
responds to R. Elijah Solomon, of Fez, to clarify 
for the latter why the original judgement should 
stand. 


This woman deserves no special considera- 
tion in respect of her marriage contract for the 
following reasons. Firstly, she and her former 
husband were involved in collusion by trying to 
coerce others to divest themselves of property 
which was originally accorded to her in her 
marriage contract but was sold to others a long 
time ago. Her husband would remarry her once 




this daughter ten pieces of silver and divide the 
remainder between the second wife and her 
sons? If that were done, then the wife would re- 
ceive fifty percent of what remains, which is forty- 
five silver pieces, and the remaining forty-five 
pieces of silver would be divided amongst the 
sons. Or, does the second wife receive fifty per- 
cent of the total estate at the outset which gives 
her fifty silver pieces and the remainder divided 
as follows—ten silver pieces to the daughter and 
the remaining forty pieces to the sons? Perhaps 
the second wife’s portion does not enter into the 
calculation of ‘Isur Nikhsei’ at all, in which case 
the daughter is only entitled to one tenth of what 
the male and female issue receive, which is a 
considerably smaller sum. The writer states that 
this is an actual case that is pending and he 
requires that a decision be rendered. A speedy 
reply is desired. 




she had extracted the money from the third party 
under false pretense. Secondly, her marriage 
contract was mortgaged for a debt so that she has 
no rights to negotiate on the strength of her 
marriage contract. Furthermore, a compromise 
settlement could have been reached were she 
willing to waive any future claims on her marriage 
contract. R. Y. Adhan sought such a compromise 
and it was only out of respect for him that there 
was a willingness to entertain such an arrange- 
ment. Strictly according to the law, no com- 
promise should have even been introduced. 
When the woman saw that she could get no 
satisfaction she turned to the ruler to try to obtain 
a ruling in her favor. The divorcée charged that a 
bad judgement had been rendered against her. 
The ruler decreed that the case should be sent 
(from Meknés) to the rabbis of Fez for review. The 
charges that this woman made must be proven to 
be unfounded so as to clear the court of any false 
accusations in the way they had rendered their 
verdict. The writer himself is involved in this 
litigation with the divorcée as the third party that 
acquired the property which she claims belongs 
to her. That is why Raphael Maman responds toR. 
Elijah Solomon Ibn Zur instead of R. Matityah 
(Zikhri), to whom Ibn Zur wrote originally. The

writer does not desire to elaborate any more to R. 
Ibn Zur except in a face to face confrontation. IfR. 
Elijah Solomon stills wants to grant the divorcée 
and her children some funds as a result.of the 
earlier compromise, the writer is not averse to her 
receiving some aid, especially since the orphans, 
the children of the divorcée, are cousins to the 
writer. However, the writer refuses to permit this 
grant to be given a guise of legality in the form ofa 
compromise, since the cause of justice will not be 
served in that manner. 


In the last paragraph of the letter, R. Raphael 




A letter of introduction written on behalf of R. 
Jacob Ohana who requires economic aid 




This letter is written to R. Solomon Elijah Ibn Zur 
on behalf of a scholar, R. Jacob Ohana, of Rabat, 
who requires financial assistance. The writer, 




Raphael Maman writes a short note to R. 
Solomon Ibn Zur concerning two cases that were 
under litigation 




Raphael Maman informs R. Solomon Ibn Zur that 
the author of a legal decision [unknown to us] has 
pleaded that the judgement should not be 
revealed to R. Joseph Halevi for reasons known 




Two allegorical folk tales and a poetic composi- 
tion of sixteen stanzas, by Raphael Arzi. Another 
poetic composition of six stanzas by Hayyim 
Toledano, and a metaphorical epistle by Raphael 
Arzi 




The first of two allegories relates the tale of a 
maiden who was fooled by a Don Juan type lover. 
He wooed her, married her, and then he aban- 
doned her. He returned to her after many years, 
only to abandon her again and leave her shattered 
and forlorn. A sage warns her against him and 
informs her of his philandering nature. The 
narrator breaks off before the end of the tale of 
woe is concluded. He states, in his puckish way, 
that it is better to save the paper. 




140 




takes issue with R. Elijah Solomon who cited a 
ruling of R. Judah ibn Attar o.b.m., that witnesses 
should write their testimony that they saw a bill of 
pledge. He states that even R. Judah ibn Attar 
would have agreed that where the bill of pledge is 
still in force such written testimony is irrelevant. 
The writer states that he follows Maimonides’ 
ruling in this case. The writer also notes that the 
Rema’s view expressed in Hoshen Mishpat 115:5 
is rejected by most authorities, especially sinceR. 
Caro is in disagreement with that view. [The 
address to Fez is on the other side of this letter. ] 




Raphael ibn Arzi, asks R. Solomon Elijah to 
ensure that the community extends a helping 
hand to R. Jacob. He also requests that since the 
rainy season will soon commence the fundraising 
effort should be expedited as soon as possible, so 
that the scholar can return home. [The address 
to Fez is given on the other side of the page.] 




only to that individual. The writer asks R. Solomon 
to affirm the decision so that the matter can be 
concluded. Raphael Maman mentions another 
case that was brought to litigation, and informs 
R. Solomon that he wrote to Raphael Agayni to 
make payment in accord with the decision ren- 
dered. [The address to Fez is given on the other 
side of the page.] 




The second tale relates the story of how a 
virtuous young man was able to succeed in the 
moral battle and how he avoided the clutches of 
wayward women who desired to ensnare him. 
One woman, however, succeeded with her wiles 
and the young man succumbed to her charms and 
wed her. However, she proved to be unfaithful to 
him and he reviled her. Yet he wanted her to 
receive her just desserts so he went to seek her 
out. On the way he encountered her but she did 
not appear at all familiar to him. The woman 
fabricated a story that her husband had been 
imprisoned for more than ten years. After this 
chance encounter she had twins and she justified 
her ways before her unknowing husband. 


Sixteen verses follow which characterize 




women. They are penned by Raphael Arzi, the 
author of the aforementioned allegories. Another 
six verses similar in style to the previous verses 
were composed by Hayyim Toledano. 


The final text in this group of writings is by 
Raphael Arzi and is an epistle to R. Judah, the 
father of Samuel and Amram (Elbaz), in a 




A chronicle recorded by Immanuel Monsano 




The chronicler commences with a lament about 
the unfortunate times in which he lives. “In the 
year 1739 no rain fell in the month of Adar | until 
the seventeenth day of the month. On the 
eighteenth day prayers of thanksgiving were 
recited. In the month of Adar II no rain fell until 
the seventh day at which time a public fast was 
declared, although some people were fasting 
anyway because it was the anniversary of Moses’ 
death. At the morning service supplicatory 
prayers and scriptural verses were read. At the 
afternoon service the Torah scroll was read and 
additional prayers were recited. On Thursday, the 
ninth day of Adar II, a public fast was again 
declared. At the morning service supplicatory 
prayers were offered, including ‘Our Father Our 
King.’” 


The head of the academy and leading rabbi of 
the community delivered a lecture after which the 
service was concluded. The lecture stressed that 
the denial of rain was directly related to the sin of 
neglecting Torah study, since Torah study leads 
to good behavior. The speaker also stated that 
gossip and other improper exercise of speech 
cause the rains to cease; this is based on 
interpretation. Public violation of Sabbath laws, 
especially by the vendors of liquor, is also a factor. 
Therefore, an enactment was made to the effect 
that even if only one witness saw a vendor sell 
liquor, whether to Jew or non-Jew, on the Sab- 
bath, then he should pay a fine to be used on 
behalf of the poor. Another lapse recounted by 
the scholar was that Jewish women go to Fez to 
work for the non-Jews and remain there day and 
night and on the Sabbaths. They must behave in 
accordance with the code that Jewish women are 
accustomed to live by. It was decided that an 
emissary should make them return and if they

that he feels he has been unjustly treated by R. 
Judah and he affirms his love and friendship for 
him and his two sons. This is a unique letter of 
reconciliation wherein Raphael asks that their

figure is used to symbolize waywardness. 




refused then the ruler should -be asked to 
intervene to oblige them to do so. R. Azriel ibn 
Amozag was appointed overseer in these matters. 


In that same day good news arrived for the 
Jews concerning Ahdwan Al-Wadaya, one of the 
infamous bands during the days of King Mulay 
Mahmad ibn La-Ariba. There was an eclipse of the 
sun during the latter's reign. Many of the 
misfortunes of this period were recorded in the 
chronicles of R. Immanuel Monsano. The non- 
Jew Mahmad ibn Abu ibn Sa’id suffered a terrible 
death at the hands of King Mulay Lamuztadi, at 
Meknés. There was tranquility in the land during 
the latter’s reign. His accession was in Tammuz, 
1738, and he was declared king, in Fez, on Friday, 
the eighth of Av. 


“In the same day it became cloudy and very 
windy, So much so that we thought it appropriate 
to recite the ‘Great Hallel’ prayer at the afternoon 
service. The scriptural text of Vayehal was 
followed by supplicatory prayers at the afternoon 
service. We must praise the giver of life for He sent 
rain on Sunday, the twelfth of Adar. All day rain 
fell on and off, the sun shone and set, and much 
rain fell in the evening. Great thundering was 
followed by the appearance of the rainbow. It 
again became cloudy with much rain falling on 
the night of the thirteenth (of Adar).” A prayer 
follows that rain may be sent by God. On the 
fourteenth, which is the Festival of Purim, after the 
customary gifts were sent, the rabbi took a Torah 
scroll in his arms and Piyyutim (liturgical poems) 
were read. The price of wheat was still exorbitant. 
A prayer for economic sustenance and the 
coming of the Messiah is recorded, followed by 
the name of the chronicler, Immanuel Monsano. 
The chronicler continues on: 


“On Sunday, the sixteenth of Shevat, 1740, 
while we were engaged in Torah study, a man 
informed us that King Mulay Lamuztadi had

fled to Fez and the entire city was in an uproar 
because of the reign of terror that would follow, 
especially for the Jewish populace, which was the 
usual course of events during unsettled times. 
That same day R. Jacob Monsonyego was 
wounded in the arm and head and as a result lost 
much blood. The king left the city and fled 
eastward since he saw no relief in Fez. On 
Tuesday, the eighteenth of Shevat, Mulay Ab- 
dallah was declared king. This was his third term 
as ruler. The supporters of the king who had 
fled, Known as LeBukhari, went after him to try 
to persuade him to return. In the month of Tishri 
1740, the ruling king arrived at Mekneés. When the 
Al-Wadaya heard of the king’s arrival at Meknés 
they rebelled against him for two months, during 
Tishri and Heshvan, and they still maintained the 
state of rebellion after that. On the twenty-fifth of 
Heshvan, the king sent his representative to them 
with an offer of amnesty. They refused to trust the 
king.” A prayer is added that the Messiah might 
come. The name of Immanuel Monsano con- 
cludes the statement. 


“In the middle of the month of Kislev, 1740, the 
king's officers went to Argil to give warning to the 
Al-Wadaya. They accepted the king’s authority 
because they received a stern warning. On Sun- 
day, the twenty-first of Kislev, they went to meet 
the king who received them and a reconcilia- 
tion was effected. 


“In the year 1758-59 no rain fell from the 
fifteenth of Tevet until the beginning of Adar. 
Clouds began to appear on Tuesday, the thirtieth 
of Shevat followed by much rain. Consequently, 
the prayer of thanksgiving was recited. However, 
the rain ceased again and the gentiles asked the 
Jews to pray for rain; so the court decreed a public 
fast for Monday, the twentieth of the month, for 
old and young, men and women, alike. Penitential 
and supplicatory prayers were recited at the 
morning service. The people went to the cemetery 
and recited prayers at the graves of the saints. 
Psalms were recited at the grave of the Great 
Rabbi Judah ibn Attar. Rabbi Elijah Ha-Sarfati 
gave a lengthy discourse. Afterwards, penitential 
prayers were recited between the gates of the city, 
at the graves of those who were murdered there. 
Then the entourage proceeded to the adjoining 
burial grounds at Al-Karsalin to recite Psalms 




142 




there. They returned, in great distress, to the 
Synagogue of the Toshavim where they recited 
Psalms. The entire congregation assembled there 
for the afternoon service at which time Rabbi 
Saul ibn Danan addressed the people. 


“On Wednesday, the twenty-second, rain fell 
the first part of the day and then ceased: The 
rabbinic tribunal decreed a fast for Monday, the 
twenty-seventh, to be observed in similar fashion 
to the earlier fast. Rabbi Elijah Ha-Sarfati ad- 
dressed the people in the morning while Rabbi 
Raphael Ibn Zur addressed the people at the 
afternoon service. After the Torah reading, seven 
circuits were made around the reader’s stand. At 
each circuit the twenty-ninth Psalm was recited 
and a poem from the Hoshanah Rabbah liturgy 
was read. Penitential prayers were again recited 
but no relief came. On Wednesday, the twenty- 
ninth of the month, on the eve of the New Moon, a 
decree was issued by the court for a fast and each 
group prayed in its own synagogue. The after- 
noon service followed a fast day ritual. That same 
day it became cloudy. On Friday, the second of 
Nisan, towards evening, rain fell. On the Sabbath, 
after midday, great winds and thunder and light- 
ning were followed by much rain and hail which 
affected the fields. Then, no rain fell from that 
day until Sunday night, the third eve of the inter- 
mediate days of Passover, at midnight, when 
much rain fell until the morning.” A blessing for a 
prosperous year concludes this section. 


“After the conquest of the city of Fez by the 
King Muhammad ben Mulay-Abdallah, on Friday 
the twenty-sixth of Av 1760, he brought acannon 
to the Mellah and placed it in the cemetery. He 
told the troops to fill it with gunpowder and to 
shoot it in order to see what distance the missile 
would attain. On Sunday, the New Month of Av, 
the ruler made an inspection of the cannon. When 
he returned home he was welcomed by cheering 
women and he received gifts from the populace. 
On the eve of the New Month of Elul, which was a 
Monday, astorm wind arose and one could almost 
feel the earth quaking. This was followed by 
thunder, lightning, and rain.” The king's tent is 
described as being very big. Another tent of lesser 
size fell from the impact of the storm. More than 
two hundred Al-Wadaya who were imprisoned 
and who subsequently fled, were given amnesty, 




money, and seed for planting by the ruler. Hesent Theruler finally went to Marrakesh and left Mulay 
them to dwell in the environs of Meknés where the Idris in charge. The Jews suffered much at the 
children of the leader were living off brigandage. hands of Mulay Idris.
