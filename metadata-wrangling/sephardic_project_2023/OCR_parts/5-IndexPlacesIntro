Note: Numbers without parentheses indicate that the document was despatched from or received in that city, or that the city is definitely indicated in the text. Numbers in parenthesis mean that it is not certain that the city was involved, but that it most probably was so. For example, in Ms. 162, R. Judah ibn Attar wrote to R. Jacob Ibn Zur in the year 1720. Even though no cities are mentioned it is known that R. Jacob established his residence in Meknés during that period while R. Judah lived in Fez. Therefore we classify the document under Fez [162] and Meknés [162].
