His research interest in hypertext shifted to web-based hypertext architectures, and he began not only building web-based systems, but also to move his writing and publication activities to the web. As an instructor, his materials increasingly integrated web-based content, and he developed over 80 online lessons to supplement classroom instruction.

Smith corresponding to the period of 1970-1984, provided by John B. Smith from his personal collection. In this period, Smith had a joint appointment at Penn State University in the English department and Computation Center. His instructional duties were a blend of English and interdisciplinary subjects. English courses included literature and composition, while the interdisciplinary courses blended science and humanities concerns in courses like Science and Human Values. Smith's contributions to the digital humanities expanded in the 1970s, in part due to his role in the Computing Center as the applications staff member focused on computers and the liberal arts. Over the course of the decade, he developed a three-course sequence on technology and methods for Liberal Arts students; in 1977, he discontinued his Computation Center appointment to teach it half-time in the College of Liberal Arts. Other notable activities include natural language processing techniques, computer-assisted of literature and oral performances, and bibliography systems and practices. He also became interested in literary critical theory, particularly in exploring it as a distinct mode of intellectual inquiry. The files provided here are a combination of PDFs scanned from original texts, with .tif versions of the relevant figures and illustrations. All originals are held by John B. Smith." .

Smith corresponding to the period of 1966-1970, provided by John B. Smith from his personal collection. In this period, Smith was a Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia at Chapel Hill. Over the course of this degree, Smith was introduced to programming via a course on PL/1 programming for humanists with an emphasis on natural language processing, and developed a passion for that stream of research. The documents included in this bundle emerged from that early interest, and reflect a combination of Smith's work as research assistant to Sally Sedelow and his dissertation, <em>Imagery and the Mind of Stephen Dedalus</em>. Starting the summer of 1968, Smith worked as a research assistant for Sally Sedelow on her Automated Language Analysis research project while taking computer science and psychometric courses, and learning about the statistical analysis and modeling tools that gave him the tools to develop the programs and strategies used in his dissertation. The files provided here are a combination of PDFs scanned from original texts, .tif and .jpg versions of the relevant figures and illustrations, and an .html index file for the dissertation.
