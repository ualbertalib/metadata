<http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/4b/29/b6/75/4b29b6759> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Library cards evoke a sense of membership in the “club of the library” that goes beyond access to collections and members-only services. Many libraries have policies that require proof of address or identification in order to qualify for a library card, restrictions that inhibit members of marginalized populations from obtaining library cards, and effectively prevent access to library services for these individuals. This is particularly impactful for the 200,000 Canadians who are unsheltered or emergency sheltered in any year. While North American library associations have issued persuasive official policy statements regarding poverty and homelessness, including the American Library Association’s Library Services to the Poor policy statement and the Canadian Library Association’s Position Statement on Diversity and Inclusion, their directives are not compulsory for individual libraries within their jurisdictions. In response to these identified barriers, some urban Canadian library systems have created reduced barrier library cards in order to extend the reach of their services to all segments of society. These cards typically have no residential address requirement, alongside other specialized modifications including reduced borrowing privileges and a limited application of late fines to balance increased access against increased risks for the library. A comparison of reduced barrier library card policies in four Canadian library systems – Vancouver, Fraser Valley, Edmonton and Toronto – permits for an understanding of the diverse approaches taken to address this issue. Managerial considerations for development and implementation of reduced barrier cards, such as financial and collection risks, use by other populations, staff training and buy-in are also considered within the context of public librarian professionals’ complex employment environments." .

A qualitative approach based on a non-random, purposive sampling method was used. Semi-structured interviews of five female participants using open-ended questions were carried out for this pilot study. This research not only surveyed the information needs and information sources used by parents, but also examined the criteria that parents used to evaluate them as well as barriers that parents faced in accessing relevant information. Though parents mostly needed information for medical/health purposes and for managing the symptoms and behaviours of their children, a number of peripheral information needs which included respite care, education, transportation and social services providing family support were also documented. Parents relied mostly on health professionals and the Internet for their information. Other information sources included not for profit organizations, government agencies, libraries, conferences and workshops, print materials and newly diagnosed parents’ meetings. However, findings point to increased reliance on a parent support system on social networking sites, such as Facebook, that allowed parents to connect and share useful information about caring for a child with ASD. Barriers that parents faced in accessing useful information included commodification of information, dispersal of information and information overload. While not-for-profit agencies were lauded for excellence in providing information, parents had mixed-feelings about government agencies. The study also indicated that parents need instruction in evaluating their sources of information on the Internet. Implications for information professionals are presented." .

<http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/z3/16/q1/95/z316q195g> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Romance fiction remains one of the most read but least respected literary genres. Traditionally, public libraries have shunned romance fiction, either refusing to stock romance novels or purposefully limiting their collection. Nevertheless, the unwavering demand for romance fiction and the shift towards user-oriented services and acquisitions has solidified the genre’s place on contemporary public library shelves. This overall acceptance does not mean that romance fiction is always accessible to patrons, however. Professional library and information science (LIS) literature suggests that romance readers are routinely marginalized in public libraries due to the limited accessibility of romance novels, with cataloguing and classification being identified as one of the areas contributing to this issue. Vassiliki Veros (2012) argues that romance novels are treated as disposable literature and catalogued to a minimal standard or not at all. This makes romance novels difficult to search for and find in a library’s catalogue and on the shelf. However, little LIS research has been conducted on the topic of romance fiction and what studies are available do not focus on accessibility and cataloguing. This mix-method case study investigates the accessibility or romance fiction in three Edmonton regional public libraries and in their individual online catalogues. Data was collected in the form of in-person observations performed by the researcher, as well as through the evaluation of bibliographic records of a representational sample of romance novels. The results suggest that while the selected libraries treat romance fiction similarly to other genres in terms of organization and shelving, barriers still remain in making romance fiction visible in the library, especially in regard to hard and softcover books. It was also determined that efforts are being made to increase the accessibility of romance fiction in the libraries’ catalogues through the application of diverse subject-headings. However, this practice was not consistent across all three libraries. Ultimately, more needs to be done to ensure that romance fiction is easily available to romance reading patrons in order to ensure a positive library experience." .

This envisions people with autism as a source of social capital instead of a social burden. The healing Indigenous people experience through community sharing can also help non-indigenous people with autism heal in their communities. The healing stories of people with autism provide a wealth of experience to the Library and Information Studies Field. The World Health Organization (WHO) values librarians’ inclusion of people with autism through developing informative autism web sites and sharing their valuable experiences through digital stories (Servili, & Saxena, 2013).  Librarians can challenge societies’ stereotypes of autism through promoting appropriate autism websites and critiquing inaccurate websites. This poster examines how five autism organization websites challenge the Western medical view of autism as a disease through alternative Indigenous methods of coping with autism. These refreshing stories of people with autism reveal how nourishing their strengths enables them to flourish creatively as authors of their own destiny." .
