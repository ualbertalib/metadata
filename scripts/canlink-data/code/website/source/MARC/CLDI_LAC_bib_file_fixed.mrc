This study presents an example of top-down inverse modeling that utilizes high precision measurement data collected at a Canadian greenhouse gas monitoring site. The measurements include multiple tracers encompassing standard greenhouse gas species, stable isotopes of CO2, and combustion-related species.

Despite its increasing adoption, little research exists to support the effectiveness of this growth management tool, and a key indicator of its success is on whether its suburban condo dwellers exhibits a consumption pattern and lifestyle that are more urban in character. This study offers a comparative analysis on the lifestyles and motivations of suburban condominium dwellers, their respective municipalities, and condominiums clusters located in the downtowns of Toronto and Vancouver. It finds that the suburban 'condo boom' is fueled by a transient population characterized by tenuous socio-demographic status, childless and small households, and is currently not in a position to replace lower density forms of housing.

Specifically, grounded theory was utilized to examine the central research question: "What is the decision-making process of guardians of adults under the care of the NSW Public Guardian, who are charged and proceed through the criminal justice system?" Another question based on the central research question was, "What decisions are required, how are these decisions made and implemented, and what are the outcomes of those decisions?" Eleven participants were interviewed using an open-ended interview format. The results are represented in 8 themes and 35 categories. It was hoped that the description of these processes could assist in future decisions being made on behalf of individuals under Guardianship by: specifying what information is considered and valued when making decisions; how the decisions are implemented; how the guardians felt about the decisions; and the outcome of those decisions.   aPublic Guardian.  aGuardianship.  aCriminal Justice System.  aMental Illness.  aDevelopmental Disability.  aIntellectual Disability.  aDecision Making.  aCrime.  aRecidivism.  aSupport workers.  aLegal.  aMental Health. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10791/18540uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/AEAU/TC-AEAU-185.pdf40uhttps://dt.athabascau.ca/jspui/bitstream/10791/185/1/PERRY_THESIS_FINAL.pdf1 aPerry, Alison.1 aPerry, A.

Some contemporary egalitarians - often referred to as "Luck Egalitarians" - believe it does. However, many seemingly chosen inequalities obtain between men and women as a group. A recent surge of empirical literature has sought to demonstrate the role that individual choice plays in producing and maintaining a subset of existing gender inequalities (e.g. the gender wage gap). This thesis considers the status of such inequalities in the context of the Luck Egalitarian project. More precisely, it considers whether the claim that choice excuses inequality is appropriate to the phenomenon of gendered choice. In Chapter 1, I argue that Luck Egalitarianism, as it currently stands, does not adequately deal with the topic of gendered choice. I maintain that this is due largely to the fact that it is not sufficiently attentive to the social forces shaping gendered choices (e.g. socialization, hostile social climates). In Chapter 2, I discuss whether attending more fully to factors that  aGraduate  aphilosophy.  apolitical philosophy.  agender.  aautonomy.  adistributive justice.  aluck egalitarianism.  achoice. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/BVIV/TC-BVIV-7054.pdf40uhttp://dspace.library.uvic.ca/bitstream/handle/1828/7054/Byrnes_Emma_MA_2016.pdf40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1828/705402457nam  22003973a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000250013824501680016326000650033150200640039650400410046051600200050152910270052165300260154865300200157465300280159465300190162265300150164165300200165665300240167665300170170065300160171765300220173365300250175565300210178065300090180165500460181085600820185685600830193885600380202100004430302920170411145047.0m        d        cr uz 160216s2016    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-342211 aHe, Juan Xia,d1970-10aAssessing and Improving Methods for the Effective Use of Landsat Imagery for Classification and Change Detection in Remote Canadian Regionsh[electronic resource].  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2016.  aThesis ()--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2016  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aCanadian remote areas are characterized by a minimal human footprint, restricted accessibility, ubiquitous lichen/snow cover (e.g. Arctic) or continuous forest with water bodies (e.g. Sub-Arctic). Effective mapping of earth surface cover and land cover changes using free medium-resolution Landsat images in remote environments is a challenge due to the presence of spectrally mixed pixels, restricted field sampling and ground truthing, and the often relatively homogenous cover in some areas. This thesis investigates how remote sensing methods can be applied to improve the capability of Landsat images for mapping earth surface features and land cover changes in Canadian remote areas. The investigation is conducted from the following four perspectives: 1) determining the continuity of Landsat-8 images for mapping surficial materials, 2) selecting classification algorithms that best address challenges involving mixed pixels, 3) applying advanced image fusion algorithms to improve Landsat spatial resolution while  aimage classification.  aNeural Network.  aSupport Vector Machine.  aRandom Forest.  alithology.  ageostatistical.  aregression kriging.  adata fusion.  aLand cover.  achange detection.  apost-classification.  athreshold-based.  aPCA. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOU/TC-OOU-34221.pdf40uhttp://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/34221/1/He_Juan_Xia_2016_thesis.pdf40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10393/3422102120nam  22003373a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000310013824501280016926000650029750200640036250400410042651600200046752908590048765300100134665300240135665300220138065300170140265300140141965300370143365500460147085600820151685600960159885600380169490000310173299000190176300004430304120160216      .0m        d        cr uz 160216s2016    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-342571 aBelzil-Lacasse, Christian.10aStudy of Dissipative Spots In Three-Component Reaction-Difussion Systems on Two-Dimensional Domainsh[electronic resource].  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2016.  aThesis ()--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2016  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aDissipative spots are found in physical experiments of many branches of natural science.

Using a dynamical system approach we proceed with a Fourier analysis on a linearized reaction-diffusion system in order to provide the bifurcation conditions for a given homogeneous state. We validate our results and establish it's limitations through numerical experiments. We report very interesting behavior during these simulations, notably hysteresis and multi-stability. We will then turn our attention to the relatively unexplored phenomenon of rotating spots.

We also analyzed a possible L1 transfer from French to L2 Spanish in the acquisition of SFP, due to the typological similarity of this linguistic feature in the two languages. Twenty seven B1/B2 Spanish level students including L1 English and L1 French learners of L2 Spanish were divided into three groups according to the instruction type: explicit focus on form instruction group, implicit focus on form instruction group and control group, which received no additional instruction.

Linear and logistic regression models utilizing a multivariable fractional polynomial selection process identified variables associated with health-related quality of life, measured by the EQ-5D. Results: Upstream and downstream associations between smoking cessation and higher health-related quality of life were evident. Significant upstream associations, such as education level and current working status and were explained by the addition of morbidities and symptoms to regression models.

Although they are all somewhat different, I argue that these four constructs are really addressing a common issue and share a number of central and core components, each of which focuses on explaining the powerful roles of history, identity, and cultural embeddedness that reinforce the tendency of long-standing organizations to resist change. I discuss the umbrella construct of organizational legacy to capture these shared components. I define organizational legacy as the narrowing of strategic choice and capacity to change that occurs as a consequence of an organization's own successful history.

Our study revealed a set of cognitive processes supported through free-form annotation that have not previously been discussed in this context. We derived design guidelines for digital tools which augment active reading and annotation.

The pressure tube heavy water reactor (PT-HWR) has for decades been considered capable of achieving net breeding on the thorium fuel cycle, but this capability has not been conclusively demonstrated. The goal of this work was to perform reactor physics modelling of the 380-channel, 700 MWe PT-HWR, attempting to achieve a self-sustaining equilibrium thorium cycle with specific focus on operational viability. The DRAGON neutron transport code was used to model ThO???/??????UO??? fuel lattice cells. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the fissile nuclide content, specific power, and average fuel temperature. Thorium-based fuels are found to have a strongly negative power coefficient of reactivity, leading to criticality concerns in the event of a prolonged shutdown. Several fuel bundle concepts were modelled in order to determine the most favourable assembly for breeding.

In the present research, I explored the SNA in an order judgment task. In three experiments, participants judged whether three digit sequences were ordered or unordered. People with more efficient calculation skill are faster and more accurate on order judgments than those with less efficient skills.

Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), it was predicted that there would be evidence of WM disruption in patients with psychosis compared to healthy controls, and more so in patients with earlier and heavier lifetime cannabis use. Methods: The primary outcome measure was fractional anisotropy (FA) which reflects WM integrity. There were two groups of subjects: 1) Patients with early phase psychosis and 2) Healthy controls with no cannabis use. Scans were acquired on a 1.5T MRI and imaging analysis was done both within a volume of interest (VOI - left superior longitudinal fasciculus) and at the full-brain level. Results: A trend level decrease in mean VOI FA was found in patients relative to healthy controls, but no difference was found at the full-brain level.

Using Bonnie Honig's account of agonism, this paper creates a contestation-centred approach that emphasizes disagreement between these branches to illustrate how, despite what the judicial dialogue literature insists, a final interpretation of the Charter is not possible. The remainder of this project demonstrates how the legislature's responses to these cases could have been more democratic by emphasizing the contestation taking place between it and the judiciary over the interpretation of the Charter. Specifically, it argues that the contestation in these instances could have been made more accessible by the legislature justifying its decision to resist the judiciary's interpretations of the Charter, o 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOCC/TC-OOCC-24757.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/44f07149-7f10-4e50-acac-c34806a745ea/etd_pdf/fd82689c4eed7fa68c83581254878ca5/lecoq-potentialstrugglebetweenthelegislativeand.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/44f07149-7f10-4e50-acac-c34806a745ea1 aLecoq, Garrett Gerald Leon Peter.10a90001ab10001a02187nam  22002653a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000210013924501590016026000420031950200510036150400410041251600200045352910270047365500460150085600840154685601820163085600670181290000230187999000190190200004437895320160323      .0m        d        cr uz 160323s2016    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOCC-248621 aZolderdo, Aaron.10aDoes Nutritional Status Mediate the Consequences of Elevated Cortisol on Wild Fish?

Male smallmouth bass provide parental care for developing offspring. During this stage males cease active foraging as they defend their brood. Experimental manipulation of cortisol levels (via injection) and food (via supplemental-feeding) in parental males was used to investigate the fitness consequences of parental care. Improving the nutritional condition of nest guarding males increased their reproductive success by reducing nest-abandonment. However, supplemental-feeding and cortisol had no effect on parental behaviours. Cortisol reduced plasma lymphocyte numbers, but increased neutrophil and monocyte concentrations. Supplemental-feeding improved the physiological condition of parental fish by reducing oxidative injury. Increasing the nutritional condition of parental fish can reduce the physiological cost of intensive pa 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOCC/TC-OOCC-24862.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/210e3962-34a6-4f5b-9445-88610843586c/etd_pdf/e9ff54ec5588c992d4ca6a7550d49a42/zolderdo-doesnutritionalstatusmediatetheconsequences.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/210e3962-34a6-4f5b-9445-88610843586c1 aZolderdo, Aaron J.10a90001ab10001a02198nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000260013924501240016526000440028950200670033350400410040051600200044152910270046165300190148865300310150765300300153865300260156865300210159465500460161585600380166185600840169985601130178300004437926520160323      .0m        d        cr uz 160323s2016    nsc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-NSHD-652201 aDickson, Ernest Paul.10aIterative Estimation and Demodulation for Improved Joint Random Access Satellite Communicationsh[electronic resource].  aHalifax :bDalhousie University,c2016.  aThesis (Master of Applied Science)--Dalhousie University, 2016  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThis thesis investigates high throughput random access communications in the satellite up-link environment. In this environment it is typical for a large number of un-coordinated, mobile transmitters scattered over a large geographic area to connect intermittently to a single receiver over the satellite channel. This configuration fundamentally results in a random access scenario, where a large number of potential users contend for access to limited channel resources. Complexity is increased due to the geographic spread and localized weather effects which make it possible for each user have its own independent channel that must be estimated to ensure a high level of system performance. To this point research efforts have been focused on the development of access protocols capable of approaching the single user capacity, and have succeeded in asymptotically approaching it, however previous efforts have shown that the application of joint detection and multiple packet reception (MPR) techniques make it is pos  aRandom Access.  aMulti-user Communications.  aSatellite Communications.  aIterative Estimation.  aJoint Detection. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10222/6522040uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/NSHD/TC-NSHD-65220.pdf40uhttp://DalSpace.library.dal.ca:8080/xmlui/bitstream/10222/65220/1/Dickson-Ernest-Paul-MASc-ECED-Dec-2015.pdf02146nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000320013824500850017026000650025550200640032050400410038451600200042552910270044565300180147265300180149065300220150865500460153085600820157685600970165885600380175590000320179399000190182500004445415720160401      .0m        d        cr uz 160330s2016    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-343061 aBoucher-Lalonde, Véronique.10aPredicting Broad-scale Patterns in Species Distributionsh[electronic resource].  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2016.  aThesis ()--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2016  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aSpecies richness of virtually all high-level taxonomic groups is strongly statistically related to climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation, and consistently so across space and time. These observations are consistent with a causal link between the number of species that occur in a given region and its climate. Although dozens of hypotheses have been proposed, the main mechanisms underlying this pattern remain largely unresolved. And, few ecological studies have attempted to identify regularities in the individual species distributions that make up the richness-climate relationship. Despite the complexities of species' biologies, I found that, to a first approximation, species' probability of occupancy at continental scales were generally well statistically explained by a Gaussian function of temperature and precipitation. This simple model appeared general among species, taxa and regions.

To increase performance for end users the 802.11n WiFi standard introduces several new features that increase Physical Layer Data Rates (PLDRs). However, the rates are less robust (i.e., more prone error). Optimizing throughput in an 802.11n network requires choosing the combination of features that results in the greatest balance between PLDRs and error rates, which is highly dependent on the environmental conditions. While the faster PLDRs are an important factor in the throughput gains afforded by 802.11n, it is only when they are used in combination with the new MAC layer features, namely Frame Aggregation (FA) and Block Acknowledgements (BAs), that 802.11n achieves significant gains when compared to the older 802.11g standard.

These include integral group rings, integral adjacency algebras of association schemes and integral C-algebras. Torsion units of group rings have been studied extensively since the 1960???s. Much of the attention has been devoted to the Zassenhaus conjecture for normalized torsion units of ZG, which says that they should be rationally conjugate (i.e. in QG) to elements of the groupG. In recent years several new restrictions on integral partial augmentations for torsion units of ZG have been introduced that have improved the e ectiveness of the Luthar-Passi method for checking the Zassenhaus conjecture for specific finite groups G. We have implemented a computer program that constructs units of QG that have integral partial augmentations that are relevant to the Zassenhaus conjecture. Indeed, any unit of ZG with these partial augmentations would be a counterexample to the conjecture.

The recommendations indicated the need to articulate the mandate for leadership development and its merit for stakeholders, to define holistic assessment in support of developmental decision making, and the creation of a programmatic structure to focus each opportun  ahttp://dspace.royalroads.ca/docs/bitstream/handle/10170/886/license.txt?sequence=2  aDevelopment.  aEffectiveness.  aLeadership. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10170/88640uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/BRC/TC-BRC-886.pdf40uhttp://dspace.royalroads.ca/docs/bitstream/handle/10170/886/brosinsky_chris.pdf02167nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000220013924501340016126000440029550200550033950400410039451600200043552910270045565300300148265300240151265300220153665300170155865300140157565500460158985600380163585600840167385601080175700004451490120170421085653.0m        d        cr uz 160426s2016    nsc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-NSHD-713061 aLowrey, Joshua B.10aNutrient Recycling of Spent Biomass and Lipid-Extraction Wastewater in the Production of Thraustochytridsh[electronic resource].  aHalifax :bDalhousie University,c2016.  a(Doctor of Philosophy)--Dalhousie University, 2016  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aOne of the most important challenges for the emerging sector of microalgae biotechnology is reducing the production costs by improving the efficacy of resource use, while minimizing environmental repercussions of the process. An avenue for accomplishing this goal is implementing a novel strategy of nutrient recycling, whereby the effluent wastewater produced is recycled internally for subsequent cultures. This concept is the foundation of this thesis where the prospect of nutrient recycling, and all of the corollaries associated with it, are explored in the context of the production process at Mara Renewables Corporation. Due to the vast majority of valuable nutrients residing in the lipid-extracted hydrolysate, that liquid waste material was the primary focus of the secondary fermentations conducted. Initial flask-scale secondary fermentations revealed that Thraustochytrium sp.

The recent decommissioning of the refinery has reduced it to an arcane landscape of weathered steel towers, pipes and storage tanks. This thesis defends the inherent value of the refinery as a device of imagination and memory of the past energy era, both historically through the infrastructure of industry and the residual landscape that it is defined by. Architectural interventions act to reveal the potential of existing site infrastructure and are introduced through a phased strategy, providing thresholds and view that engage with this powerful residual landscape. Through this engagement both the experiential and imaginative capacity of the landscape is revealed, creating a sense of place through time, connecting memory and the community to this once forbidden site.  aarchitecture.  aDartmouth.  alandscape.  aNova Scotia.  aHalifax.  apetrochemical sites.  arefinery.  apost-industrial.  amemory. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10222/7137540uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/NSHD/TC-NSHD-71375.pdf40uhttp://DalSpace.library.dal.ca:8080/xmlui/bitstream/10222/71375/1/Reynolds-Tyler-MArch-ARCH-March-2016.pdf02169nam  22003253a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000200013924500960015926000440025550200640029950400410036351600200040452910270042465300160145165300230146765300100149065300260150065300140152665300180154065300120155865500460157085600380161685600840165485601050173800004451493720160427      .0m        d        cr uz 160426s2016    nsc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-NSHD-714191 aSchmidt, Brent.10aTime, Space and Adaptationh[electronic resource] :bA Strategy Towards Growth From Within.  aHalifax :bDalhousie University,c2016.  aThesis (Master of Architecture)--Dalhousie University, 2016  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aTo adapt is to transform to become better suited to the conditions of an environment.

This narrative inquiry explored the question: What do the stories of participants reveal about how this program fits within the particular cultural and socio-economic situation of this First Nations reserve community? This thesis shares the stories of four research participants as they described their experience of the YES! program to the researcher: a student, the school counsellor, an Elder and addictions counsellor at the school, and the mother of one of the students. Nine threads that run throughout the stories are identified: spirituality, youth, school, breathing, helping, resilience, non-interference, stones, and moving forward.  aAboriginal.  aYouth.  aYES! for Schools.  aSudarshan Kriya Yoga.  aNarrative Research.  aFirst Nations.  aindigenous. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10791/20040uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/AEAU/TC-AEAU-200.pdf40uhttps://dt.athabascau.ca/jspui/bitstream/10791/200/3/REVISED Final Thesis.pdf1 aShaw, Meredith.10a90001ab10001a02360nam  22003253a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900150012110000280013624502280016426000470039250200720043950400410051151600200055252910270057254000870159965300200168665300170170665300150172365300230173865300180176165300130177965500460179285600360183885600800187485600800195400004453683720170421085725.0m        d        cr uz 160525s2016    bcc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-BRC-8901 aPittman, Samuel Robert.10aHydrologic regimes in a changing climateh[electronic resource] :bcharacteristics and responses of wetland and off-channel habitat along the Telkwa River and the implications for juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch)  aVictoria :bRoyal Roads University,c2016.  a(M.Sc. in Environment and Management)--Royal Roads University, 2016  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aGiven changing climatic conditions in British Columbia, Canada, there is a need to examine the hydrologic regime in freshwater systems and the potential implications of a changing regime to species in these systems. This study assessed parameters in the Telkwa River (TR) watershed which, if altered, could potentially have adverse effects on the TR's hydrologic regime and juvenile Pacific coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Current and historic parameters, including: local climate; glacier mass; discharge; water temperature; and the characteristics of adjacent wetland and off-channel habitats (WOHs) utilized by O. kisutch were examined. It was found that long-term changes to local climate are having an impact on the hydrologic regime by reducing glacier mass, and altering intra-annual and annual discharge. However, with respect to WOHs, a significant ecological change in response to the altered hydrologic regime was not noted, suggesting WOHs have been capable of buffering the changing hydrologic conditions   ahttp://dspace.royalroads.ca/docs/bitstream/handle/10170/890/license.txt?sequence=2  aClimate Change.  aCoho Salmon.  aDischarge.  aHydrologic Regime.  aTelkwa River.  aWetland. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10170/89040uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/BRC/TC-BRC-890.pdf40uhttp://dspace.royalroads.ca/docs/bitstream/handle/10170/890/pittman_sam.pdf02288nam  22004453a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000310013824501240016926000470029350200630034050400410040351600200044452907900046452900130125465300260126765300180129365300150131165300230132665300130134965300340136265300140139665300120141065300100142265300190143265300330145165300160148465300200150065300170152065300220153765300250155965500460158485600830163085600930171385600360180600004453686120170421085738.0m        d        cr uz 160525s2016    bcc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-BVIV-72021 aHenderson, Charlotte Anne.10aReconceptualizing bodies and pleasureh[electronic resource] :bconsiderations by and for sex-positive service workers.  aVictoria :bUniversity of Victoria,c2016.  aThesis (Master of Arts M.A.)--University of Victoria, 2016  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aHuman sexuality has been overrun with narratives that limit the possibilities of pleasure.

Drawing from poststructural feminist theory I propose three ways of reconceptualizing bodies and pleasure as emergent sites of change and potential.

This study set out to determine an appropriate e-referral to psychiatry. A field study was conducted. The criteria and supporting information requirements for an appropriate e-referral to psychiatry were determined. These results were used in turn to conduct a gap analysis on current e-referral standards. It was possible to conclude that current standards would not meet the needs for an e-referral to psychiatry. The results were also used as a case study to address gaps in the knowledge of e-referrals. There was a recurrent theme that the development of e-referrals must account for a number of contexts and as such e-referrals should be developed conceptually before technical deployment. Next steps in research were then discussed.  aGraduate  apsychiatry.  areferral.  ae-referral.  aelectronic. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/BVIV/TC-BVIV-7250.pdf40uhttp://dspace.library.uvic.ca/bitstream/handle/1828/7250/Prior_Scott_MSc_2016.pdf40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1828/725002119nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000210013924500900016026000590025050200990030950400410040851600200044952910270046965300100149665300110150665300180151765300170153565300100155265500460156285600360160885600860164485600870173000004453707720160525      .0m        d        cr uz 160525s2016    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOSHDU-6421 aGilbert, Jordan.10aSimulation of in-core dose rates for an offline CANDU reactorh[electronic resource].  aOshawa : Ontario Institute of TechnologybUOIT,c2016.  aThesis (Master of Applied Science (MASc))--University of Ontario Institute of Technology, 2016  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThis thesis describes the development of a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the dose rates that will be encountered by a novel robotic inspection system for the pressure tubes of an offline CANDU reactor. Simulations were performed using the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) radiation transport code, version 6.1. The radiation fields within the reactor, even when shut down, are very high, and can cause significant damage to certain structural components and the electronics of the inspection system. Given that the robotic system will rely heavily on electronics, it is important to know the dose rates that will be encountered, in order to estimate the component lifetimes. The MCNP simulation was developed and benchmarked against information obtained from Ontario Power Generation and the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories. The benchmarking showed a good match between the simulated values and the expected values.

By staging symbolic rituals of confrontation referred to as performative violence, I seek to highlight differential power dynamics that ground relations between Blacks and non-Blacks. Through the use of industrial materials--dark, grey, heavy, strong--the exhibition aims to re-examine our contemporary understanding of Blackness and challenge the relationship of Blackness as a colour and shade, and Blackness as a societal or cultural construction of a group of people.

Notwithstanding, FRP laminates are critically susceptible to delaminations, which are often initiated due to invisible interlaminar cracks. Delaminations in turn weaken the overall strength and stiffness of FRPs, thus degrading their longevity and in-service reliability. Delamination phenomenon, which is one of the most common failure modes in FRP structures, is considered as a matrix dominant failure, because it is governed by matrix's fracture toughness and the fiber/matrix interface bond strength. The recent emergence of carbon nano-particles (CNPs), such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), have, however, enabled the engineers and scientists to develop a new generation of multi-functional modifiers for FRP composites.

The intention of this work is to find economic opportunities generating new networks by initiating a local crop processing program as means of empowering small, local farming groups. This research is a systemic approach that explores the power that a site-specific activity survey may have on prototypical objects that make evident the attributes of crop, land owner type, and local economies. The assembly and disassembly of the new elevator's structure and machine at the micro- and macro-site not only mirror past local networks but also activate the memory of the rise and fall of the powerful wooden steeples that were once rooted in the infinite prairie horizon.  aindustrial infrastructure.  agrain elevators.  aprairie architecture.  aeconomic development.  aagricultural architecture.  acommunity development.  aiconic prairie architecture.  afarm buildings.  arural Manitoba.  aindustrial memory.  amapping in architecture.  aarchitectural networks.  acrop processing. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10222/5629640uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/NSHD/TC-NSHD-56296.pdf40uhttp://Dalspace.library.dal.ca//bitstream/10222/56296/1/Fillion-Janelle-MArch-ARCH-April-2015.pdf02433nam  22003733a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000200013924501580015926000440031750200700036150400410043151600200047252910270049265300280151965300310154765300290157865300200160765300210162765300250164865300270167365300330170065300240173365300200175765300210177765500460179885600380184485600840188285600930196600004356879720150422      .0m        d        cr uz 150422s2015    nsc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-NSHD-563311 aRussell, Amina.10aSHARED DECISION MAKINGh[electronic resource] :bMANAGING NON-CRITICAL CHRONIC ILLNESS BY COMBINING BEHAVIOURAL & DECISION THEORY WITH ONLINE TECHNOLOGY.  aHalifax :bDalhousie University,c2015.  aThesis (Master of Health Informatics)--Dalhousie University, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aShared decision making between patient and provider is considered the cornerstone of patient-centred care but transpires in only 10% of face-to-face encounters.

Mentoring graduate students is very challenging, even when both the student and faculty have similar cultural values. To the degree most international students have a different culture from that of Canadians, the challenge for international graduate students to adapt to their new environment, and for their faculty advisors to understand and work well with them is significantly increased. This research explored the relationships, experiences and challenges of international graduate students and their faculty advisors at the University of Guelph, through focus group discussions, semi-structured face-to- face interviews and online surveys. Language barriers and financial difficulties were among the major challenges international students face adapting to their academic and social environment and working with their faculty advisors.

These groups were affixed to a well-understood supramolecular platform in calix[4]arene and their binding affinities for various halides and oxyanions probed. It was found that although in its least energetically favourable conformation that is orthogonal to the aryl group to which it was bound, the tetrazole proved a superior anion-binding element. Noting that tetrazoles prefer co-planarity with aryl neighbours, a series of pyrrolyl-tetrazole anion binding compounds were prepared, first a simple bidentate pyrrolyl-tetrazole which when tested for anion binding affinity demonstrated some of the strongest binding with anions for a bidentate compound ever observed, especially chloride.

Here we present spectral emissivity index and temperature maps of dust in the star-forming clumps of the Perseus molecular cloud determined from fitting SEDs to the combined Herschel and JCMT observations in the 160 &#956;m, 250 &#956;m, 350 &#956;m, 500 &#956;m, and 850 &#956;m bands, employing the technique developed by Sadavoy et al. (2013). In NGC1333, the most complex and active star-forming clump in Perseus, we demonstrate that CO line contamination in the JCMT SCUBA-2 850 &#956;m band is typically insignificant. The derived spectral emissivity index, ß, and dust temperature, T, ranges between 0.8 - 3.0 and 7 - 50 K, respectively. Throughout Perseus, we see indications of heating from B stars and embedded protostars, and smooth ß variations on the smaller scales.

In this thesis, we develop distributed control strategies that provide stable and realistic force feedback to a varying number of users manipulating a SVO when connected across a computer network with imperfections (such as limited packet update rate, delay, jitter, and packet-loss). We fi rst propose the average position (AP) scheme to upper bound the effective stiff ness of the SVO coordination and thus, to enhance the stability of the distributed multi-user haptic cooperation.

People are not mechanical, they are not engines that contain in similar fashion, parts and pieces that can be replaced or even understood.

The expression of some F. graminearum genes was upregulated in presence of SA. However, the role of those induced genes in SA degradation was not investigated. This study aimed at characterizing six candidate genes predicted to encode enzymes with ability to catalyze one of the first two-enzymatic steps in SA degradation by F. graminearum. Those genes are FGSG_09063, FGSG03657, FGSG_09061, FGSG_03667, FGSG08358 and FGSG_08037. In order to investigate the function of those genes, genes were individually inactivated by gene replacement and the deletion mutant strains were tested for their ability to grow in solid and liquid medium supplemented with SA as the sole carbon source. Results indicated that FGSG_03667 is an essential gene in the SA degradation pathway.

Nous proposons que cette quête de la médiété tire profit de l'oscillation entre les "extrêmes" esthétiques, stylistiques et thématiques qui caractérisent l'¶uvre rabelaisienne. Le premier chapitre est l'occasion d'étudier la subversion, par l'auteur, de certaines normes rhétoriques comme celles de l'aptum et du decorum, subversion qui peut mener, par exemple, à des jeux sur les niveaux de style qui font en sorte que le niveau de langue utilisé ne convient plus à l'objet qu'il sert à décrire. Nous examinerons, par le fait même, les effets que ces jeux rhétoriques ont sur la quête de la vertu.

Companies are increasingly moving their business processes online using Business Process Management (BPM) tools and technologies. With BPM, online business processes are defined by an explicit business process model that flexibly combines and orchestrates forms delivered through a web browser to integrate tasks performed by people, and web services accessible through Internet protocols to integrate tasks performed by software. Often the approach to quality assurance for online business processes is similar to what would be done with any other web application. This is insufficient since it only provides rudimentary verification of single user behavior whereas the orchestration of tasks across many users and software systems can be quite complex.

Pre and post data were collected using quantitative surveys (SPSI, CARS), a qualitative survey (VOSI-E), interviews, and researcher's observations. Paired sample t-tests from the quantitative surveys revealed that the YSIDC positively impacted participants' science inquiry skills and attitudes towards science. Interviews supported these findings and provided contextual reasons for these impacts. Implications from this research would suggest that informal and formal educational institutions can increase science inquiry skills and promote positive views and attitudes towards science and scientific inquiry by using non-competitive cooperative learning strategies with a mixture of guided and open inquiry.

Few neuropathologic studies of human brain exist. Hypotheses: First, markers of oxidative stress persist following PNEE. Second, PNEE is associated with inhibitory and excitatory neuron changes. Methods: Human brain autopsies (153) with known PNEE were reviewed; 18 cases (fetus to adult) and controls were selected. Oxidative stress and neuronal differentiation markers were used for immunohistochemistry. Results: There were no obvious differences between control and PNEE brains using oxidative stress markers. In human PNEE brains, glutamatergic neurons were reduced 15.96 % and 18.03% in dentate gyrus and temporal cortex, respectively. GABAergic neurons reactive for parvalbumin were reduced in all hippocampal regions (CA1= 57.86%, CA3= 65.15%, and DG= 53.39%) and temporal cortex (44.13%) in all age groups.

This thesis aims to improve the current knowledge on in situ C-band microwave scattering from first-year sea ice (FYI) pressure ridges during winter, and how C-band backscatter can vary with changes to radar and target parameters. Remotely sensed data of ridged ice were collected at a sea ice mesocosm using a LiDAR laser scanner and a fully-polarimetric C-band scatterometer. Thesis results indicate that using an incidence angle between 30 and 50° and HV polarization will best enable distinguishing between smooth and ridged ice, while using an incidence angle of 40° and HV or HH polarization will best enable detecting variations in ridge height. Overall results indicate that a significant proportion of the variance in FYI snow-free ridge C-band backscatter can be explained by incidence angle, polarization, and ridge height, with almost 88% of the variability in backscatter attributed to ridge height.  aMicrowaves.  aLiDAR.  aRidges.  aSea Ice.  aC-Band.  aArctic. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1993/3057140uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/MWU/TC-MWU-30571.pdf40uhttp://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/jspui/bitstream/1993/30571/1/Shields_Megan.pdf02284nam  22003253a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900150012110000270013624501240016326000470028750200860033450400410042051600200046152910270048154000870150865300150159565300190161065300250162965300170165465300290167165300110170065500460171185600360175785600800179385600850187300004391775720150714      .0m        d        cr uz 150714s2015    bcc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-BRC-8201 aFeschuk, Jennifer Ann.10aTree wisdomh[electronic resource] :bexploring the impacts of learning experiences and biophilic connections to trees.  aVictoria :bRoyal Roads University,c2015.  a(M.A. in Environmental Education and Communication)--Royal Roads University, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThis thesis explores our relationship with trees.

The objective of this study was to develop a parental questionnaire to predict the child's caries risk without professional evaluation and assess if risk factors worked together and if behaviours changed over time. At baseline, a survey and examination for caries were administered to 100 subjects aged 1 to 3 years old in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Six months later the same survey and examination were administered. Statistical analysis included logistic regression, Pearson Chi-squared, McNemar's, Fisher's exact tests and paired T-tests. The main finding was this survey could not predict future caries risk. Parents' reports of visible cavities/fillings in their child predicted caries. Few risk factors changed significantly over time. A change in developmental delay corresponded to a change in caries. Overall, caries risk was found to be complex and requires further investigation.  aDental caries.  aEarly childhood caries.  aPrevention.  aCaries risk assessment. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1993/3061440uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/MWU/TC-MWU-30614.pdf40uhttp://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/jspui/bitstream/1993/30614/1/Huminicki_Amanda.pdf02159nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000280013824501380016626000470030450200420035150400410039351600200043452910270045465300190148165300330150065300250153365300190155865300260157765500460160385600370164985600820168685600890176800004391785320170421085815.0m        d        cr uz 150714s2015    mbc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-MWU-305951 aDebnath, Jayanta Kumar.10aAccelerating electromagnetic transient simulation of electrical power systems using graphics processing unitsh[electronic resource].  aWinnipeg :bUniversity of Manitoba,c2015.  a(Ph.D.)--University of Manitoba, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThis thesis presents the application of graphics processing unit (GPU) based parallel computing technique to speed up electromagnetic transients (EMT) simulation of large power systems. GPUs support extra computing capability to handle gaming and animation related applications in the desktop computers. GPUs can be used for general-purpose computations, such as EMT simulation. Traditionally, EMT simulation tools are implemented on the CPUs, where simulation is performed in a sequential manner. Hence, with the increase in network size, there is a drastic increase in simulation times. This research shows that the use of GPU computing considerably reduces the total simulation time. This thesis proposes parallelized algorithm for EMT simulations on the GPU, and demonstrates the algorithm by simulating large power systems. Total computation times for GPU computing, using 'compute unified device architecture' (CUDA)-based C programming are compared with the total computation times for the sequential implementation  aPower Systems.  aEelectromagnetic Simulation.  aparallel processing.  aGPU-Computing.  aTransient Simulation. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1993/3059540uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/MWU/TC-MWU-30595.pdf40uhttp://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/jspui/bitstream/1993/30595/1/Thesis_Jayanta_Final.pdf02123nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900160012110000240013724500930016126000430025450200620029750400410035951600200040052910270042065300180144765300200146565300370148565300220152265300120154465500460155685600370160285600810163985601010172000004391787720150714      .0m        d        cr uz 150714s2015    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OGU-85701 aMcSweeney, Matthew.10aProso Millet as an Ingredient in Foods Common to North Americansh[electronic resource].  aGuelph :bUniversity of Guelph,c2015.  aThesis (Doctor of Philosophy)--University of Guelph, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aMillet is a small grain that is drought resistant, gluten free and has been found to elicit a lower glycemic response than other grains. However, millet is considerably under-utilized in the Western world. The purpose of this study was: (i) to investigate proso millet based products that are common to North American consumers (biscuits, extruded snacks, couscous and porridge), and (ii) to examine the effect of decortication on the health benefits of these products, glycemic index and sensory properties. A human glycemic index study was conducted to ascertain that a variety of millet based products were in fact low GI foods, as other studies have suggested. Once products were manufactured, refined proso millet resulted in higher protein, lipid, dietary fibre and polyphenol content in comparison to refined corn products. The expected glycemic index of the proso millet based products (50.2- 64.7) was much lower than those of the corn based products (78.5-86.3) (p<0.05).

A comprehensive review of the solventbased heavy oil recovery processes is provided by conducting a literature search of over 100 most recent and significant technical publications. A number of experimental, theoretical and numerical studies of solvent-based methods are reviewed, from physical and theoretical modeling to numerical simulations. Some important factors or major phenomena as well as their effects on the solvent-based methods are analyzed. Experimental and theoretical studies of the VAPEX heavy oil recovery process were conducted. More specifically, a total of four VAPEX tests were conducted in a rectangular sand-packed physical model by using four different sizes of Ottawa sands. A theoretical model was formulated to predict the accumulative heavy oil production during the entire VAPEX process.

Since each of these groups is reductive, in the sense that every regular module is a direct sum of irreducible regular modules, it su ces to construct the irreducible ones. We achieve this by using Weyl's method, which provides an explicit and concrete realization of each of the desired modules. Chapters 1 to 3 contain background information. The reader may choose to skip them and consult them only when necessary. Chapters 1 and 3 describe the relationship between the classical groups and their Lie algebras, with emphasis on the representation theory aspects of such objects. Chapter 2 summarizes many important results on the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras. The actual work begins in Chapter 4, where we use Young diagrams and tableaux to construct all the irreducible complex representations of the symmetric groups. Surprisingly enough, these modules serve as building block 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10294/575040uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/SRU/TC-SRU-5750.pdf40uhttp://ourspace.uregina.ca/bitstream/handle/10294/5750/Chaktoura_Martin_200324423_MSC_MATH_Fall2014.pdf02351nam  22002773a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900160012110000300013724501440016726000880031150200680039950400410046751600200050852902070052852910270073565500460176285600370180885600810184585601070192690000210203399000190205400004391802120150714      .0m        d        cr uz 150714s2015    snc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-SRU-56671 aAl-Ageili, Munira Faysal.10aIntegrating Ontology-Based Information Extraction Systems and Spatial Modeling for Land Use Analysis and Simulationh[electronic resource].  aSaskatoon :bFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research, University of Regina,c2015.  aThesis (Doctor of Philosophy (PhD))--University of Regina, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aA Thesis Submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science, University of Regina. xv, 161 p.  aInformation Extraction (IE) is defined as the automatic identification and extraction of a predefined set of concepts, relevant to a specific domain of knowledge, ignoring irrelevant information. IE converts unstructured text into structured data and extracts the required information. IE is to some extent domain-specific. In IE, the information to be extracted must be specified a priori. In the context of IE, the ontology is used to structure and represent the domain knowledge. The IE system extracts information with respect to the domain ontology and then populates the ontology with the extracted information. This process is referred to as Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE). Many jurisdictions apply land use suitability analysis (LUSA) for land use planning. LUSA in this context is used to assess the appropriateness of a specific area of land for a particular kind of use.

Alterations in generate random numbers from PN junction which are synapse-like interfaces mediating electron movement were assessed when people intended upon altering these fluctuations while being exposed to weak magnetic fields that could affect intention. The results indicated that specific physiological patterns of transcerebral magnetic fields interacted with intention to alter random fluctuation. Paired exposure of two random number devices at non-traditional distances to these patterned magnetic fields with changing angular velocities demonstrated clear evidence of classic excess correlation or "entanglement".

Traditional placement algorithms such as routability-driven placement (improves routability) and wirelength- driven placement (reduces total wirelength) are no longer sufficient to close timing. To this end, timing-driven placement plays a crucial role in reducing the interconnect delay through timing critical paths (paths with timing violations/negative slacks) of the design and thereby achieving specific performance/clock frequency. In the placement flow, timing information about the design can be incorporated during global placement and/or incremental/detailed placement. Although, over the years, there has been significant advances in the quality of the global placement, there is a growing need for high performance incremental timing-driven placement due to the lack of accurate interconnect information during global placement.

The system is designed to allow game designers to focus on physical prototyping while the computer digitalizes real-world actions into a playable digital game. The current PlayTIME implementation uses Tangible User Interfaces to facilitate specific functionalities in Unity, a widely-used game engine. We hypothesized that using PlayTIME would improve the game design experience for users. To test our hypotheses, we ran a user study to evaluate the usability, creativity support and enjoyment of PlayTIME against the usability, creativity support and enjoyment of Unity alone.

The environment of air travel exposes a series of potential adverse events within a brief and concentrated period of time that evokes negative emotions. The airport provides a unique situation where psychology, anatomy and architecture meet and overlap with the potential to resolve most of the situations leading to anxiety and instead create a space designed to be therapeutic rather than induce stress.

In the decades after that, the two came together to bring about quantum computing. A sub field of quantum computing is quantum communications, the ability to transmit a quantum state from one place to another. This communication takes place between two entities. Communication over a classic network involves many entities each vying for network time. This is done through various network protocols, one of them being Medium Access Control (MAC). Although quantum computing is currently a one-to-one medium, it's properties can be used to assist the MAC protocol to enhance it's current abilities. In this thesis, we propose two different quantum communication assisted MAC protocols to achieve shared communication over a classic network. These protocols are based on quantum entanglement principles and contention-free collision avoidance algorithms. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOCC/TC-OOCC-19020.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/1496a18a-c422-4a58-951e-03a9ce5f916e/etd_pdf/2eec411f25333c7ddf83fe84c716cef8/cloutier-quantumcommunicationassistedmacprotocol.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/1496a18a-c422-4a58-951e-03a9ce5f916e1 aCloutier, Steve Renald.10a90001ab10001ae01918nam  22002653a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000320013924500880017126000420025950200570030150400410035851600200039952907900041965500460120985600840125585601950133985600670153490000320160199000190163300004392460920150724      .0m        d        cr uz 150724s2015    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOCC-184621 aBashardoust Tajali, Maryam.10aCo-Housing+h[electronic resource] :bTowards a Greater Urban Community in Toronto.  aOttawa :bCarleton University,c2015.  a(Master of Architecture )--Carleton University, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThis thesis grew from understanding the present common values of today's contemporary society, where people are less unified and prefer their secluded private realm showing diminished interest in integrating with the public sphere.

However, Macro-eNB causes strong interference to Pico Cell edge users due to its higher transmission power. Inter-Cell interference is the biggest challenge in LTE-A HetNets. Lot of research is performed for years to solve this critical problem in an efficient way and many contributions have been made. This thesis is an in-depth analysis of Inter-Cell Interference in LTE-Advanced HetNets and explores various solutions proposed in literature to reduce interference. It presents a pioneering tactic based on the blend of eICIC and smart antennas to further reduce the Macro interference. The simulations for downlink co-channel deployment of Macro-eNB and Pico-eNB, demonstrates overall network performance gain and improved QoS for the Pico Cell edge users' achieved using the proposed scheme. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOCC/TC-OOCC-18985.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/a1108496-2a4f-4888-94f5-db9b55af26c2/etd_pdf/c42bee124a6dda5e5b712263b52d5681/sadekar-lteaenhancedintercellinterferencecoordination.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/a1108496-2a4f-4888-94f5-db9b55af26c202110nam  22002653a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000200013924500810015926000420024050200600028250400410034251600200038352910120040365500460141585600840146185601850154585600670173090000280179799000190182500004392466920170421085927.0m        d        cr uz 150724s2015    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOCC-190141 aGerroir, Jesse.10aConstructing Visual Narratives of Museum Experiencesh[electronic resource].  aOttawa :bCarleton University,c2015.  a(Master of Applied Science )--Carleton University, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThe technological enrichment of museums serves as a prime area of research focused on the changing role of information and communication technologies and the visualization of personal data. While previous research projects have focused on using mobile and interactive technologies as electronic museum guides this project takes a different approach. It seeks to develop new methods to visualize the data collected from a user's trip through a museum enabling the user to construct a presentation that they can use to reflect, communicate, and share their experiences with others. To this end, four styles of visual narratives (each targeting a particular purpose) were designed, developed, and tested via a prototype. Our usability study was based upon a series of evaluation criteria such as effectiveness, operability, overall satisfaction, flexibility, and sociability. It demonstrates the users do in fact prefer the proposed narrative visualization and our visualization styles serve distinct purposes. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOCC/TC-OOCC-19014.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/ed682caf-f2b5-4fd9-805b-2774bbf106b9/etd_pdf/beea3b5dcf7f0d96ca88e5240682b0ad/gerroir-constructingvisualnarrativesofmuseumexperiences.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/ed682caf-f2b5-4fd9-805b-2774bbf106b91 aGerroir, Jesse Raymond.10a90001ab10001a02050nam  22002413a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000280013924501120016726000420027950200600032150400410038151600200042252909900044265500460143285600840147885601790156285600670174100004392468120150724      .0m        d        cr uz 150724s2015    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOCC-188941 aModares, Ahmad Ghadiri.10aSimulation of Next Generation Sequencing Short Reads for Mutation Spectrum Analysish[electronic resource].  aOttawa :bCarleton University,c2015.  a(Master of Applied Science )--Carleton University, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aNext generation sequencing (NGS) of mutant reporter transgenes is increasingly being used for mutation spectrum analysis (MSA) to characterize the genomic effects of mutagens. The ability to simulate NGS-MSA experimental data will permit the tuning of various parameters in the downstream analysis pipeline. However, no simulator currently exists that is capable of producing the read depths (up to 100,000x) required for MSA experiments. In this study, we introduce MutSim, a short read mutation simulator that enables researchers to generate NGS data for simulated samples exposed to a mutagen. MutSim generates data following the Ion Proton&#8482; instrument error model and also a mutational model of a given mutagen. MutSim is shown to be highly scalable both with respect to genome length and read depth coverage. MutSim simulated data is validated against real experimental data in several aspects including genotype content, quality scores, read depth coverage and read length. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOCC/TC-OOCC-18894.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/74dd5e78-9783-4bd5-9fad-a8193f0b315d/etd_pdf/ac025e09e47bc3153c25ae20d42f22aa/modares-simulationofnextgenerationsequencingshort.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/74dd5e78-9783-4bd5-9fad-a8193f0b315d02070nam  22002413a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000200013924501020015926000420026150200550030350400410035851600200039952910270041965500460144685600840149285601850157685600670176100004392474120150724      .0m        d        cr uz 150724s2015    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOCC-186051 aJodayree, Sara.10aAntioxidant Activity of Oat Bran Hydrolyzed Proteins in Vitro and in Vivoh[electronic resource].  aOttawa :bCarleton University,c2015.  a(Doctor of Philosophy )--Carleton University, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aIn this thesis research evaluated the potential of oat protein hydrolyzed (OPH) with trypsin (better in vitro antioxidant activity relative to alcalase hydrolysate) to reduce oxidative in vivo. Three different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 mg OPH/g diet) were added to the diet of CD-1 male mice. The animals were divided into five groups, normal diet (ND), high fat (HF), and HF containing 1, 10, and 100 mg OPH/g. The study lasted for 3 weeks after which, mice were scarified. Blood, liver, brain, muscle, lung, and heart tissues collected for analysis. Erythrocytes of mice on 100mg OPH/g had higher (p < 0.05) peroxyl radical scavenging activity compared to HF group.

The aim of this study was to explore the process of identity development within early emerging adulthood (18-24 years of age), during the transition to university using Eriksonian-measures.

Two print Muslim newspapers, The Muslim Link and Muslim Link, are used as a case study to explore how the journalism, goals and practices of the Muslim media differ from the mainstream media. A mixed method approach, comprising comparative content analysis, discourse and text analysis and interviews, is used in the study. The content of both Muslim newspapers is compared to the mainstream newspapers of their respective regions. Drawing from theoretical perspectives on alternative media, the findings show, in varying ways, that these Muslim newspapers are able to provide an alternative in terms of their coverage, representations and discourses. The newspapers are also able to foster social and political engagement in their communities and in many ways attempt to write the Muslim community's own narrative about itself. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOCC/TC-OOCC-18506.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/7ec02e28-a821-4baa-943a-dc0543d0d916/etd_pdf/0e1c082b721015146f71af7a7b79f75d/aqueel-takingbackthenewsastudyofmuslimmediainnorth.pdf40uhttps://curve.carleton.ca/7ec02e28-a821-4baa-943a-dc0543d0d91602095nam  22003253a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900150012110000220013624500910015826000470024950200680029650400410036451600200040552908730042554000870129865300160138565300230140165300200142465300240144465300350146865300200150365500460152385600360156985600800160585600840168500004400160120150827      .0m        d        cr uz 150827s2015    bcc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-BRC-8321 aFloritto, Arlene.10aTechnology for capacity developmenth[electronic resource] :bone union's perspective.  aVictoria :bRoyal Roads University,c2015.  a(M.A. in Learning and Technology)--Royal Roads University, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aUnions exist to advocate for fair wages, equality, safe work environments, and professional practice supports on behalf of workers.

A steady-state Kalman filter was used as an optimal state observer with localized velocity information as the measurement. Since the main model is a partial differential equation, the states evolve in infinite-dimensional spaces, and hence an approximation (finite representation) was required to design the observer. Three different approximation methods were compared - eigenfunctions and finite element methods using a linear and a high-order polynomial basis. The latter two methods are the more common choice of approximation schemes for systems with a complex geometry. It was found that the eigenfunctions perform much better as expected. The finite element methods require larger matrices to approximate the system with reasonable accuracy and hence calls for numerical methods to solve the Algebraic Riccati Equation efficiently.

A thorough comparison among the recovery techniques is needed to understand their effectiveness and applicability. This study improves on previous studies in two ways. First, we study the impact of leveraging more accurate symbol dependencies on the accuracy of architecture recovery techniques. In addition, we evaluate other factors of the input dependencies such as the level of granularity, the impact of virtual call resolution, global variable usage and whether using direct dependencies provides better results than using transitive dependencies.

This is mostly because traditional systems employed isolated customized components, while modern systems tend to be highly interconnected and rely on open components and protocols. A wave of recent attacks on real-time systems have forced both practitioners and researchers to consider security as an essential system requirement. To propose a first step towards integrating security mechanisms in real-time systems, we focus on the problem of information leakage through shared physical resources such as cache memory. Regular security mechanisms tend to be computationally intensive, and using them as a separate protection component in hard RTSs can affect the schedulability of the system. Hence, in this work we propose two mechanisms to prevent information leakage, analyze their impact on task schedulability and study how to optimize the system configuration to minimize overhead.

The first stage of commissioning is to design and implement the safety controls system for the Steiner tunnel, fulfilling all the requirements of the safety regulations and provide additional safety calculations needed for approval of the system. Following this, the overall tunnel operation is tested with the tunnel installed at its full 25 foot length.

Accordingly, three research projects were conducted to inform lineup construction practices. The first project is a meta-analysis of lineup similarity effects. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that biased lineups yield the highest rate of suspect identifications, regardless of whether that person is guilty or innocent. When lineups with moderately similar members are compared with lineups containing highly similar members, increasing similarity reduces innocent suspect identifications and has only a small and nonsignificant effect on correct identifications. Two experimental studies were then conducted using morphing software to systematically manipulate the degree of similarity between lineup members who are known be innocent (fillers) and the lineup member who is under investigation (the suspect).

Rapid advances in robotics technology recently have resulted in increasing applications of vast variety types of robot manipulators. In spite of the fact that various aspects of trajectory planning for robot arms have been investigated, the problem of quickly planning a collision avoiding path for hyper-redundant manipulators in cluttered environments, has not been intensely addressed. This research has developed a comprehensive computationally tractable collision free path planner for robot manipulators with specified number of degrees of freedom (DOF) without using inverse kinematics (IK), which is computationally expensive.

MPS is used for solving fluid dynamics problems, in which the fluid is substituted by a set of particles that move with flow and carry on the fluid properties. This method has been shown to be suitable for modeling different cases of fluid flow with large deformations including free surface flows. In this study, a refinement algorithm based on the particle splitting is defined. A quadrilateral pattern is used for splitting candidate particles and generating ???daughter particles???. The error of the refinement is defined as the difference between the calculated value of the particle number density based on the kernel function and the initial particle number.

In artificial photosynthetic devices, light harvesting molecules drive reactions which create fuel (e.g by splitting water). For optimal fuel generation efficiency a long charge transfer excited state lifetime is necessary. Additionally, an absorption peak in the visible region is required for the molecule to absorb sunlight. To investigate the absorption peak and properties associated with the excited state lifetime of light harvesting molecules, a workflow has been developed using a combination of first principles techniques and analysis code. In the development of the workflow, this study focused on a vanadium(V) oxo compound VOLF which has been experimentally synthesized by collaborators. To fully understand the properties of this light absorbing molecule, it was studied using a variety of theoretical techniques and compared to experimental results obtained by collaborators.  aArtificial photosynthesis.  aElectronic structure. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10155/55540uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOSHDU/TC-OOSHDU-555.pdf40uhttp://ir.library.dc-uoit.ca/bitstream/10155/555/1/bitstream/../Clendenning_Graham.pdf02130nam  22002893a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000160013924501600015526000470031550200500036250400410041251600200045352910270047365300220150065300150152265300270153765300280156465500460159285600850163885600800172385600370180300004401872520150923      .0m        d        cr uz 150923s2015    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OSTCB-70551 aCode, Mary.10aInstagram, Social Media, and the "Like"h[electronic resource] :bExploring Virtual Identity's Role in 21st Century Students' New Socialization Experience.  aSt. Catharines :bBrock University,c2015.  a(Master of Education)--Brock University, 2015  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aPersonal technologies and social media use have changed the socialization experience of our 21st century learners.

Prior research on trait boredom has demonstrated that it is often related to variables indicative of poor self-regulatory control. Likewise, prior research has shown a relationship between state boredom and conditions in which individuals are prevented from self-regulating effectively. The goal of this research was to directly test the relationship between boredom proneness and various aspects of self-regulation, as well as exploring how conditions that prevent effective self-regulation influence the experience of boredom. Study 1 explored the relationship between self-regulation and boredom proneness using a variety of measures of self-regulation.

By use of a common language of prairie diplomacy, Métis had situated themselves as a close "relation" of the Hudson's Bay Company, but still politically independent of it. Nineteenth century Métis had repeatedly demonstrated their independence from British institutions of justice and politics, and were equally insistent that Canadian institutions had no authority over them. When they did choose to form a diplomatic relationship with Canada, it was decidedly on Métis terms.

Research suggests that North America's non-profit sector faces a looming leadership crisis as its executive leaders are subjected to escalating anxiety, burnout, and feelings of isolation (Cornelius, Moyers, & Bell, 2011). Peer support networks, alternately known as a CoP, have been proposed as a potential means of sustaining such beleaguered executives. This research reveals that Canadian EE leaders found value in a CoP as a forum for networking and relationship building, as a medium for professional development, and as a source of support and inspiration. This thesis recommends the establishment of a national CoP for Canada's EE network leaders and outlines recommendations to inform the creation of such a community.  ahttp://dspace.royalroads.ca/docs/bitstream/handle/10170/678/license.txt?sequence=2  aAction Research.  aCommunications.  aCommunity of Practice.  aEnvironmental Education.  aNetworking.  aSocial Capital. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10170/67840uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/BRC/TC-BRC-678.pdf40uhttp://dspace.royalroads.ca/docs/bitstream/handle/10170/678/baker_eli.pdf02185nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900160012110000200013724502130015726000430037050200590041350400410047251600200051352910270053365300120156065300110157265300110158365300130159465300150160765500460162285600370166885600810170585600970178600004224522120140120      .0m        d        cr uz 140120s2014    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OGU-77461 aLogan, Kirstyn.10aCORRELATING THE STRUCTURE AND VISCOSITIES OF DIFFERENT PECTIN FIBERS TO IN VIVO HUMAN SATIETY AND IN VITRO GASTRIC DIGESTION VISCOSITIES USING A NOVEL IN VITRO GASTRIC DIGESTION METHODh[electronic resource].  aGuelph :bUniversity of Guelph,c2014.  aThesis (Master of Science)--University of Guelph, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThe effects of a simulated in vitro digestion model on the viscosity of solutions comprised of high methoxyl, low methoxyl, and low methoxyl amidated pectins were examined in conjunction with a human satiety study with healthy men (n=10) and women (n=15).

This occurs due to the reduction of corticosterone (CORT) and behavioural deficits are associated with the loss of these neurons. Dentate lesions and cell loss associated with ADX have been shown to effect behaviour in a number of spatial tasks. In contras, it has been shown granule cell loss does not affect the specificity of place cells in CA3 and CA1. We used the ADX model to examine the role of DG granule cells plays in representing space using immediate early gene (IEG) activation in the principal hippocampal subfields after exploration of novel environments. Rats were allowed to free explore multiple novel environments and then the mRNA for the IEG Homer 1a (H1a) was used as a marker of neural activity.

There is a history of submarine slide events at the delta crest which pose substantial risk to coastal infrastructure near the delta front. A submarine channel, characterized by prominent levee deposits, extends seaward from the Sand Heads area. In this study, sand beds in cores from levee overspill deposits are dated using excess 210Pb activity. They are interpreted as the downstream deposits of channelized turbidity currents generated by liquefied slide material. Sedimentation is characterized by sandy mud, interpreted to be deposited continuously by river plume suspension fall-out, and two distinct kinds of sand beds which represent two genetically different processes.

Aluminum alloys are attractive due to their excellent mechanical properties and high strength to weight ratios. Powder metallurgy (PM), which converts metal powder into a high performance product, presents an alternative to traditional forming techniques, which are often unable to provide adequate dimensional tolerances. The challenge is to determine if aluminum PM alloys and technologies can be successfully employed within aerospace applications. This research focuses on the PM processing technologies (die compaction, cold isostatic pressing (CIP), and spark plasma sintering (SPS)) of two alloys, PM2024 and PM7075. Processing parameters were assessed using attributes such as density, hardness, and tensile properties. Both powders showed comparable densities and tensile properties to their wrought equivalents.

A promising approach through which this could be achieved is 'sustainable intensification'. This thesis contributes to the exploration of sustainable intensification using two complementary modes of investigation. First through the development of a conceptual framework that analyzes agricultural systems through the lens of ecosystem services and the trade-offs associated with using external inputs (e.g. fertilizer, pesticides, fossil fuels) as substitutes for them. Then by quantifying the life cycle environmental impacts of a novel aquaculture technology developed as a means for minimizing local ecological impacts.

In this thesis, a comprehensive method for EEC selection is developed by which the data are found to be Kramers-Kronig compliant, a library of possible circuits is selected, and then residual errors, parameter values, and standard deviations based on replicate measurements are used to find the circuit which best models the electrochemical system.

Investigations deal with the horizon-based experience, exposure, extreme temperatures, and the relationships between brought and found elements. The architectural implications of these characteristics are tested within the context of an overarching narrative of the socioeconomic and architectural forces at work behind contemporary projects in the region: A generic town and fictitious inhabitants are created to help the designs respond to common realities and challenges facing the prairie today.

Aerial insectivores are declining across North America; therefore, to determine the cause of these declines, we must have a holistic view of their annual cycle. I use geolocators to map the annual movements of tree swallows breeding in Nova Scotia, Canada, determine if reproduction has carry-over effects on migration, and examine the effects of geolocators. Geolocators revealed that tree swallows began migration in July and had an extended stopover in the northeastern United States. They wintered in Florida or Cuba, returning from spring migration in late April. This study revealed that later breeding swallows began migration later than earlier breeding swallows, but all birds arrived on the wintering grounds around the same time, due to differences in stopover length. No short-term effects of geolocators were found, although the sample size was small, and thus these results must be interpreted cautiously.  ageolocators.  acarry-over effects.  amigration.  atree swallows.  atag effects. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10222/4909440uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/NSHD/TC-NSHD-49094.pdf40uhttp://Dalspace.library.dal.ca//bitstream/10222/49094/3/Burke-Lauren-MSc-BIOL-March-2014.pdf02140nam  22003373a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000180013924501530015726000440031050200590035450400410041351600200045452909180047465300360139265300100142865300100143865300290144865300130147765300170149065300170150765300150152465500460153985600380158585600840162385600950170700004260169320140416      .0m        d        cr uz 140416s2014    nsc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-NSHD-490821 aAbel, Hannah.10aMeasurement of Health-Related Quality of Life in Canadians with Neurological Conditionsh[electronic resource] :bA Comparison of the SF6D and HUI3.  aHalifax :bDalhousie University,c2014.  aThesis (Master of Science)--Dalhousie University, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThe objective of this study was to contribute evidence regarding the use of the SF6D and HUI3 in persons with neurological conditions.

Even though the SF6D and HUI3 were sensitive to a variety of HRQoL domains relevant to persons with neurological conditions, they showed only marginal agreement (ICC of 0.41) with a mean utility difference of 0.15 (95% CI 0.13, 0.17). Discordance varied systematically with HRQoL status and was consistent regardless of the participant or impairment characteristics present. Despite sharing a common purpose, the substantial and clinically important differences found between the SF6D and HUI3 cast doubt on whether the utility estimates produced by these instruments are directly comparable or universally valid.  aHealth-related quality of life.  aSF6D.  aHUI3.  aNeurological conditions.  autility.  adiscordance.  ameasurement.  aNeruo-QoL. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10222/4908240uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/NSHD/TC-NSHD-49082.pdf40uhttp://Dalspace.library.dal.ca//bitstream/10222/49082/5/Abel-Hannah-MSc-CHE-March-2014.pdf01778nam  22002533a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000230013924500950016226000440025750200560030150400410035751600200039852907790041865300590119765500460125685600380130285600840134085601000142400004260174120140416      .0m        d        cr uz 140416s2014    nsc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-NSHD-490701 aShooshtari, Milad.10aELASTICITY OF DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS IN WESTERN AND CENTRAL CANADAh[electronic resource].  aHalifax :bDalhousie University,c2014.  aThesis (Master of Arts)--Dalhousie University, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aIn this paper, we used the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and the bounds test approach to estimate the elasticity of demand for natural gas in Western and Central Canada. The best model specification selected by Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC) for each province suggests that there exist long-run relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables for all provinces, except Ontario. Consumption per capita in these provinces can be explained by natural gas prices, electricity prices, income, and heating degree days (a measurement for the weather factor) in levels for the selected specification.

The extended shear tab (EST) is one increasingly popular option when it is necessary to bring the bolt line outside of shop applied coatings or encasement. The effect of greater eccentricity resulting from extending the bolt line needs to be accounted for in design. The current Canadian steel design standard CSA S16-09 does not contain guidelines for design of EST connections. The AISC Manual 2011 provides a design procedure for EST connections based on the bolt effective eccentricity. The effective eccentricity values based on this method have been shown to be overly conservative in some cases, which ultimately leads to underestimation of the connection capacity This research presents results of a numerical study on the behaviour amd strength of EST connections using finite element modelling.

It complicates the prima facie distinction between the requirement and recommendation-based programs by applying the common law requirement of the voluntariness of consent to the vaccination programs. In particular, the voluntariness light is shone on the nature of the "requirement" and "recommendation" to vaccinate distinction; exemptions from the requirement to vaccinate; the choice to refuse vaccination; and financial incentives to doctors and parents. The thesis concludes that on a spectrum of "most voluntary" to "least voluntary," the aforementioned programs would be located close to each other in terms of actual, practical presence of voluntariness, demonstrating the complexity of the dichotomy between the requirement and recommendation-based vaccination programs.  aconsent.  avoluntariness.  achildhood vaccination.  avaccination programs. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10222/5040140uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/NSHD/TC-NSHD-50401.pdf40uhttp://Dalspace.library.dal.ca//bitstream/10222/50401/3/Hnatyshyn-Maryana-LLM-LAWS-April-2014.pdf02394nam  22003373a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900160012110000270013724501380016426000510030250200530035350400410040651600200044752900270046752910270049465300290152165300500155065300350160065300560163565300510169165300480174265300290179065500460181985600370186585600810190285600730198300004277632920140618      .0m        d        cr uz 140618s2014    abc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-ALU-34251 aAfroz, Farzana,d1983-10aVulnerabilities and strengths in parent-adolescent relationships in Bangladeshi immigrant families in Albertah[electronic resource].  aLethbridge :bUniversity of Lethbridge,c2014.  aThesis (Masters)--University of Lethbridge, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aix, 133 leaves ; 29 cm  aThis study investigated the challenges and parent-adolescent relationship factors that contribute to resilience and the successful adjustment of Bangladeshi families following immigration to Canada. The systems framework of family resilience (Walsh, 2006) was used to interpret how Bangladeshi immigrant adolescents and parents experienced and navigated immigration challenges. Using a qualitative approach, four adolescent girls and four parents of adolescents were interviewed to inquire into their experience of challenges related to adolescent development, the immigrant experiences, and parentadolescent relationships influencing their post-immigration adjustment.

Sulfur tetrafluoride reacts with oxo-anions in acetonitrile or anhydrous HF (aHF) via fluoride-oxide exchange reactions to quantitatively form oxide fluoride salts, as observed by Raman and 19F NMR spectroscopy. Pure Ag[ReO2F4] as well as the new CH3CN coordination compounds [Ag(CH3CN)2][ReO2F4] and [Ag(CH3CN)4][ReO2F4]·CH3CN were prepared. The latter was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The reaction of [N(CH3)4]IO3 with SF4 in acetonitrile gave the new [N(CH3)4][IOF4] salt. Sulfur tetrafluoride forms Lewis acid-base adducts with pyridine and its derivatives, i.e., 2,6-dimethylpyridine, 4-methylpyridine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, which have recently been identified in our lab. In the presence of HF, the nitrogen base in the SF4 base reaction systems is protonated, which can formally be viewed as solvolysis of the SF4·base adducts by HF.

Whether this loss proceeds gene by gene or through deletion of multi-gene DNA segments is controversial, as is the question of fractionation bias, namely whether one homeologous chromosome is more vulnerable to gene deletion than the other. As a null hypothesis, we first assume deletion events, on one homeolog only, excise a geometrically distributed number of genes with unknown mean mu, and these events combine to produce deleted runs of length l, distributed approximately as a negative binomial with unknown parameter r; itself a random variable with distribution pi(.). A biologically more realistic model requires deletion events on both homeologs distributed as a truncated geometric. We simulate the distribution of run lengths l in both models, as well as the underlying pi(r), as a function of mu, and show how sampling l allows us to estimate mu.

Given the predicted nursing shortage due to an aging nursing workforce and a short supply of nursing graduates, this trend will probably continue as international recruitment to meet nursing demands in Canada continues. Current Canadian research that examines IENs' experience as they integrate into their workplaces is scarce. With an increasingly diverse Canadian and patient population due to rising immigration trends, a workforce that addresses the needs of the diverse patient population is valuable. Therefore an in-depth understanding of IENs' experience, their contribution to nursing practice, and their distinct role in promoting health care access to Canada's diverse population is necessary. A qualitative study using descriptive phenomenology was used to explore the integration experiences of eleven IENs within the Ontario, Canada health care system.

In vivo electrophysiological recordings were carried in male Sprague Dawley rats 30 minutes following ketamine administration (10 mg/kg) to first assess its effects on monoaminergic firing. Whilst no change in the firing activity of serotonin (5-HT) neurons was observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), an increase in the firing activity was observed for dopamine (DA) and noradrenergic (NE) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC), respectively. The effect of ketamine on these electrophysiological parameters was prevented by pre-administration of the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX 10 minutes prior to ketamine administration.

The fundamental objective is to support such requirements by providing solutions that are adaptive to varying conditions in highly mobile and heterogeneous, as well as dynamically changing wireless network infrastructures. This can only be achieved through well-designed management systems. Most techniques fail to utilize the knowledge gained from previously tested reconfiguration strategies on system and network behaviour. This dissertation presents a novel framework that automates the cooperation among a number of wireless SPs facing the challenge of meeting strict service demands for a large number of mobile users.

In this thesis, Norman Fairclough's Critical Discourse Analysis is adopted to examine them as social practices, specifically focusing on the human right to food. This is done through a discursive analysis of a corpus of documents drawn from FIAN International, a human rights organization advocating for the human right to food, and La Via Campesina, an international peasant organization which also aims to realize the right to food but is not itself a human rights organization. Findings highlight how each of the organizations define the right to food, and show that these differences are tied to the structure of the organizations themselves. This suggests that human rights organizations such as FIAN are more constrained by their need to balance legitimacy and programmatic visions than are other types of organizations in the struggle for meaningful social change.  aHuman Right to Food.  aHuman Rights.  aCritical Discourse Analysis.  aFIAN.  aLa Via Campesina. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10393/3095640uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOU/TC-OOU-30956.pdf40uhttp://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/en/bitstream/10393/30956/3/Sommerville_Kathryn_2014_Thesis.pdf02251nam  22003373a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000210013824501060015926000650026550200660033050400410039651600200043752910270045765300260148465300140151065300430152465300130156765300170158065300240159765300240162165300130164565500460165885600380170485600820174285600890182400004277701320140618      .0m        d        cr uz 140618s2014    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-304541 aAhluwalia, Kyle.10aProjecting Presenceh[electronic resource] :bCreating an "Effet de Présence" for Virtual Characters.  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2014.  aThesis (MA)--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aGiven the expansion of multimedia technology and proliferation of moving projections on the theatre stage in the 21st century, this thesis examines how a virtual or projected character can appear to be present without a physical body on the stage. This study is grounded in the theories of effet de présence (effect of presence) as elaborated by Josette Féral, but also uses other theories to look at how productions can create such an effect for virtual characters. Specifically, this thesis examines the character's relationship with the real, framing devices and actions of the characters. The specific examples of Rwanda 94 (Groupov), La Belle et la Bête (4D Art) and Les Aveugles (UBU CC) are used as case studies in order to focus on these techniques.

However, recent molecular evidence for three of the genera has suggested that the subtribe may be polyphyletic. To test this, five DNA regions were sequenced and analyzed using phylogenetic methods. Results confirm that Alopecurinae s.l. as presently treated is polyphyletic and should be dissolved. Additionally, the genus Cornucopiae may be just another Alopecurus. Limnas and Pseudophleum are not closely allied to Alopecurus or each other, and are even further from Phleum. Phleum is a distinct lineage that is not closely allied to any other included Alopecurinae genus. Evidence for revising infrageneric classifications of Alopecurus and Phleum is presented, as is evidence for separating A. magellanicus into two or more subspecies.  aPoaceae.  aAlopecurinae.  aPoinae.  aPoeae.  aPhleinae.  aPooideae.  aPhylogenetics.  aPhylogeny.  aPolyphyly.  aMolecular.  aBotany.  aTaxonomy.  aSystematics.  aAlopecurus.  aPhleum.  aBeckmannia.  aLimnas.  aCornucopiae.  aRhizocephalus.  aPseudophleum.  aPlant.  aGrass.  aDNA sequencing.  atrnT-trnL-trnF.  arpoB-trnC.  amatK.  aITS.  aETS.  aConvergent Evolution.  aHybridization.  aMorphology.  aEvolution.  aGenetics.  aFlora.  aSubtribe. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10393/3069640uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOU/TC-OOU-30696.pdf40uhttp://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/en/bitstream/10393/30696/3/Boudko_Ekaterina_2014_thesis.pdf1 aBoudko, Ekaterina Katya.10a90001ab10001a01979nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000250013824501140016326000650027750200660034250400410040851600200044952908420046965300240131165300240133565300120135965300280137165300210139965500460142085600380146685600820150485600910158600004277704920140618      .0m        d        cr uz 140618s2014    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-306531 aSoltermann, Tanya C.10aEmergence of a Cancer Identity in Emerging Adulthoodh[electronic resource] :bWeblogs as Illness Narratives.  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2014.  aThesis (MA)--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThe focus of this research is on the specific relational and particular circumstances that result in an emerging cancer identity expressed through the daily lived- experiences of emerging adults via personal weblogs. Identity, a complex term in its own right, is discussed here under the rubric of social identity as processual, therefore it is expected that an emerging cancer identity will develop as the participants begin to narrativize their daily experiences with cancer on their weblogs. By critically engaging with notions of emerging adulthood theories with theories on the sociology of death and dying and illness narratives, this research seeks to understand the specific psychosocial changes that occur as the participants engage with their illness on their weblogs, which arguably contributes to an emerging cancer identity.  aEmerging Adulthood.  aIllness Narratives.  aCancer.  aWeblogs as Data Source.  aSocial Identity. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10393/3065340uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOU/TC-OOU-30653.pdf40uhttp://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/en/bitstream/10393/30653/1/Soltermann_Tanya_2014_thesis.pdf02260nam  22002893a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000250013824501900016326000650035350200690041850400460048751600200053352910270055365300130158065300350159365300240162865300400165265500660169285600380175885600820179685600920187800004277706120140618      .0m        d        cr uz 140618s2014    onc     smab  000 0 fre    aCaOONLbfrecCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-306721 aHilaire, Ralph Dama.10aSynthèse de sept programmes d'intervention éducative visant l'acquisition d'habiletés sociales chez les personnes ayant un trouble du spectre autistique (TSA)h[ressource électronique].  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2014.  aThèse (MA[Ed])--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2014  aComprend des références bibliographiques.  aapplication/pdf  aTroubles de communication, troubles de comportement, troubles d'interactions sociales: voilà les premiers signes d'alerte du syndrome autistique.

Indépendamment des facteurs de risque génétiques et environnementaux, on reconnaît que les difficultés sociales qui minent le quotidien de ceux ayant reçu un diagnostic de TSA sont associées à des déficits dans la cognition sociale. À cet égard, plusieurs modèles fonctionnels ont été proposés pour expliquer ces insuffisances. Alors que la prévalence du syndrome autistique est en constante augmentation à l'échelle mondiale, une kyrielle de programmes d'intervention ont été élaborés, testés puis réappliqués au fil des ans pour redresser les déficits sociaux, comportementaux et communicationnels des personnes autistes ou du moins en atténuer l  aAutisme.  atrouble du spectre autistique.  ahabiletés sociales.  aprogramme d'intervention éducative. 7aMémoire de maîtrise ou thèse de doctorat électronique.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10393/3067240uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOU/TC-OOU-30672.pdf40uhttp://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/en/bitstream/10393/30672/1/Hilaire_Ralph_Dama_2014_These.pdf02034nam  22003493a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000260013824501200016426000650028450200660034950400410041551600200045652908050047665300110128165300210129265300100131365300110132365300290133465300200136365300110138365300150139465300150140965500460142485600380147085600820150885600940159000004277707320140618      .0m        d        cr uz 140618s2014    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-306921 aTsantsoulas, Tiffany.10aPlato Exits the Pharmacyh[electronic resource] :bAn Answer to the Derridean Critique of the Phaedrus and Timaeus.  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2014.  aThesis (MA)--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aBy framing his deconstruction of Plato's Phaedrus and Timaeus as a response to Platonism, Jacques Derrida overlooks the possibility of a Platonic philosophy beyond dogma and doctrine. This thesis argues that Derrida's deconstructions target a particularly Platonist abstraction of the dialogues, and thus, his critique relies on the underlying assumption that Plato defends the metaphysics of presence. Derrida attempts to show how the thesis that Being is presence undermines itself in both dialogues through hints of différance like pharmakon and khôra. To answer the Derridean critique, I analyze the hermeneutics of Derrida's deconstruction of Plato and identify what in the dialogues lies beyond the limits Derrida's reading, for example Derrida's notable exclusion of &#7956;&#961;&#969;&#962;.  aPlato.  aJacques Derrida.  aEros.  aBeing.  aMetaphysics of presence.  aDeconstruction.  aKhora.  aPharmakon.  aPlatonism. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10393/3069240uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOU/TC-OOU-30692.pdf40uhttp://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/en/bitstream/10393/30692/1/Tsantsoulas_Tiffany_2014_Thesis.pdf02159nam  22002893a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000360013824501060017426000650028050200650034550400460041051600200045652910080047665300270148465300190151165500660153085600380159685600820163485600960171690000360181299000210184800004277708520170421101801.0m        d        cr uz 140618s2014    onc     smab  000 0 fre    aCaOONLbfrecCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-307141 aLévêque, Élise Fournier,d1985-10aTraduire la métafiction dans Dressing Up for the Carnival de Carol Shieldsh[ressource électronique].  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2014.  aThèse (MA)--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2014  aComprend des références bibliographiques.  aapplication/pdf  aLe projet de cette maîtrise en traduction littéraire comporte deux grands volets.

Le deuxième volet, celui-ci théorique, est une analyse de cette traduction - de quatre nouvelles en particulier - portant sur l'aspect métafictionnel et autoréférentiel de l'écriture de Shields. Cette analyse s'intéresse particulièrement aux manières dont la figure de l'auteur est présentée et déconstruite. Elle montre en quoi cet aspect important de l'¶uvre de Shields peut avoir une incidence sur la traduction ou la réception de la traduction, puisque l'auteure se prononce sur l'acte d'interprétation. L'analyse souligne également les défis qui découlent de la traduction d'une auteure comme Shields, qui tend à privilégier la langue et non l'intrigue comme point de départ de l'écriture, notamment par l'imposition de contraintes stylistiques sévères.  atraduction littéraire.  aCarol Shields. 7aMémoire de maîtrise ou thèse de doctorat électronique.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10393/3071440uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOU/TC-OOU-30714.pdf40uhttp://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/en/bitstream/10393/30714/1/Fournier-Leveque_Elise_2014_these.pdf1 aFournier Lévêque, Élise,d1985-11a90001adb10001ad02169nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000180013824501560015626000650031250200670037750400410044451600200048552910270050565300190153265300170155165300110156865300210157965300150160065500460161585600380166185600820169985600860178100004277719320140618      .0m        d        cr uz 140618s2014    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-309071 aMyles, Sonya.14aThe Relationship Between Maternal Intravenous Fluids and Breast Changes in the Postpartum Periodh[electronic resource] :bA Pilot Observational Study.  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2014.  aThesis (MSc)--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aClinical Issue Health Canada recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months post birth and then the addition of complementary foods with breastfeeding extending to a minimum of two years. Breastfeeding initiation rates in Canada are currently at around 87% but, by one month, about 21% of women have stopped breastfeeding. Engorgement and edema in breast tissue can lead to breastfeeding challenges which may contribute to early weaning. Purpose The purpose of this pilot research study was to explore the relationship between intravenous (IV) fluids given to mothers during the peripartum period and postpartum breast or nipple swelling in the first ten days postpartum and determine if a larger study was warranted and feasible.

Individuals with a High AD/LBM (315 cm2/kg) had a ~1.7-fold greater overall rectal cooling rate relative to those with Low AD/LBM (275 cm2/kg) during both CWI and TWI. Further, overall rectal cooling rates during CWI were ~2.7-fold greater than during TWI for both the High and Low AD/LBM groups. Study findings show that AD/LBM must be considered when determining the duration of the immersion period.

This project draws on bilingual corpora of government and media texts to examine how Canada was framed in the discourses and narratives in circulation in its two official languages at the time of the 2010 G8 and G20 Summits, using concepts and techniques from Critical Discourse Analysis, narrative theory, and corpus linguistics. Examining some aspects of language in use such as collocation, semantic relations, and metaphor, several of the ways in which Canada was framed in the two contexts and languages were compared. The project concludes that discourses and narratives may differ between sources and languages, thereby highlighting the importance of recognizing the impact of translation on the variety of national representations within discourses and narratives.  aTranslation Studies.  aCritical Discourse Analysis. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10393/3098140uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOU/TC-OOU-30981.pdf40uhttp://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/en/bitstream/10393/30981/1/Harms_Charissa_2014_thesis.pdf02250nam  22003373a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000210013824501220015926000650028150200650034650400460041151600200045752910080047765300160148565300230150165300180152465300190154265300180156165300200157965300240159965300150162365500660163885600380170485600820174285600880182400004277733720140618      .0m        d        cr uz 140618s2014    onc     smab  000 0 fre    aCaOONLbfrecCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-306781 aTapp, Fanny-Ève.12aL'industrie canadienne de la télévision à l'ère du numériqueh[ressource électronique] :bl'invasion du multi-écrans.  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2014.  aThèse (MA)--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2014  aComprend des références bibliographiques.  aapplication/pdf  aCette étude a pour but d'investiguer l'état de la télédiffusion canadienne dans le contexte du multi-écrans.

The black virus is a faulty node that destroys any visiting agent without leaving a trace; moreover, once the black virus is triggered by an agent, it clones itself and spreads to neighbouring nodes. These viruses can only be destroyed if they move to nodes that have been occupied by agents. In this thesis, we consider the black virus disinfection problem in chordal rings. Initially, the system contains a single black virus that resides at an unknown location. We propose a solution that involves deploying a team of mobile agents to locate the original black virus and to prevent further damage once it has been triggered. Our protocol is divided into two phases: 1) searching the graph until the black virus is found and triggered and 2) sending agents to occupy the neighbouring nodes of the black virus in order to trigger and destroy all the black viruses at once. Our solutions are monotone, meaning that once a node has been explored it   ablack virus.  achordal rings.  aBV.  amobile agents. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10393/3117040uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOU/TC-OOU-31170.pdf40uhttp://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/en/bitstream/10393/31170/1/Alotaibi_Modhawi_2014_thesis.pdf02411nam  22003613a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000340013824501160017226000650028850200670035350400410042051600200046152910270048165300270150865300330153565300280156865300370159665300220163365300220165565500460167785600380172385600820176185600970184390000360194090000310197699000210200799000210202800004277743320160308104856.0m        d        cr uz 140618s2014    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOU-237141 aCousineau, Mélanie L.,d1978-10aTracing Biogeochemical Processes Using Sulfur Stable Isotopesh[electronic resource] :bTwo Novel Applications.  aOttawa :bUniversité d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa,c2014.  aThesis (PhD)--Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aAbstract Dissimilatory microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) The specific objectives of the study were to provide the first measurements of sulfur isotope fractionation associated with acidophilic sulfate reducing-microorganisms, and to examine whether pH influences sulfur fractionation during MSR. The fractionation associated with the strains investigated was comparable to that of neutrophilic strains with similar metabolisms (4-12&#8240;), but varied with pH. Two fractionation regimes were identified: one regime is consistent with fractionation during exponential growth, while the other - not identified previously - is not linked to active sulfate reduction and may result from internal sulfate accumulation. This would represent the first measurement of sulfur fractionation during sulfate uptake, the first step of MSR.

Planar lipid membranes deposited on solid substrates (solid supported membranes) provide models to study the functions of membrane proteins and are used as biosensing platforms. However, despite remarkable progress, solid supported membranes are not stable to harsh conditions such as dehydration, high temperature and pressure, and mechanical stress. In addition, the direct deposition of membranes onto a solid substrate often causes restricted mobility and denaturation of reconstituted membrane proteins. Membrane stability can be addressed by altering the structure of the component lipids. Bolalipids are an interesting class of bipolar lipids that have been proposed for biosensing applications.

Furthermore, gene reassortment as well as the direct transmission of highly pathogenic avian viruses to humans can result in an occasional emergence of novel influenza strains with devastating pandemic potential. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate alternative approaches to better control these viruses and to develop new prophylactic and treatment options. Targeting highly conserved epitopes or antigens among the different subtypes of influenza A virus could offer protection against broad range of influenza viruses, including emerging strains.

In the blood plasma of PD patients, our laboratory found elevated levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-[gamma]), a proinflammatory cytokine and potent activator of microglia. Given this, we sought to untangle the immune responses relevant to PD in mice, examining IFN-[gamma]'s involvement and signaling mechanism using an inflammatory co-culture model of microglia and midbrain neurons treated with rotenone.

An initial literature search identified different methods that were applied to a cohort of colorectal patients operated on by general surgeons using an electronic hospital database. Surgeon specific complications were validated with a chart review. General surgeons at The Ottawa Hospital were surveyed on their opinions regarding monitoring outcomes. We can conclude that different methods may be needed as they are dependent heavily on specified target limits. With our derived cohort, we had adequate risk adjustment using a modified Escobar model for 30 day mortality and morbidity. These complications were derived from electronic algorithms and had excellent specificity and sensitivity.

Classically, GPCRs (including D2R and D3R) are desensitized by the activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase C (PKC) upon phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) treatment. Previous studies demonstrate that while human D5R (hD5R) is also strongly desensitized upon PMA treatment, the human D1R (hD1R) undergo a robust PMA-induced sensitization. The aim of this PhD thesis was to explore how the canonical PKC- or phorbol ester-linked pathway can control the responsiveness of two similar GPCRs like hD1R and hD5R in an opposite fashion. Our data indicate that hD1R sensitization and hD5R desensitization are not mediated by a direct modulation of AC activity by PKC.

One such set of tools, open-source frameworks, allows application developers to reuse software artifacts and should increase application quality. However, given the vast number of open-source frameworks available, users must be able to differentiate among frameworks and select the one best suited for them. In this study, we expand the taxonomy of open-source frameworks and analyze the impact of the framework's characteristics, technical quality, and social pressure on perceived usefulness and continued framework usage intention. Our findings suggest that understandability and flexibility have a significant impact on perceived ease of use, while perceived usefulness is mainly determined by flexibility and efficiency. Our research can be used to understand what influences developers to continue using frameworks and to improve framework development.  aSoftware frameworks -- Research.  aComputer software -- Reusability.  aOpen source software.  aApplication software -- Development.  aDissertations, Academic. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10133/345540uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/ALU/TC-ALU-3455.pdf40uhttp://www.uleth.ca/dspace/bitstream/10133/3455/1/lemnaru, alexandru.pdf02250nam  22003253a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900150012110000190013624501390015526000470029450200720034150400410041351600200045452910270047454000870150165300090158865300150159765300220161265300140163465300170164865300160166565500460168185600360172785600800176385600810184300004287190920140711      .0m        d        cr uz 140711s2014    bcc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-BRC-7181 aDilley, Laura.10aRestoration of Burns Bogh[electronic resource] :bcumulative moisture deficit as an indicator of vegetation recovery and peat growth.  aVictoria :bRoyal Roads University,c2014.  a(M.Sc. in Environment and Management)--Royal Roads University, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aBurns Bog covers approximately 3,000 hectares between the Fraser River and Boundary Bay in Delta, BC.

This study investigated measures of hydrology, including water table residence times and cumulative moisture deficits, to quantify intuitive relationships between moisture stress and ecological zones. Regression analysis of quantitative field observations reveal statistically significant relationships between cumulative moisture deficits and several key bog plant species and Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) diameter at breast height, signifying that these relationships can be used to predict the potential for vegetation recovery.

Professional ice-hockey players must overcome numerous stressors throughout their careers in the National Hockey League (NHL). Though sport researchers have conducted preliminary studies about the stress and adaptation processes of NHL players, small participant numbers and the use of a structured interview guide limited to rookie and veteran career stages limit the conclusions. Based on these limitations, the purpose of the present dissertation was to provide a comprehensive depiction of the stress episodes and processes that lead to adaptation and maladaptation in the NHL.

Lesbian mothers are subjected to sexual stigma that other sexual minority individuals face, but in addition they experience stigma attached to the idealization of the nuclear family. As a consequence of this dual prejudice, moderators should be examined specifically for lesbian mothers to identify shared and possible unique factors for parenting stress.

Numerous attempts have been made to derive this rule from the perspective of observers within the quantum wavefunction. These are not really analytic proofs, but are rather attempts to derive the Born rule as a synthetic a priori necessity, given the nature of human observers (a fact not fully appreciated even by all of those who have attempted such proofs). I show why existing attempts are unsuccessful or only partly successful, and postulate that Solomonoff's algorithmic approach to the interpretation of probability theory could clarify the problems with these approaches. The Sleeping Beauty probability puzzle is used as a springboard from which to deduce an objectivist, yet synthetic a priori framework for quantum probabilities, that properly frames the role of self-location and self-selection (anthropic) p  aQuantum physics.  aPhilosophy of science.  aMetaphysics. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10315/2764040uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OTY/TC-OTY-27640.pdf40uhttp://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/xmlui/bitstream/10315/27640/2/Randall_Allan_F_2014_PhD.pdf02088nam  22002773a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000300013824500820016826000390025050200630028950400410035251600200039352910270041365300110144065300130145165300810146465500460154585600380159185600820162985600990171100004293896520140815      .0m        d        cr uz 140815s2014    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OTY-276321 aDonovan, Michael Francis.10aConsidering Schubert and Natureh[electronic resource] :bA Romantic Ecology.  aToronto :bYork University,c2014.  aThesis (PhD - Doctor of Philosophy)--York University, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aFranz Schubert's preoccupation with the nature-centric poetry of his day yielded a large body of musical landscapes and depictions of the human experience of nature. And while his songs are often associated with the "Volkstümlichkeit" of the 18th century, an aesthetic in which nature occupied a secondary role, this study underlines how Schubert would develop an idiosyncratic musical vocabulary conveying the inherently ecological nature of the texts, casting nature as a central subject in his poetic settings. The discourse of deep-ecology has reassessed the shallowness or quaintness traditionally ascribed to the Romantic view of nature, looking to the holistic view of nature in Romanticism as a template for the formulation of a contemporary deep-ecological worldview. Using experiential models of deep-ecology, namely phenomenology, embodied meaning and indigenous animism, this study revisits the archetypal Romantic wanderer's experience of nature in Schubert's poetic settings as an encounter between the indiv  aMusic.  aEcology.  aSchubert, Ecology, Deep Ecology, Musicology, Romanticism, Music, Musicology. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10315/2763240uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OTY/TC-OTY-27632.pdf40uhttp://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/xmlui/bitstream/10315/27632/2/Donovan_Michael_F_2014_PhD.pdf02170nam  22002773a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900170012110000230013824501270016126000390028850200620032750400410038951600200043052908100045065300110126065300210127165303360129265500460162885600380167485600820171285600980179400004293897720140815      .0m        d        cr uz 140815s2014    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OTY-276711 aLevin, Ruth Naomi.10aEnhancing the Performer's Experience of Absorption through the Choreographic Process and Structureh[electronic resource].  aToronto :bYork University,c2014.  aThesis (MFA - Master of Fine Arts)--York University, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThrough the creation of three dance works over the course of the second year of my MFA research, I explored the question of how the process and structure of a choreography could enhance the experience of absorption (bliss, focus) for the performer.

To perform this essential task, EF-Tu binds aa-tRNA in an active GTP-bound state, and GTP hydrolysis is critical for deposition of aa-tRNA into the ribosome. Following each aa-tRNA delivery, nucleotide exchange is required for reactivation of EF-Tu·GDP to EF-Tu·GTP. EF-Tu undergoes a variety of conformational changes during each round of aa-tRNA delivery and reactivation. Here, molecular dynamics simulations in silico and kinetic measurements in vitro demonstrate that structural dynamics of EF-Tu on the sub-nanosecond timescale are correlated with EF-Tu functions on the timescale of seconds. Specifically, structural dynamics of the conserved P-loop and switch II regions are important for nucleotide binding in EF-Tu. Additionally, interactions between domain II of EF-Tu and the small ribosomal subunit, which stimulate GTP hydrolysis on EF-Tu, have the potential to regulate structural dynamics of switch   aGenetic translation -- Research.  aAminoacyl-tRNA -- Research.  aG proteins -- Research.  aDissertations, Academic. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10133/346540uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/ALU/TC-ALU-3465.pdf40uhttp://www.uleth.ca/dspace/bitstream/10133/3465/1/mercier, evan.pdf02203nam  22003253a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900150012110000250013624500950016126000470025650200550030350400410035851600200039952910270041954000870144665300190153365300190155265300150157165300160158665300170160265300090161965500460162885600360167485600800171085600870179000004304109720140924      .0m        d        cr uz 140924s2014    bcc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-BRC-7441 aBoronowski, Michael.10aCollaboration in recruitment and enrollment student communicationsh[electronic resource].  aVictoria :bRoyal Roads University,c2014.  a(M.A. in Leadership)--Royal Roads University, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThis is an action research inquiry focused on how the Student Services division at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) can strengthen collaborative capabilities to enhance recruitment and enrollment student communications.

The effects of this warming on the Canadian Beaufort Shelf have led to a longer ice-free season which has assisted the expansion of northern development, mainly in the oil and gas sector. Both these direct and indirect effects of climate change will likely impact the marine ecosystem of this region, in which benthic fauna play a key ecological role. The aim of this thesis was to expand the current baseline knowledge of benthic fauna in the interest of developing the capacity to identify, predict and manage benthic change. The distribution of benthic macro- and megafauna was characterized utilizing community data from two recent benthic surveys on the Canadian Beaufort shelf and slope.

Further, a rational K_3-decomposition of G is a non-negative rational weighting of the copies of K_3 in G such that the total weight on any edge of G equals one. In this thesis, we explore the problem of rational triangle decompositions of dense graphs. We start by considering necessary conditions for a rational triangle decomposition, which can be represented by facets of a convex cone generated by a certain incidence matrix. We identify several infinite families of these facets that represent meaningful obstructions to rational triangle decomposability of a graph. Further, we classify all facets on up to 9 vertices and check all 8-vertex graphs of degree at least four for rational triangle decomposability.

However, this corrective process is vulnerable to failure because human cognitive capacity is of a limited pool of resources. Three experiments test whether there is a corrective process for people who hold beliefs in luck, and if so, whether cognitive constraints inhibit this process. Results suggest inhibited executive function impedes the usual correction of beliefs in luck, which facilitates future expectations of success. As such, factors within our environment that tax cognitive resources may enable people to act on beliefs in luck. This finding holds important theoretical and practical implications for gambling because these factors could range from the mindset created by financial distress or the ambient casino environment.  aLuck.  aAttribution theory.  aGambling. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10214/835440uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OGU/TC-OGU-8354.pdf40uhttp://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca:8080/xmlui/bitstream/10214/8354/1/McManus_Justin_201408_MSc.pdf02121nam  22003133a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900160012110000210013724500850015826000430024350200590028650400410034551600200038652910270040665300140143365300110144765300230145865300190148165500460150085600370154685600810158385600980166490000260176299000190178800004304220120140924      .0m        d        cr uz 140924s2014    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OGU-83521 aRémillard, Liam.10aExploring the Grief Experience Among Bereaved Pet Ownersh[electronic resource].  aGuelph :bUniversity of Guelph,c2014.  aThesis (Master of Science)--University of Guelph, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aThis thesis is an exploration of the grief that pet owners experience resulting from the death of pet with attention towards complicated grief. The first study involved a content analysis of 75 call notes recorded by volunteers of the Ontario Veterinary College Guelph Pet Loss Support Hotline following contact with bereaved pet owners from 2011 to 2012. Themes included; personal narrative, the grief experience, perceived social support; positive and negative emotions, callers' relationship with their pet, memorialization, coping methods, difficulty with euthanasia, and interaction with veterinary staff. The second study, a retrospective cross-sectional survey of 681 Canadian pet owners identified factors associated with complicated grief.

TEPC designs typically consist of a low density gas sensitive volume surrounded by a solid wall, each of which is composed of tissue-equivalent material. The response of a TEPC in a radiation field is characterized by two quantities: the sensitivity, defined as the ratio of the counts recorded to the measured dose equivalent, and the dose equivalent energy response, defined as the ratio of the measured dose equivalent to the ambient dose equivalent for the radiation field of a given energy. TEPC technology has great potential for use in low energy neutron fields, such as those in nuclear power plants, however, what hinders its use as a portable area monitor in such fields is its large physical size. For any given neutron field, an optimized TEPC design is one that can provide the same or better sensitivity and dose equiv  aArea monitoring.  aDosimeter.  aMicrodosimetry.  aNeutron dosimetry.  aTissue equivalent proportional counter. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10155/41740uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OOSHDU/TC-OOSHDU-417.pdf40uhttp://ir.library.dc-uoit.ca/bitstream/10155/417/1/bitstream/../Ali_Fawaz.pdf02231nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000180013924501310015726000590028850200990034750400410044651600200048752910270050765300330153465300190156765300320158665300250161865300340164365500460167785600360172385600860175985600840184500004310263320141009      .0m        d        cr uz 141009s2014    onc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-OOSHDU-4261 aGupta, Sahil.10aDeveloping 1-D heat transfer correlations for supercritical water and carbon dioxide in vertical tubesh[electronic resource].  aOshawa : Ontario Institute of TechnologybUOIT,c2014.  aThesis (Master of Applied Science (MASc))--University of Ontario Institute of Technology, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aTaking into account the expected increase in global energy demands and increasing climate change issues, there is a pressing need to develop new environmentally sustainable energy systems. Nuclear energy will play a major role in being part of the energy mix since it offers a relatively clean, safe and reliable source of electrical energy. However, opportunities for building new generation nuclear systems will depend on their economic and safety attractiveness as well as their flexibility in design to adapt in different countries and situations. Keeping these objectives in mind, a framework for international cooperation was set forth in a charter of Generation IV International Forum (GIF) (GIF Charter, 2002) and six design concepts were selected for further development.

A survey assessing the perception of fit with the organization and job, promotion, salary, job satisfaction, and career satisfaction was gathered from 149 employees in Nigeria. Fit hypotheses were tested by means of hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The analysis indicated that demands-abilities fit related positively with promotion and salary, but DAPO fit and DAPJ fit did not have a significant relationship.

Unlike other birds, male Ruffed Grouse do not vocalize during courtship, and are dependent upon 'drumming', a 'wingbeat' display, for the acoustic component of their courtship behaviour. Because this wingbeat display is unique, I investigated morphological correlates that could underlie its production. First, I examined wing shape among grouse from museum specimens using various morphometrics. I found that wing morphology corresponds with habitat, behaviour and phylogentic relationships within Tetraoninae. Next, I examined the brains of male and female Ruffed Grouse. I detected seasonal plasticity between males collected during the breeding and non-breeding seasons; those collected during the breeding season had larger motor regions than those collected during the non-breeding season.

In applying grounded theory methodology and narrative analysis to 12 semi-structured interviews I conducted with SMUS students and alumni who had partaken of the experiential program, I discovered learning and transformation of consciousness themes in their comments. From these findings, I have created a transformative learning process theoretical model that outlines the phases of transformational change or a personal shift experienced by the students and alumni during and following their international service trips.

By conducting an ethnographic content analysis of relevant information within the inaugural October 2003 issue of Glamour, the following themes were identified: (a) a culture of consumerism (overarching theme); (b) the oblivious, unknowledgeable, dependent woman at risk (sub-theme); and (c) attaining a particular version of a healthy, feminine woman.

However, recent trends not only in reconsidering the effectiveness and needs of early modern English warfare, but also in debating the extent of the Greco-Roman influence over early modern culture in general, warrant a re-examination of early modern English warfare altogether. Given the large number of works available at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries on warfare in England, and the fact that most controversy concerning the "military revolution" relates to this period, this work focuses on military literature compiled at the end of the sixteenth century. Through examining nine different authors of different backgrounds, military experiences, educations, and opinions, it sets out to provide  7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10294/528740uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/SRU/TC-SRU-5287.pdf40uhttp://ourspace.uregina.ca/bitstream/handle/10294/5287/Clow_Steven_200256859_MAHIST_201330.pdf1 aClow, Steven Ross.10a90001ab10001a02289nam  22002773a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900160012110000240013724501130016126000880027450200610036250400410042351600200046452901810048452910270066565500460169285600370173885600810177585601030185690000320195999000200199100004312882920141027      .0m        d        cr uz 141027s2014    snc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-SRU-52911 aReiser, Sarah Jane.10aChildhood Abuse and Health Anxietyh[electronic resource] :bThe Roles of Attachment and Emotion Regulation.  aSaskatoon :bFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research, University of Regina,c2014.  aThesis (Master of Arts (MA))--University of Regina, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aA Thesis Submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts, University of Regina. ix, 135 l.  aHealth anxiety refers to excessive preoccupation or worry about one's health. A number of childhood experiences have been linked to the development of health anxiety in adulthood; however, the influence of childhood abuse on health anxiety is unclear. Previous literature has revealed mixed findings (e.g., Noyes et al., 2002; Salmon & Calderbank, 1996). The purpose of the current study was to examine levels of health anxiety in adults who have a history of childhood abuse (i.e., physical, sexual, emotional, and neglect) and to investigate the roles of emotion regulation and attachment in this relationship. It was hypothesized that there would be significant, positive relationships between health anxiety, childhood abuse, and the associated constructs, that childhood abuse experiences and the associated constructs would be predictive of health anxiety, and that emotion regulation and attachment would mediate the relationship between childhood abuse and health anxiety.

There are recognized gaps, not only in care between best practice and actual care delivery as it relates to osteoporosis screening access, but also from knowledge to practice as men and women at risk of osteoporosis and fragility fractures are not engaging in adequate preventive health behaviours. A series of three studies were conducted and emphasized primary and secondary prevention of osteoporosis in effort to reduce the care gap. The purpose of Study 1 was to conduct a systematic review to identify common validated clinical risk factor assessment tools in predicting low BMD in postmenopausal women and identify which tool demonstrated the best discriminative performance.

X, 170 p.  aToday, the need to use some kind of Intelligent Systems (IS) techniques from the Soft Computing / Computational Intelligence fields is rapidly growing. This is because intelligent processes have the capability to deal with problems relating user-experience-knowledge and also they can consider data being uncertain or vague. This research focuses on applying IS techniques to solve the Resource Constrained Scheduling Problem (RSCP) and some related problems. Traditional methods to solve the RSCP have proven to be useful; however, they are somewhat limited, time consuming, and not always effective. Among the traditional heuristic methods that have been used for years, the Serial method, the Parallel method, the Branch and Bound algorithm, and the Utility Index calculation, have played an important role in solving the RSCP. These methods focus on the scheduling of activities in a project and aim to do it in an effective way considering several factors such as, priority, availability of resources, and time frames 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10294/539540uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/SRU/TC-SRU-5395.pdf40uhttp://ourspace.uregina.ca/bitstream/handle/10294/5395/Khan_Imran_Nathan_200312071_MASC_ISE_Apring2014.pdf1 aKhan, I.

Substantial evidence has linked tobacco smoking with both acute and chronic pain conditions. Contemporary models of pain and smoking posit a cyclical relationship wherein individuals smoke to reduce pain in the short term; however, smoking to cope with pain indirectly exacerbates pain in the long term. Recent findings suggest situational pain is sufficient to increase smoking urge and immediate smoking behaviour (Ditre & Brandon, 2008). The purpose of the current investigation is to replicate and extend the findings of Ditre and Brandon (2008) by investigating the effects of (a) situational pain on smoking urge and behaviour using a reliable pain induction technique (electrical stimulation) and an alternate thermal mode (heat), and (b) anxiety vulnerabilities and smoking expectancies that may be contributing to increased tobacco dependence in a university and community sample (n=34; 55.9% male).

Agriculture and transportation are primary sources of PM while industries are the primary sources of SO2. A network of air quality monitoring stations was established to measure ambient PM and SO2 concentrations continuously but they are not enough to cover remote areas of Saskatchewan. To provide a cost-effective solution to this problem, principles of remote sensing for predicting ambient concentrations of air pollutants and mapping their distributions over the areas of interest were applied. Concentration prediction can be done in an almost real-time fashion depending on how fast the satellite data can be obtained. The Landsat TM/ETM+ data were used in this study because of its fine resolution (30m), availability, and easy to obtain compared to other data.

To improve quality, policy reforms must target the length of consultations, interdisciplinary collaboration, and system coordination. PMHC governance and physician remuneration are structural barriers that impede quality improvement efforts. Purpose: The purpose of the research is to determine which PMHC governance and mode of physician remuneration policy reforms can most effectively facilitate greater system coordination, interdisciplinary coordination, and longer, more involved consultations in Canadian PMHC. Methods: A comparative case study of three Canadian provinces, specifically British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, was completed. These cases represent the range of Canadian PMHC policy reforms. To evaluate progress and performance, reforms were ranked on a PMHC best practices ordinal scale.

Among the psychological consequences, researchers have found that a cardiac event can lead to high levels of depressive symptoms in both males and females (Milani, Lavie, & Cassidy, 1996). To date, research has confirmed the beneficial effects of a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program on depressive symptoms (Casey, Hughes, Waechter, Josephson, & Rosneck, 2008; Zellweger, Osterwalder, Langewitz, & Pfisterer, 2004); however, there has been a limited focus on how males and females differ in their depressive symptoms both prior to commencing and after completing a CR program. Previous research has shown that patients with heart disease and co-morbid depressive symptoms have a high risk for subsequent major cardiac events and potentially fatal cardiac consequences (Irwin, Artin, & Oxman, 1999). This can place a significant economic burden on society, lead to treatment drop-out and program non-compliance, and reduce the overall well- 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10294/546340uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/SRU/TC-SRU-5463.pdf40uhttp://ourspace.uregina.ca/bitstream/handle/10294/5463/Marshall-Prain_Natalie_200228193_MSC_KHS_Spring2014.pdf1 aPrain, Natalie Kym Marshall-1 aPrain, N.

The caustic extraction process results in dispersed tailings that do not dewater under conventional gravity settling. Centrifugation along with polymer addition has recently demonstrated promising results for these tailings at the pilot-scale level. The complex colloid-water-polymer interactions govern the dewatering behaviour of the tailings during this process. The main objective of this research was to characterize and improve the dewatering properties of oil sands fine tailings using centrifuge technology in conjunction with polymer amendment. MFT was found to be a fine grained material with clay size fraction of 53% and possessing a moderate water adsorption capacity (wl = 55% and wp = 25%). The solids comprised of 55% quartz and 40% clay minerals (kaolinite and illite) and showed a specific surface area of 43 m2/g and a cation exchange cap 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10294/539840uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/SRU/TC-SRU-5398.pdf40uhttp://ourspace.uregina.ca/bitstream/handle/10294/5398/Rima_Umme_200305429_MASC_EVSE_Spring2014.pdf02470nam  22003013a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900160012110000340013724501710017126000880034250200680043050400410049851600200053952902290055952910270078865500460181585600370186185600810189885601050197990000270208490000170211199000200212899000200214800004312897320160411081335.0m        d        cr uz 141027s2014    snc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-SRU-54821 aWarren, Jim W.q(Jim William)10aRural Water Governance in the Saskatchewan Portion of the Palliser Triangleh[electronic resource] :bAn Assessment of the Applicability of the Predominant Paradigms.  aSaskatoon :bFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research, University of Regina,c2014.  aThesis (Doctor of Philosophy (PhD))--University of Regina, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aA Thesis Submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Special Case Doctor of Philosophy in Canadian Plains Studies, University of Regina. viii, 337 p.  aThis thesis describes the paradigmatic forms of water governance and management employed by town and country communities, irrigation districts, regional pipeline systems and private water management systems in the Saskatchewan portion of the Palliser Triangle. It demonstrates that the trajectory of water policy development affecting the region since 2002, when the province developed its Safe Drinking Water Strategy, has reflected the influence of the market-based paradigm within the province???s water governance policy community. The application of policy measures that conform to the principles of the market-based water governance paradigm have failed to consistently produce the beneficial outcomes predicted by the paradigm???s advocates. The lack of consistent efficacy is apparent in outcomes related to water conservation, social equity and infrastructure financing objectives. The research demonstrates that the water management challenges facing the study communities are context specific.

As students are being placed in inclusive classroom, they are developing ideas around difference and disability. But what exactly are these students learning from this experience? This thesis examines my class of Grade 1 and 2 students??? perspectives on disability and difference. Through interviews with the students, observations and my own self-reflections two key themes emerged. Firstly, the students were unlikely to notice a difference of autism and just see a friend. Secondly, the students??? understanding of difference was derived from their own personal experience. It was also determined that effective inclusive practices are lead by teachers and educational assistants. The environment that teacher and assistants create can influence the academic and social success for all students. This environment may then also aid in all students understanding of disability and difference. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10294/546440uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/SRU/TC-SRU-5464.pdf40uhttp://ourspace.uregina.ca/bitstream/handle/10294/5464/Haase_Cambri_200221326_MED_C%26I_Spring2014.pdf1 aHaase, C.10a90001ab10001a02210nam  22003493a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900160012110000170013724500810015426000510023550200530028650400410033951600200038052910270040065300330142765300180146065300170147865300330149565300200152865300250154865300100157365300100158365300100159365500460160385600370164985600810168685600930176700004318785720141124      .0m        d        cr uz 141124s2014    abc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-ALU-34951 aLi, Taoting.10aApplying the IS success model to mobile banking appsh[electronic resource].  aLethbridge :bUniversity of Lethbridge,c2014.  aThesis (Masters)--University of Lethbridge, 2014  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aMobile banking applications (apps) are the latest technology to be offered by the retail banking sector.

System quality and information quality were found to be multidimensional structures with the user interface, response time, and security contributing significantly to system quality while understandability and completeness contributed significantly to information quality. The findings suggest that system quality significantly impacts perceived innovativeness while information quality significantly influences satisfaction.

The Sudbury region of Ontario, Canada has suffered over a century of elevated metal and sulphur deposition from mining and smelting activity, and wetlands in the area have provided an important ecosystem service by adsorbing large concentrations of metals over decades of emissions. However, metals can be released from peat in some circumstances such as during dry periods that result in a drop in water table height. With emissions declines in the region, there is the potential that wetlands have remained contaminated and are now acting as a source of metals at annual scales. Stream metal concentrations and dissolved organic matter (DOM) exports were evaluated in six Sudbury wetland-draining streams to address the question: Are wetlands in mining-impacted watersheds releasing potentially toxic metals to receiving waters?

Adult musicians who began lessons prior to age 7 have been found to have superior rhythm synchronization and enhancements in brain structures when compared to musicians who started later in life. These differences exist even when early-trained (ET) and late-trained (LT) groups are matched for musical training, formal lessons, and current practice. Moreover, duration of musical training is associated with better performance on measures of rhythm and melody discrimination. Finally, musical training has been shown to directly improve scores on IQ tests and is highly correlated with measures of auditory working memory and nonverbal reasoning skills. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether sensitive-period effects can be observed in childhood. A secondary aim is to investigate the contributions of age-of-start, duration of lessons, and cognitive abilities to performance on musically relevant tasks.

Our understanding of iron geochemistry is central to the study of carbon and vice versa as it is nearly impossible to find an environment where these two elements are not conjoined. Iron has a profound effect on the carbon that cycles on geological time scales--in sedimentary rocks, in coal and petroleum deposits, the balance between carbon preservation and remineralization is in part modulated by iron. Approximately 20% of the organic carbon buried in sediments is protected by reducible iron phases, well below the oxic-anoxic limit of the sediment where they are no longer thermodynamically stable. Iron represents a globally important sink for sedimentary organic matter (OM), contributing to maintaining the delicate balance of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere. Iron also impacts the carbon cycling in active oceanic, atmospheric and lithospheric reservoirs, for example by linking c 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/QMG/TC-QMG-978639.pdf40uhttp://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/978639/1/Lalonde_PhD_F2014.pdf01993nam  22002293a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900180012110000200013924502220015926000450038150200480042650400410047451600200051552910270053565500460156285600830160885600720169100004318999320141201      .0m        d        cr uz 141128s2014    quc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-QMG-9786751 aZbarcea, Danut.10aJe suis ce que j'interroge L'impact pédagogique des méthodes d'enseignement et d'apprentissage basées sur la déconstruction et la reconstruction de la rhétorique visuelle des nouvelles en ligneh[electronic resource].  aMontréal :bConcordia University,c2014.  aThesis (Ph.

Secondly, the expenses associated with the fabrication of solar cell devices, are much less than the fabrication costs of other energy generators. This is because the sun energy is free of charges. Besides, the materials that are used in the solar cell structure are mainly from the most abundant elements on the earth such as silicon. Thirdly, this source of energy is not in conflict with the issue of natural environment pollution. In turn, it helps in eliminating the concern of contamination production, which is a direct result of fossil fuel consumption. Having investigated for the benefits of these photovoltaic devices, we were motivated to do some significant work in improving the efficiency of these renewable energy resources.

Considered here are mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the behaviour of this electrical activity. Generating an efficient numerical solution of these models is a challenging task, and in fact the physiological accuracy of tissue-scale models is often limited by the efficiency of the numerical solution process. In this thesis, we discuss two sets of experiments that test ideas for making the numerical solution process more efficient. In the first set of experiments, we examine the numerical solution of four single cell cardiac electrophysiological models, which consist solely of ODEs. We study the efficiency of using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) splitting methods to solve these models.

Quantitative adequacy assessment is a basic task in achieving this objective. An important requirement in this task is the ability to forecast the system load requirements at specific times in the future. These forecasts must also recognize the inherent uncertainty in predicting the future load demands. The primary focus of the research described in this thesis is to examine the effects and implications of load forecast uncertainty on the load point and system adequacy indices of a composite generation and transmission system.

Poloidal beta is defined as the ratio of plasma kinetic pressure to poloidal magentic field pressure. Compensation for the vacuum toroidal field has been performed using a non-enclosing co-planar coil, and vibrational compensation from auxiliary coils. It was found that in STOR-M conditions (20\% toroidal magnetic field decay over discharge) there is significant influence on the diamagnetic flux measurements from strong residual signals, presumably from image currents being induced by the toroidal field coils, requiring further compensation. A blank (non-plasma) shot is used specifically to eliminate the residual component which is not proportional to the toroidal magnetic field. Data from normal ohmic discharge operation is presented and calculations of poloidal beta from coil data ($eta_ heta simeq 0.5$) is found to be in reasonable agreement with the values of poloidal  aunrestricted  aI hereby certify that, if appropriate, I have obtained and attached hereto a written permission statement from the owner(s) of each third party copyrighted matter to be included in my thesis, dissertation, or project report, allowing distribution as specified below.

The aim of this thesis is to apply optimization techniques in the design of multi-relay wireless networks employing cooperative communications. In general, the thesis is organized into two parts: ``Distributed space-time coding' (DSTC) and ``Distributed beamforming', which cover two main approaches in cooperative communications over multi-relay networks. <br><br> In Part I of the thesis, various aspects of distributed implementation of space-time coding in a wireless relay network are treated.

The increasing demands for attitude accuracy, high performance and low cost spacecraft are driving designers to change from available attitude determination methods to those that are more robust and accurate. However, the cost, the processor workload and the time-constraints in spacecraft development and deployment projects curtail the opportunity for developing new on-board attitude determination methods, especially with regards to the development of more precise sensors. Therefore, it is always desired to achieve the required attitude accuracy with the existing set of on-board sensors, but using effective attitude determination methods and sensor fusion algorithms. Developing such algorithms starts on the ground and is subject to verification and tuning with real experimental data from telemetry.

Cornerstones of embedded systems are analog and mixed signal (AMS) designs, which are integrated circuits required at the interfaces with the real world environment. The verification of AMS designs is concerned with the assurance of correct functionality, in addition to checking whether an AMS design is robust with respect to different types of inaccuracies like parameter tolerances, nonlinearities, etc. The verification framework described in this thesis is composed of two proposed methodologies each concerned with a class of AMS designs, i.e., continuous-time AMS designs and discrete-time AMS designs. The common idea behind both methodologies is built on top of Bounded Model Checking (BMC) algorithms. In BMC, we search for a counter-example for a property verified against the design model for bounded number of verification steps.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the response of bone, fracture plate, screws and callus at different stages of healing to various applied loads. A three-dimensional, half-symmetric finite element model was developed. The stress and strain states in the assembly were investigated for pure compression, pure tension, twisting moment and combination of compressive and shear forces, which generate a bending moment, simulating getting up from a chair, carrying a suitcase and turning a screw driver. Two types of commonly used fracture plates were compared: 316 stainless steel and Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy. The results of this research showed that there is less stress shielding of the bone with the titanium alloy plate and screws than with the stainless steel ones. The maximum equivalent von-Mises stress was found to be less in compression and tension than in bending and twisting.

The standard DLs, based on the classical logic, are more suitable to describe concepts that are crisp and well-defined in nature. However, for many emerging applications, we also need to deal with uncertainty. In recent years, a number of proposals have been put forward for incorporating uncertainty in DL frameworks. While much progress has been made on the representation and reasoning of the uncertainty knowledge, query optimization in this context has received little attention. In this thesis, we tackle this problem in both theoretical and practical aspects by taking a generic approach. We first propose the [Special characters omitted.] framework which extends the standard DL [Special characters omitted.] with uncertainty. This is done by extending each component of the [Special characters omitted.] framework, including the description language, the knowledge base, and the reasoning procedure 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/QMG/TC-QMG-975875.pdf40uhttp://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/975875/1/NR37747.pdf02448nam  22003373a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000240009709900150012110000330013624501080016926000510027750200460032850400410037451600200041552900480043552910270048365300300151065300590154065300580159965300560165765300870171365300470180065300290184765500460187685600360192285600800195885600720203800004213821720150120152439.0m        d        cr uz 131022s2008    abc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONL 2aTC-ALU-6491 aBigelow, Sarah Grace,d1976-10aImpacts of flow augmentation on river channel processes and riparian vegetationh[electronic resource].  aLethbridge :bUniversity of Lethbridge,c2008.  aThesis ()--University of Lethbridge, 2008  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  axiv, 139 leaves : ill.

Disturbing olfactory sense input during development affected motor output. Rats normally display an equal distribution of right or left paw preference. In this study, both OBX sexes showed a shifted paw preference to the ipsilesional side, and forelimb deficits were found in a skilled reaching task. Lesion animals also showed enhanced performance on a visually driven spatial cognitive test. Cross-modal compensatory changes may be responsible. Morphological changes within the cerebral cortex are described, including bulbar changes, enlarged but fewer glomeruli, smaller accessory olfactory bulb, decreased downstream connectivity, and a rostral shift of the forebrain toward the olfactory b  aDissertations, Academic.  aElectronic dissertations.  aBrain -- Research.  aBrain -- Wounds and injuries.  aRhinencephalon.  aRats as laboratory animals. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10133/68340uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/ALU/TC-ALU-683.pdf40uhttp://www.uleth.ca/dspace/bitstream/10133/683/1/goldsbury, robin.pdf02392cam  22003253a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000320009709900150012910000300014424501300017426000510030450200460035550400410040151600200044252900460046252910040050865300580151265300640157065300600163465300650169465300290175965300460178865500460183485600360188085600800191685600700199600004213842120170424082700.0m        d        cr uz 131022s2008    abc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONLdCaOONL 2aTC-ALU-6241 aHall, Alexis Anne,d1980-10aResponse of riparian cottonwoods to experimental flows along the lower Bridge River, British Columbiah[electronic resource].  aLethbridge :bUniversity of Lethbridge,c2008.  aThesis ()--University of Lethbridge, 2008  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  axii, 89 leaves : ill. (some col.) ; 29 cm  aThe Bridge River drains the east slope of the Coast Mountain Range and is a major tributary of the Fraser River in southwestern British Columbia. The lower Bridge River has been regulated since the installation of Terzaghi Dam in 1948, which left a section of dry riverbed for an interval of 52 years prior to 2000. An out-of-court settlement between BC Hydro and Federal and Provincial Fisheries regulatory agencies resulted in the required experimental discharge of 3 m3/s below Terzaghi Dam in 2000. This study investigated growth of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) trees in response to the experimental discharges. Mature trees did not show a significant response in radial trunk growth or branch elongation. In contrast, the juvenile trees displayed an increased growth response, and the successful establishment of saplings provided a dramatic response to the new flow regime. Thus, I conclude that cottonwoods have benefited from the experimental flow regime of the lower Bridge River.  aCottonwood -- British Columbia -- Bridge River Basin.  aRiparian ecology -- British Columbia -- Bridge River Basin.  aEcohydrology -- British Columbia -- Bridge River Basin.  aHydrology, Forest -- British Columbia -- Bridge River Basin.  aDissertations, Academic.  aDams -- British Columbia -- Bridge River. 7aElectronic thesis or dissertation.2local40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/10133/62440uhttp://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/ALU/TC-ALU-624.pdf40uhttp://www.uleth.ca/dspace/bitstream/10133/624/1/hall, alexis.pdf02907cam  22002893a 450000100130000000500170001300600190003000700070004900800410005604000320009709900260012910000220015524500610017726000520023850200530029050400410034351600200038452910270040454000170143154008660144865300290231465300340234365300100237765300340238785600810242185601150250200003443677320170424085859.0m        d        cr uz 081001s2008    snc     smab  000 0 eng    aCaOONLbengcCaOONLdCaOONL 2aTC-SSU-042520081502001 aNienaber, Kurt H.10aStructural Investigation of MosAh[electronic resource].  aSaskatoon :bUniversity of Saskatchewan,c2008.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Saskatchewan, 2008  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aapplication/pdf  aMosA is an enzyme from Sinorhizobium meliloti L5-30, a beneficial soil bacterium. Initial investigation into this enzyme categorized it as a methyltransferase. Further investigation revealed that this was incorrect, and that MosA is actually a dihydrodipicolinate synthase, part of the N-acetylneuraminate lyase superfamily. One of the characteristics of enzyme superfamilies is their low sequence identity, but relatively high structural similarity. The structural investigation reported here confirms the high structural similarity between MosA and other superfamily members. Investigation of MosA was carried out by means of x-ray crystallography. It was believed that detailed structural information may shed light into not only the enzymatic mechanism, but also the inhibition of MosA by lysine, the final product of the enzymatic pathway. Insight into enzyme mechanism and inhibition may ultimately prove useful in herbicide or insecticide development, as other dihydrodipicolinate synthases from harmful fungi, bact  aunrestricted  aI hereby certify that, if appropriate, I have obtained and attached hereto a written permission statement from the owner(s) of each third party copyrighted matter to be included in my thesis, dissertation, or project report, allowing distribution as specified below.
