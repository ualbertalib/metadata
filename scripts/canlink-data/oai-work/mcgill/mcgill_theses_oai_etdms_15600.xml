From the kitchen only a passage width away came the clink and the scraping of a pot in the sink, the discreet slushing rise in pitch of the tap water filling the pot, the tempered shuffle and heel click on the linoleum of his mother’s moving about. Up already, he thought. He listened hard for a moment. Her voice, still as young and fresh as a spring, gurgled in an endless flow of Yiddish past his closed door and into his room, punctuated every now and then by an indignant "Ah!"

Beek and Tichy (1935) recommended removal of the epicardium irrespective of the graft or material used, be it talc powder, pericardium, pericardial fat, mediastinal tissue, pleura, etc. Beck believed that the epicardium was a barrier to the development of extra-coronary vessels.

Probably no English writer of the time, and certainly no novelist, more fully epitomizes the century.” Many, including William Hale White and Lord Acton, have considered her the greatest Victorian. G. M. Young makes the reason for such tributes clear. George Eliot was, he says, “a light to thousands who had learnt from her that, in the darkness deepening over all ancient faiths, the star of duty shone clearer than ever. Grave and wise men thought that George Eliot had, single-handed, by her ethical teaching, saved us from the moral catastrophe which might have been expected to follow upon the waning of religious conviction. They were not altogether wrong. George Eliot did give body, and expression… to her time. In doing so she shaped a generation.”</description><creator>Raff, Anton. D.</creator><contributor>Lucas, A.

In the case of acetylcholine (ACh), the sequence of events was quite different, for, it will be seen that the physiological role of ACh had been suggested long before its discovery in animal tissue. It is generally believed that two different physiological events occur innerve activity: a) conduction, i.e. propagation of the nerve impulse in the nerve fibers and, b) transmission, a biochemical process that occurs at nerve endings or synapses. The fundamental findings on which these concepts were based can be traced as far back as 1843.</description><creator>Proulx, Lucille. M.</creator><contributor>Hosein, E.

There have been numerous reports, some based mainly on clinical observations and others on experimental findings, but these are not all in agreement, and analysis of the results obtained by different investigators is rendered particularly difficult by the lack of uniformity of methods and by the lack of comparable studies in man and experimental animal. In man. bilateral medial temporal-lobe lesions appear to cause a grave, persistent, and generalized defect of recent memory (Scoville and Milner, 1957; Penfield and Milner, 1958; Milner, 1959; Milner, 1962b) but attempts to produce an analogous deficit in the monkey by similarly placed lesions have been largely unsuccessful (Orbach, Milner, and Rasmussen 1960), although loss of recent memory in both auditory and visual modalities has been reported after bilateral medial temporal-lobe removal in one study (Stepien, Cordeau, and Rasmussen, 1960).</description><creator>Prisko, Lilli-Heddi.</creator><contributor>Milner, B.

A technique which employs this sort of design has been developed by Lambert, Hodgson, Gardner, and Fillenbaum (1960). They compared a listener's evaluative reactions to the same individual speaking in two languages.

In this paper, we are presenting the problem of cellular injury resulting from the application of heat to living tissue, otherwise known as a "thermal burn". There are numerous varieties of thermal burns aptly named according to the physical nature of the heat emitting agent. Amongst these are electrical burns resulting from contact with a “live electric current”, flash burns secondary to intense radiant energy, flame burns produced by contact with flames from any flamable agent, and scald burns resulting from contact with high temperature liquids to mention only a few.</description><creator>Poy, Neville.

A review of previous studies is presented. A theoretical model is established which considers the gas stream to be influenced by both the motion of the film and the “non-smooth” nature of the film surface. The subject experimental investigation of a water film flowing on one face of a vertical rectangular duct is described. Liquid Reynolds numbers in the range 150-1500 and mean air velocities up to 55 fps were encountered Values of mean, maximum and minimum film thickness as well as records of the film surface profiles were obtained by use of a photometric measuring technique.</description><creator>Pike, John.

The earliest mention of epilepsy of which we are now aware occurs in the Code of Hammurabi (2080 B.C.) in which may be found laws regulating the marriage of epileptic persona and the validity of their court testimony. Ancient Hebrew writings (2000 B.C.) found in the Talmud contain references to epilepsy in the precepts of the sanitary laws (Pirkner, 1929). It is understandable that the attention of the earliest observer of epilepsy should have been arrested by the prominent and awesome aspect of the generalized convulsion, and it is to this part or form of the disease that most consideration was given.</description><creator>Perot, Phanor.

It represents an element which has significant impact on nearly every phase of human life. In the latter part of last century, the experiments with vaccum dischargers have led to the discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895. This was soon followed by Becherel's (1896) discovery of radiation from radiactive materials. Within months it was recognized that each of these radiation could have injurious effect upon persons exposed to it. The increasing incidence of radiation damage had culminated in the establishment of International Commission of Radiological Protection in 1928.</description><creator>Thyvalikakath, Paul.

In the ensuing period, the more articulate world has shown a marked preference for treating only his theory of “ideas” .The result has been misleading. It is therefore the purpose of this essay to present Berkeley' s theory of “notions”, in so far as it can be gleaned from the pages of his extant works, and to emphasize the importance of "notions" in any fair-minded attempt to view Berkeleyan philosophy as a whole.

Changes which result in inadequate control when an insecticide dosage which was formerly effective is employed are termed insecticidal resistance. Major review papers (Brown 1958, Crow 1960, Metcalf 1955) all conclude that resistance is a result of natural selection taking place with such rapidity that the worker is able to observe the evolutionary processes.

In her case the choice has been complicated by the prominence of two languages, namely, Swahili and English. Swahili, a Bantu-based language, is widely spoken and understood among the country’s population, whose languages belong mainly to the Bantu family of languages. It is estimated that some 7,000,000 people throughout East Africa speak Swahili as their native language.</description><creator>Owuor, Donald.</creator><contributor>Hall, C.

Such drug effects are currently receiving considerable attention. A different type of drug effect is that first noted by Girden and Culler (1937). They observed that, in certain cases, a response learned in a particular drug state would subsequently reoccur only when that drug state was reinstated. Their results draw attention to response decrements produced by a change in the chemical state of the organism, independent of whether it is a change from the nondrug state, to a drug state, from a drug state to the nondrug state, or from one drug state to another drug state. However, until recently, little interest was shown in such control of subsequent response occurrence by the “drug state" or body-chemistry condition present during acquisition of the response.</description><creator>Overton, Donald.

Many of these substances possess a characteristic physiological activity and therefore are extensively used in medicine. The significance of these compounds bas provided an impetus for extensive synthetic research by various schools to prepare new related substances of improved biological activity. The fact that many physiologically active substances are oxazines, led us to believe that the combination of a dialkoxybenzene ring with an oxazine nucleus, might give rise to or increase biological activity. In the present work the object was to study the synthesis of a number of 6,7-dialkoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-2-ones and their dihydro-derivatives 2-phenomorpholones.</description><creator>Orphanos, Demetrius.

During this period, which was inaugurated by Drechsler in the U.S.A., the range of morphological diversity of these fungi has received considerable attention; some work has been done on their distribution and degree of occurrence in various habitats; aspects of their biology have been studied and attempts have been made to utilize these fungi in the biological control of plant and animal diseases, caused by nematodes, or eelworms as they are sometimes called.</description><creator>Olthof, Theodorus.

To achieve planetary wave stabilization, an approximation based on Phillips’ (1951) two-layer atmospheric model, was made to the horizontal divergence term. The integration was performed on the IBM 1410 computer located at McGill University. The calculations were done on a (49 x 38) rectangular, hemispheric grid network using initial 500-mb height data for February 15, 1959. The resulting forecast, for the particular day, showed a definite improvement over forecasts obtained with other barotropic models which did not include the stabilization term. The comparisons also demonstrated that the use of a large grid can result in an improved forecast.</description><creator>Olson, Marvin. P.</creator><contributor>Kwizak, M.

Chalcopyrite exsol ves in borni te as lamellae up to 0.004 mm wide, boundary segregations and possibly rounded blebs; while bornite exsolves in chalcopyrite as irregular hair-like structures generally less than 0.001 mm wide. Chalcopyrite and bornite lamellae seem to be controlled by the low and high temp. erature forms of the respective host minerals. Chalcopyrite lamellae grow more rapidly than bornite1 and exsolution occurs raster in the pure system than in natural minerals (Schwartz, 1931), therefore these data are not directly applicable to geothermometry. </description><creator>Newham, Walter.

The divisions that are seen to evolve in the one complete education system may help to explain why physical education has grown as it has in the province, and why the division of chapters is as it is in this thesis. This province is the oldest of the Canadian Confederation, European settlement coming in 1608 when Champlain founded the city of Quebec. It is also the largest province in the Dominion.

It has been established that the hyperon-nucleon interaction is of the strong type which arises from the exchange of bosons, that is, which is present in the nucleon-nucleon interaction. At low energies, the effects of the exchange of kaons on the nucleon-nucleon interaction may be neglected and the interaction may be taken as arising from the exchange of only pions. The work of Lichtenberg and Ross (1958) indicates that the effects of the exchange of kaons on the ^-nucleon interaction may also be neglected.</description><creator>Needler, George.

The importance of recording human brain responses to controlled sensory stimuli is well recognized. These responses represent, in fact, the end product of a long series of events in the nervous system from the peripheral receptor organs, through many interneurones and relay stations, up to the cortical neurons which participate in their production. Any change, physiological, chemical or pathological, occurring anywhere along their paths may be reflected in the recorded evoked responses. It is conceivable, therefore, that the study of these electrophysiological data can yield useful information about the functional state of the nervous system.</description><creator>Nazif, Abdel.
