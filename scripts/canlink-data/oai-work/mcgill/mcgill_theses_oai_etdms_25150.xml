It was shown that esophageal samples were more representative of the grazing animal's diet than clipped samples. High drying temperature affected the intake values obtained by different indicator methods. Results showed that the chromogen ratio and the lignin ratio methods could give relatively accurate and similar intake values provided the correct MEC combinations for chromogen and VanSoest's procedure for lignin were used. In vitro cellulose digestibility and animal behaviour studies suggested that the NVI computed using the lignin ratio method gave more meaningful results particularly for aftermath forages. In vivo and in vitro studies indicated that the first growth forage up to the midbloom stage was superior in feeding value to the best aftermath forage. As measured by the NVI the feeding value of pasture managed differently appeared to be affected more by stocking rate than by the method of grazing.

Eligible carbon sequestering practices investigated in the simulations  include adoption of moderate tillage and no-till as well as the conversion to a  permanent cover crop. Monetary demand for greenhouse gas emissions offsets from the  cropping sector is endogenized in the objective function of the Canadian Regional  Agriculture Model (CRAM) which has been modified to account for the simulations and  for the disaggregation of the single crop region of Quebec into eleven sub-regions.  Changes in the cropping sector induced by the introduction of seven different carbon  price levels, ranging from $1/t CO2 to $100/t CO2, are compared to a baseline.  Variables covered in the simulation results include: relative profitability of  carbon sequestering crops/technology; adoption rates of moderate tillage and  no-till; carbon sequestration levels; carbon credit revenue; cropping pattern, crop  production and livestock. Results indicate that carbon sequestration in agricultural soils  could only contribute a minor share of the total emission reduction in Quebec, even  with very high carbon price levels. At a carbon price of $15/t CO2, it is estimated  that changes in tillage practices and permanent cover would result in an additional  12,328 t CO2 per year sequestered by the cropping sector in Quebec. However, some  regions display higher adoption rates of carbon sequestering practices than other  regions and appear to be more responsive to the price incentive. The introduction of  a monetary demand for GHGE offsets from the cropping sector induces some changes in  terms of cropping pattern and crop production level, while it has almost no impact  on the livestock sector.</description><creator>Morand, Hugues</creator><contributor>Thomassin, Paul J.

The resulting network of 61 synthetic  interactions was composed of 3 subnetworks, the N-glucosyltransferase (ALG6, ALG8,  ALG10), the glucosidase (CWH41, ROT2) and CNE1 interaction sets, respectively.  Deletion in 34 interacting genes conferred calcofluor white hypersensitivity,  strengthening the relationship between N-glycan glucosylation/processing and cell  wall physiology. In addition, a genetic interaction was found between ALG6 and  SEC53, the yeast homologues of human ALG6 and PMM2 genes involved in congenital  disorders of glycosylation. The alg6sec53 double mutant shows a synthetic growth  defect and a CPY underglycosylation. Since this synthetic interaction is conserved  from yeast to mammals, this work proposes the use of SGA analysis as a tool to  uncover digenic effects that may underlie complex human genetic  disorders.</description><creator>Munyana, Christella</creator><contributor>Bussey, Howard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</subject><subject>Glycosylation.</subject><title>Analysis of N-glycan glucosylation and processing using a synthetic lethal approach</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763744p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cw871</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05fc18n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. Evidence-based practice aims to improve patient care  and service delivery, particularly in the management of individuals with low back  pain, the largest client group seen by out-patient physiotherapists. Objective: This  study determined the prevalence of use of interventions with evidence of  effectiveness in the management of acute non-specific low back pain by  physiotherapists. Methods. A multi-centered cross-sectional study was conducted on  100 physiotherapists working with low back pain patients. Using a  telephone-administered interview, therapists described their current and desired  treatment practices for a typical case of low back pain. Each intervention reported  was coded according to its evidence of effectiveness (strong, moderate, limited or  none) as per Van Tulder's rating system. Information on clinician, workplace and  client characteristics was also obtained. Results. The prevalence of use of  interventions with strong or moderate evidence of effectiveness was 68%. Almost all  therapists use interventions with limited or no evidence of effectiveness or  moderate evidence of ineffectiveness. Users of interventions with high evidence of  effectiveness, as compared to non-users, had graduated more recently (p = 0.0098)  and had taken a higher number of post-graduate clinical courses (p = 0.0091).  Conclusion. Although most therapists use interventions with high evidence of  effectiveness, much of their treatment programs consist of interventions that are  not well studied in the literature.</description><creator>Mikhail, Christine</creator><contributor>Korner-Bitensky, Nicol (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</subject><title>Physiotherapists' use of interventions with high evidence of effectiveness in the management of low back pain</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hg08x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc18n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jf356</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A case study of hurricane Floyd (1999) is performed using the  Penn State/NCAR MM5 model. Hurricane Floyd was the third most costly hurricane to  have hit the United States. To predict accurately the track and evolution of the hurricane,  a vortex bogusing technique has been devised. A more realistic initial vortex was  specified and introduced into the large-scale analysis for model initialization. The  technique used follows closely that described by Zhu et al. (2002) where Advanced  Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) data are employed to retrieve the temperature of the  hurricane vortex. An algorithm is then applied to compute the sea level pressure,  geopotential heights, winds and moisture content. Three experiments initialized with  three different data sets were performed, using respectively the original Canadian  Meteorological Centre (CMC) analysis, the bogus-vortex modified CMC analysis with  the original CMC sea surface temperature (SST) field, and a bogus-vortex modified  CMC analysis with a spatially-constant SST of 28°C.

This  multi-centered, retrospective study using data from medical charts of a  representative sample of individuals admitted to 10 Ontario acute care hospitals  from July 15th to December 15th 2002, examined the prevalence, timing and frequency  of use of standardized assessments to evaluate USN post stroke. Out of the 248  subjects who should have received a USN assessment, 37.5% received an assessment;  only 13.31% with a standardized visual perception tool and of these, only 0.81% (n =  2) with a standardized tool specific to USN assessment. All clients receiving a  standardized assessment were evaluated for USN in the near extrapersonal space, the  hemispace within reaching distance of the patient: no patient received a  standardized assessment for USN in the personal space or far extrapersonal space.  Three standardized visual perception tools that include a USN component were used:  the Clock Drawing Test (n = 22), the Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists  (OSOT) Perceptual Evaluation (n = 8) and the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test (n =  1). Only 8 (3.23%) of the 248 clients were screened with a standardized tool within  the 2-day critical period as recommended by Stroke Guidelines. Reassessment was  rare, even in those with detected USN, such that only 1 subject was ever reassessed  with a standardized tool.</description><creator>Menon, Anita</creator><contributor>Korner-Bitensky, Nicol (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>Assessment of unilateral spatial neglect post stroke in acute care hospitals : are we neglecting neglect?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g0766.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182k737</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6108vb984</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents the results of a search for the decay B 0  → J/Ψγ at the BABAR experiment.

The Chk2 family of kinases  plays a central role in mediating responses to DNA damage or DNA replication blocks  in various organisms. My functional analysis of the Drosophila serine/threonine  kinase Loki/Chk2 shows that fly chk2 monitors double-strand breaks caused by  irradiation during S and G2 phases and induces cell cycle arrest in embryonic cells  around cellularization. loki is also required for the normal number of germ line cells  to form in the embryo, and for normal modification of Vasa, a crucial factor in germ  cell formation. However, during normal oogenesis loki expression is suppressed by  orb. Another group described the involvement of Drosophila loki/chk2 in the meiotic  pachytene checkpoint. Using our loki·null mutant, I obtained the opposite  result: loki/chk2 does not have an essential function in this  process. The second part of my thesis deals with the question of how  cells are instructed about their identity in a developing organism.

The purpose of this study was to examine which data from the RAMQ  administrative database could be used to accurately diagnose COPD patients, and  classify their severity and comorbidity. Methods . Patients with physician-diagnosed  COPD were selected using hospital discharge and outpatient records. Information  collected from medical chart was compared to information on the same patients from  medical service and prescription drug databases. Results. The ICD-9 respiratory  diagnostic codes were found to have a sensitivity of 93% identifying COPD in 151  cases and 94% specificity within a group of similar-aged asthmatic patients. The  number of prednisone prescriptions over one year accurately separated severe from  moderate patients. As well, diagnostic codes showed moderate reliability for  indicating the presence of comorbidity. Conclusions. The diagnostic codes of the  medical service database were accurate at identifying COPD patients and the  prescription drug data was useful for classifying their severity.</description><creator>McKnight, Jason</creator><contributor>Menzies, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><subject>Information Science.</subject><title>Validation of use of ramq databases for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj2362602.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p17z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9w0323641</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the past decade, the increasing costs incurred as a result of  caring for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have led to the recognition of AD  economic research as an important area of study in most industrialized countries.  This thesis contains an overview of the AD economic literature published in recent  years, focusing in particular on four cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA's), which  employ Markov models to simulate disease progression through different health  states. Methodological issues and key study assumptions related to modelling disease  progression are identified and critically evaluated. Two of these issues, namely the  assumption that transition probabilities are independent of a patient's age and the  implications of MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score misclassification, are  investigated through re-analysis of MMSE data from two longitudinal cohorts of  probable AD patients (N = 106). Simulations are carried out to assess the impact of  score misclassification on transition probabilities. Our findings suggest that younger age may be associated with a  higher likelihood of progressing into more advanced stages of AD. Additionally, we  conclude that, in the presence of score misclassification, the use of the MMSE in  the context of CEA's would lead to underestimating disease progression and the time  spent in the more severe stages of AD. Recommendations are made for future  research.</description><creator>Lazariciu, Irina</creator><contributor>Wolfson, C.

If such a possibility was to be confirmed, it would provide us  the first possibility to ever get experimental measurements of the physics near the  Planck scale. This work investigates the physicality of such non-adiabatic  evolutions, by avoiding the introduction of any exotic physics, by working well  below the Planck scale. Simple 'hybrid-like' models of inflation composed of an  inflaton field coupled to another heavy scalar will be used. It will be shown that  small oscillations in the heavy scalar field can generate a non-adiabatic evolution  of the inflationary vacuum leading to new features in the power spectrum that could  eventually be observed. The naturalness of this non-adiabaticity is also studied,  leading to a constraint about the maximum duration of inflation if these effects are  to be big enough to ever be detectable.</description><creator>Lemieux, François, 1979-</creator><contributor>Burgess, C.

The viscoelastic properties of the protein gels  were monitored as a function of temperature and were also measured at three fixed  temperatures (44, 48, and 68°C). Examination was done of changes in the  secondary structure-sensitive amide l'band in the FTIR spectra of the protein in D2O  buffer (0.6M KCl, pH 6.4) as a function of temperature, as well as far-UV CD  spectra. Myosin solutions were exposed to increasing hydrostatic pressure (100--400  MPa for 10 min at 16°C). The extent of unfolding of the tail was shown to be  proportional to the pressure treatment, suggesting that the slight increase of gel  strength may partly originate from the facilitated tail-tail interaction.

In animals, HTS can modulate PMN  response to inflammatory stimulus. We hypothesized that compared to RL, HTS infusion  in humans reduces PMN oxidative burst and alters adhesion molecule expression.  Volunteers received infusions of HTS, RL or NS. PMN oxidative burst and surface  adhesion molecules were measured before and after in-vitro stimulation with  PMA(0.02ug) and LPS(1ng) respectively. Compared to pre-infusion, in-vitro  stimulation with PMA resulted in significant reduction in PMN oxidative burst in  humans having received HTS but not RL or NS. The HTS group also demonstrated  attenuation in CD11b upregulation and L-selectin reduction. HTS infusion in humans  reduces oxidative burst and alters adhesion molecule expression of activated  neutrophils. These findings suggest that HTS infusion can modulate the inflammatory  response of the neutrophil in humans, which may be beneficial following tissue  injury in resuscitated patients.</description><creator>Khwaja, Kosar A.</creator><contributor>Christou, N.

Given an observed set of data, deriving the optimal phylogenetic trees  which explain the data with maximum probability remains a central problem in  mathematical biology. Even when the phylogenetic tree is given, there is no efficient  algorithm for determining branch lengths with optimal likelihood. This motivates the  development of efficient upper bounds for the likelihood of a tree. These upper  bounds can be used to assess the quality of a particular branch length optimization  or to eliminate the trees which are not possible optimal solutions. The upper bounds derived in the thesis are based on the circular  ordering of leaves of a phylogenetic tree T. They apply to extremely general models  of evolution, with both equal and unequal base frequencies. We obtain tighter bounds  for some specific models as well.</description><creator>Han, Ying, 1974-</creator><contributor>Bryant, David (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Nigam, Nilima (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Upper bounds for the likelihood of a phylogeny</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g259.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cw889</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bk128b50j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we explore linear programming relaxations for  the Max Cut problem in graphs.

To begin to characterize the CDP2/Cux2 protein, I generated a  number of reagents to analyze its expression and activity. Polyclonal antibodies  were obtained by injecting rabbits with glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins  containing antigenic regions of the Cux2 protein. The antibodies were then  characterized in Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays  (EMSA). In total, 5 antibodies were produced against different regions of Cux2.  These antibodies were able to specifically recognize CDP2 and Cux2 but not CDP1 or  Cux1. Expression of the Cux2 protein was found in only one among 19 neuronal cell  lines: the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line. Histidine-tagged fusion protein  containing various combinations of Cut repeats and Cut homeodomain were generated to  investigate the DNA binding properties of CDP2/Cux2. The CR1CR2, CR2CR3HD and CR3HD  domains were found to exhibit similar DNA binding specificities as the corresponding  domains of CDP1/Cux2, however, analysis of DNA binding kinetics revealed that all of  these combinations of domains made rapid but transient interactions with DNA.  Mammalian expression vectors were engineered with epitope tags at the N- and  C-termini of CDP2/Cux2. The full-length protein was found to localize in the nucleus  and also to make a rapid but transient interaction with DNA. In contrast to  CDP1/Cux1, the CDP2/Cux2 protein did not appear to be subject to specific  proteolytic processing.</description><creator>Gingras, Hélène</creator><contributor>Nepveu, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Initial characterization of the CDP2Cux2 protein</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vk64w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zf112</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dz010q64c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The human visual system possesses a remarkable ability to  recognize shading patterns and attribute them to 3D shape. In this thesis  statistical differences between shading and non-shading patterns are  studied. First, a formal analysis of the regions around shading maxima is  presented. Second-order approximations of these regions are derived and compared to  the approximations of the corresponding surface regions. The analysis supports the  observation that the regions around the shading maxima tend to have elongated  intensity structure. Then, statistical properties of the regions around the maxima  are discussed and related to the analytic properties of the shading maxima. The  second-order coefficients of the shading images are estimated and their  distributions are compared with those of the surfaces and the non-shading images.  Distinctive properties of the distributions obtained from the shading images can be  captured by their normalized third central moment, or skewness coefficient. It's  thus concluded that the latter coefficient provides a cue to shading  identification.</description><creator>Gipsman, Daria</creator><contributor>Langer, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Critical points of shading: on intensity maxima</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257f755.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q64c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b5644s14n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Gold clusters protected with self-assembled monolayers of  sodium, 10-mercaptodecanesulfonate, HS(CH2)10SO 3Na, and  11-mercaptoundecanylphosphonic acid, HS(CH2) 11PO3H2, were synthesized to provide  negatively charged nanoparticles. The negatively charged end groups of the  sulfonate- and phosphonate-monolayers protected clusters, SO3-MPCs and PO 3-MPCs,  allowed the particles to be water soluble in addition to be stable in air, and can  be dried and redissolved without change. Modifications of experimental conditions,  namely the thiol:gold ratio, gold concentration and the type of surfactant, yielded  MPCs of 1.8--5.7 nm core diameters with a broad range of size dispersity, and  solubilities. Transmission electron microscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance  (1H NMR), UV-Visible and infrared spectroscopies, thermogravimetric and  zeta-potential analyses were consistent with nanoparticle formation. The chain  conformation, dynamic behavior and ordering of SO3-MPCs and PO3-MPCs were further  investigated by solid-state NMR. Despite the high surface curvature of the  nanoparticles and the bulky end groups, medium length chains of SO 3-MPCs (C10) and  PO3-MPCs (C11) showed a high degree of organization and restricted mobility when  compare to long chains of alkanethiolate MPCs (C18). The more extensive hydrogen  bonding interactions between the phosphonic acid groups led to a reduced chain  mobility and a higher thermal stability. The PO3-MPCs exhibit a high order-disorder  transition, partial decomposition and a very marked hysteresis in the chain  recrystallization similar to MPCs stabilized by HS(CH2)nCO2H. Solid-state 31P-NMR  allowed studies of the hydrogen-bonded self-assembled structure in the PO3-MPCs as  well as in the bulk phosphonic acid. The 1.8 nm-diameter SO3-MPCs produced large  aggregates in presence of poly(diallyldimethyl-ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC).

The  beta-globin LCR has previously been reported to confer high-level, position  independent expression onto globin transgenes. Each HS has been shown to have some  enhancer activity individually; however, there is evidence that they may work by  different mechanisms. In this study, we have explored this possibility by assessing  what type of position effects arise in individual clones having integrated either  muLCR, HS2 or HS3 linked to the human beta-globin gene at different integration  sites. We used Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) in conjunction with  immunochemistry to measure human beta-globin expression in single murine erythroid  leukemia cells (MEL). MEL cells (c88 strain) were induced to produce human  beta-globin by treatment using 2% DMSO or by 10 nM TSA treatment so as to gain  further insight on the molecular mechanism of these enhancers. Our results suggest  that (1) HS3 is generally a stronger enhancer than HS2. (2) HS2 is exclusively  affected by a graded position effect whereas HS3 (and the [LCR to a lesser extent)  is prone to position effect variegation (PEV). (3) PEV was alleviated in HS3 and  muLCR clones when we used 10nM TSA as the induction method but did not change HS2  position effects. (4) The expression per expressing cell seemed copy number  dependent for HS3 whereas it was not for HS2 This data taken together with evidence  from the literature suggests that HS2 and HS3 function by different mechanisms  whereby HS2 would play a role in acetylating histones/protection from DNA  methylation and open chromatin whereas HS3 would increase the total amount of  transcripts in each expressing cell.</description><creator>Diallo, Jean-Simon</creator><contributor>Pelletier, Jerry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The human ß-globin LCR HS2 and HS3 : a tale of two position effects and mechanisms of transcriptional enhancement</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pb01c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80hv90g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):25175</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
