The amount of growth was proportional to the glucose concentration. The pathogenicity of the yeast-like cells was studied in diabetic mice (strain C57 BL/KsJ-db/db) injected intraperitoneally with pre-incubated sporangiospores. A non-fatal disease developed from which the mice recovered. Cultures of M. alternans were obtained from visceral organs, lungs, brain and nodules of 37.7% of the diabetic mice. Normal controls were negative in culture. Upon microscopic examination of livers and nodules, hyphae, arthrospores and budding cells were found. It is postulated that single cells, e.g., broken off arthrospores disseminate the disease to distant foci where germination occurs accounting for the presence of hyphae observed in o histopathological sections.</description><creator>Leyritz, Michele</creator><contributor>Kapica, L.
