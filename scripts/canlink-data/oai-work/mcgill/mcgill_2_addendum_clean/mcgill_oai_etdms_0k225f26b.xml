The duration and degree of constriction of the catâ€™s basilar artery produced by several different substances was examined. Topical applications of fresh whole venous blood, autogenous platelet-rich plasma and rupture of a branch of the basilar artery were used. There was a suggestion that platelet-rich plasma produced more long lasting spasm than the other spasmogenic methods, but in all other respects the constriction produced was similar. Intravenous administration of acetazolamide failed to prevent or reverse the vasospasm. In the second group of experiments, the effects of cisternal infusion of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1 ) on the cerebral circulation were studied in the dog. Measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were made with the 133Xe clearance technique, fluorescein angiograms were performed to assess cerebral circulation, and measurements of vessel diameter change were made from colour photographs of the exposed epicerebral vessels.</description><creator>Myles, S.
