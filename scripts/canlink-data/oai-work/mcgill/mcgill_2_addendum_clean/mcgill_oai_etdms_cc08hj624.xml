For the purposes of this study, fantasy is taken to represent the thought processes that produce daydreams, irrational fears, and wish-fulfillment, while reality is the actual world of the novel against which the characters pit themselves in their struggle for self-knowledge or success. The characters who are successful in Richler's terms are those who are not so trapped in their fantasy worlds that they cannot transcend their limitations and the restrictions of their society to affirm the values of human decency, moral integrity, and perseverance.</description><creator>Darling, Michael E.</creator><date>1974</date><subject>English.</subject><title>Reality and fantasy in the novels of Mordecai Richler</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977z04w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hj624</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record></GetRecord></OAI-PMH>
