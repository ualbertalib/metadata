One of the most characteristic properties of phenols is the Kolbe reaction, whereby they are carboxylated by treatment of the alkali metal salts with carbon dioxide. If carboxyl groups could be introduced into the aromatic nuclei of lignin by the same method, it might\ be expected that the lignin would oe solubilized; hence the Kolbe reaction might function as an effective method for the delignification of wood. A series of spruce wood cooks with aqueous sodium bicarbonate and carbon dioxide under pressure were therefore carried out, but the results were negative. Attention was then turned towards another novel possibility for lignin removal - extraction of wood with anhydrous liquid ammonia.</description><creator>Yan, Maxwell Menuhin.</creator><contributor>Purves, C.
