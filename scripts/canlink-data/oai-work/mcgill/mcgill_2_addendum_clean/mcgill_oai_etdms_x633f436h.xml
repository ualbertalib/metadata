If the lung were very distortable (liquid-like) ΔVy would equal - ΔVx. If the chest wall were very disortable, ΔVy would equal zero. If neither were distortable, ΔAy would be very much greater than zero. At low VL, ΔVy max was -12.5% of ΔVx max. At high VL, ΔVy max was zero. Measured pleural surface pressure differences between lobes were large. Results indicate that; 1) lung distortabllity decreases as volume increases; 2) the pressure cost of chest wall deformations is substantial and results in marked regional differences in pleural surface pressures.</description><creator>Murphy, Brian G.</creator><contributor>Macklem, P.
