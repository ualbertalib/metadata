This study is based on the fact that Islam, like other monotheist religions, considers the presence of evil in the world as a grave difficulty, a situation which has resulted in much dispute among the mutakallimin. For 'Abd al-Jabbar, the problem of evil is discussed in the framework of the concept of divine justice. According to this formulation, God does nothing except the good, as he must do the obligatory (al-wajib), will not devote himself to anything except for the sake of goodness, and never desires to do anything repulsive but only chooses wisdom and righteousness. Thus, 'Abd al-Jabbar's discussion of the problem of evil is an effort aimed at defending God's justice and omnipotence in a world marred by the presence of evil. This is significant, since divine justice (al-'adl), together with divine unity (al-tawhid), constitutes the most important characteristic of Mu'tazilism, a characteristic by virtue of which the Mu'tazilites claimed for themselves the title of ahl al-'adi wa al-tawhid, the adherents of divine justice and unity.</description><creator>Saleh, Fauzan</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Good and evil -- Religious aspects -- Islam.</subject><title>The problem of evil in Islamic theology : a study on the concept of al-Qabīḥ in al-Qāḍī ʻAbd al-Jabbār al-Hamadhānī's thought</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Fauzan Saleh, 1992</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65v906f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g78b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676w74m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis has been divided into five chapters. The three central chapters reflect paradigmatic shifts in Nigerian historiography. During the colonial era, although a few texts written by Nigerians entered the published literature, most writing was produced by non-Africans, anthropologists and colonial administrators, for the purpose of social investigation and control. With the establishment of Nigerian universities in 1948, academic historians, fuelled by the desire for independence, reclaimed their discipline to write local and national political histories. Encouraged by the concerns of the North American feminist movement of the 1970s, women gained an increasing presence in research and literature. Contrary to earlier arguments, categories for representations of women in history coexist in time. There are periods such as the nationalist era, in which women are almost invisible. When women are present in the literature, however, they are seen both in complementary power relationships with men in certain economic areas, such as trading, and in other areas, such as taxation, subject to male power.

The most prevalent of these theories locates the core of support for Quebec independence in the Francophone new middle class. The Marxist perspective offers a closely related hypothesis, according to which the independence movement is based in the Francophone new petite bourgeoisie. A third theory sees the new class as at the helm of the new social movements, among which is the Quebec independence movement. Finally, a fourth hypothesis is that the Francophone intellectuals and professional intelligentsia are the foremost separatists. The results of tabular and logistic regression analysis of data on referendum support for sovereignty-association refute the new middle class and new petite bourgeoisie hypotheses. The analyses indicate considerable support for sovereignty-association among a narrow variant of the new class. Within this narrow new class, or professional intelligentsia, support for sovereignty is most heavily concentrated among the Francophone intellectuals. The most discriminating predictor of separatism is not class, but the opposition between those in intellectuals vs. the business/managerial occupations.

On this task a "set" or method of solution is assumed to be induced through the prior solving of a series of problems which require a common solution pattern. Researchers employing this task have generally discriminated between subjects who appear to have formed a "set" on the initial questions and subjects who do not appear to have formed the set. Subjects regarded as not forming the set have generally not been involved in all the analysis since the effect of the set on solution to subsequent questions cannot be analyzed if the set is not formed. In a previous study using the water-jar task, some generalizations were made about the thinking processes of gifted and nongifted children without regard to whether or not they formed the set. The present study reexamined the relations among metacognitive knowledge, speed and giftedness taking into account set formation.

Under 'normal' everyday conditions, passive elements of the Islamic community, the mutadayyin, dominate, but in times of crisis or challenge, it is the militants, the isl amiyyin, who react against the state, its institutions and its employees. The Egypt of Anwar al-S ad at (1970-1981) will be used in order to test this hypothesis. The everyday conditions in which the people live, work and survive will be examined in order to establish the constant, the invariable. These conditions include the sectarian strife between Muslims and Copts, especially in Upper Egypt; overpopulation; the lack of housing; the failure of education; the debt burden; the cost of war with Israel, and the 'brain-drain' from Egypt to the oil-rich countries. These aspects encouraged an increase in religiosity, both Muslim and Coptic. Egypt however was also faced with three periods of crisis during S ad at's presidency, namely the October War (1973), the 'open-door' economic policy of infit ah (April 1974+)/the Bread Riots (January 1977), and the peace process with Israel (November 1977+). Shortly after each period, the militants reacted against the state.

The first part outlines the cultural and historical tradition of Venice during the Eighteenth Century. Particular attention is subsequently given to the intellectual role of women, their contribution to the literary salons of the time, and the neoclassical tradition. This first part is essential in that it supplies a valuable context to Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi's writings. In the second part, I examine Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi's literary criticism of major European authors and works. Through these criticisms she exposes her misvision of the literary world to which she aspired, and reveals that although she was influenced by the subtle preromantic tendencies, she remained faithful to the neoclassical school.</description><creator>Fonsato, Vanna Marisa</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Italian literature -- 19th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Mocenigo Soranzo, Tommaseo -- Correspondence.</subject><subject>Women intellectuals -- Italy -- Venice -- Correspondence.</subject><subject>Venice (Italy) -- Intellectual life.</subject><subject>Teotochi Albrizzi, Isabella, 1760-1836 -- Correspondence.</subject><subject>Teotochi Albrizzi, Isabella, 1760-1836 -- Views on Italian literature.</subject><subject>Salons -- Italy -- Venice -- History -- 18th century.</subject><title>Giudizi letterari di Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi nel carteggio inedito della Raccolta Piancastelli</title><language>ita</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333328r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547s59r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Italian</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dj52w592j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Three essays in the study recursive utility are presented. The first is an exposition of the extant recursive utility literature. A correspondence is drawn between the discrete time axioms for recursive utility in Koopmans (1960) and the continuous time framework in Epstein (1987b). The second essay investigates the method for endogenizing the rate of time preference given in Uzawa (1968). It is shown that when applied to non-autonomous systems, the Uzawa transformation generates errors in first order conditions. We provide a simple method for extending the Uzawa transformation to non-autonomous systems. These results are applied to two stochastic optimal control problems in the third essay. In the first problem a consumer optimally allocates consumption of a given cake whose size is unknown. With an endogenous rate of time preference, it is shown that the consumption profile may be increasing monotonic under a given set of assumptions. The second problem incorporates an endogenous rate of time preference into a stochastic optimal growth model.</description><creator>Francis, Johanna Leigh, 1970-</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Recursive functions</subject><title>Three essays in recursive utility functionals</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290b61x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w592j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rx913r029</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis re-examines the Non-Aggression Treaty of August 1939 arrived at between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in light of the changes which occurred in Eastern Europe since 1989.

A lack of casting temperature control is not only detrimental to the quality of the cast product, but also to a shop's overall productivity. The important variables for temperature control in the ladle, tundish and mould were quantified and possible methods of controlling these variables were proposed. The thermal state of the ladle lining is one of the major contributors to the variability in casting temperature. It was shown that by reducing energy losses from the refractory ladle lining, by way of incorporating an insulating refractory tile between the ladle shell and the safety lining and by using a ladle lid throughout the cycle of the ladle, temperature losses from the liquid steel can be substantially decreased.

To this end we have described the development process of sub-contracting and worked out a typology of this notion. Subsequently, we have shown how the legal systems under study have defined sub-contracting, and in which manner their definitions of sub-contracting differ from those given by economists. We have also looked closely at the legal qualification of the process of sub-contracting and the contracts involved, insisting on certain consequences of the qualifications retained. Finally, we have distinguished sub-contracting from other related notions.</description><creator>Lapointe, Catherine</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>La notion de sous-traitance en droit : etude comparative</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b443v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nj22x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s1784m86p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of the present study is to analyze the structural techniques and genre of Chekhov's plays. The many books and articles published on Chekhov's plays far exceeds his own works. Although there have been numerous studies analyzing the structural techniques of his play, considerable controversy still exists among literary and theatre scholars regarding the genre of his plays. Most of the studies simply avoid this complex and intricate problem. In this study particular emphasis is also placed on the dramatic techniques used by Chekhov: the sequence of events, the nature of the roles and the so-called "unfinished" endings.</description><creator>Ziskin, Gregory</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Chekhov, Anton Pavlovich, 1860-1904 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Chekhov, Anton Pavlovich, 1860-1904 -- Technique</subject><title>The main principles of Chekhov's dramatic technique /</title><language>rus</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sb35z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784m86p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Russian and Slavic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d504rm480</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To evaluate the extent to which the provision of universal and free of charge health care services contributes to the reduction of socio-economic disparities in health status, we studied mortality due to causes amenable to medical intervention by social class in Montreal from 1984 to 1988. The study territory was divided into quintiles based on income data from the 1986 census. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for each quintile. For all causes mortality, comparisons of the richest and poorest quintiles showed a two-fold difference in both crude death rates and standardized mortality ratios. The discrepancy between quintiles was most apparent for deaths before age 65, particularly among males. We have identified that deaths amenable to medical intervention are still observed in Montreal. Marked social class disparities in deaths amenable to medical intervention are present but they tend to be less important than those observed for causes of death known to be associated with behavioral risk factors. The observed disparities may indicate a different relationship of disadvantaged persons with health care services. The significance of these results and their implications for research and intervention are discussed.</description><creator>Roy, Denis</creator><contributor>Boivin, Jean-Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Sociology, Demography.</subject><title>La mortalité par causes traitables et le statut socio-économique Montréal, 1984-1988 /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612p78p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rm480</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5t34sk58k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Initiating a computerized population-based registry of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the IMAGE Project has developed a multimatrix model to investigate the disease. Part of the IMAGE Project 1, the neuropathological study, is designed to correlate clinical, neuropsychological and neuropathological features of AD for characterization of subtypes. This thesis reports mainly the morphometrical studies associated with project 1. The study, based on (a) brain autopsy, (b) standardized histopathology, and (c) quantitative morphometry, shows heterogeneity in pathophenotypes of AD. Four morphological subgroups have been presently recognizes, by their characteristic histological abnormalities, and the densities, the distribution, and progression patterns of their lesions. The heterogeneity in pathophenotypes indicates that AD is not a disease with a single cause, but rather a syndrome with multiple elements involved in etiology and pathogenesis. These lead to different pathological features, and correspondingly, similar, but distinguishable clinical expressions.</description><creator>Xu, Chun</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>Morphological subtypes of Alzheimer's disease</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k824r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sk58k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2801ph50h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>By the end of the eighteenth century, as imagination makes its appearance behind representation, man enters the field of knowledge and literature emerges in the world of fiction. L'Architecture of Claude-Nicolas Ledoux is too complex a work to make its mapping possible in such a short study. I therefore tried to unfold the work through the question that seemed to me to be the most revelatory of this time. The notion of caratere derived from the specific codes of a culture where representation was the foundation of a possible order. In L'Architecture, between the fictional character and his caractere is this space where representation and imagination coincide through what makes the specificity of human nature: the identity, the ability to speak, the power to act, and the perception of time.</description><creator>Ben-Aïssa, Ramla</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Ledoux, Claude Nicolas, 1736-1806.

The thesis includes three major parts: (1) the development of SPCSS; (2) the design, performance feature of SPCSS; and (3) cases studies. The development of SPCSS traces its origin as the structure of prefabricated houses for the housing shortage after the world war in Europe to its spread to developing countries for low-cost housing. Design and performance study focuses on its features related to low-cost housing its special considerations and key points in design as a small component system, its acclaimed system performance features. Case studies surveys 15 typical cases. Each case includes general background of the system, system design, comments following the design consideration and example of its application.</description><creator>Sun, Minhui</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Building</subject><subject>Reinforced concrete</subject><subject>Precast concrete</subject><title>A study of precast reinforced concrete skeleton for low-cost housing /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qn09w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311q372</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sj139301v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of membership in women's rural associations on farm productivity. A survey of 320 women was carried out in the Prefecture of Gitarama in Rwanda, in order to obtain primary data and test the hypothesis. The survey results indicate that women's associations contribute to an increased yield compared to NON-MEMBERS. In the case of credit and technical assistance, women in general received low support. Being a member of an association provides additional income to the member, but this is not the main reason to join the association. Social reasons, such as not having to work alone and being able to exchange views with other women, prevail over the economic reasons. Mutual aid is considered an important factor when considering joining the association. The survey results revealed that MEMBERS in general are more literate, are slightly older, have larger families and spend a higher percentage of their income on investments than NON-MEMBERS.

The principal method of analysis tested for the existence of asymmetry. Supplementary testing included estimates of markup equations, means and coefficients of variation, elasticities of demand and price transmission, and correlation coefficients. The findings give retailers market power in Montreal and Toronto for chicken, and in Toronto, Edmonton, and Winnipeg for beef. Vancouver retail prices for chicken and eggs were statistically independent of prices at the other levels. Processors dominated producers in the chicken markets of Montreal and Toronto, and the Winnipeg beef market. Producers showed possible dominance in the Montreal egg market. Symmetry occurred most often in the beef and egg markets; which share the character of flat or declining consumer demand conditions. The ability to exercise market power may be determined by strong demand coupled with institutional price-responsiveness.</description><creator>Druhan, Patrick James</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Eggs -- Prices -- Canada.</subject><subject>Beef -- Prices -- Canada.</subject><subject>Poultry -- Prices -- Canada</subject><title>Price asymmetry in the Canadian beef, chicken, and egg markets : implications for market power</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xs84z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h300t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6682x507b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Prolidase deficiency (McKusick 26413) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by iminodipeptiduria, skin lesions and mental retardation. The enzyme prolidase hydrolyzes dipeptides containing C-terminal proline or hydroxyproline. The results presented here indicate that prolidase plays a major role in the recycling of dipeptide bound proline. Control fibroblasts were able to use iminodipeptides in lieu of proline to sustain normal growth and protein synthesis whereas prolidase deficient cells were not. Iminodipeptides added to the media of control and mutant cells showed no adverse effects on protein synthesis or cell growth. These results are consistent with a mechanism of biochemical pathology in which proline deprivation caused by the enzyme deficit is the cause of damage to skin cells. Prolidase regulation by product and substrate was studied. A two fold decrease of prolidase activity was observed in fibroblasts grown in excess proline. However, cells grown in medium in which iminodipeptides replaced proline showed no significant difference in prolidase activity.</description><creator>Dolenga, Michael Peter</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Metabolism, Inborn errors of.</subject><subject>Fibroblasts.</subject><subject>Prolidase deficiency</subject><title>Metabolic studies of prolidase deficiency in cultured human fibroblasts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xs83p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x507b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sx61dn53f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Salmincola edwardsii is an ectoparasitic copepod typically found on the gills of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine: (i) the effects of temperature and photoperiod on early life cycle events, and (ii) the rate of larval development to adult. Egg incubation time, duration of copepodid swimming activity and copepodid survival time all decreased with increasing temperature. Different photoperiods had no effect. Hatching duration and hatching success were not influenced by either temperature or photoperiod. Copepodids remained alive and active for up to 16 days at 8$ sp circ$ and 5 days at 20$ sp circ$C. Adult male copepods were observed at 3 to 8 days after host exposure. They lived for up to 3 days.

This paper investigates the importance and validity of small time adjustments in recordings to compensate for variation in distance between spot microphones and a main stereo pair. Conventional recording techniques, psychoacoustic considerations and technological aspects of the use of delays are researched in order to determine their validity in timbral improvement. Multiple microphone set-ups are used to record both large orchestral works and smaller-scale classical compositions where auxiliary microphones may be needed to ensure an optimum balance in the final mix. Small time delays are derived from calculations involving the distances between microphones, the speed of sound, and humidity and temperature readings from the hall. Proper synchronization of these delays is desirable to preserve phase coherence and combat comb-filter effects. Precise delay units are used to compile musical exerpts for listening tests. The results reveal any change in sound quality and provide a basis for investigating both the positive and negative effects through objective study of the value of time delay compensation in the live recording reproduction of classical music performances.</description><creator>Leonard, Theresa Ann</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Sound -- Recording and reproducing</subject><title>Time delay compensation of distributed multiple microphones in recording : an experimental evaluation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x008d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vm12b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Music</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):24500</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
