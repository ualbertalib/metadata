A program of field and laboratory studies has enabled the classification to be related to both geological and physical-mechanical properties. The classification has been aimed to advance TNB mining, mineral exploration and processing research. The thesis also considers the genesis and nature of both inherent and mining-induced rock mass damage at the Birchtree mine. An inherent rock mass damage index, D$ sb{ rm I}$, has been derived, based upon the rock unit intact strength, together with the quantity and conditions of any meso- and macro-structure present. D$ sb{ rm I}$ was closely related to rock mass domains. The physical characteristics of rock mass damage in mine developments induced both through drill-and-blast and roadheader mining were also monitored at the Birchtree Mine. This permitted the formation of a mining-induced rock mass damage index, D$ sb{ rm M}$. This was based upon decrease in the intact strength, half cast/tool marks, normalized scaling time, drift condition rating, and orientation of local structure. The type and intensity of mining-induced damage was found to be clearly related to the nature of the rock mass units and domains, as evident in their inherent damage. Two types of mining-induced damage mechanism were evident at Birchtree. Firstly, in the inherently weak rock mass ($ rm D sb{I}10$), such as the Metasedimentary Domain, the rock units are foliated with wider spaced joints. More energy is evidently required to fragment the rock mass through what was observed to be predominantly intact rock breakage controlled by foliation. These two damage mechanisms were also clearly evident from analysis of drift and fragmentation morphology survey data. The damage mechanism associated with both forms of mining appeared to be similar, although the intensity of machine-induced damage was significantly less. Rock mass damage related to ground stress redistribution was also observed. This thesis was motivated by the need to understand, control and minimize mining-induced damage, particularly in serpentized ultramafic domains which will host most of the future TNB mining at depth. It thus concludes by reviewing a proposed strategy for rock mass damage sensing and control in underground development and stoping, based upon the experience at Birchtree.</description><creator>Paventi, Mario</creator><contributor>Scoble, M.

Study outcomes were lung function level and airway responsiveness to exercise and to methacholine. The hypotheses examined were that asthma occurred more frequently in urban than rural areas, and that the differences were due to the differences in the distribution of host and environmental risk factors. The analysis was based on the results of 485 rural and 586 grade 4 school children, aged 8-12 years. Host factors to which urban children were more frequently exposed than rural children included--pre-term birth (but higher average birth weight) and shorter periods of breast feeding, personal and family history of asthma and allergy, and sensitivity to house dust mite. Urban children were also more frequently exposed to motor vehicle fumes. Environmental risk factors to which rural children were more frequently exposed than urban children included sleeping in the kitchen, sharing a bed and having no mattress. Wood was the most common domestic fuel in rural homes and gas and electricity in urban homes. Separate kitchens, paternal smoking, and animals in the homestead were more common in rural compared to urban homes. Rural children were older but smaller in size compared to urban children and urban-rural differences in lung function level were almost entirely due to these differences. Urban children were more likely to exhibit airway hyperresponsiveness to exercise than rural children. This difference did not, however, persist when adjusted for age, host and environmental factors. Urban children were also more likely to exhibit airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine than rural children. This difference increased when adjusted for host factors, but diminished and was no longer significant when adjusted for environmental factors. When adjusted simultaneously for age, host and environmental factors, this difference increased but was no longer statistically significant. These findings are consistent with the view that host susceptibility to airway hyperresponsiveness, arising from either a genetic predisposition and/or other early like events, interacts with exposure to environmental factors to produce asthma in urban children.</description><creator>Ng'ang'a, Lucy Wamaitha</creator><contributor>Becklake, M.

Much of the work focused on lead: shots, flattened shots and fragments were ground in three different laboratory mills. Testwork with fragments was repeated in the presence of a brittle and harder mineral phase (95% silica, 5% lead) and for copper (100% copper). The transfer of particles across size classes and the loss of weight because of smearing on the mill shell and grinding media were measured. Microhardness tests confirmed that lead did not work-harden during grinding. The transfer across size classes was modelled with various first order differential equations describing flattening, folding, cold-welding and actual breakage. Model parameters were estimated using a least-square minimization criterion. When more than one model was fitted to a given data set, the one whose phenomenological basis was closest to the dominant transfer mechanisms observed almost always yielded the best data fit. The dominant mechanism was very dependent on the type of metal ground, its particle size and shape, the grinding intensity generated by the tumbling mill and the presence of a hard, brittle phase. Flattening, responsible for the transfer to coarser size classes, generally dominated over folding, the mechanism accountable for the transfer to finer size classes (other than breakage). Breakage was favoured over flattening and folding when grinding finer and softer particles,in a high impact environment, or in the presence of a hard, brittle mineral phase. Loss of weight due to smearing significantly increased when grinding a softer mineral in a mill with a rough inner shell, or when particle breakage took place. A methodology based on the Laboratory Knelson Concentrator was developed and tested to estimate the breakage function and gravity recoverability of gold flakes. Progeny from the breakage of gold particles was shown to be highly gravity recoverable, more than 90% above 0.025 mm. The breakage function was non-normalizable, with a large b$ sb{ rm i+1,i}$ component, because of folding.</description><creator>Noaparast, Mohammad</creator><contributor>Laplante, Andre R.

The dada language of the two drama-manifestoes tends to adopt a syllabic writing which defines itself as a sonorousness free of syntaxico-semantic contingencies. The writing in Coeur a Gaz is more graphic in that it defines linear writing in terms of its inscription in a bidimensional frame (list, table) which caracterizes theatre in itself. And while Mouchoir de Nuages adhers more closely to dramatic writing of a metadiscursive nature, the apparent linearity of the writing of this drama leads to the subversion of the stage writing (scenography) and therefore of theatre itelf. In the second part of our thesis we study the question of language reception, indispensable for the understanding of the Dada phenomenon in particular and theatrical in general. The aleatory vocality La Premiere Aventure Celeste de Monsieur Antipyrine provoked a violent reception by the historical spectator of 1920, whose esthetic parameters (horizon of expectation) are analyzed. Insofar as Coeur a Gaz is concerned the performance of 1923 consecrated the rupture of Andre Breton with the Dada group and led to the birth of the surrealist movement. Finally, the revolutionary scenographic work of Mouchoir de Nuages radically modifies the scenic perception of the spectator and announces the pluralist art of the twentieth century.</description><description>This doctoral thesis analyzes the plays of Tristan Tzara, specifically La Premiere Aventure Celeste de Monsieur Antipyrine (1920), La Deuxieme Aventure Celeste de Monsieur Antipyrine (1920), Coeur a Gaz (1921) et Mouchoir de Nuages (1924).</description><creator>Papachristos, Katherine</creator><contributor>Lane-Mercier, Gillian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Tzara, Tristan, 1896-1963 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Le théâtre de Tristan Tzara : le passage de l'oralité à l'écriture</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848s14z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956h49b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rf55z943b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates chain formation processes in syntax within the general framework of the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1993, 1994, 1995), where comparison among derivations plays a central role. It is primarily concerned with interactions between Grammatical Function changing (Baker 1988a) and wh-movement. Constructions such as antipassive, applicative, and Object Preposing: (special "passive") from typologically different languages are examined together with their implications for extraction. On a theoretical level this thesis proposes a modification of the notion of reference set (Chomsky 1994, 1995), which fixes the domain of comparison for the purpose of economy. In particular, the notion of reference set is defined in terms of non-distinctness of numerations; this in turn is sensitive to the Interpretability of features (Chomsky 1995). It is also argued that the Minimal Link Condition is an economy condition that elects among convergent derivations on the basis of the notion of chain link comparability. The system advanced here, in combination with some independently motivated Minimalist assumptions, explains phenomena which have so far defied a unified account, thereby providing important empirical support for the leading ideas of the Minimalist Program.</description><creator>Nakamura, Masanori, 1966-</creator><contributor>Baker, Mark (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Syntax</subject><subject>Minimalist theory (Linguistics)</subject><title>Economy of chain formation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d824c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z943b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9s161778b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Colonialism in twentieth century Canada has operated as a totalizing discourse, administered not by the force of a colonizing power, but by the mimicry of descendants from the constructed British imperial centre. These anglo-celtic descendants built a colonial identity that in its ideal manifestation asserted universal dominance and control, demanding that all difference assimilate or cease to exist. The Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire (IODE), a Canadian women's patriotic organization formed in 1900 and still in existence, is used to represent this colonial identity; a hegemonic process that was constantly changing, and produced in a recursive relationship to the threats and resistance that, at specific moments, challenged its composition. Tracing the historical/cultural geography of the IODE reveals the shifting focus of Canadian identity from imperial space to national space. This shift was produced in a multiplicity of geographic locations that offer a complicated challenge to theories of 'public' and 'private', of masculine and feminine and the 'everyday' and the 'theoretical'. Archival sources from across Canada, interviews with members of the IODE provide the primary sources.</description><creator>Pickles, Catherine Gillian</creator><contributor>Kobayashi, Audrey (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Canada -- Social conditions -- 20th century</subject><subject>Canada -- History -- 20th century</subject><subject>Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire</subject><title>Representing twentieth century Canadian colonial identity : the Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire (IODE)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cc46x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161778b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:td96k421x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase activities from the human trifunctional dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase/synthetase are proposed to share a single active site. Binding studies reveal that a single tetrahydrofolate binding site exists in the domain and therefore the two activities share a single substrate binding site. As well, a single high affinity NADP-binding site was shown to exist in the domain, where NADP acts both as a substrate of the dehydrogenase and as a partial inhibitor of the cyclohydrolase, at the common active site. The 2$ sp prime$-phosphate of the $2 sp prime ,5 sp prime$-ADP moiety of NADP provides most of the affinity of this ligand for the enzyme. The presence of the 5$ sp prime$-phosphate results in methylenetetrahydrofolate binding cooperativity and activation of the cyclohydrolase. A new kinetic mechanism and the overall equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase were determined. They are consistent with the proposal that the bifunctional nature of the domain is used to optimize the efficiency of the reverse reactions in vivo. A side-reaction of the cyclohydrolase was identified and a scheme developed for enzymatic synthesis of (6S) -5-formyltetrahydrofolate.</description><creator>Pelletier, Joelle N.

The overall study can be divided into three different parts. The first part explores the validity of the distributional similarity of the rainfall time series aggregated at different time scales. Based on the theory of multiplicative cascade process, a scale independent mathematical model has been proposed to describe the probability distributions of rainfall time series aggregated at different time scales. It has been demonstrated that the multifractal formalism can be used to estimate the probability distribution of rainfalls for a wide range of space and time scales. The second part of the research deals with the estimation of floods at an ungauged site using regional physiographic and climatic variables. To this end, a detailed study was carried out to determine the best technique for estimating the parameters of the commonly used power-form flood regionalization model, and to identify the minimum number of physiographic and hydrometeorological variables which should be included in the model. The study was further elaborated by applying the linear and nonlinear covariance structural models. Results of a numerical example using hydrologic data from Quebec and Ontario have indicated the superior performance of the nonlinear optimization method. Further, it was found that the significant variables which should be considered in the estimation of floods, are the area of the basin, the basin slope and the total precipitation five days before the flood for Quebec, and the area of the basin, the area of forests, lakes, and marses and the slope of the main channel for Ontario. The third part of the study proposed a new method of flood estimation based on the scaling of the statistical moments of the regional flood series with the basin area. Analysis of the physiographic and hydrologic data from Quebec and Ontario showed that the non-central moments of order from one to six are scaling with the basin area. This empirical evidence was used in defining the hydrologically similar basins (i.e., homogeneous flood regions), and in selecting a suitable regional distribution function for the estimation of flood quantiles. It was observed that the grouping of homogeneous basins as proposed in this study formed well-defined geographical regions with distinct climatic characteristics. Further, it was recommended that the selection of regional probability distribution and the corresponding parameter estimation method should be made such that the scaling properties of the flood series were preserved. The improved estimates of the statistical moments and flood quantiles for unguaged sites have indicated the superiority of the proposed approach as compared to those values given by existing methods.</description><creator>Pandey, Ganesh Raj</creator><contributor>Nguyen, U-T-V.

However, though access to services has broadened, the general condition of infrastructure is poor, and the quality of service has deteriorated. Water services is a good example of this problematique. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a demand-oriented perspective on water provision for domestic users. The thesis examines cost recovery potential based on household willingness to pay more for an improved service and water pricing. Also, factors contributing to rising provision costs are explored, with the aim of formulating prescriptions for demand management and lowered costs. The thesis also focuses on institutional strengthening scenarios which achieve a demand orientation in water delivery. To this end, competition in the provision of water services and the regulation of service providers are examined. A case study of domestic users in Trinidad was undertaken. Households in the main urban area were surveyed to test willingness to pay for water improvements using a questionnaire which incorporated three methodologies; contingent ranking, contingent valuation and the household production function. The household production function examined the revealed preference of consumers, whereas the contingent ranking and contingent valuation considered the stated preference for different features of the water service. The survey found that most consumers were willing to pay more than twice the current price of water, contingent upon a guaranteed improvement in service, particularly reliability. The main factors influencing willingness to pay were household income, the price of water, number of service hours, and housing and land tenure. The results indicate that while the potential for cost recovery does exist, formulating demand-oriented water policies with a focus on improved reliability is necessary. Extensive interviews were also conducted with professionals from both local and international agencies involved in the water sector, to elicit their perspectives on the problems of water agencies and possible solutions. There is a consensus among sector professionals that water agencies should emphasize improvements in operational performance, system maintenance and rehabilitation, and quality and reliability of service, instead of increases in capacity through new investments. Professionals took the common position that institutional capacity building was needed to achieve these results.</description><creator>Mycoo, Michelle</creator><contributor>Wolfe, Jeanne M.

If detected early, melanoma lesions can be surgically removed with wide excisional margins resulting in high cure rates. However, as the melanoma invades the deep layers of the skin at the primary site and subsequently metastasizes to the regional and distant nodes, the prognosis for the patient becomes progressively worse. As the melanocytic lesion progresses from a benign nevus to a highly malignant metastatic melanoma, it undergoes changes in protein expression which may be relevant to melanoma development. Among the proteins found to be upregulated during melanoma progression are the vitronectin adhesion receptor $ alpha sb{ rm v} beta sb3$ and the receptor for the proteolytic enzyme urokinase plasminogen activator (uPAR). The present work describes our results with two new animal models of human melanoma which were developed to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in lymphatic metastasis of this disease. Each model consisted of two cell lines with different metastatic abilities. Using these models, a correlation was found between the adhesion of the melanoma cells to cryostat sections of human lymph nodes and their metastatic ability in nude mice. When compared to the parent cells, the lymph-node metastasizing melanoma cells were found to express increased levels of the cell surface vitronectin receptor (VNR) $ alpha sb{ rm v} beta sb3$ which was utilized to mediate the increased adhesion to lymph node. In addition to the VNR, the metastatic cells also expressed increased levels of the uPAR. To study the relationship between expression of these two receptors, $ alpha sb{ rm v}$ expression was suppressed with $ alpha sb{ rm v}$ antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. In the antisense-treated cells a 9-fold reduction in $ alpha sb{ rm v}$ mRNA was seen with a corresponding 2.8-fold decrease in adhesion to vitronectin In a parallel study, a model of human breast carcinoma was used to study the role of cell adhesion in breast carcinoma metastasis. A correlation was observed between cell adhesion to frozen sections of human lymph modes and metastasis in vivo. However, unlike the melanoma cells, the metastatic breast carcinoma cells were found to utilize receptors $ alpha sb3 beta sb1$ and $ alpha sb5 beta sb1$ to adhere to lymph node fibronectin suggesting that different adhesion receptors may be involved in lymph node metastasis of different malignancies.</description><creator>Nip, John S.</creator><contributor>Brodt, Pnina (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>The role of the vitronectin receptor avb3, in melanoma invasion and metastasis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w6418.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634542k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1r66j2757</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Formiminotetrahydrofolate:glutamate formiminotransferase (EC 2.1.2.5) - formiminotetrahydrofolate cyclodeaminase (EC 4.3.1.4) is a bifunctional enzyme arranged as a circular tetramer of dimers that exhibits the ability to efficiently channel polyglutamylated folate between catalytic sites. A novel, full-length cDNA clone encoding the porcine liver formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase was isolated and inserted into a prokaryotic expression vector. The recombinant enzyme is expressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli and was purified to homogeneity using a multistep scheme. Deletion analysis of the cDNA indicated that each subunit consists of an N-terminal transferase-active domain and a C-terminal deaminase-active domain separated by a short linker sequence. These domains were expressed in Escherichia coli and demonstrated to exist as monofunctional dimers. This provides direct evidence for the existence of two types of subunit interfaces and suggests that both catalytic activities are dependent on the formation of specific subunit interfaces. Because channelling is not observed between isolated domains, only the octamer appears able to directly transfer pentaglutamylated intermediate between active sites. Thus we have established direct support for Findlay and MacKenzie's model (Findlay, W. A. &amp; MacKenzie, R. E. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 1948-1954) that the octamer is the functional unit of the enzyme. The purified dimers show no tendency to associate, suggesting that the linker mediates the only substantial domain-domain interaction. The isolated domains and the full-length enzyme were subjected to urea-induced denaturation in order to characterize the properties of both domains in and outside of the octamer. At low concentrations of urea, both domains undergo a cooperative loss of fluorescence and activity, while maintaining their secondary structure and the majority of their quatenary structure.

By the early twentieth century the system of handling offenders in Montreal was highly institutionalized and based on sex- and age-specific treatment involving the Catholic Church, civic and legal authorities, and Protestant reform organizations. A thematic study of the relationship of female offenders, concerned organizations, and the criminal justice system at the height of industrial capitalism shows that as the economy expanded and the city grew, there were increasing opportunities for women to break the law. Women's crimes were largely determined by their socio-economic status in Canadian society, often crimes of poverty and survival. The growing potential to commit crime was met with a more organized and institutionalized response and the definition of what was considered wayward female behaviour broadened. The growth of the state over the latter part of the nineteenth century in the form of new and expanded juridical and penal structures resulted in an increase in disciplining the population. For women this meant the use of laws and institutions to punish inappropriate social and sexual behaviour. This thesis explores the gender-specific treatment of female offenders in the new institutions created ostensibly to rescue them: Fullum Street Prison for Women, the Ecole de Reforme, the Girls' Cottage Industrial School, the Juvenile Delinquents' Court, and the female police force. It looks at the construction of "criminal" and "bad" and the flexible usage of certain laws to curb unruly behaviour.</description><creator>Myers, Tamara</creator><contributor>Levesque, Andree (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Women -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Female offenders -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Montréal (Québec) -- Social conditions -- History</subject><subject>Criminal law -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History</subject><title>Criminal women and bad girls : regulation and punishment in Montreal, 1890-1930</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gx756.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881n54v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:736666137</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:43:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In a survey conducted in Zimbabwe in 1993, waterhyacinth was present in seven out of the eight provinces. No control measures were imposed on 35% of the infested dams and 61% of the infested rivers, while in 47% of the infested dams and 11% of the infested rivers control of waterhyacinth was being attempted with a combination of 2,4-D and mechanical control methods. The population of Neochetina eichhorniae and N. bruchi declined during the period 1993 to 1995 in the Hunyani River system. Several fungi were isolated from diseased waterhyacinth, and Fusarium moniliforme (isolate 2ex 12), F. solani (isolates 5a ex25 and 2a3), and F. pallidoroseum (isolate 3ex1) were found to be the most pathogenic. Large numbers of viable conidia were produced in shake-flask liquid fermentation with modified Richard's medium and in solid fermentation with food grains. Conidia production in straw was poor with the exception of waterhyacinth straw. Host range studies conducted in pots and in the field indicated that Commelina benghalensis was moderately susceptible to both isolates of F. solani in the field, while Setaria verticilata grown in pots was moderately susceptible to isolate 2a3. Brassica rapa and Crotalaria juncea grown in pots were moderately susceptible to F. moniliforme but they showed no infection in the field. Fifty-nine additional plant species of ecological and agricultural importance were not susceptible to the Fusarium species. When F. solani, F. pallidoroseum and Neochetina spp. were used individually in ponds, they did not control waterhyacinth. When the fungi were combined with Neochetina spp., the area covered by waterhyacinth and the volume of waterhyacinth were significantly reduced.</description><creator>Mpofu, Bellah</creator><contributor>Watson, A.

In Study 1, longitudinal diary data from a community sample of 62 women showed that women's contraceptive behavior in ongoing sexual relationships was quadratically associated with sexual attitude. Study 2 showed that contraceptive behavior in initial and ongoing sexual encounters differed significantly in a sample of 52 university women. In initial encounters there was a greater reliance on condoms and a greater risk of unprotected intercourse. Studies 3, 4 and 5 used a person perception paradigm to examine women's perceptions of a female contraceptive provider in an initial sexual encounter. In Study 3, 57 women rated a female condom provider in a casual encounter as less nice, less socially acceptable, and her behavior as less appropriate than when her partner provided a condom. However, the target was rated as less wise if she had unprotected intercourse. In Study 4 (N = 249), a pill condition was added and the influence of sexual attitudes was assessed. Relative to when her partner provided a condom, women rated the target as less wise and less nice if she was on the pill, but they rated her as more wise when she provided a condom. Negative sexual attitudes were associated with more negative reactions but generally did not interact with contraceptive condition. In Study 5, 96 women rated the target as a function of who provided a condom (her vs. him) and four properties of the romantic relationship. Providing a condom did not result in negative evaluations in a committed relationship. In a non-committed relationship, when the woman provided a condom she was perceived as less nice but more wise. Furthermore, women used intimacy as a cue for commitment, but did not perceive intimacy alone as adequate justification for intercourse.

By re-examining the early critical reception of these works in connection with current theories of cultural reproduction, we can develop a new understanding of how metaphysicality undermines, in particular, an ideology of "natural" desire and identity. Focussing on desire, metaphysical authors produce a dissident knowledge of the cultural contingencies of normative thought, identity, and behaviour. Taking a philosophical approach to the subject, Edward Herbert reveals the impact of personal desires on the development of mental concepts. Christopher Marlowe, meanwhile, demonstrates the way definitions of natural gender identity inhibit sexual expression between men. Elaborating on women's same-sex desire, John Donne and Andrew Marvell contest heteronormative narratives of growth, while Aemilia Lanyer offers a vision of love between women as a homoerotic state of grace and alternative to men's violence. In his thoughts on martyrdom and political allegiance, Donne denaturalizes absolute authority and carves a space for liberty of conscience, an endeavour that corresponds to the desire for personal freedom that each of the other writers also expresses.</description><creator>Holmes, Michael M.

This process, which connects events at the domestic and international levels, also has been referred to as conflict linkage, conflict and cohesion, diversion and projection. The diverse terminology is fitting, because the pursuit by national elites of internal cohesion through external conflict is anything but a matter of consensus among scholars. The present investigation will seek a more precise delineation of causes and effects. Following a review of the research program on conflict linkage, a reformulated model of externalization will be presented. Propositions will be derived from the model. Data pertaining to the experiences of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France at the domestic level and in international crises during the post-World War II era will be used to evaluate the propositions. These results will be in turn compared to the more traditional explanation on the causes of international conflict; namely, theories derived from the Realist perspective. The study then concludes with some recommendations for further research on the linkage of domestic and foreign conflict.</description><creator>Hristoulas, Athanasios</creator><contributor>Paul, T. V.

The dimers were incorporated into normal strands of DNA by solid phase synthesis. Thermal denaturation studies, using complementary single-stranded RNA, indicated that these modifications caused no destabilization of the DNA-RNA duplex. The block synthesis of amide-linked homotetramer 30 is described. The synthesis of the corresponding octamer could not be verified because of lack of solubility. One by one homologation was found to be a suitable method for the preparation of N-methylamide analogues. Poly(ethylene glycol), covalently attached to the 3$ sp prime$ or 5$ sp prime$ end of amide-backbone thymidine homopolymers, was found to greatly increase their solubility.

Forces were applied using either a traveling microtube in which doublets were exposed to accelerating Poiseuille flow in 150 $ mu$m diameter tubes, or in a cone and plate Rheoscope which allowed virtually instantaneous application of Couette flow. Break-up was observed while tracking individual doublets under the microscope. Originally, the force was increased at a steady rate, and it was assumed that the doublets separate the instant a critical force to "break all crossbridges" was reached. Lack of clustering at discrete values of F$ rm sb{n}$, however, suggested that the scatter was due to the stochastic nature of intercellular bonds (Evans et al., Biophys. J. 59:838, 1991), a result confirmed by applying a constant shear rate and observing break-up at a distribution of times under a constant maximum F$ sb{n}.$ Using a stochastic model of break-up (Bell, Science 200:618, 1978) and a Poisson distribution for the number of bonds, break-up in Poiseuille and Couette flow was simulated. Studies using micropipette aspiration (Evans et al. Biophys. J. 59:838, 1991) and shear flow (Xia et al. Biophys. J. 66:1222, 1994), however, indicate that bond rupture occur through extraction of antigen from the cell membranes of SSRC. Accordingly, the Rheoscope experiments were repeated using latex microspheres with covalently coupled synthetic blood group B antigen. Comparison of the time and force dependence of break-up showed that antigen spheres required significantly higher forces to achieve the same degree of break-up. The computer simulation showed that the reduced sensitivity to force is due to a change in bond character and not to an increase in the number of bonds linking antigen sphere doublets. This is consistent with the anticipated increased force required to break antibody-antigen bonds compared with that required to extract a receptor from the membrane.</description><creator>Tees, David</creator><contributor>Zuckermann, M.

In response to this need, a general three dimensional nonlinear finite element model has been developed as part of this work and has been applied to the investigation of the meniscal responses when the joint itself is subjected to 3D complex loading. The geometry of the model has been obtained from the results of in vitro measurements performed on three adult human knee specimens. The method of measurements combination of computed tomography, a travelling dial gauge system, and a cutting procedure. The model's analysis accounts for both geometric and material nonlinearities, and is based on a representation of each meniscus as a composite of collagen fibers reinforcing matrix or ground substance. The sticking, sliding, and separation conditions at the meniscus-bone and at the ligament-bone interfaces have been treated as a general moving contact problem. The stress-strain relations, describing the materials of the meniscal matrix and fibers, have been derived from the results of elongation tests of more than 500 samples prepared from different zones and regions of human menisci. Similarly, the stress-strain relations, describing the materials of the major ligaments of the knee joint including transverse ligament, have been derived from elongation tests of bone-ligament-bone prepared from 10 human cadaveric knees. The model predictions have been validated by direct comparison with measurements, performed on human cadaveric knee as part of the present work and with the measurements reported in the literature. The responses of the menisci have then been determined and analyzed for a joint under a compressive load alone, or combined with a tibial axial rotation, and a tibial anterior translation. The stress strain results have been correlated with the meniscal injuries reported clinically. Furthermore, an injury mechanism for the meniscal tears has been proposed and the supporting clinical evidence has been presented.</description><creator>Tissakht, Mustapha</creator><contributor>Ahmed, Abdul M.

The trifunctional NADP-dependent dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase-synthetase is localized in the cytoplasm whereas the bifunctional NAD-dependent dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase is expressed in mitochondria suggesting they play different metabolic roles. Insect tissues also express both proteins but when immortalized into cell lines, the trifunctional enzyme is not detectable and the bifunctional enzyme is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. The change in localization coupled with the observation that insect cell lines are not purine auxotrophs, indicate the NAD-dependent dehydrogenase now fulfills the role of interconverting one-carbon units when the NADP-dependent dehydrogenase is not present. The cDNA encoding the insect NADP-dependent trifunctional enzyme was cloned and Northern analysis revealed the gene is transcriptionally down-regulated n insect cell lines. The cytoplasmic localization of the NAD-dependent dehydrogenase in these cells appears to be due to the transcription of shortened mRNAs which translate into a protein lacking a mitochondrial targeting signal. Targeted disruption of the gene in embryonic stem cells showed the enzyme is not required for initiation of protein synthesis in mitochondria as was originally hypothesized, and raises new questions as to its metabolic role.</description><creator>Tremblay, Gilles B.</creator><contributor>Mackenzie, Robert E.

Milling Fe$ rm sb{67}Ti sb{33}$ leads to a single-phase amorphous alloy which absorbs hydrogen, in sharp contrast to the intermetallic compound of the same composition. The nanocrystalline samples on their part exhibit a narrowing of the miscibility gap and a reduction of the pressure of the absorption plateau. The change in absorption properties, which is due to the interaction between the nanocystals and the amorphous phase, is analyzed using a simplified model of the elastic stress.

Its western margin is defined, and exhibits a major re-entrant 25 km wide named the Shark Embayment. A Devonian paleoclimatic model suggests that the western margin was subjected to seasonal oceanic upwelling of nutrient-rich and oxygen-poor waters that influenced the development of the carbonate buildups. Lithostratigraphic units of the Fairholme Group are characterized in terms of a Rocky Mountain (RM) Conodont Zonation. In the western part of the study area, the Flume carbonate platform began to onlap the westernmost slope of the West Alberta Ridge (WAR) as early as latest Givetian time (norrisi Zone). To the east, the Flume platform did not onlap and begin to cover the crest of the WAR until the succeeding RM Zone 1. The overlying Upper Cairn Member (containing a unique coral biofacies) and Perdrix Formation range from the uppermost RM Zone 1 to Zone 4b. The Peechee Member is difficult to date, but is probably within Zones 5a to 5b; the overlying Grotto Member is no younger than Zone 5b. The Arcs Member is within Faunal Intervals (F.I.) 6-7, and the Ronde Member is within Faunal Interval 8 which includes the Frasnian-Famennian boundary near its top. The Mount Hawk ranges from Zone 4b/5a to F.I. 8. Stromatoporoids were widespread and abundant calcareous benthos living in shallow, tropical, oligotrophic, and agitated marine environments. Thirty-two species representing 5 different orders of stromatoporoids are recognized in this study; thirty-one species comprise a diverse fauna in the Cairn Formation. Five stromatoporoid assemblages are defined in the Flume and Upper Cairn succession, and are correlated with RM conodont zones. Stromatoporoids exhibit mostly domical, but also bulbous, laminar, and dendroid growth forms that were genetically prescribed and only slightly modified by environmental factors. Trace element geochemistry of Devonian stromatoporoids indicates that these sponges originally secreted a calcitic skeleton, in contrast to Ordovician stromatoporoids which secreted an aragonitic skeleton. Evidence suggest that Paleozoic stromatoporoids eventually developed into mixotrophic organisms enabling them to construct large carbonate buildups, but they were also vulnerable to the devastating effects of paleoceanic upwelling of nutrient-rich waters.</description><creator>Mallamo, Mark P.</creator><contributor>Stearn, Colin W.

The thesis is presented briefly in the first section. The second section provides a critical review of theories about children's early part-of-speech identifications. Section 3 presents a new theory of verb identification. I argue that learners initially identify members of a category, predicator, that subsumes verbs and adjectives. Predicators have argument structures. Learners identify a predicator through an inference that the word must take noun-phrase arguments because the phrase containing the word is interpreted into a nonseparable phenomenon--a property or relation that exists or occurs only by virtue of one or more individuals (i.e., the bearers of the property, or the participants in the relation), the referent(s) of the argument(s). Actions are prototypical of that which is nonseparable (being dependent for their realisation upon one or more participants), and so words for actions will usually be identified as predicators. This tendency will be augmented when an unfamiliar predicator appears in an utterance with its one or more noun-phrase arguments, and the noun phrases are interpretable (by the learner) into the one or more individuals that are the participants in an ongoing action (or other nonseparable phenomenon); under these conditions, the learner should readily divine that the novel word is a predicator and the noun phrases are its arguments. These conjectures form the nonseparability hypothesis. To identify verbs in particular, a learner must first discover a distinction between verbs and adjectives, where it exists in a language, through distributional analyses within phrases. Subsequently, details of syntax and morphology will reveal to the learner a predicator's subcategory (verb or adjective). Section 4 contains reviews of literatures that provide support, in varying degree, for the theor</description><creator>McPherson, Leslie M.

This functional analogy has been described during both T cell development and maturation, as well as during the activation of mature peripheral T lymphocytes. It has been demonstrated that the stringency for CD4/CD8 expression, and their ability to interact with MHC molecules during positive and negative selection, are comparable. Further, mAb mediated coaggregation of either CD4 or CD8 with TCR$ alpha beta$ enhances TCR$ alpha beta$ mediated responses in mature T cells to the same degree. These studies have suggested that both CD4 and CD8 need be juxtaposed with the antigen receptor complex in order to provide their positive functions. We have re-addressed the role of CD4 and CD8 during antigen receptor mediated T cell activation, and have characterized major distinctions between these two accessory activation molecules. Thus, while aggregation of membrane CD4 on primary CD4$ sp+$ lymph node T cells results in a 10-fold inhibition of DNA synthesis subsequently induced through TCR$ alpha beta,$ aggregation of CD8 on CD8$ sp+$ primary T cells has no effect. These results are correlated with the differential localization and activity of Lck in the two T cell lineages. Further, while membrane expression of the tyrosine specific phosphatase, CD45, predicates TCR$ alpha beta$ signalling both in CD4$ sp+$ and CD8$ sp+$ T cells, we present evidence indicating that the mechanism through which this phosphatase functions is distinct in the two T cell lineages. Taken together, the results presented demonstrate fundamental differences in the constraints placed on antigen receptor signalling in the two T cell lineages, which may reflect the distinct properties of CD4 and CD8 themselves, and/or lineage specific differences arising as a consequen</description><creator>Maroun, Christiane</creator><contributor>Julius, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Distinct mechanisms regulate antigen receptor mediated signalling in CD4+ and CD8+ primary T cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r265h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j9543</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kk91fn33j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:43:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cascade poly(aryl ether) containing aryl sulfide or aryl sulfone groups, and aryl fluoride terminal functionality, were synthesized. Four generations of the dendrimers were prepared. The divergent initiator core method was employed, using 4,4$ sp prime$-difluorodiphenyl sulfone, as the core precursor, and a relatively high molecular weight phenol as the monomer. The strategy is based on an activation/condensation sequence that involves oxidation of the aryl sulfide group and the displacement of the activated aryl halide moiety by a phenolate ion. The aryl halide was activated by a sulfone group formed by oxidation of a sulfide group. Optimum conditions for the condensation reaction utilized a very active metal carbonate, such as cesium carbonate, in conjunction with magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate which removes some of the fluoride ions formed. The phenolate was generated in situ from an organic carbonate, thus eliminating the usual dehydration step. NMR characterization indicated that the reactions were most quantitative and MALDI-TOF-MS confirmed those results up to the third generation. No reaction intermediates were detected. Imperfections in some molecules of the dendrimers, formed by reaction of the core precursors with an impurity present in the phenol, were also identified. Simultaneously, aryl halide-terminated and phenol-terminated hyperbranched poly(ether sulfone)s were prepared by the polycondensation of A$ sb2$B monomers via a one-pot approach. Syntheses were developed for all the new monomers required. The main advantage of this method is its simplicity, which allows rapid access to large amounts of hyperbranched polymers. Molecular weights and viscosities were controlled by the concentration of the monomer and temperature of the reaction. The best conditions were obtained when the condensation agent was a mixture of $ rm Cs sb2CO sb3$ and Mg(OH)$ sb2$ and the displaced halide was a fluoride.</description><creator>Martínez, Coromoto</creator><contributor>Hay, A.
