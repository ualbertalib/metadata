The equations of motion and the thermodynamic equation are reviewed, together with the formulation of the Sawyer-Bushby and Godson two-level models. The height data for eight standard pressure levels from 1000 mb to 100 mb for January 1956 were used to determine linear correlation among the various levels. The multiple regression equations, so determined, were tested against independent data in 1958. It is found that the two levels account for most of the contour height variance up to 300 mb. The degree of representation drops above 300 mb and is quite variable at 100 mb. The experiment suggests that two-level representation of the synoptic scale contour height patterns is adequate, up to the 300 mb level.</description><creator>Boville, Byron.

The search for geological structures favorable for the accumulation of natural gas and petroleum has made the determination of the stratigraphic horizons of individual exposures of this formation important. A paucity of outcrops in many areas, combined with a lack of variation in lithology throughout the formation, makes this difficult. so far the study of the mega-fossils of the Bearpaw formation has given little information which could be used to establish useful fossil zones. One of the main reasons for this has been that most fossil collecting has been done without observing carefully the horizon in which the fossils occurred.

Some archeologists would trace their origin to the area between the Elbe, the Vistula, and the Oder and Bug Rivers. Pressure from the neighbouring tribes forced the Slavs to migrate as early as 500 B.C. from the land of their birth into the basin of the Dniester and the Dnieper Rivers which is known today as the territory of the modern Ukraine.</description><creator>Zuk, Michael.</creator><contributor>Walsh, H.

The emphasis of chemical kinetics has been increasingly directed toward the study of reactions of free radicals with stable molecules and, more recently, with atoms and other free radicals. Steacie (7), in his treatise "Atomic and Free Radical Reactions" has made a comprehensive review of the voluminous literature on this subject up to 1954 and consequently the introduction to this thesis has been restricted to a review of those reactions directly related to the present study.</description><creator>Wright, Archibald.

These changes may include increases of the oviduct weight, liver weight, liver protein and liver lipid as well as of the levels of calcium, phosphorus, protein and lipid in the blood. There is some experimental evidence that these responses may be conditioned by the effects of the thyroid hormones. There is a somewhat more limited literature on the effects of the antithyroid agent, thiouracil, on estrogen-induced changes of serum calcium, serum protein, liver weight, liver protein and liver lipid.</description><creator>Wright, Leebert.

In most recent studies the variables have been three: composition of the solid phase, temperature, pressure of water in contact with the solid phase. In general the investigators have varied each of these three properties of the systems and have determined the shifts in mineral equilibria caused by each change. In nature, mineral assemblages are undoubtedly controlled by other r variables in addition to these three. The present paper is concerned with an attempt to determine experimentally whether changes in other physical conditions are reflected by changes in the minerals present at a given temperature.</description><creator>Wolofsky, Leib.</creator><contributor>Gill, J.

In order to achieve the most economical production of power by these methods a suitable combustion cycle must be used to transfer heat energy to useful mechanical or electrical work. The subject of this thesis, ignition delay, plays an important part in the combustion cycle. The practical problems still not completely solved add impetus to the research work in combustion.</description><creator>Winship, David. R.</creator><creator>Mordell, D.

The greatest incidence of frostbite has occurred among armed forces during military campaigns. Napolèon' s surgeon, Baron Larrey (101) encountered huge numbers of cold injuries in French troops during the retreat from Moscow. Lewis (108) is of the opinion that these were trench foot injuries, while Arena (5) refers to themas examples of true frostbite. During both World wars non-freezing wet cold injuries predominated.</description><creator>Wilson, William. E.</creator><contributor>Webster, D.

Although the processes that may occur in a discharge are of interest in the present work, the information available on the subject is largely empirical and qualitative and the theoretical treatment is far from complete. Nevertheless the descriptions given in the literature (2, 4, 5) of the dissociation processes resulting from electrical excitation are adequate for consideration of the problem at hand. Hydrogen atoms have been produced from molecular hydrogen in flow systems with continuous, condensed or high frequency electrodeless discharges.</description><creator>Wiles, David.

Numerous studies have been done but few, if any, conclusions based on sound evidence have been reached. The ovary has a life span shorter than that of the total organism, and concomitant with a decline in ovarian function undesirable physical and emotional disturbances may occur. Some features of human senescence are similar to those of the hypothyroid states for example, one sees in both diminished motor activity, impaired muscle strength, dryness or the skin, diminished cold tolerance, and falling of the hair.</description><creator>Wilansky, Douglas.
