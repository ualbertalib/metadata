For many years lead arsenate was used to control but gradually became less effective as the insect developed resistance (Hough, 1929). DDT, after its introduction in 1945, gave excellent control and is now the most widely used insecticide against the pest. Its use, however, has not been without some disadvantages, chief of which are an upsurge of phytophagus mites, and to a less extent other pests such as the red-banded leafroller, due in large part to the destruction of natural enemies.</description><creator>Hikichi, Akira.</creator><contributor>Morrison, F.

In a vacuum it is stable, but in the presence of matter in any form, it readily combines with an ordinary negative electron, and the result is the complete disappearance of the mass of the pair and the emission of gamma rays of equivalent energy. This process is called annihilation and the radiation emitted is annihilation radiation. The emission of one photon is theoretically possible but can occur only in the presence of a very strong external field or very near a nucleus.

However, a more sensitive device is realized if three regions are used alternately n,p,n. The npn structure, a phototransistor, provides a current approximately fifty times greater than that obtained from a pn photodiode illuminated by the same light source. Several of these npn units were constructed and the performance of each as a two-terminal phototransistor was evaluated.</description><creator>Goldie, Hugh. J.</creator><contributor>Farnell, G.

Aeromagnetic anomalies were checked and geological mapping of these anomalies was carried out in the area surrounding Pegma Lake. This thesis is concerned with the general geology and petrology of the rocks in the claim group.

Reconnaissance work was carried out by four field parties that were "spotted" at various locations during the summer, and by a helicopter party. One of the field groups was headed by the writer. The interval between traverses was from one-half to one mile. A study was made of thin sections cut from specimens collected by these parties and a description of these sections is the chief contribution of this thesis.</description><creator>Gillett, Laurie.

As a result, a large number of helminths, other than schistosomes, was collected and some were forwarded to the Institute of Parasitology at Macdonald College for identification. This thesis deals with the classification of those nematodes collected from Carnivora. It is hoped that eventually a complete host list for all the parasites obtained in the area will be published.</description><creator>Gibbs, Harold. C.</creator><contributor>Cameron, T.

Most of them feed on plants and grains but some occasionally feed on other insects. Several species of crickets overwinter as eggs, laid generally in the moist ground or vegetation, while others in tropical climates pass the winter either as nymphs of late instars, or as adults. They are among the most familiar insects. In Italy and North Africa crickets, which are best known for the musical sounds made by the male, are kept in cages tor the sake of their notes.</description><creator>Ghouri, Ahmad.

The compounds: 2-amino-4-pyridinecarboxylic acid, 2-amino-6-pyridinecarboxylic acid, 4-amino-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid and 4-amino-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid have been prepared by permanganate oxidation of the corresponding acetamidopicolines. Further, 2-amino-4-pyridinecarboxylic acid bas been also obtained by the reduction of 2-nitro-4-pyridinecarboxylic acid with iron powder and 20% acetic acid.</description><creator>Gantchev, Neno.</creator><contributor>Taurins, A.

An important case is that in which the prescribed field is the field of complex numbers. The theory was originated by Frobenius. His most important results were again found independently by Burnside who gave a number of important applications of the theory as well as its classical treatment.</description><creator>French, Betty.
