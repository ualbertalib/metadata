Total exposure times of more than 200 hours above 10,000 feet, with more than half being above 15*000 feet, were achieved, Microscopic examination of the plates disclosed a large number of nuclear disintegrations produced by cosmic rays. Detailed study of thèse disintegrations revealed several types not previously reported. Mesons were observed which produced at the end of their range a single proton, a single alpha particle, or one or more of each, and in one case, a secondary meson. Mesons were found among the particles of nuclear disintegrations. Other phenomena included the fast neutron disintegration of boron, the éjection of an alpha and a proton from nuclei, a "star" of 26 particles, and proton tracks with energies greater than 40 mev.</description><creator>Morrison, Wesley Adair.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

This cross-linking reaction was thought to be due principally to the presence of unsaturation in the polymer, but there did seem to exist the possibility that even saturated hydro carbon chains might undergo similar cross-linking under certain conditions. Consequently, it seemed worth while to determine whether such a reaction might be induced to occur between saturated polymer molecules in solution in the absence of the monomer when a catalyst capable of producing free radicals is present.

None of these methods, with the exception of loss in ignition in case of certain types of soils, gives an absolute measure of the organic matter content.

This is evidenced by the development of special thoracic branches of medicine and surgery and the publication of periodicals devoted solely to these fields of medical science. A natural result of the increased clinical importance of the lungs has been a focusing of attention on the anatomy of these organs, but, in spite of this, little attention has been given to the possible significance of their lobation. It is surprising that this should be so, as pleuritic fusion of the pulmonary lobes is not an uncommon occurrence. It would be of practical interest to know whether the existence of these lobes has any significance, and, if so, what effect their fusion has on the function of the lungs.

In the present search two types of oscillating electron beam sources have been tried. One employs a hot filament cathode, the other a cold cathode. The hot filament source appeared to be very promising at the time. An ion output of 2 mA, containing an estimated 50% of atomic ions, was obtained from it. Difficulties such as contamination by evaporation from the filaments, a tendency toward instability, and a cathode life of only 1-2 days were observed.

Ana similarly, if one is more immediately concerned with the understanding and prevention or amelioration of human disease, there are few diseases that are of more pressing social and economic importance at the present time. Arteriosclerosis and its accepted sequelae have come to constitute tne major cause of death in the more civilized parts of the world.

Although much information has been obtained during the course of these varied investigations it is readily apparent that no all-embracing explanation of these lesions has been agreed upon, nor, as yet, has a theory been formulated which will successfully withstand criticism. This, in itself, suggests two chief possibilities. Firstly - that there is no single explanation of "peptic" ulcer. It may be a condition, the result of many factors, with now one, and then another, predominantly responsible. Secondly - that more factors remain to be brought to light in the future, one of which may be proven to be of paramount importance in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer, with the presently-recognised factors secondary to or synergic with it.

Results indicate that in freezing vegetables the slower the speed, the larger are the ice crystals formed. It has been shown that ice forms in and around water conducting vessels to a greater extent than in neighbouring areas of undifferentiated parenchyma cells Injury to tissues is caused by the mechanical action of ice formation both intracellularly and extracellularly.

The first includes all methods in which a magnetic field is used to bend the particles during acceleration into spiral or circular orbits; in the second are all systems in which the particles are accelerated along straight paths.We shall be concerned here chiefly with the principal accelerators in the first class. The theoretical problems concerned with the stability of the orbital motion ere investigated. Account is also taken of the effects on the motion of loss of energy through radiation.

The parts are: esophagus, stomach, small and large Intestine. The esophagus or gullet is, with the exception of pylorus, the narrowest and one of the most muscular parts of the whole alimentary tract. In the neck anteriorly lies the trachea and in the groove at each side, between the trachea and esophagus, the recurrent laryngeal nerve ascends to the larynx.[...]</description><creator>Li-Liang, DSO.</creator><contributor>Hoff, H.

It is found that the cutting relationships reported afford positive evidence of at least four sequences of "diabase" intrusion. Except for degree of alteration, the sequences resemble each other so closely that positive age correlation on a petrographical basis is precluded. The dykes have predominant north west, north-south, and north a act trends. The writer concludes thab structural evidence suggests" the hypothesis that the dykes are emplaced in fissures which began opening in the crust above a basaltic substratum, along lines of weakness striking approximately north west, north-south, pnd north east, during stretching of the crust; and that surface trends have been modified somewhat by diversion of the magma into some pre-existing local fissures.</description><creator>L’Espérance, R.
