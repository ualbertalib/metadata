Membership has been extended from time to time, formally or only de facto, to countries outside the political framework of the Commonwealth as well. In its technical aspects this monetary union can be described as an association of the United Kingdom with certain countries whose trade is financed mainly in sterling and whose reserves are mainly held in sterling (underlined by the writer, ref (1) p. VIII ). Some basic characteristics such as trade financing mainly in sterling and holding of members’ reserves in sterling have been substantially present throughout the life of the old British Empire.</description><creator>Petrogiannis, Demetrios.

The phase plotter operates at 9.3 Kmc/s and measures phase and intensity of a field continuously along chosen scanning lines. The phase measurement is essentially independent of intensity variations of up to 40 db and the follow-up response during automatic operation is over 90° per second. The accuracy is + 5° in automatic operation and + 2° when operated manually. The system's operation depends on the Homodyne technique. Automatic operation is made possible by the development of a novel modulator using ferrite microwave components.</description><creator>Pavlasek, Tomas. J.</creator><contributor>Howes, F.

Because of the solubility of silicates of alkali metals a considerable quantity of silicon is absorbed by plants and variable amounts are ingested with plants by animals. Of the amount ingested a small proportion gains an entrance into the body and is distributed in all tissues. The question which has been entertained by many workers is whether silicon is an essential element in animal metabolism.

Its composition and function is most complex. Volumes have been written on various aspects of the biliary tract and bile. One of the most complexing problems has been that of partial biliary obstruction. We are all only too familiar with the clinical course of the “acquired biliary stricture,” and the “post-cholecystectomy syndrome” which result from an impairment of biliary outflow. Because of the rather confusing clinical picture that such conditions present and the difficulty encountered in attempting to follow these cases in a serial fashion, it was felt that an experimental study incorporating well established liver function tests, pathological and bacteriological methods should be attempted.</description><creator>Murphy, Frederick.

(2) A zone of high resistance between 30 and 50 mm. has been demonstrated with larvae and adults of Tenebroides mauritanicus (L.). Resistance in this zone is related to the effects of reduced pressure and is connected in some way with reduction of the visible activity of the insects at these pressures. The response in this zone is apparently independant of humidity. (3) It has been shown that at pressures lower than the zone of high resistance the mortality of T. mauritanicus is due more to dessication than to the action of the fumigant.</description><creator>Monro, Hector.

It is one of the most important seeded legumes used in the province of Quebec, in both hay and pasture mixtures. Breeding work with red clover began early in the twentieth century, and Steppler (1955) reported that work of this nature was initiated at Macdonald Collage in 1911. Red clover is a cross-pollinated species and is entomophilous. It is highly self-incompatible, as determined by a series of s-alleles through which the plants are maintained in a constant state or heterozygosity.</description><creator>Mittelholzer, Alexander.

The Nusselt Numbers for the evaporating .drops were correlated by means of the equation proposed by Ranz and Marshall for stationary drops in a rnoving air flow. Values of the drag coefficients for the decelerating drops, over a range of Reynolds Numbers of 1 to lOO, were approximately one tenth of those predicted by the standard curve for spheres, and a dependance on the drop diameter was observed. Methods of measuring the physical properties of the water-air system were developed and tested with special attention devoted to the determination of drop velocities and air humidity.</description><creator>Manning, William.

We are still far from solving the problems of this serious disease as is evidenced by the continuous flood of papers. The greatest advance has been on the diagnostic front of myocardial infarction and its allied picture of coronary insufficiency. Practically all the schools of the world have contributed in the clinical study. The names of Parkinson, Bedford in England, Barnes, Whitten, Woolfirth, Wood, White, Levine, Wright, Levy, Master in the U.S.A. are closely associated with this work.</description><creator>Mahanti, Biresh.

As had been expected, a high correlation was found to exist between these two quantities although the form of the relationship (linear in the logarithms of the standard deviations of height and wind) was totally unexpected. The Arctic data from previous papers, concerned with the relationship between the time variances of height and wind, were then reanalysed and the relationship between them was found to be of the same form as for the space variances. In both cases the standard error of estimate was too large to be able to calculate accurately the wind variance from the height variance, but the relationships do allow climatological estimates of the mean kinetic energy and the size of the dominant wave systems.</description><creator>Macfarlane, Mona.

By definition this inhibition must be reversed by the metabolite. Ethionine is a synthetic compound which is structurally related to methionine in that it is formed by replacing the terminal methyl group of methionine by an ethyl group (Figure 1). Ethionine has been shown to be an antimetabolite to methionine in a number of biological systems involving animals and microorganisms (Martin, 1951; Wooley, 1952; Rabinovitz et al, 1954).</description><creator>Lowther, Ruth.

Pyrolusite is usually found mixed with ferric oxide, since both are deposited by atmospheric oxidation of their bicarbonates. It contains about 63 per cent manganese. Minerals of manganese are listed in Table I. The different ores of manganese may also be classified according to the fields in which they are used. This classification can be seen in Table II.</description><creator>Lemay, Henri. P.</creator><contributor>MacEwan, J.

The former is a biennial or short lived perennial with a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 14; the latter is a perennial with a tetraploid chromosome number of 2n = 28 and is thought to be an autotetraploid because it exhibits tetrasomic inheritance (Bubar, 1957). They are known to have incompatibility systems precluding close inbreeding and are almost completely self-sterile.

Every finite dimensional algebra A which contains a non-zero nilpotent ideal has a non-zero radical R, and A/R is semi-simple (has a zero radical) and contains a unit element. Every semi-simple algebra is uniquely expressible as a direct sum of a finite number of simple algebras, each with a unit element. In the infinite dimensional case the above structure theory still persists to some extent; that is, in certain cases a semisimple Banach algebra is a suitably generalized direct sum of suitably generalized matrix algebras.</description><creator>Laufer, Philip.
