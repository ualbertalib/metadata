Existing commercial systems for data acquisition and control have many shortcomings and behave in a non-deterministic manner. Determinism or predictability is a key element of high performance real-time systems which must always meet specific deadlines under tight synchronizations. In this thesis, a new approach to very high-performance predictable real-time acquisition and control is proposed, theoretically analyzed, implemented in hardware, and experimentally tested. The resulting system is highly adaptable and reconfigurable, and has been applied to a number of problem areas including micro-robot control via a high performance parallel computer architecture, and cardiac electropotential mapping. Indeed, the resulting cardiac mapping system is so far as we know, the highest resolution produced to date.</description><creator>Martel, Sylvain.</creator><contributor>Hunter, Ian W.

This breakdown is due to the appearance of the Bose-Einstein distribution which is singular in the low-momentum limit. In this thesis it is argued that an effective-Lagrangian approach can be used to restore perturbative calculability. To illustrate this point, the induced thermal mass of a scalar theory is computed to both one and two-loop order. It is shown that the results can be largely determined without the explicit evaluation of Feynman graphs. This technique is then used to calculate the finite-temperature effective potential in a scalar model with spontaneous symmetry breaking. One finds that the resummed expression for the effective potential is not valid in the region of parameter space where evidence of a first-order phase transition is observed. Therefore, contrary to some of the literature, one cannot conclude that this model exhibits a first-order phase transition.</description><creator>Marini, Alexander L.</creator><contributor>Burgess, C.

Secondary objectives are to study determinants of the occurrence of playground injuries, to estimate injury rates adjusted for exposure, and to do recommendations for prevention. To document circumstances of each injury, telephone interviews were completed with parents of children and a response rate of 90% was obtained. The objectives of this research required different study designs. The principal objective was achieved through a case-control study. In this study, logistic regressions were performed to study risk factors of serious (AIS3, n = 88) and moderate injuries (AIS2, n = 203), using minor injuries (AIS1, n = 348) as the reference category. One of our secondary objectives was to analyze risk factors for injury occurrence. For this, two additional case-control studies were performed. In the first study, cases related to playgrounds (n = 639) were compared with control children who had visited the emergency room for another type of injury (n = 1064). In the second study, characteristics of playgrounds where an injury occurred were compared with playgrounds with no injuries. Finally, qualitative analyses were conducted to describe the scenarios of the injury incidents. To prevent future incidents, the Canadian Standards on Children's Playspaces and Equipment were reviewed to identify playground elements associated with injuries. As they become older, boys tend to sustain more severe injuries than girls. Children who use playgrounds less frequently are at lower risk of being injured, however, when they are injured, the injuries are more severe. Approximately 75% of all playground injuries resulted from a fall. Injuries from falls are more severe than other types of injuries. Public playgrounds account for 71% of injuries and home playgrounds for 21%. Injuries sustained at public playgrounds are more severe than injuries at home, except among children aged 1 to 4. The rate of injury is higher on modules (combination of several types of equipment including swings, climbers and slides) and swings than on slides and climbers. However, injuries on slides are more severe. The odds of serious injuries are 2.1 times greater for a fall on grass compared to one on sand (CI: 1.08; 3.96). The height of the equipment also appears to be a risk factor for incidence and severity of injury. For all hospitals in Montreal during 1991, the average rate of emergency room visits for playground injuries among children aged 1 to 14 years is 397 per 100,000 children for the period May to September. Injury rates are higher for children under 10 years old and among boys. In conclusion, the findings regarding playground surfaces are the most important, and suggest that, under equipment, grass should be replaced by sand. This recommendation applies to both public and home playgrounds. Prevention programs should focus on ensuring that playgrounds are in compliance with Canadian Safety Standards and should include both public and home playgrounds.</description><creator>Laforest, Sophie.</creator><contributor>Robitaille, Yvonne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>Etude des facteurs de risque de la sévérité et de la survenue des traumatismes liés aux aires et appareils de jeu</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v452b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246t52f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xg94hr23t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:28:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Morphological and electrophysical properties of layer II neurons from the medial entorhinal cortex were investigated in a rat brain slice preparation to enhance our understanding of the role the entorhinal cortex plays in the gating of afferent stimuli to the hippocampal formation. Morphological characterization revealed that layer II projection neurons fell into two distinct categories. 65% of neurons were identified as the stellate cells described previously. The remaining 35% had, for the most, a pyramidal-like morphology, and were referred to as non-stellates. Electrophysiological characterization revealed that stellates and non-stellates had distinct electroresponsive properties. Notably, stellates, upon d.c. depolarization, generated subthreshold, sinusoidal-like, membrane potential oscillations at a mean frequency of 8.6 Hz and a 1-3 Hz repetitive bursting pattern, referred to as clustering. Non-stellates, when d.c. depolarized, never generated subthreshold oscillations nor spike clusters; instead they readily went into tonic firing. Investigation of the main ionic mechanisms endowing stellates and non-stellates with their differential electroresponsiveness revealed that stellates exclusively possessed a fast, low threshold, Ba$ sp{2+}$-sensitive outward rectifier, which, in interplay with the persistent Na$ sp+$ conductance, generated the membrane potential oscillations. The cholinergic agonist carbachol caused a depolarization in both stellates and non-stellates, associated with no change or a slight increase in apparent input resistance. In stellates, carbachol caused a decrease in the dominant frequency of the subthreshold membrane potential oscillations from 9.2 to 6.3 Hz. In non-stellates, carbachol transformed tonic firing into a slow voltage-dependent bursting discharge. Investigation of the ionic mechanisms of the carbachol-induced depolarization in stellates and non-stellates revealed that it resulted mainly from activation of a Ca$ sp{2+}$ dependent cationic conductance largely carried by Na$ sp+$, mediated predominantly through m1 muscarinic receptor subtype activation. Serotonin, in stellates, caused a variable response consisting of a hyperpolarization and/or depolarization, associated with a decrease in apparent input resistance, while in non-stellates, only the hyperpolarizing response was observed. In stellates, serotonin increased the frequency of subthreshold oscillations from 8.5 to 14.0 Hz. In non-stellates, serotonin did not affect spike-train adaptation nor the slow afterhyperpolarization following the train of spikes while it reduced both in stellates. These results attest to the presence, in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex, of two parallel information processing channels, both projecting to the hippocampal formation, and differentially modulated by the cholinergic and serotoninergic systems. One of these, the stellate channel, is endowed with robust rhythmic properties whose fundamental frequency can vary widely, depending on the relative tone of these two major neurotransmitter systems.</description><creator>Klink, Ruby.</creator><contributor>Alonso, Angel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Functional organization and neuromodulation of entorhinal cortex layer II neurons</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418p73t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr23t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kp78gh90g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:28:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The compilation of albums began almost upon the invention of photography and has continued to this day, migrating now into the realms of electronic and digital imagery. The private album, which includes, but is not limited to, the family album, is a hybrid of flexibility and conservatism--situational, syncretic and personal in its contents and organization. Interpretation of an album is correspondingly challenging, especially when the album has been separated from its compiler and placed in a public collection. The McCord Museum of Canadian History has a substantial collection of private albums ranging in date from the 1860s to the 1960s. The collection has been assembled mainly from private donations as a reflection of Canadian social history. Aside from its breadth, the collection offers the researcher a degree of assurance that the albums represent the work of amateur compilers. Bringing this collection to light and raising the museum's consciousness of the value of these objects as albums have been important aspects of this study. The primary focus, however, has been the discovery of an interpretational framework, a way of reconstituting the intentions and methods of the compiler. Albums have been interpreted as visual equivalents of analogous forms, such as journals or Family Bibles, but these categories fail to contain the full nature of compilatory expression which is often multiplistic, redundant, serpentine and obscure. The private album transferred to the public institution needs to be considered in the full context of its creation and presentation--the merging of visual and oral traditions. A multidisciplinary review of the literature outlines the paradigms and metaphors that inflect our understanding of photographic albums as tools of communication and sources for artists. The function of the album as an aide-memoire for individual life history has long been recognized, but the detailed application of orality's condition and structure to the photographic album is here an original contribution to knowledge. The reconciliation of photography and orality expands our understanding of both and restores the heuristic conversation that brought the photographic album into being.</description><creator>Langford, Martha.</creator><contributor>Glen, Thomas L.

Pattern matching provides a solid framework for identifying higher level abstractions that may be instances of predefined plans (commonly used algorithms and cliches), programming concepts, or abstract data types and operations. This thesis discusses two types of pattern-matching techniques developed for plan recognition in Program Understanding. The first type is based on Software Metrics and Dynamic Programming techniques that allow for statement-level comparison of feature vectors that characterize source code program statements. This type of pattern matching is used to identify similar code fragments, and code cloning, facilitating thus code modularization, code restructuring and efficient localization of the occurrence of similar programming errors. The second type addresses the problem of establishing correspondences, between a parse tree of a custom abstract description language developed (ACL) and the parse tree of the code. Matching of abstract representations and source code representations involves alignment that is again performed using a Dynamic Programming algorithm that compares feature vectors of abstract descriptions, and source code. The use of a statistical formalism allows a score (a probability) to be assigned to every match that is attempted. Incomplete or imperfect matching is also possible leaving to the software engineer the final decision on the similar candidates proposed by the matcher. The system has been implemented to analyze software systems written in PL/AS and C.</description><creator>Kontoyiannis, Konstantinos A.</creator><contributor>De Mori, Renato (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Pattern matching techniques for program understanding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zc66s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784n255</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3f4627001</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:28:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Benzodiazepines, one of the most frequently prescribed class of medications in the elderly population, are known to impair motor function and cognitive skills. The evidence based on laboratory and experimental driving studies reporting the performance impairing effects of benzodiazepines is very convincing. However epidemiologic studies of the association between benzodiazepine use and the risk of motor vehicle crashes are inconclusive. The primary objective of this thesis was to determine the risk of injurious motor vehicle crashes among elderly drivers following the initiation of treatment with long and short half-life benzodiazepines. We also sought to determine when, after initiating treatment, the risk of experiencing this adverse event became elevated, and whether there was a continued risk with prolonged use. The study was a nested case-control design within a cohort of 224,734 drivers from the province of Quebec, age 67 to 84, and followed from 1990 to 1993. The study outcome was involvement of a cohort member as a driver in a motor vehicle crash in which at least one victim (not necessarily the driver) sustained bodily injury. All 5,579 drivers involved in an injurious motor vehicle crash (cases) were identified from this cohort. A random sample of 10 subjects per case was selected as controls from a sub-cohort of 13,265 subjects. Study subjects were linked to the Quebec health insurance databases and a complete history of drugs dispensed was obtained. The rate ratio of crash involvement was estimated from logistic regression models controlling for demographic characteristics, a measure of health status, exposure to other central nervous system drugs and previous injurious crashes. For long half-life benzodiazepines, the adjusted rate ratio of crash involvement within the first week of treatment initiation was 1.45 (95% CI 1.04-2.03). The rate ratio for continuous use of longer duration up to one year was slightly lower, but remained significantly elevated (rate ratio 1.26; 95% CI 1.09-1.45). In contrast, there was no increased risk following the initiation of treatment with short half-life benzodiazepines (rate ratio 1.04; 95% CI 0.81-1.34), or with their continued use (rate ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.82-1.01). In conclusion, brief or extended periods of exposure to long half-life benzodiazepines are associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle crash involvement in the elderly population. There appears to be no such raised risk for short half-life benzodiazepines.</description><creator>Hemmelgarn, Brenda.</creator><contributor>Suissa, Samy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacy.</subject><subject>Gerontology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Benzodiazepine use and the risk of motor vehicle crashes in the elderly</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pr89k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f4627001</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c247dt56s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:28:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Based on an analysis of the causes of non-convergence in the effective heat capacity methods a new conservative effective heat capacity method is developed for general phase change heat transfer problems. Numerical experiments verified the accuracy and efficiency of the new method. A multi-layer phase change material (PCM) heat transfer module is proposed for latent heat energy storage. Cyclic heat transfer in the module was modelled using the finite element technique. A parametric study was performed to investigate the energy charge/discharge rates for the new design. A second-law thermodynamic analysis was carried out for thermal energy storage using multiple PCMs. The exergy efficiency of energy storage units using two, three as well as five different PCMs was analyzed and compared with that using a single PCM. A novel cone-cylinder design configuration is proposed for a shell-and-tube latent heat energy storage exchanger. A finite element model was developed to simulate the coupled convection and cyclic melting/freezing phase change heat transfer occurring outside the tube. The advantages of the new configuration are examined and discussed with the help of numerical experiments. Following the new design configuration a novel multi-exchanger energy storage system is proposed. Finite element simulation results validated and extended the thermodynamic analytical results. A new solar thermal storage unit using multiple PCMs was proposed and analyzed by a finite element model. A parametric study was carried out to investigate the advantages of the new design when compared with conventional single PCM designs. Finally, a finite element model for melting and freezing heat transfer including free convection in the melt region was developed. The streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin method was employed to enhance both the stability and accuracy of the numerical solution. Using this finite element model simulations were carried out for melting of a PCM in a rectangular cavity heated from below. Flow patterns and local heat flux distributions at the heating surface are presented and discussed. In addition, melting of a PCM in a rectangular cavity with an isothermal vertical wall was simulated. To enhance the heat transfer rate during the last stage of the melting process, inverting the PCM container is shown to be an effective technique; this idea was examined with a parametric study.</description><creator>Gong, Zhen-Xiang.</creator><contributor>Mujumdar, Arun S.

Its treatment and/or control with iron preparations in malaria endemic areas has, however, been implicated to increase host susceptibility to malaria infection. Scientific evidence accumulated to date remains equivocal about the presence of this increased susceptibility. The present work was planned to address the existing controversy by assessing the effect of oral iron supplementation on host susceptibility to malaria infection. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled field trial of oral ferrous sulphate supplementation in schoolchildren 5 to 14 years of age was carried out in northwest Ethiopia where transmission of malaria is high. A total of 500 school children, all with mild-to-moderate iron deficiency, were randomly assigned to receive either ferrous sulphate (60 mg elemental iron per day) or a look-alike placebo, over a period of 12 weeks. Follow-up continued for 24 weeks post-randomization. Children who received iron supplementation tended to develop more clinical attacks of malaria than those children who received placebo, although the difference between the groups was not statistically significant, either during the initial 12 week supplementation period (RR = 1.59; 95% CI: 0.92-2.75) or during the 24 weeks of follow-up (RR = 1.45; 95% CI: 0.95-2.20). Similarly, a trend of increased risk of malaria infection (parasitemia) was noted in the iron-supplemented group over the 24 week follow-up period (RR = 1.22; 95% CI: 0.98-1.52). No difference in any other outcome measure (spleen rate, average enlarged spleen index, and parasite density index) was observed between the groups either during the 12 weeks of supplementation or the 24 weeks of follow-up. This study suggests that iron supplementation, in areas where iron deficiency and malaria co-occur, may enhance host susceptibility to malaria infection. Thus, approaches to control or prevent iron deficiency anaemia in malaria endemic areas should be integrated with malaria control activities in order to minimize the unintended effects of malaria infection while providing the greatest benefit.</description><creator>Gebreselassie, Hailemichael.</creator><contributor>Gyorkos, Theresa W.

This dissertation develops a methodology for analyzing this movement by approaching theatre, not as a unified institution or a series of texts, but as a mode of cognition that can overcome another of the basic binary oppositions of modern Euroamerican thought, the opposition between mind and body. Following an introductory chapter that situates the Canadian popular theatre movement in the context of recent Canadian theatre history and of other popular theatre movements around the world, a theoretical chapter lays the foundation for this methodology by exploring such key terms as "community," "professional," and "theatrical." It suggests that theatre is a particularly appropriate cognitive tool for building participatory community in heterogeneous social milieus. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 analyze three stages in the popular theatre process in these terms. Chapter 3 looks at how methods of organizing community workshops put in place particular forms of community. Chapter 4 explores the ways in which the dramaturgic structures of plays created by Headlines Theatre, the Theatre Parminou, and Red Roots Community Theatre are formed both by their creation processes and by their analyses of the problems in the dominant public spheres of the larger society. Chapter 5 looks at the specific contribution professional theatre workers make in focusing audience attention on key elements in community participants' stories. The dissertation concludes by suggesting that popular theatre events can be most fairly evaluated by looking at their contribution to the creation of new categories of thought through which we might publicly discuss and enact truly participatory communities.</description><creator>Graham, Catherine (Catherine Elizabeth)</creator><contributor>Lieblein, Leanore (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Suvin, Darko (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Theater -- Canada.</subject><subject>Theater and society -- Canada.</subject><title>Dramaturgy and community-building in Canadian popular theatre : English Canadian, Québécois, and native approaches</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sk978.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311q89t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6t053h60m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:28:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes meningitis in infants. Located in the outer membrane, Hib porin (342 amino acids, M$ rm sb{r}$ 37,782 daltons) forms channels that allow for the diffusion into the periplasm of small solutes up to a molecular mass of 1400 daltons. Based on predictions of porin secondary structure, a model of Hib porin was generated. The model proposed sixteen membrane spanning $ beta$-strands connected by eight long loops on one side and eight short $ beta$-turns on the other side. To refine further this model, the epitopes of nine monoclonal antibodies specific for Hib porin were mapped precisely. Surface-exposure of these epitopes was determined by flow cytometry of intact Hib cells. Our studies identified two surface-exposed regions of Hib porin: amino acids 162 to 172, and 318 to 325. These two regions correspond to loops 4 and 8 in the Hib porin model. Three naturally occurring Hib porin variants were purified, reconstituted into planar bilayers, and analyzed for their voltage dependency. Substitutions at Arg166 residue, which is localized to loop 4, were associated with a lowered threshold potential for the voltage gating of Hib porin. This surface-exposed loop was therefore implicated in the conformational changes that are postulated to occur during voltage gating. Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) binds tightly to Hib porin. To generate large amounts of Hib porin devoid of LOS, the ompP2 gene was cloned into an expression vector of Bacillus subtilis. Recombinant Hib porin was produced in large quantities and it aggregated into inclusion bodies. Under denaturing conditions, recombinant porin was purified to homogeneity and subsequently refolded. To assess the fidelity of refolding of recombinant porin, four criteria were used: spectroscopic properties, channel formation in planar bilayers, resistance to trypsin digestion and formation of the conformational epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody Hb-2. We conclude that in the absence of LOS, recombinant porin was refolded into a functional form, its structure closely resembling the native state.</description><creator>Dahan, David.</creator><contributor>Coulton, J.

Merr.) is a subtropical legume that requires root zone temperatures (RZTs) in the 25 to 30$ sp circ$C range for optimal symbiotic activity. The inability of soybean to adapt to cool soil conditions limits its development and yield in short season areas. In particular, nodulation and N$ sb2$ fixation by this subtropical crop species is sensitive to cool (RZT). The objectives of this thesis were to determine whether or not PGPR could be used to help overcome the low RZT inhibition of soybean nodulation, to improve soybean nitrogen fixation and yield under field conditions and to determine the methods by which such increases occurred. The work reported in this thesis has demonstrated that PGPR can increase early season nodulation and total seasonal nitrogen fixation and yield of soybean growing in an area with cool spring soils. The ability of PGPR to stimulate soybean nodulation and growth was shown to be related to their ability to colonize soybean roots, and this was shown to be related to RZT. All steps in early nodulation were stimulated by the presence of PGPR. The beneficial effects of PGPR are exerted through a diffusible molecule excreted into the growth medium. The addition of genistein, a plant-to-bacteria signal molecule already shown to stimulate soybean N$ sb2$ fixation at low RZT, plus PGPR causes increases in soybean nodulation, N$ sb2$ fixation, and growth that were greater than those caused by the addition of PGPR alone, but only at 25 and 17.5$ sp circ$C, and not at 15$ sp circ$C RZT.</description><creator>Dashti, Narjes.</creator><contributor>Smith, D.

In some of these applications, it will be important to lessen the pro-oxidant effects of hemoglobin and potential free radical-mediated toxicity. This research introduces a novel modified hemoglobin that is based on intermolecularly crosslinking hemoglobin, superoxide dismutase and catalase (PolyHb-SOD-CAT) with the bifunctional agent, glutaraldehyde. Superoxide dismutase and catalase catalyze the breakdown of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide respectively. Studies of structural and functional parameters reveal that PolyHb-SOD-CAT retains superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymatic activity, and consists of a mixture of molecular species ranging in molecular size and protein composition. Circulation time studies of PolyHb-SOD-CAT in rats show that hemoglobin, superoxide dismutase and catalase possess longer circulatory half-lives as compared to the free forms of these proteins. Studies also show that PolyHb-SOD-CAT prevents the formation of methemoglobin, ferrylhemoglobin, hydroxyl radical, free iron, and lipid peroxidation. Ischemia-reperfusion studies using isolated perfused hindlimbs and intestine of rat show that PolyHb-SOD-CAT reduced the formation of hydroxyl radical compared to PolyHb. Altogether, these results suggest that PolyHb-SOD-CAT is a potentially safer modified hemoglobin oxygen carrier by virtue of its ability to detoxify reactive oxygen species, and reduced propensity to promote and participate in oxidative processes.</description><creator>D'Agnillo, Felice.</creator><contributor>Chang, T.

Previous research suggests that DLI subjects are atypical regarding word decomposition and word formation. Given these observations, two questions arise: What is the extent of DLI insensitivity to word-internal structure and to morpheme features? and Is this insensitivity equally evident in inflectional, derivational and compounding processes? Three experiments address these questions: plural formation, nominal compounding and diminutive formation and comprehension. These word formation processes are very productive Greek and are observed from (2;0) onwards in non-impaired children cross-linguistically. Nominal roots (bound) are mapped to other bound morphemes: inflectional affixes for plural formation, derivational affixes and inflectional affixes for diminutive formation, and lexical morphemes and inflectional affixes for compound formation. In this thesis, the performance of Greek DLI subjects was compared to that of non-impaired controls using elicited production and comprehension tasks that probed real and novel word formation. Results show that DLI children are not sensitive to morphological features and have difficulty knowing where root boundaries are. Given the atypical performance of DLI children, the initial hypothesis on the building of an atypical competence appears to be supported.</description><creator>Dalalakis, Jenny E.</creator><contributor>Piggott, G.

Later on, the observation that the typical opioid antagonist, naloxone, failed to antagonize some of these behavioral effects led to a reconsideration of the nature of $ sigma$ receptors. It was determined that although several $ sigma$ ligands displayed reasonable affinity for the phencyclidine (PCP) receptor and that their activation could mimic PCP "psychotomimetic-like" effects in animals, $ sigma$ receptors were a different identity and shared no commonality with opioid or PCP receptors. Since then, $ sigma$ receptors have generated a great deal of interest mostly in relation to their possible implication in psychosis like schizophrenia. More recently, $ sigma$ sites have been associated with various other functions such as the modulation of posture and movement, neuroprotection, anxiety and depression, pain control, drug abuse, regulation of endocrine and immune functions, and cognitive behaviors. Although evidence for the existence of an endogenous $ sigma$ ligand have been reported, the full characterization of such putative endogenous ligand(s) has yet to be achieved. Roman and co-workers (1989) proposed that neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peptide YY (PYY) could act as endogenous $ sigma$ ligands since both NPY and PYY competed with high affinity (nM) for $ rm lbrack sp3 H rbrack ({+})SKF 10,047$ binding sites in rat brain membrane homogenates. However, various laboratories failed to replicate these in vitro findings. In order to clarify this apparent discrepancy, the present thesis investigates the possibility of the existence of in vivo interaction(s) between $ sigma$ receptors and various NPY-related peptides. We first demonstrated that NPY could interact with $ sigma$ sites in vivo, since certain NPY-related peptides could, to some extent, compete for in vivo $ rm lbrack sp3 H rbrack ({+})SKF 10,047$/$ sigma$ binding in the mouse hippocampal formation (Chapter 2). In the course of a specificity study, we found that the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) also potently competed for in vivo $ rm lbrack sp3 H rbrack ({+})SKF 10,047$/$ sigma$ binding in the mouse hippocampus. We thus included CGRP-related peptides in subsequent studies and found that certain CGRP-related peptides significantly competed for $ rm lbrack sp3 H rbrack ({+})SKF 10,047$/$ sigma$ binding in the mouse hippocampus, in a manner similar to NPY (Chapter 3). Using an ex vivo autoradiographic approach, we further demonstrated that NPY- and CGRP-related peptides could interact with $ sigma$ receptors not only in the hippocampus but in most, if not all, brain areas enriched with $ sigma$ sites (Chapter 4). Finally, the behavioral relevance of these interactions was demonstrated. We found that various NPY- and CGRP-related peptides attenuated learning impairments induced by the systemic administration of the non-competitive NMDA-receptor antagonist MK-801. These effects were blocked by the purported cr antagonist BMY-14802., supporting the
involvement of 0' receptors in certain NMDA-related cognitive processes (Chapter 5).
Taken together, our results suggest that selected NPY- and CGRP-related peptides
could act as neuromodulators of 0' receptor functions in vivo, and that these
modulatory effects are behaviorally relevant.</description><creator>Bouchard, Pascale.</creator><contributor>Quirion, Remi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>In vivo interactions between sigma receptors and NPY- &amp; CGRP-relates peptides in the brain</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623f18g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67js664</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tt44pp42j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:28:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Previous studies in this laboratory have demonstrated that low doses of some selective $ sigma$ ligands such as DTG act as "agonists" by potentiating the neuronal response of rat CA$ sb3$ dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons to NMDA. Other $ sigma$ ligands such as haloperidol act as "antagonists" by reversing this potentiation. At doses in between 1-1000 $ mu$g/kg, i.v., several selective $ sigma$ ligands and antidepressant $ sigma$ ligands present a bell-shaped dose-response curve, which effect cannot be explained by a rapid desensitization. These $ sigma$ ligands that behave as "agonists" at low doses act as "antagonists" at the dose of 1000 $ mu$g/kg, i.v. To date, two subtypes of $ sigma$ receptors ($ sigma sb1$ and $ sigma sb2$) are acknowledged. However, data presented in this thesis have shown that pertussis pretreatment abolished the potentiation induced by JO-1784 but not that induced by (+)pentazocine. Moreover, the injection of colchicine in the dentate gyrus abolished the potentiation induced by JO-1784, but not that of (+)pentazocine. These data suggest that the subtype of $ sigma sb1$ receptor on which J0-1784 is acting is related to a G-protein and is located presynaptically whereas the subtype of $ sigma sb1$, receptor on which (+)pentazocine is acting is not related to a G-protein and is located postsynaptically. Because progesterone possesses high affinity at the $ sigma$ receptors, we have determined the effects of neuroactive steroids on NMDA-induced excitation. Low doses of DHEA potentiated the NMDA response selectively and dose-dependently. Progesterone had no effect by itself but reversed, at low doses, the potentiation of the NMDA response induced by DHEA as well as those induced by selective $ sigma$ ligands. The degree of the potentiation induced by 1 $ mu$g/kg, i.v. of DTG is significantly greater in ovariectorized rats than in control rats. Moreover, in late pregnancy, ten-fold higher dose of DTG is required to obtain a selective potentiation of the NMDA response. Conversely, the potentiation of the NMDA response induced by DTG is greater at day 5 post-partum than in control rats. The data presented in this thesis suggest that: (1) more than two subtypes of $ sigma$ receptors exist in the mammalian brain; (2) neuroactive steroids such as progesterone and DHEA modulate the NMDA response via $ sigma$ receptors.</description><creator>Bergeron, Richard, 1961-</creator><contributor>Debonnel, Guy (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Montigny, Claude de (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Characterization of the subtypes of sigma receptors : electrophysiological studies in the rat dorsal hippocampus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n950r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pp42j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827d21w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:28:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis specifies how Franz Brentano inspired some of his students and how those students, in their turn, influenced the next generation of psychologists. After outlining the essentials of Aristotle's psychology, the thesis explains some general positions that Brentano borrowed from Aristotle. It goes on to relate Brentano's concepts of 'presentation,' 'unity of consciousness,' and 'difference between the mental and physical,' as well as his call for a 'science of the mind' to ideas of Christian von Ehrenfels, Carl Stumpf and Alexius Meinong. Ehrenfels thought that a mental element, which he named gestalt quality, explains why a string of presentations has a certain form. The thesis then looks at a book of Edgar Rubin, even though Rubin was not a student of Brentano. His experiments that demonstrated the figure-ground phenomenon, however, were well known to the Berlin gestalt school. My analysis of Ehrenfels also sheds light on Rubin's theory, a theory that the Berlin gestalt school seemed to have overlooked, perhaps because Rubin's findings fit so well into their own notions. Stumpf developed his theory of how presentations form a unity partly in rejection of Aristotle's notion of substance. His theory grounds his criticism of associationism. Stumpf's students, however, would not accept his dualistic view, but they would benefit from the experimental methods that he developed and taught them. Stumpf adapted his theory in response to his students' work, and that version formed the basis of his objections against their explanations. Meinong's theory of how presentations are united was inspired by the Scholastics, and his students would render it into a psychological format. It is as a review of that latter work that the Berlin gestalt school presented its gestalt notion for the first time in mature form. The conclusion very briefly reiterates Brentano's influence. It also contains some general observations regarding the diversity among the gestalt notions, the wide scope of the gestalt authors, and their zeal for the pursuit of pure scientific knowledge.</description><creator>Boudewijnse, Geert-Jan A.</creator><contributor>Ramsay, J.

The development of sonata form in his early string quartets, though, raises serious questions about such a view. The quartets (ca. 1810 to 1816), constitute the composer's first concentrated work in large-scale instrumental music and include some of his earliest compositions in any genre. The first sonata-form movements all lack the most basic features of the structure, specifically a clearly delineated subordinate theme and subordinate key in the exposition. The evolution of Schubert's sonata form from 1810 to 1816 consists of an expansion to encompass such necessary tonal and thematic contrast. This process, however, does not lead to a close imitation of the Classical prototype but rather to a highly original reinterpretation of the form. By the end of 1814, many of the distinctive tendencies in his writing are already evident. These include (1) unusual modulatory strategies dependant upon tonal ambiguity and surprise, (2) the first signs of an intensely lyrical quality in the thematic material, (3) complementary, as opposed to derivative, thematic relationships, in which the musical discourse is divided between two contrasting motivic regions connected by underlying harmonic links and (4) a widespread allusiveness in his handling of harmony, which allows an initial harmonic event or "sensitive sonority" to become increasingly significant as the music proceeds. Ultimately Schubert's innovative approach to sonata form, while weakening the Classical attributes of clarity and conciseness, infuses a new atmosphere into the structure, making it the perfect vehicle for the expression of Romantic sentiment.</description><creator>Black, Brian, 1953-</creator><contributor>Caplin, William E.

Specifically, we focus on the problem of fine end-point motion control of the robot end-effector about a nominal point where the linearized dynamics can be used. Performance is measured in the context of linear quadratic (LQ) theory. An LQ based task-space performance index for robots is proposed. Several existing robots are examined for various transient tasks using this index and for each an optimum operating location is found. A cheap control (i.e. large actuator energies) analysis is done. The limits to performance are determined (i.e. singular optimal control). An explicit solution to performance was determined and an examination of the computed-torque control law is done. An LQ based piecewise linear control (PLC) law is derived that increases the LQ gain in a piecewise-constant manner as the system trajectory converges towards the origin. This law uses a succession of invariant sets of decreasing size and for each an associated LQ gain. The formulation gives rise to an iteration function whose solution is a fixed point. The development of the PLC law led to the unveiling of a number of key properties, namely that the solution to the algebraic Riccati equation is concave with respect to both the actuator weighting and the state weighting matrices. A time-varying extension of the PLC law and an overshoot control scheme are also derived. Issues regarding state estimation problem are studied. Noise is introduced to account for model uncertainty. A transient and steady state Kalman filter analysis is done. Sensor issues are examined for robots. The Kalman filter is used to fuse joint sensor data, Cartesian position sensor data, and tachometer data to provide a single best estimate of the state and to eliminate position offsets due to model error. Finally, the effects of unmodeled dynamics, model error, and non-linearities on performance are examined. A Kalman filter is used to eliminate bias positioning errors at the robot's end-effector. Performance-uncertainty curves are generated using a numerical convex optimization method when the system is subject to parametric uncertainty. Describing functions are used to examine the backlash non-linearity.</description><creator>Wredenhagen, G. Finn (Gordon Finn)</creator><contributor>Belanger, Pierre R.

Homozygous high-K$ sp+$ (HK) cells possess only M antigen, whereas homozygous low-K$ sp+$ (LK) cells have an antigen, L$ rm sb{p},$ which is an endogenous inhibitor of the Na/K pump since isoimmune antiserum, anti-L$ rm sb{p},$ stimulates the Na/K pump of LK cells by relieving this inhibition. In this study, it is shown that the $ rm L sb{p}$ antigen is a molecular entity distinct from the pump. Thus, anti-$ rm L sb{p}$ stimulated the activity (ouabain-sensitive $ rm sp{86}Rb sp+(K sp+)$ influx) of exogenous rat kidney pumps incorporated by fusion of kidney microsomes into immature LK red cells. Moreover, the $ rm L sb{p}$ antigen is responsible for the changes in pump kinetics associated with maturation of LK sheep red cells. The evidence is that treatment of immature LK cells with either anti-L$ rm sb{p}$ or trypsin (which cleaves the $ rm L sb{p}$ antigen) prevents the maturation-associated change in kinetics of the pumps, normally from one of no inhibition (immature cells) to that of marked inhibition by intracellular K$ sp+$ (mature cells). In addition, it was shown that kidney pumps delivered into immature LK red cells develop sensitivity to inhibition by intracellular K$ sp+$ following maturation of the cells in vitro. Mature LK cells have fewer pumps than mature HK cells and, therefore, another question addressed was whether the $ rm L sb{p}$ antigen promotes the greater loss of pumps in LK red cells during maturation. It was observed that modification of the $ rm L sb{p}$ antigen of immature LK cells with either anti-L$ rm sb{p}$ or trypsin diminished the subsequent loss of pumps during maturation in vitro. It was shown also that there is little decline in the number of $ rm</description><creator>Xu, Zheng-Chun</creator><contributor>Blostein, Rhoda (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Regulation of the NaK-ATPase of sheep red blood cells of the low- K+ genotype</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021g729.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wf28m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wd375x90m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:28:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Embryogenesis in plants, as in animals, requires the regulated expression of sets of genes involved in developmental processes. To gain insight into the processes regulating gene expression during embryogenesis differential screening was used to identify embryo-specific sequences in a cDNA library constructed from Zea mays embryo RNA. Four embryo-specific sequences and one constitutive sequence were characterized further by RNA blot hybridization and DNA sequence determination. The constitutive sequence and two of the embryo-specific sequences were found to encode parts of the previously-reported chloroplast 23S rRNA, Oleosin KD-18, and RAB-17 genes. Two sequences, named Emb5 and Emb564, were found to encode novel maize homologs of a gene expressed during late embryogenesis in a wide range of seed plants. These 5 genes exhibited differential temporal and spatial accumulation during development. Moreover, analysis of RNA from cultured embryos suggested that 4 of these genes were regulated by abscisic acid. The ABA-responsive genes could be divided into 3 classes, based on their developmental expression, tissue-specificity, and sensitivity to ABA. Antibodies raised against a $ beta$-galactosidase:EMB564 fusion protein were used to analyze the accumulation of the EMB564 and/or EMB5 proteins. These polyclonal antibodies detected one or several polypeptides with a molecular weight less than 14 kD which exhibited patterns of developmental accumulation and regulation similar to Emb5 and Emb564 transcripts.</description><creator>Williams, Bruce</creator><contributor>Tsang, Adrian (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Brown, Greg (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Corn -- Genetics</subject><subject>Corn -- Embryology</subject><subject>Abscisic acid</subject><subject>Genetic regulation</subject><title>Isolation and characterization of abscisic acid-responsive, embryo specific genes from Zea mays</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rm854.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375x90m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rb68xd301</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:28:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints and by the presence, in high titers, of an autoantibody known as the rheumatoid factor (RF). The human cytomegalovirus, a member of the human Herpesviridae family, has been proposed as a potential environmental agent involved in the induction of RF production. The report of an anti-CMV antibody having structural homology to a major group of human paraproteins with RF activity, as detected by the expression of RF-associated idiotypes and by variable region sequences, provided a possible structural relationship between CMV infection and RF production. In this thesis, the structural characterization of eight human hybridoma anti-CMV antibodies and their possible relationship to RFs is presented. All eight antibodies recognized the viral matrix phosphoprotein, known as pp65, which has previously been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic during the natural infection. Seven of these antibodies expressed a restricted number of RF-associated idiotypes. The HCV-2 anti-CMV antibody expressed the greatest number of RF-associated idiotypes and was most similar to RFs of the "PO" idiotypic family. All eight antibodies were composed of different $ rm V sb{H}/V sb{L}$ pairs, with evidence of antigen-selected somatically-induced mutations in the majority of cases. When the nucleotide sequences of these anti-CMV antibodies were compared to previously reported rearranged immunoglobulin sequences, the majority were found to share the highest degree of identity with antibodies possessing RF activity. This data provides evidence that there is extensive overlap between the autoimmune and anti-pathogen antibody repertoires. Comparisons of the anti-CMV antibodies with homologous RF sequences revealed that most of the amino acid differences could be accounted for by putative somatic mutation events and different junctional diversity in the third complementarity determining region (CDR3) of the antibody heavy chains. This was supported by the cloning and sequencing of the variable regions of a human hybridoma RF, known as C304, which was derived from a patient with active RA. The C304 heavy and light chain sequences had high identity with one of the anti-pp65 antibodies (HCV-3) and with a previously reported antibody directed against the human herpes simplex virus (HSV). The sequences diverged at points of suspected somatic mutations and, extensively, in the CDR3 of the heavy chains. Although no evidence was obtained that could definitively implicate human herpes viruses in the induction of RFs, this work has provided an analysis of the relationship between idiotype expression and antigenic specificity. This data has enabled the identification of the sequence differences between RFs and anti-viral antibodies that potentially play a role in determining antigenic specificity and provides the basis for an experimental model to address the issue of how primary amino acid sequence determines the specificity of human antibodies.</description><creator>Rioux, John David</creator><contributor>Newkirk, M.

It is induced by CD4$ sp{+}$ T cells. We used reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction to analyse T cell and cytokine gene expression in the CNS of SJL/J mice with myelin basic protein-induced EAE. Undetectable in normal CNS and cerebrospinal fluid, the expression of CD3, IL-2, IFN-$ gamma$, and TNF$ alpha$ increased in EAE, correlating with disease severity, then dropped to background levels during remission. IL-2 and IFN-$ gamma$ were produced by CD4$ sp{+}$ CD45RB$ sp{ rm low}$ T cells isolated from LN and CNS. In contrast, TNF$ alpha$ was predominately made by macrophages and microglia in the CNS. Purified microglia from normal CNS were induced to express TNF$ alpha$ by activated TH1 supernatant, suggesting that TNF$ alpha$ expression by cells in the CNS could be regulated by cytokines from infiltrating T cells. IL-4 was not detectable in total CNS or in isolated CD4$ sp{+}$ CD45RB$ sp{ rm low}$ cells from the CNS, but was readily amplified from CD4$ sp{+}$ CD45RB$ sp{ rm low}$ LN T cells. This suggests an enrichment of TH1 cells in autoimmune CNS. To determine the effect of IFN-$ gamma$ expression in the CNS, we produced transgenic mice using an IFN-$ gamma$ cDNA downstream of an MBP promoter. Expression of the transgene was CNS-specific. MHC class I was induced in the CNS of transgenic mice. Transgenic animals that were backcrossed up to 5 generations with SJL/J did not develop spontaneous pathology. However, when they were immunized with MBP in adjuvant, the penetrance of EAE was greater, symptoms were more severe, and the duration of the first episode significantly longer than in non-transgenic littermates, suggesting a role for IFN-$ gamma$ in the amplification and perpetuation of EAE.</description><creator>Renno, Toufic</creator><contributor>Owens, Trevor (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Cytokine expression and regulation in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h611n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c425j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rn3012815</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:28:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A series of studies was carried out on the direct analysis of solid samples with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Samples were first vaporized by modified electrothermal vaporization (ETV) systems and the vapor was introduced into the ICP. Inert gas flows were used to increase analyte transport efficiency and to reduce matrix effects. Halogenation reactions were used to improve solid sample vaporization in one of the modified ETV systems. At temperatures ranging from 1000$ sp circ$C to 2400$ sp circ$C pure oxides and carbides were converted to lower boiling point halides and evaporated. Experimental results showed that, with the use of Freon-12 as a gas phase halogenation reagent, nearly 100% vaporization was achieved for $ rm Al sb2O sb3$ (B.P. 2980$ sp circ$C, particle size $&lt;$10 $ mu$m), SiO$ sb2$ (B.P. 2230$ sp circ$C, particle size $&lt;$44 $ mu$m), ZrO$ sb2$ (B.P. 5000$ sp circ$C, particle size $&lt;$74 $ mu$m) and TaC (B.P. 5500$ sp circ$C, typical particle size 5 $ mu$m). The same was true for WC (B.P. 6000$ sp circ$C, particle size $&lt;$10 $ mu$m) if BaCl$ sb2$ was used as a second halogenation reagent. These lead us to believe that we would be able to vaporize samples with almost any inorganic matrix. When the same ETV system was used to analyze four marine sediment reference materials and one coal fly ash reference material, a linear relationship was found between the background corrected peak area and the reference concentration for six of the eight elements monitored.</description><creator>Ren, Jian Min</creator><contributor>Salin, Eric D.

In this thesis it is demonstrated that photopyroelectric spectroscopy is capable of recovering profiles of optical absorptivity in micron scale thick polymer laminates with submicron depth resolution. The pyroelectric method has also been used to characterize adhesion at polymer/metal interfaces from the photothermal impulse response using both the transmission and inverse detection geometries. The PPES technique can also map the distribution of polyene bands created during photodegradation of polyvinyl chloride. Results are obtained in the frequency and time domains using conventional lock-in detection, excitation with wideband time domain sweep waveforms and wideband homodyne techniques. The experimental photothermal results can be modeled using the linear properties of heat conduction to obtain quantitative values of the optical and thermal properties of the samples.</description><creator>Prystay, Marc C.
