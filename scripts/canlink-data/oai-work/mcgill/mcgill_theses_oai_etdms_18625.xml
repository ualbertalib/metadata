The wartime destructions and attendant shortages laid the groundwork for inflation, but the manner in which it developed was largely influenced by political factors. The first government attempts at stabilization were insufficient, and allowed a wage-price spiral to get under way. [...]</description><creator>O'Brien, John W.</creator><contributor>Weldon, J.

Smith tentatively described it as a species of enteric amoeba. Tyzzer (26) later suggested a definite classification for this organism in a new genus. The species name he proposed was Histomonas (gen. nov.) meleagridis (Smith 1895) Tyzzer, 1919. Incidence of the fatal condition referred to as enterohepatitis results in heavy annual losses to commercial turkey and poultry producers.</description><creator>McGregor, John.

Particular reference is made to the manner in which individual and group activities are organized by interest groups in an attempt to control certain of the content of the mass media of communication. The promotion of the professional spectator sports is used as a framework for describing the activities of various individuals and groups in a modern city. </description><creator>McFarlane, Bruce.

This soon proved too large an undertaking for the time at my disposal, and the subject was narrowed to an analysis of the pattern of the eschatological ideas of the Qur’an. My analysis includes an attempt to describe some aspects of the religious experience which might, on one interpretation, be inferred to have been the creative force behind such eschatological ideas.</description><creator>McDonough, Sheila.

The efficiency of the coronary circulation depends therefore upon two main factors: (1) the rate of coronary blood supply, i.e. the rate at which nutrition is supplied to the heart, and (2) the nutritional demands of the heart, i.e. the need of the heart for nutrition in order to meet its work requirements.</description><creator>Mazurkiewicz, Irena.

Because of the impossibility of obtaining an exact mathematical formulation, the common procedures of simplifying approximations and assumptions are liberally applied from the start in all of the reviewed investigations on the subject. By a simple approximate nonlinear theory one is able to predict phenomana in nonlinear systems which have no parallel in linear systems, but the results obtained must be considered as oualitative. Major trends are indicated correctly although the field is so broad that the work has only touched some of the high spots.</description><creator>Matsas, Loucas. C.</creator><contributor>Jackson, J.

Implicit in his statement is the assumption that critics of a certain period will reflect in their writing on Shakespeare the predilections and prejudices of their age. Like many fine-sounding but too sweeping generalizations, this one, although telling the truth, does not tell the whole truth. Shakespearian scholarship has perhaps been too prone to place Shakespearian criticism into rigid categories.</description><creator>Maizel, Norah. L.</creator><contributor>Porter, S.
