We examined the digestion products  generated by the cleavage of human CD4 with catL5 using mass spectrometry and  predicted candidate cleavage sites by performing a theoretical digest of the  protein. Ovine CD4 is also of interest to us as a target of F. hepatica  cathepsin L activity. Here we confirm a recently reported ovine CD4 cDNA sequence  and the existence of a single nucleotide polymorphism (T/C) within this sequence.  The polymorphism translates to a serine-proline switch near the hinge region of the  protein. Additionally, we have found that this polymorphism is also present in  genomic DNA, suggesting that two alleles of CD4 exist in the ovine  genome.</description><creator>Boscariol, Rya</creator><date>2004</date><subject>CD4 antigen.</subject><subject>Sheep -- Immunology -- Genetic aspects.</subject><subject>Immune response -- Regulation.</subject><subject>Fascioliasis.</subject><subject>Fasciola hepatica.</subject><title>Studies on ovine CD4 : genomic sequence analysis and protein cleavage studies with cathepsin proteases</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623d188.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096763c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p8418n819</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Athletes wear mouthguards to decrease the risk of injuries.  However, many athletes resist wearing mouthguards due to problems with speech and  breathing during play. Breathing difficulties may suggest limitations with  ventilation. The purpose of this study was to examine peak inspiratory and peak  expiratory air flow at different ventilatory rates using various types of  mouthguards and a no mouthguard condition. Mouthguards were fitted into a dental  model and air was ventilated through the model at three flow rates (30, 45, 60  strokes·min-1) using 2 and 3 L syringes. Flows were recorded using a  Medisoft Ergocard. Peak flows (L·s -1) were recorded for 10 strokes  during each condition. At 180 L·min -1, only bimolar mouthguards impeded  air flow compared to the no mouthguard condition. In addition, the Shock Doctor  bimolar mouthguard experienced decreased peak values compared to several  mouthguards. Results suggest that peak flow is lowered at high ventilation with  bimolar mouthguards.</description><creator>Blyth, Annie</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Respiration</subject><subject>Sports -- Safety measures</subject><title>The effects of different types of mouthguards on ventilation /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq25p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418n819</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b5644s13c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The possible polar wandering of the planet Mars is investigated  by modeling some of the many surface magnetic anomalies discovered by Mars Global  Surveyor (MGS).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the  involvement of PGD2 and the DP1 and DP2 receptors in eosinophil recruitment in vivo.  In this project, a group of Brown Norway rats were administered intratracheally with  PGD2, which activates both DP1 and DP2 receptors, as well as selective agonists of  DP1 (BW245C) and DP2 (15R-methyl-PGD 2 and 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-PGD2) receptors. In  addition, we have also tested the effect of 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ 2 which known to  activate PPARgamma and NF-kappaB, and DP2 receptors. Negative control animals  received saline alone while positive control animals received 5-oxo-ETE. In this  work, we have shown for the first time that PGD2 and selective DP2 receptor agonists  induce pulmonary eosinophilia in vivo in the following order of potency;  (15R-methyl-PGD 2 &gt; PGD2 ≈ 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ 2 &gt; dhk-PGD2). This  effect was time dependent with the maximal response being observed after 24 h.  Interestingly; this response was somehow diminished when higher dose was tested  (10mug). This effect is most likely to be mediated solely through the DP2 receptor  since this effect was not shared by the DP1 specific agonist BW245C. These results  are consistent with an important role for PGD2 and the DP 2 receptor/CRTH2 in  allergic diseases such as asthma and suggest that this receptor may be an important  therapeutic target for these conditions.</description><creator>Almishri, Wagdi</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>Effects of prostaglandin D₂ and the DP₁ and DP₂ receptors in eosinophil recruitment into the Brown Norway rat lungs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cb402.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472x01z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k0698809z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Oocyte loss and meiotic prophase progression was studied in XY  sex-reversed and XO female mice, two mouse models that lack pairing between their  sex chromosomes. An arrest at the pachytene stage of meiosis was not observed, nor  was a significant loss of oocytes at this stage compared to normal XX control mice.  Thus, it was concluded that a pairing checkpoint either does not exist in oocytes or  is not as stringent as the one observed in males. The effect of mutating the pro-apoptotic Bax molecule was  studied at three distinct ages corresponding to the time when female germ cells are  premeiotic, in meiotic prophase, and arrested in dictyotene. Although it appeared  that more germ cells were retained in the Bax homozygous mutant compared to the  wild-type and heterozygous mice at 18.5 dpc, by 24.5 dpc all of the mice possessed  similar numbers of germ cells. These results indicate a role for Bax in germ cell  death but also support the idea that an alternative pathway can compensate for the  elimination of this molecule.</description><creator>Alton, Michelle</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Oogenesis</subject><subject>Mice -- Molecular genetics</subject><subject>Ovum</subject><title>Control of the oocyte population in mouse ovaries</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tm56t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698809z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w95051071</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Microporosity, a serious defect in Al-Si based castings,  severely prevents their widespread applications in many critical conditions. The use  of criteria functions to quantitatively predict microporosity level holds promise.  To date, an ideal criteria function has yet to be obtained. In the present work, microporosity distribution in three  prominently used hypoeutectic Al-Si alloys (319, 356, and 332) was investigated. The  prediction effectiveness of single solidification parameter and existing criteria  functions was evaluated by correlating thermal data from simulation studies to  experimentally obtained microporosity values. Several new criteria functions are  proposed based on experimental observation and multivariable regression analysis.  The results indicate that the thermal parameters associated with the solidification  process have a strong impact on the formation of the microporosity in Al-Si alloys.  Thermal parameter-based criteria functions may be used to predict the microporosity  in Al-Si castings but have their limitations. A general criteria function tf1.18  Vs1.13 (tf: local solidification time, Vs: solidification velocity) can be applied  to predict microporosity for the family of hypoeutectic Al-Si casting alloys within  0.2 ~ 0.4 (%) error.</description><creator>Shang, Lihong</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Prediction of microporosity in aluminum silicon castings using criteria functions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343s762.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w95051071</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9880vr48q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The structural behaviour of FRP-composite (E-glass/polyester)  sheet pile panels subjected to uniform pressure load was investigated. Single,  connected and concrete-filled 2.13 m panels were tested to failure with the  objective of determining their moment capacity and failure mechanism. As the uniform  load test procedure utilized in this study allowed for the prevention of premature  local crushing behaviour within the span, the average moment capacity obtained in  this study was more than double that found in prior studies of FRP sheet pile  panels, averaging 11.15 kN.m in single panel tests and 9.32 kN.m in connected panel  tests. Single panels exhibited little difference in moment capacity whether tested  in the upright or inverted orientation and there was no apparent reduction in  capacity when a single panel was subjected to repeated load cycles. Failure of both  single and connected panels was generally attributable to local buckling and  invariably occurred at a deflection of about 50mm, indicating that deflection limits  may govern design. No joint failure was observed in connected panels.

The key  contribution of the proposed approach is that the computational cost of observation  selection is significantly lower than with current approaches presented in the  literature. First, a probabilistic approach to the fusion of data obtained from  multiple observations is presented. This approach works by recursively updating  probabilities associated with each hypothesis, taking into account the different  sources of uncertainty as well as the dependencies between the observed scene, the  measured data and the observation parameters. A novel criterion for automatic  selection of additional observations is then described. This criterion associates  high utility with observations whose outcome predictably facilitates distinction  between pairs of competing hypotheses. The algorithm is shown to have low complexity  and lends itself to various simplifications. Therefore, it represents a much less  expensive solution than techniques commonly used in the literature such as  maximisation of mutual information or expected loss of entropy. The very general  methodology presented is then applied to the open and difficult problem of object  recognition and pose estimation. Rigourous experimentation of the proposed approach  was conducted in two different contexts.

Accurate interference estimation is useful for  resource allocation, network planning and performance assessment in cellular  systems. If the individual interference power caused by a single interferer can be  approximated by a lognormal distribution due to the predominant effect of shadowing,  evaluation of the total interference distribution boils down to the problem of the  sum of lognormal distributed random variables. However, the problem of the sum of  independent lognormal distributions is well known to be difficult due to the  non-existence of closed form expressions. Many approximation methods have been  proposed to solve this problem. This thesis presents the Log Shifted Gamma (LSG)  approximation method, which provides high accuracy for the entire sum of lognormal  distributions with all combinations of individual lognormal parameters. The  probability density function (PDF) of Log Shifted Gamma random variable is in  closed-form expression and is fully characterized by its parameters. By comparing  results in outage probability and capacity evaluation, guideline of resource  allocation, and typical value estimation, LSG approximation is found to be a better  tool of analysis with higher accuracy than other methods, including the classical  lognormal and Gaussian approximation.</description><creator>Lam, Chong Lai Joshua, 1977-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Interference analysis in cellular network using log shifted gamma approximation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623hz26t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059c806w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kp78gg95n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The superior mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes would  make them excellent candidates for the next generation of composite materials.  Researchers have tried to demonstrate the potential of that novel material with  various degree of success. In order to complement the experimental efforts in this  new field, the modeling of these new material systems is required. One challenge  when modeling nanotube composites is the large scale span between the nanotube  itself and the final component. The present study focuses on the creation of a  framework and methodology to span three orders of magnitude in scale with  interconnected models that relate performance of single-walled carbon nanotubes  (SWNT) at the nanometer scale to a nano-array, nano-wire and micro-fiber with  self-similar geometries. The geometry chosen is the helical array composed of  discontinuous SWNT. The five elastic constants of the twisted SWNT fibers are then  predicted using a finite element analysis combined with the strain energy method. It  is shown that the Young's modulus of carbon nanotube fiber decreases dramatically  even for small twist angles (less than 20°) without any contribution to the  transverse properties. Moreover, it was shown that adding the polymer and its  properties can have important effects on the elastic properties of the SWNT/polymer  fiber. Finally, this model is compared to the experimental data and theoretical  models found in the literature.</description><creator>Ashrafi, Behnam</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Modeling the elastic properties of carbon nanotube arrays and their composites</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967426f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gg95n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rn301193r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Finite Element and Finite Difference methods are both widely  used in estimating magnetic field solutions.

Feed-forward neural networks may provide  the bridge to provide the initial estimate.

Using interviews, focus groups, participant observations  and a questionnaire, I examined the recursive cycle of professional growth and  transformation, and rooted the inquiry within the theoretical frameworks of  reflective practice, the dialogic imagination, social constructivist learning and  critical theory. I conceptualize teachers' professional growth as the transformation  of professional practices through the deepening knowledge and expertise that arises  out of collaborative inquiry and collegial dialogue. The major assumption supported  by this study is that teachers learn from one another through engaging in ongoing  and site-based critical dialogue focussed on classroom practices. This inquiry has  implications for professional development programmes, school leadership and teacher  empowerment.</description><creator>Moore, J.

The major research questions include whether there is a similar  representation of female-female interactions and a common conception of gender and  identity construction arising from these interactions. In addition to offering a  unique perspective on relationships between women, this analysis presents "Das  Gebell" as the story of two women, rather than one that focuses on the  relationship between a mother and her son, which has predominately been the  interpretation in the previous literature. Findings indicate that parallels exist in  the way women are portrayed in the above three Erzahlungen and that the  female-female interactions serve certain common narrative functions in each of these  texts.</description><creator>Menzies, Erica L.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Interpersonal relations in literature</subject><subject>Bachmann, Ingeborg, 1926-1973 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Women in literature</subject><title>The portrayal and function of relationships between women in selected Erzählungen by Ingeborg Bachmann /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s304b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935357b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rj430538n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The debate over the quality of work has been on-going for a  number of years. Recently, non-standard work has figured predominantly in that  debate. Some researchers have argued that the rise of non-standard work is evidence  of the declining quality of work since it offers few benefits, little job security  and lower incomes. Other research has indicated that it is the effect of job  characteristics themselves that determine quality of work, whether in standard or  non-standard employment. Other researchers have noted that it is the profile of  workers in these jobs that is a good indicator of whether the employment is  "good" or "bad" since most individuals who are from groups on  the periphery of the labour force tend to be in jobs of lesser  quality. This study addresses the quality of work in the Canadian context  from 1989 to 1994, by exploring its connection to all three of these theories: the  rise of non-standard work, the decline of "good" job characteristics and  the changing profile of workers in non-standard work. What was found may be an  interesting trend. Non-standard employment is becoming more mainstream and may even  be influencing the characteristics of standard employment. The demographic profile  of non-standard workers is also beginning to resemble that of standard workers. It  could be concluded that the quality of work is indeed shifting. However, it was  difficult to determine whether the shifts were indeed long-term or indicative only  of difficult economic times in Canada. The issue of job quality is complex and  better definitions of quality of work and longer timeframes should be considered in  future research, to better understand what was/is happening in the Canadian labour  market. If non-standard employment is truly "bad" work and it continues to  increase, there will be fundamental implications for the quality of work in  Canada.</description><creator>Fewkes, Carolyn J.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Labor -- Canada</subject><subject>Labor market -- Canada</subject><subject>Canada -- Social conditions -- 1945-</subject><subject>Canada -- Social conditions -- 1991-</subject><title>The quality of work in Canada : changes in non-standard and standard work arrangements 1989 to 1994</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354f81j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430538n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xd07gt25z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>"...music is an art that exists in point of time."  Aaron Copland, What to Listen for in Music Few definitions are adequate to describe music, but a  "point of time" is a concept with which people are familiar. When  musicians give concerts they try to create these points in a context, which allows  the audience to observe each moment by itself. Concert practice has developed to  define the edges of musical points, guided by cues such as clapping, pauses, and  concert program notes. This masters thesis investigates how to analyze concert  recordings of Western music and their program notes to produce segments which best  fit the boundaries of musical points. Modern segmentation techniques are reviewed  and a new method specific to concert recordings is examined.</description><creator>Ferguson, Robert W., III</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Sound -- Recording and reproducing -- Digital techniques</subject><subject>Music -- Acoustics and physics.</subject><title>Automatic segmentation in concert recordings</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956g426.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gt25z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wm117p44s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Fading Points is a piece of music for large wind ensemble. The  work is concerned with time perception and is designed to convey to the listener a  long temporal progression from slow music to fast music. To this end, the work is  written using musical gestures specifically designed for their portrayal of musical  time. The work consists of four sections, each of which is described in detail in  the analytical part of the thesis. The analysis also describes the rhythmic  language, which is created around short rhythmic cells. These cells are based on  ratios and are used in all levels of the piece from the surface rhythm to the large  formal divisions. The harmonic language is also described. The vertical harmony is  derived from a dense chord presented at the beginning of the piece. The horizontal  pitch material is created from small pitch cells, also taken from the opening chord.  These cells are used in isolation but are also combined to create modes, which are  the focus of the latter parts of the piece.</description><creator>Middleton, Neil, 1977-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Wind ensembles -- Analysis, appreciation.</subject><subject>Middleton, Neil, 1977- Fading points.</subject><subject>Band music -- Scores.</subject><subject>Band music -- Analysis, appreciation.</subject><subject>Wind ensembles -- Scores</subject><title>Fading points</title><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kg901.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117p44s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Music</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:th83kz93t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Time Fields: Chamber Concerto #3 for fifteen players (2004) is a  composition for five woodwinds, three brass, one percussionist, piano, string  quartet and double bass with an approximate duration of 14 minutes.

GINI is an innovative platform on conventional  PCs, which brings the whole functionality of a router into user space. GINI is able  to create a complex virtual network consisting of User-Mode Linux (UML), virtual  switches and routers. GINI is far more than a simulation engine, because packets on  a virtual link may experience real networks by going through UDP tunnels. This  thesis also presents a new architecture for building flexible and configurable  routers in GINI. They have a modular structure and are easy to extend. Our  evaluation shows that the GINI router has a much better performance than UML to be a  router. Since the GINI routers are lightweight and configurable, it is easy to run  hundreds of them by a simple script on one or more PCs, without crashing  them.</description><creator>Xu, Weiling, 1979-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>The GINI router : a routing element for user-level micro internet</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bp82p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xj22b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z9030515</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We review Cartan's method for determining whether two  G-structures are locally equivalent.

Mutational studies on residues involved in cofactor  binding and in catalysis conserved in both the LuxC enzyme and in Vibrio harveyi  aldehyde dehydrogenase have shown that these residues may play similar roles as the  effects of mutation on the kinetic parameters of the two enzymes were found to be  very similar. Moreover, preliminary X-ray structural characterization of LuxC shows  that its overall structure and fold is very similar to that of the V. harveyi  aldehyde dehydrogenase. Both enzymes are able to bind their NAD(P)(H) cofactors in  much the same way and the beta-sheet extension that is seen upon dimer formation in  the V. harveyi enzyme is also seen in the P. phosphoreum enzyme. Given these  results, and the fact that PpLuxC and Vh-ALDH have polypeptides of very similar size  that can catalyze similar reactions, albeit in opposite directions, we are proposing  that the acyl-CoA reductase of P. phosphoreum is part of the aldehyde dehydrogenase  extended family, making it the first member of this family to preferentially  catalyze the reduction of fatty acids to aldehydes rather than the oxidation of  fatty aldehydes to acids. Finally, through the study of a critical glutamate residue  of V. harveyi aldehyde dehydrogenase, we have provided direct evidence that this  residue may be the critical determinant in deciding whether aldehyde oxidation or  acid reduction is catalyzed preferentially.</description><creator>Skouris, Nicolas</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>The LuxC reductase of the marine bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum may be part of the aldehyde dehydrogenase extended family of enzymes /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36tz140.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz13q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6t053g637</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis introduces a development platform especially  tailored to Bioinformatics research and software development.

In this report, two aspects of CNP are  investigated, each introduced in their own chapters. First, a possible interaction of CNP with Fyn tyrosine kinase  during myelination is investigated. Fyn is an important factor known to be active  during the process of myelination, and CNP contains a number of possible tyrosine  phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, their presence in an isolated domain of cell  membrane called lipid rafts, further strengthened the possibility of interaction.  However, no evidence was found which could support the possibility, neither in new  born mouse brain nor in in-vitro experiment using transfected cells expressing Fyn  and CNP. Secondly, the role of CNP2 isoform in mitochondria is  investigated. CNP2 is found to be associated with mitochondria, and its 20 amino  acid segment at the N-terminus possesses characteristics of a mitochondrial import  signal. Furthermore, two known sites of serine phosphorylation in the N terminus of  CNP2 show influence on mitochondrial localization of the protein. However, results  collectively suggests that CNP2 is not imported into mitochondria, as pulse chase  did not show the typical processing of what was suspected to be the N-terminal  import signal sequence. Furthermore, CNP was degraded when partially purified  mitochondria was subjected to protease action, showing that CNP is not enclosed by  mitochondrial membranes. Two serine residues at positions 9 and 22 in the N-terminus  of CNP2 are likely phosphorylated by both PKA and PKC, and is responsible for the  decrease in mitochondrial localization of CNP2.</description><creator>Park, Minwoo</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>2',3'-Cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase : investigation of interaction with Fyn tyrosine kinase during the development of nervous system, and mitochondrial import of CNP2 isoform</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x1977.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pg798</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9880vr529</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A ground-based radar refractivity mapping technique is used to  measure water vapor near the surface during the International H2O Project in May and  June, 2002 (IHOP_2002). Radar-measured refractivity is compared with refractivity  estimated from surface station observations during this field experiment. Bias in  radar and station refractivity is found to occur often when humidity is high.  Possible reasons for this difference between radar and station observations are  discussed. Most of the biases were associated either with inaccurate humidity  observations by stations or with the small height difference of the two  measurements. With confirming this last observation further during these wet ground  conditions, radar refractivity shows much better agreement with radiosonde sounding  refractivity just above the surface than with station refractivity. In addition, columnar water vapor is computed using the mixing  ratios retrieved from radar and station refractivity and using the observed height  of the convective boundary layer from a FM-CW radar. Surface moisture fluxes are  computed as a residual of the columnar water vapor and compared with observations  from flux-towers, which compute this using the eddy-covariance technique. Although  the results show that the radar-based measurements may have some skill over longer  time periods, the technique completely fails to reproduce observations over scales  smaller than 1 hour.</description><creator>Park, ShinJu</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Water vapor estimation using near-surface radar refractivity during IHOP_2002</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zr280.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vr529</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3b591907h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of puck mass  on shot velocity of female ice hockey players. The contributions of upper body  strength and skill level to shot velocity were also examined. Female varsity and  recreational players (n = 29, age = 21.3 yr) performed shooting tests on ice. The  participants shot 20 light weight (5 oz) and 20 regulation (6 oz) pucks, using 4  different types of shots (standing wrist shot, standing slap shot, skating wrist  shot, skating slap shot). The on-ice tests were followed-by 3 musculoskeletal tests;  predicted 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) bench press, hand grip, and sit-ups. The light  weight puck resulted in a significantly higher velocity compared to the regular  weight puck (P &lt; 0.05). The average shooting velocity was 1.4 km/h higher  with the light weight puck compared to the regular puck (69.8 vs. 68.4 km/h) based  on overall means (4 shots x 2 pucks). Positive correlations were found between  overall shot velocity and musculoskeletal tests of hand grip (r = 0.81), predicted 1  RM bench press (r = 0.77), and sit-ups (r = 0.48).

My thesis work has been focused on characterization of the  CsrA protein and its interactions with RNA by NMR spectroscopy. Gel filtration and  PFG-NMR diffusion experiments indicate that CsrA primarily exists in oligomerized  form, while acidic pH favors the formation of a dimer. The NMR structural  characterization was carried out with the dimer form of CsrA. The CsrA subunit  consists of five anti-parallel beta-sheets and one alpha-helix with a flexible  C-terminus. The dimer is formed by sharing beta-sheets. Interactions of CsrA with  RNA have been monitored by NMR. Upon titration with a 15-mer RNA (CACACGGAUUGUGUG),  a complex was formed in slow exchange on the NMR timescale and gave rise to a large  conformational change in the CsrA structure. The three-dimensional structure and the  binding titration provide new insights into the regulatory  mechanism.</description><creator>Li, Yan, 1978-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Structural studies of carbon storage regulator, CsrA, from Escherichia coli by NMR spectroscopy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bf545.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d030f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35675</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
