There is developing gradually a clearer conception of the diseases of cattle which interfere primarily with the normal processes of reproduction. History relates many reasons which explain the early death of the fetus and its expulsion from the uterus. [...]</description><creator>Thompson, Robert R.</creator><contributor>Conklin, R.

The business man, as atrained co-ordinator of economic activity, regards it as his proper policy to reduce costs of production to a minimum. One of these costs is the labour cost. There is no reason evident to the business man that should prevent him from applying the same skill in determining wage rates as in buying material supplies. Hence he attempts to secure labour as cheaply as possible. He devotes as little as possible to the item of wages. This the competitive system demands. The workman, on the other hand, has as his essential endeavour the attempt to secure as high wages as possible.

It emphasizes their national origins and the areas in which they settled.  What Presbyterian chucrches were built and what ministers served them are treated in some detail.  Because various branches of the Presbyterian Church took root in Canada at that time, and endeavour is made to note the changing relationship of a Canadian branch to its mother church in Scotland or the United States and to observe the interrelationship of one branch to another in Canada.  Denominational structures, Presbyteries and Synods are touched on briefly.

This study thus constitutes the firstpublication of a transcription from the historical tablature into modern notation ofall the anonymous præludia/præambula from the Lynar B3 fascicle. Furthermore,the study situates these pieces within the history of the North German præambulumby way of a systematic survey into the function of organ music in the Lutheran massand the role of improvisation, the influence of the fantasia on the præludium, thetablature system, and the history and content of the Lynar B3 manuscript itself.This study offers a thematic catalogue of the incipits of the pieces with informationon their length, tonality, and formal outline. The collection is not of uniformly highquality comparable with the oeuvre of Sweelinck or other major composers, butprovides a highly stimulating insight into the workshop of a seventeenth-centuryorganist, and completes our understanding of a major historical resource.</description><creator>Dierks, Michael</creator><contributor>Neidhöfer, Christoph (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2011</date><subject>Organ Music.</subject><subject>Music.</subject><title>The untouched organ works of the Lynar B3 tablature and their context in the history of the North German Præambulum</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3335242.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r841b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Music (Performance Studies)</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qf85nd99j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:43:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>J'ai découvert le nom de Georg Friedrich Kauffmann (1679-1735) lors de mes études doctorales à l'université McGill. Plusieurs de mes lectures mentionnaient son nom en précisant que ce compositeur était à l'origine de la plus abondante source de registrations détaillées pour des oeuvres pour orgue de l'époque baroque. Cependant, en m‟intéressant de plus près à Kauffmann, je me suis aperçu qu'il n'existait que très peu d'études approfondies sur les registrations de ce compositeur. En lisant la thèse doctorale de Theodore van Wyk, publiée en 2005 et ainsi au faîte de la recherche sur Kauffmann, j'ai réalisé qu'une question était régulièrement absente de tous ces travaux musicologiques: pourquoi Kauffmann a-t-il indiqué telles registrations dans tels préludes? En discutant avec le musicologue Bruce Haynes, qui termine actuellement la rédaction de son livre The Pathetick Musician, dans lequel il étudie entre autres les Passions dans les cantates de Johann Sebastian Bach, la réponse à cette question s'est imposée d'elle-même. Il doit certainement exister un lien entre les registrations de Kauffmann et les textes des chorals sur lesquels il a composé ses préludes! En effet, les préludes de Kauffmann sont composés sur des mélodies de chorals luthériens, si bien que le texte de ces chorals est implicite à ces préludes pour orgue seul et apparaît en filigrane.

It is not only interesting from a purely comparative physiological aspect, but the peculiarities of the function of the alimentary tract of the rabbit provide an opportunity to approach the study of the mechanism of pancreatic secretion from a new point of view. The great difference between the pancreatic secretion in herbivorous animals such as the rabbit and that of carnivorous animals such as the dog and cat, is that the secretion in the herbivors is continuous. This continuity of secretion was assumed by early investigators to be dependent on the unceasing digestive work of the stomach. In carnivors the stomach functions only for a few hours after a meal whereas in herbivorous animals the stomach ts always more or less full.

There is no doubt that the peculiar action of the sympathetic nerve made investigation of its function difficult and led to the formulation of several hypotheses to explain its action on the secretory apparatus of the salivary glands. The sympathetic nerve is the second secretory nerve supplying the salivary glands, and when it is sectioned there is very little change in the reflex salivary secretion. After section of the parasympathetic nerve supply, the sympathetic nervealone cannot transmit reflex impulses from the mouth cavity to the salivary glands.

The absence of this information is not due in any way to lack of research work on the part of the writer, but arises primarily from the newness of the cellophane industry. The comparatively recent establishment of the industry largely accounts for the lack of literature dealing with it. Furthermore, a large number of patents originally covering the process of manufacturing cellophane has expired, thereby exposing the DuPont cellophane company in the United states and the cellophane subsidiary of Canadian Industries Limited in Canada to merciless competition on the part of outsiders.

Steel has been called the "core of capitalism". The very word is fraughtwith romance. It is the symbol of strength. The ramifications of its production include the ownership of mineral deposits, of coal mines, of huge plants - an integrated whole. The stress and conflict of the present economic era are reflected in the growth of the steel industry. The competitive system generated the desire and necessity of control, and in this process the introduction of huge amounts of capital followed. It was this necessity that led to the trust movement that involved the steel industry. [...]</description><creator>McCracken, Edward J.</creator><contributor>Forsey, E.
