An overall P-removal of approximately 66% was achieved at these WTPs in 1994. Dessau Inc. of Laval, McGill University and Ecole Polytechnique were contracted by the Ministry of the Environment and Fauna of Quebec to perform an evaluation of chemical P-removal from Quebec municipal wastewaters and the optimization of existing processes. Part of this evaluation and optimization involved clarifying the mechanisms and interactions during chemical P-removal. Many key models from literature were reviewed, but were not entirely adequate. A static steady-state P-removal model was therefore developed, accounting for the reactions and removals of soluble and particulate forms of orthophosphate and polyphosphate/organic phosphorus. The model traces the path of each P-fraction throughout the chemical removal process, accounting for P-precipitation and adsorption, as well as reductions of TSS and BOD$ sb5.$ Computer programs were constructed for the model, with specific programs written for primary treatment, activated sludge, biofiltration and facultative aerated lagoons. Samples were gathered at 11 WTPs during June-July 1994; these field data were used to calibrate the computer programs. Computer program output generally agreed with the field data to within 10%. Several of the WTPs sampled obtained a total-P removal of approximately 90% with metal dosed:P molar ratios often below 1.</description><creator>Hart, John, 1969-</creator><contributor>Gehr, R. L.

In the interrupted mode, a constant voltage was applied for t$ sb1$ seconds (the on-time) followed by a short circuit for t$ sb2$ seconds (the off-time). (2) Food waste--electroosmosis (continuous DC only) alone or in combination with expression (pressure of 207 kPa). (3) Titanium oxohydrate slurry--electroosmosis (similar to (1)) alone or in combination with a vacuum (absolute pressure of 89 kPa). (4) Pyrite slurry--electroosmosis (similar to (1)) in combination with vacuum (similar to (3)). The major independent variables were applied voltage, t$ sb1$ and t$ sb2,$ and initial bed height. The dependent variables were the amount of water removed and the electric current. For clay and titanium oxohydrate there was an optimum off-time for a fixed on-time. For $ rm t sb1=30$ s, the most water was removed from clay with $ rm t sb2=0.1$ s while for titanium oxohydrate the most water was removed for $ rm t sb2=3.5$ s. For suspensions (2), (3) and (4), the combination of electroosmotic dewatering with vacuum or expression increased the amount of water removed. In general, interrupted power removed more water than continuous power electroosmosis. For suspensions (3) and (4), only the combined modes were able to achieve dewatering targets set by industry.</description><creator>Gopalakrishnan, Sridhar</creator><contributor>Mujumdar, A. S.

A comprehensive study of testing methods for in-plane shear is performed and the three-rail shear test is chosen. A two-dimensional finite element analysis is performed in order to analyze and improve the performance of the three-rail shear test specimen. Through finite element analysis, the optimal specimen configuration is determined by inserting slots at the positions where there are stress concentrations. The results are verified by three-rail shear tests performed for both the standard un-notched and the new notched specimens. The notched specimens show great improvement in both static strength and fatigue life. Using a modified three-rail testing fixture and the modified notched samples, a characterization of graphite/epoxy material under in-plane shear static and fatigue loading was performed. The in-plane shear strength and stiffness were determined. The shear stiffness demonstrated significant non-linearity which was modeled and characterized. The in-plane shear fatigue life, residual strength and residual stiffness were determined and are presented in normalized forms which can be used to predict the fatigue behaviour of the material. Next the out-of-plane shear test methods are examined. Existing shear test methods are designed primarily for measuring in-plane shear strength in the x-y plane (S$ rm sb{xy}).$ An improved double-notched shear test method is developed to measure out-of-plane shear strength, S$ rm sb{yz},$ under both static and fatigue loading conditions. Out-of-plane shear strength can be measured by careful choice of specimen configuration and testing method, verified by finite element analysis. The test method is then used to determine the out-of-plane shear strength, the fatigue life and the residual strength.

Previous work has shown that WAO is technically feasible for the treatment of sludge from a thermo-mechanical pulping (TMP) mill. In an attempt to improve the degree of oxidation, and consequently reduce the overall cost, the use of different catalysts was investigated. Experiments were carried out in a stainless steel batch reactor using pure oxygen and sludge from the primary clarifier of a TMP mill. Various metal salts were screened in order to determine a suitable catalyst for the process. Further experiments were performed to study the effect of oxygen pressure, temperature, time of reaction, and catalyst concentration. The screening experiments showed that the best catalyst was copper sulfate (CuSO$ sb4).$ When using this catalyst, a 97.6% reduction in the chemical oxygen demand occurred compared to 76.5% reduction without catalyst at the same conditions. The results indicate that the use of CuSO$ sb4$ significantly improves the treatment of TMP sludge by wet air oxidation.</description><creator>Collyer, Matthew</creator><contributor>Berk, D.

The crude extract was resolved into two components, $ alpha$ and $ beta$, using capillary electrophoresis. These were both shown to be fragments from the cell wall mannoproteins. The $ alpha$ component consisted mainly of the protein portion of the mannoproteins and the $ beta$ component consisted of the long highly phosphorylated mannan chains. Fragmentation occurred when the covalent bonds between the mannans and the asparagine residues were hydrolysed during the hot citrate extraction procedure. The $ alpha$ component was identified as the active emulsifying agent. Although the $ beta$ component was not an emulsifier, it was an effective coemulsifier and improved the properties of the $ alpha$ component. The emulsifying properties of these materials were related to the ability to bind the dye Coomassie blue. Removal of the long mannan chains both increases emulsifying ability and exposes the protein chain for binding to the dye.</description><creator>Barriga, Jeffrey</creator><contributor>Cooper, D. G.

The Balqa' was a provincial area of Transjordan, which had long been part of the classical world heavily influenced by the Arab tribes of the Syrian desert. After the Arab conquest the Balqa' took on a new role as the home or some of the ruling Umayyad elite. But a process of economic, demographic and urban decline had already begun in the middle of sixth century. Even the ethnic and religious composition of the Balqa's population remained stable; the region was primarily inhabited by Christian Arabs during both the late Byzantine and the Umayyad periods. In passing from Byzantine to Umayyad control the Balqa' underwent a process of transformation, especially in regards to political matters. But the more important trend was one of continuity, even the transfer of political power from the Byzantine bureaucracy to Arab notables was but the culmination of a trend which had begun with the rise of the Ghassanids in the previous century.</description><creator>Wood, Michael John.</creator><contributor>Little, Donald (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Islamic Empire -- History -- 661-750.</subject><subject>Jordan -- History</subject><title>A history of the Balqāʾ region of central Transjordan during the Umayyad period</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jw624.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hb89v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n296x120w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The proliferation of the Internet and the convergence of telecommunication, computing, compact disc, and media technologies have paved the infrastructure for new interactive music environments.

It contains 106 chansons, 22 of which are unica. Fallows, Brown, Montagna, Kenney, Perkins and others have discussed the transformation of the style of the chanson over the course of the 15th century. Little has been written specifically on the period of the Laborde chansonnier. With reference to musical features such as melodic style, imitation, cadences, metrical structure, role of the contratenor, and range of note values, I discuss the style of the chansons, first in general, and then layer by layer, charting the changes in a crucial period. Although these changes are gradual, it is possible to follow the development of the chanson during the period between 1450 and the beginning of the sixteenth century. The Laborde Chansonnier contains twenty-five unica, of which four have appeared in modern editions, and one of which is incomplete. I have transcribed the other twenty and also four other chansons which I could not find in modern editions.

As the pastoral constitutes a literary site where a concern for landscape converges with a search for community, it has been employed as a myth in nationalist discourses whose functioning depend heavily on symbolized landscapes and idealized social types. The philosophical basis of the pastoral is the classical opposition between nature and culture. For this reason, its representations are often coded as 'natural'. To this extent, the pastoral participates in a hegemonic myth-making system, constituting a limited semiotic field in which certain representations are privileged while others are negated. Following Marx and Barthes, the thesis contends that an attack the nature/culture opposition is essential to undermining the hegemony of the myth-making process. In the context of nationalism, a pastoral can articulate a critique of dominant a 'naturalized' representations when it questions its own use of the nature/culture opposition.</description><creator>Stacey, Robert David</creator><contributor>Wihl, Gary (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Clarke, George Elliott Whylah Falls</subject><subject>Pastoral literature -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Canadian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Ondaatje, Michael, 1943- In the skin of a lion</subject><title>The transformed pastoral in recent English-Canadian literature</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gv700.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247dv20m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d504rn37p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study represents a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the Supreme Court of Canada's treatment of the exclusionary rule set out in s.24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The objective of this thesis is to contribute to the theoretical debate between legal positivism and legal realism by examining judicial discretion and the application of s.24(2) by the justices of the Supreme Court. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the weakness of the positivist school in its basic premise that judicial decisions are based solely on the application of the rule of law. It is contended that Supreme Court decisions are derived not only from the words of the law, but also from extra-legal factors, since judges possess certain predispositions by virtue of their own personal experiences. This thesis will illustrate that the exercise of judicial discretion by the Court in its interpretation of s.24(2) has had a profound impact on the nature of Canadian criminal justice policy, moving Canada even closer to the due process model of criminal justice and further from the crime control model than was intended by the framers of the Charter. Both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of s.24(2) Supreme Court decisions show that the language of this provision is often circumvented by the justices who are not constrained by either the intention of the framers or even their own precedent. Consequently, the vague wording of this provision coupled with the discretion conferred on these justices allows the Court to read the exclusionary provision in a manner that best accommodates the exclusionary philosophies of the majority of Supreme Court justices.</description><creator>Shugar, Jody Ann</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Judicial discretion -- Canada</subject><subject>Canada.

During these years the Conservative party was defeated by the Liberal party on three separate occasions. Many historians believe that this string of electoral contretemps offers convincing evidence that Conservatism, as an evolving pattern of beliefs, was fundamentally unsuited to the political climate of Great Britain at the turn of the century. According to this interpretation of Edwardian Conservatism, it was only the timely onset of war which saved the party from having to come to terms with the democratic impulse of an unfamiliar era. This is a gross exaggeration of the plight of Conservatism before the war, for the party's unwavering commitment to the economic status quo was not in itself a recipe for electoral catastrophe. What may well have turned out to be fatal to the party's well-being was Joseph Chamberlain's Tariff Reform campaign. In 1903 Chamberlain offered the party an all-encompassing creed, a total solution to Britain's problems, both domestic and foreign, and a positive platform to sustain the party in office. Balfour sensed the dangers of a comprehensive ideology that was inherently of its own time. He, and Bonar Law after him, helped to rehabilitate Conservative ideology by limiting its scope and suggesting that Tariff Reform was merely one weapon among many in a large Conservative arsenal.</description><creator>Shouba, Derek C.

In dealing with their works on the { it s = i ra}, the intention is to focus on some aspects of the life of the Prophet of Islam from the time when he resided in Makka. After outlining the authors' scholarly backgrounds, sources, methods, and purposes, etc., the thesis deals with certain specific issues concerning the Prophet's birth, his nursing and the reason behind the custom of having foster-mothers, the controversial stories of the splitting of his chest and of his participation in the sacrilegious war, his state both before and after the announcement to him of his Mission, the authors' interpretations of his night journey and ascent to heaven and lastly their discussion about the Prophet and miracles. This research should not be considered as historical in nature; rather, it aims at clarifying the similarities and differences which may be discovered between our two biographers, and at comparing their respective Sunn = i and Sh = i$spc$ = i approaches.</description><creator>Rahnamaei, Seyed Ahmad</creator><contributor>Little, Donald P.

Kuki Shuzo, like many intellectuals in Japan during the twenties and thirties, anticipates this discourse by attempting to confront the hegemonic claims and universal pretensions of modernity. Using the latest European methodologies, Kuki attempted to define a site of difference--a site that could escape the putative universality of Western modes of dealing with historical development and consciousness--through a particular reading of cultural artefacts, especially Edo poetry and painting. Yet Kuki would ultimately locate this special site within the temporal, spatial, and subjective boundaries of the modern nation implicating the geopolitics of modernity and providing an interesting context to study the complicity of art, ideology, and aesthetics in modern discourse.</description><creator>Psomiadis, Gerry</creator><contributor>Lamarre, Thomas (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Japan -- Intellectual life</subject><subject>Kuki, Shūzō, 1888-1941</subject><title>Temporalities, spatialities, subjectivities : Kuki Shûzô and the poetico-ontology of the nation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107104c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139404w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9593tx17w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Parisian Holy League, an insurgent movement in conflict with both royal government and the social elites, expounded, in spite of itself, a conservative, nobiliary social ideology.

The broadcasts which he wrote for the B.B.C. demonstrate a progressive refinement of technique and an increasingly original approach to the medium. Under Milk Wood, in many regards, represents the culmination of this broadcasting work; it is a remarkable response to the evocative potentials of radio. But the piece, apart from confirming Thomas's achievement in radio, also provides a unique vehicle for exploring critical treatment of a non-textual form like radio. The critical history of Under Milk Wood emphasises the need for a "form-sensitive" criticism appreciative of the artistic potentials and restrictions of radio. Finally, it is these potentials and restrictions, masterfully explored by Thomas, which can also be seen as exerting a powerful influence on Thomas's own artistic sensibility. The social essence of radio altered Thomas's own artistry.</description><creator>Pietersma, Eric Geoffrey</creator><contributor>Wees, William (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Radio and literature</subject><subject>Thomas, Dylan, 1914-1953.

Sixteen female and fifteen male newborns were videotaped interacting briefly with a female and male experimenter. Raters coded neonatal physical characteristics, and both neonatal and adult behaviours. Results showed that raters could discriminate the sex of the newborns based upon the degree of cuddliness and activity level. It was also found that adults responded differently with female and male newborns. Finally, the male and female experimenter were found to differ in their behaviours with the newborns. Discussion focuses on the importance of methodological considerations in assessing sex differences in neonatal behaviours, and on the implications of neonatal behavioural sex differences on subsequent parent-child interaction.</description><creator>Philippoussis, Maria C.</creator><contributor>Benenson, Joyce (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Parent and child.</subject><subject>Sex differences (Psychology)</subject><subject>Newborn infants -- Psychology.</subject><title>The effects of gender differences in newborns on adult-infant interaction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qv03n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795973f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68kj33t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As early as the fifth century C.E., the thousand buddha motif had become a prevalent feature in the art of many cave-temples in Gansu, China. Past scholarship concentrated on tracing the textual sources of the motif and with relating it to the practices associated with the devotion to the three thousand buddhas of the three ages. Past research has not considered how the thousand buddhas may have been a reflection of a wider range of religious practices and popular beliefs nor has it explored the motif's artistic origin. By demonstrating that the earliest examples of the two-dimensional painted form of the thousand buddhas came from Gansu and that the motif was related to an iconographic and architectural design that existed between several Gansu cave-temple sites, this study proposes that the thousand buddha motif was a Gansu cave-temple art innovation that influenced cave-temple decor in areas west of Gansu. In addition, possible reasons for the prevalence of the motif are suggested by considering that it may have reflected the relationship between the thousand buddhas and meditative practices as well as the acts of chanting and circumambulation.</description><creator>Pepper, France A.

Indeed, this novel absorbs and reproduces, in addition to a limited number of socially marked words or expressions, the role relationships, the power relationships, and, especially, the discursive strategies of the real world aristocratic ideology. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that if Proustian intratextual utterances undergo many systematisations, distortions and subjectivations promoting the insertion, within the dialogal component, of functional and structural characteristics of the description which modify the temporality of real dialogue and introduce pragmatico-structural modifications unthinkable in the real world, these systematisations, distortions and subjectivations partake of the text's aesthetic and ideological presuppositions, that is the anti-mimetism both of the characters' discourse in novels and of literature, the incapacity of language to reveal the truth directly.</description><creator>Pellerin, Dominique</creator><contributor>Lane-Mercier, Gillian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Proust, Marcel, 1871-1922.

One way of increasing this participation is through education in the formal system because it provides more opportunities in a modernizing society. This study presents the situation of women in education in the context of Tanzania, which has developed policies geared towards equality at all levels of society. Tanzanian educational policies have attempted to equalize opportunities for everyone regardless of race, gender and social class. A few of those policies have succeeded in reducing gender imbalances without however changing attitudes towards women's potential in the development of the nation. This study attempts to demonstrate that educational policies affect female participation in a positive manner but essentially in quantity. In the context of Tanzania, quality in education had not been a priority as much as the commitment to mass education. Therefore, female education has evolved at a lower quality than male education, thus affecting outcome in terms of opportunity. Quality education and opportunity for women will only be possible if the school, family, community and all societal institutions join in a comprehensive effort to break barriers which now prevent their full participation.</description><creator>Peera, Rishma</creator><contributor>Ghosh, Ratna (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Women -- Education -- Tanzania</subject><subject>Education and state -- Tanzania</subject><title>Tanzanian educational policy : effects on women's participation in formal education</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q622p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr172029n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Administration and Policy Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8k71nk21v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to compare health-related physical fitness of high school students in two schools that have different physical education programs. Argyle Academy has physical education 6 classes out of 7 days, and Riverside Park Academy has 3 classes out of 7 days. These two high schools are similar (e.g., size, geographical location, common feeder schools, and social economic status) and affiliated with the same school board. Students in the seventh, eighth, and tenth grade physical education classes were selected for testing in each school. Data from 102 students from Argyle Academy and 96 students from Riverside Park Academy were collected during an eight week period. Health-related physical fitness was assessed using the following test battery: sum of five skinfolds, waist to hip ratio, 20 m shuttle run, curl-ups, 90 degree push-ups, back saver sit and reach, and trunk lift. School group, gender, and grade comparisons were performed using a MANOVA procedure. The students from Argyle Academy demonstrated significantly better scores for the 20 m shuttle run and trunk lift, while those from Riverside Park Academy demonstrated significantly better scores for the curl-ups and 90 degree push-ups. There was no significant difference in the sum of five skinfolds, waist to hip ratio, and back saver sit and reach. This preliminary study has described and analyzed health-related physical fitness of students at two high schools.

Thematically as well as technically the material in his first four collections of short stories is all derived from a desire to explore the beginnings, or the primitive wellsprings, of writing and art. The collage-like construction of picture and sentence will be shown to evolve from a knowledge of palaeolithic cave painting, humanity's first writing system, while Davenport's use of cataloguing and paratactic systems will be shown to evolve from ancient Greek. His primitivism also reveals itself in a Rousseau-like concern to highlight the advantages of primitive civilization on a modern industrial one and how the lessons learned from that are invaluable for present-day society.</description><creator>O'Reilly, Séan A.

His career is seen as an unique expression of the creative and critical intelligence within modern society. The liberal, secular, and individualistic aspects of Lewis's thought are stressed. The thesis concentrates on four aspects of Lewis's life and work. First, Lewis's relationship with T. E. Hulme, usually described as one of direct influence, is shown to be adversarial and complicated by basic differences of their worldview. Second, the nature of Lewis's fascism is discussed using a new reading of Hitler (1931). Third, Lewis's view of the position and the role of the artist in society is explained by studying three of his models of culture and society, each drawn from a different period of his career. Finally, the relationship of Lewis and Marshall McLuhan is examined to determine the nature and extent of the ideas passed on.</description><creator>Nicholl, Gordon</creator><contributor>Hellman, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Lewis, Wyndham, 1882-1957 -- Political and social views</subject><subject>Lewis, Wyndham, 1882-1957</subject><title>Wyndham Lewis : critical intelligence</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vt00z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956h945</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:05741t852</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study is to explore the adjustment experiences of McGill University graduate students from the People's Republic of China (PRC). Following a qualitative approach to research, interviews were conducted with 10 graduate students from the PRC using semi-structured and open-ended methods. More structured interviews with McGill University administrative staff provided background to the study as did government and university registration statistics. This study explores student involvement and interaction with Canadian society, avenues and barriers to interaction, and communication between professors/supervisors and students. It focuses on the overlapping relationship between communication skills and culture learning as part of how students define adjustment. Students identify the particular challenges in adjusting to Canadian society as becoming more self-reliant and feeling comfortable with uncertainty in their futures. Women students discuss issues of independence and freedom and how these factors sometimes conflict with their traditional social roles. This study also includes some recommendations for further research.</description><creator>Mongillo, Anne M.
