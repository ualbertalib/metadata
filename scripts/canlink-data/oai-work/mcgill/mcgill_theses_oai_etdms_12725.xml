From one point of view, it has been maintained that different psychological attributes or functions reside in different parts of the cerebrum. In contrast to this, the position has been held by many that there is no such localization of function. It is now quite clear that many functions can be localized, in the sense that a loss of a limited region of cerebral tissue results in a qualitatively limited, or restricted, loss of function, and a loss of much cerebral tissue elsewhere in the brain does not produce the same loss.</description><creator>Forgays, Donald G.</creator><contributor>Hebb, D.

The following list (Table I) of ascorbic acid oxidase-containing plants has been compiled from the literature up to and including 1950. The list, though small, includes plants from eleven families of the Monocotyledoneae and Dicotyledoneae. Several investigators (16, 20, 55, 62) consider that ascorbic acid oxidase in these plants plays a terminal role in their respiration but others (2, 7), are not in agreement with this view owing mainly to the limited distribution of the enzyme. The work reported here has been chiefly devoted to a study of the kinetics of the enzyme as a contribution to the general knowledge of the respiratory enzymes of plants.</description><creator>Elliott, Bernard Burton</creator><contributor>Waygood, G.

We must not attempt to consider his philosophy of history as a system to be connected with other systems; the changing, prolific nature of Croce's thought as well as his own assertions in his "Autobiography" forbid such an approach; and to systematize where the author himself does not would be too presumptuous a project, and might falsify the understanding of Croce's thought in the process of crystallizing it.</description><creator>Kushner, Eva</creator><contributor>Klibansky, R.

The activity of cells may involve only the synthesis of substances for the upkeep of the cells themselves, or, in addition, the synthesis of substances to be released to the outside. In the latter case, raw materials are taken into the cell, incorporated into some new substance, and then released in this new form into the extra-cellular spaces or to the outside. The activity of such a secreting cell can be subdivided into a number of phases.

Intelligence tests can be used successfully to discriminate between those who would most likely profit from a university education and those who would not, but their ability to predict success within the university group itself, is of a low order. The primary assumption in this piece of research is that prediction at this level involves more factors than intelligence, and that probably the most important among these other factors is motivation. If tests of these two factors were used conjointly, it is assumed that they would provide a better predictive statistic than either used separately.

He stated that its beak was slender and pointed, and was used for drawing up food. He called the second antennae arms and described their motion as three-fold—rectilinear, unequal, and gyratory.

The pouch was a modification of the Cope operation (30), a pouch made from the lesser curvature of the stomach. The dog was standardized to the various gastric function tests and was maintained on a normal kennel diet of minced meat. Within 48 days the volume of gastric juice secreted by the pouch increased from an average of 50 c.c. to an average of 135 c. c. daily. There was also noted an increase in the amount of water taken and in the volume of urine excreted.</description><creator>Currie, Donald J.</creator><contributor>Webster, D.

The tendency of several of these compounds to form peroxides when exposed to light and air was noted, the esters made with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (tosyl chloride) and pyridine were prepared, and the replacement by iodine atoms of the tosyloxy groups in the products was studied. Tasker then applied the tosylation-iodination technique to a commercial hydroxyethyl ether of cellulose, but his results made it clear that side-reactions of an unexpected nature were occurring. In the light of the knowledge gained from his studies in the polyethylene oxide series, Tasker put forward suggestions concerning the possible nature of the side-reactions. These suggestions, however, were only tentative, because at that time the literature contained no reference to the existence of an hydroxyethyl derivative of a simple sugar, the chemical behavior of which would serve as a model for the probable behavior of an hydroxyethylcellulose.</description><creator>Creamer, George Bernard</creator><contributor>Purves, C.

Such children tend to become "problem children," and to find their way into Child Guidance Clinics and Juvenile Courts. Retardation in reading makes school work progressively more difficult for the child, since, as he advances in grades, his success in all subjects tends to depend more on reading ability. As he experiences failure in his school work, he is apt to lose interest in it and eventually leave school before he has reached a level of attainment consistent with his actual native capacities.</description><creator>Crane, J.

Under no load conditions and at constant speed, the concentration of nitrogen oxides continuously increases with enrichment, while those of aldehydes and carbon monoxide decrease. Similar trends are observed for a medium load at constant speed. The behavior may be explained by the effect of an increased temperature. Beyond a critical oxygen enrichment of the intake, a reaction temperature is eventually reached at which partial dissociation of carbon dioxide becomes a factor and the concentration of carbon monoxide begins to rise. The concentration of nitric oxide in the exhaust, being independent of the nature of the fuel, is a measure of the maximum reaction temperature reached during combustion, and this is probably true of all combustion processes in which air is the supporting element. Investigation shows that addition of various gases to the air intake might prove valuable as an experimental technique in the study of combustion processes.</description><creator>Cooper, Ross Malcolm</creator><contributor>Gauvin, W.

The oils were incorporated in the diets at 20$ (herring and linseed) and 10$ (linseed) levels. Linseed oil, segregated by propanol or with additions of antioxidants were tested. Supplements of sheep feces and dried brewers yeast were fed with linseed oil diets to determine their prophylactic and curative properties. Heat polymerization decreased the nutritive value of the oils as assessed by the growth rates, feed consumption, and the physical condition of the animals. Increasing the heated oil content of the diet from 10 to 20% resulted in lower growth rates. Propanol segregation or the additions of antioxidants to the heated linseed oil showed no effect on the nutritive value.

Considerable speculation as to the pathological changes and mechanism of death have failed to uncover a satisfactory explanation. In general, if the portal vein is left intact, arterial ligation alone does not produce definite infarction, but a focal or massive necrosis usually appears within twenty-four hours. In 1949 it was reported by Markowitz, Rappaport and Scott that dogs which were treated with penicillin were able to survive complete hepatic arterial ligation.</description><creator>Chau, Andrew Y.</creator><contributor>Webster, D.

The review and resume cover both theoretical and experimental studies, and was used to indicate the methods employed in expressing the results. The experimental work described in the thesis consisted of a series of tests carried out in a variable pressure wind tunnel. The results of the tests enabled a study of the effects of an adverse pressure gradient on the characteristics of a turbulent boundary layer to be made. The studies confirm salient known effects of an axial pressure gradient on the boundary layer. A method of expressing the boundary layer growth in terms of a parameter containing the pressure gradient is pointed out, and suggestions are made for further studies of this nature.</description><creator>Chant, Raymond Earle</creator><contributor>Mordell, D.

An attempt has been made to determine the answer to this question, for the case of odd quarter wavelength resonant lines. A short historical survey of the different theoretical considerations, and the reasoning behind them, is given as a preamble to the present investigation. The resonant line method of Chipman was used to measure impedance of resonant lines for various resonant lengths and at various frequencies. From this data, the apparent terminating resistance (radiation resistance) is obtained. The current approximate expression for radiation resistance of a quarter wavelength resonant line is found to be in error by a factor of two. A theoretical curve corresponding quite closely to empirical results for short line lengths is found.</description><creator>Carr, Edward Francis</creator><contributor>Chipman, R.
