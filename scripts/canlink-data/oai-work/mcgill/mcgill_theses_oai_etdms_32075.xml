A direct relationship has been demonstrated in earlier physiological studies between the excitability of SON neurons and hormone release from the neurohypophysis. Catecholamines have been shown to activate SON neurons, thereby increasing the action potential frequency to the neural lobe. The present study examined the ability of catecholamines to evoke release of vasopressin and/or oxytocin from the neural lobe of an intraarterially perfused preparation of rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysis. Experiments were carried out on male Long-Evans rats. Drugs (noradrenaline, dopamine, D1 and D2 dopamine receptor agonists) were delivered both into the perfusion medium and directly over the SON. Fractions of effluent medium were collected from the area of the neurohypophysis and tested for hormone release using a selective radioimmunoassay. Noradrenaline (NA) in concentrations of 10$ sp{-5}$ to 10$ sp{-4}$ M stimulated AVP release from neural lobe. The $ alpha sb1$-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin (50 nM in perfusion experiments; 1$ mu$M in local injection experiments) blocked the noradrenaline-stimulated release. Dopamine (10$ sp{-4}$ to 10$ sp{-3}$ M), D1 (SKF 38393, 0.5 mM) and D2 (QNP 0.5 mM) dopamine receptor agonists also increased the release of AVP. In the presence of prazosin, DA, QNP and SKF 38393 still evoked AVP release. Therefore, it is proposed that both noradrenaline and dopamine stimulate the release of AVP in this preparation; the responses to dopamine appear to be mediated by both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, presumably located at the level of the cell somata/dendrites, possibly also on axon terminals in the neural lobe.</description><creator>Huang, Chunwei</creator><contributor>Polosa, C.

Using a popular error criterion, we study the following problems for a curve P in $R sp{d}$, where $d ge 2$: (i) minimize m for a given error tolerance and (ii) given m, find the curve $P sp prime$ that has the minmum approximation error over all curves that have at most m vertices. These problems are called the min-# and min-$ varepsilon$ problems, respectively. For R$ sp2$ and with any one of the L$ sb1$, L$ sb2$ or L$ sb{ infty}$ distance metrics, we give algorithms to solve the min-# problem in $O(n sp2)$ time and the min-$ varepsilon$ problem in $O(n sp2 log n)$ time. When P is a polygonal curve in $R sp3$ that is strictly monotone with respect to one of the three axes, we show that if the $L sb1$ and $L sb infty$ metrics are used then the min-# problem can be solved in $O(n sp2)$ time and the min-$ varepsilon$ problem can be solved in $O(n sp3)$ time. If distances are computed using the $L sb2$ metric then the min-# and min-$ varepsilon$ problems can be solved in $O(n sp3)$ and $O(n sp3 log n)$ time respectively. All of our algorithms exhibit $O(n sp2)$ space complexity.</description><creator>Eu, David</creator><contributor>Toussaint, Godfried T.

This cube is shown to be an array of 12 parallel, symmetric 1-dof 4-bar linkages. The cube is composed of 8 corner tripods and 12 edge rods. There is a hinge at the end of each edge rod connected to an adjacent corner tripod leg. Motion is obtained by each tripod screwing inward about an axis along the cube space diagonal. Two different foldings are described by adjacent tripods screwing in the same, isorotation, or in the opposite, counter-rotation, hand. Folding motion and direct and inverse kinematics are derived. Results are easily obtained in closed form not only for the folding cube but also for the underlying general four-bar kernel mechanism where crank and follower are of different radii and axes are skewed. Singularity and joint combinations analyses are presented along with other angular relationships among mechanism components. The folding cube can be adapted as a robotic manipulator component which promises to be stiff, light and simple. This component mechanism appears to be a member of a family of similar, parallel mechanisms where the 4-bar kernel axes are coplanar. Family architecture appears to be based on the 5 platonic solids. The folding rectangle and the folding tetrahedron are introduced as two members of the family.</description><creator>Zhang, Hao-Chen</creator><contributor>Zsombor-Murray, P. J.

After ON cut, approximately 40% of the RGCs were lost in the second week, followed by a more protracted cell loss, while ON crush gave rise to a slow RGC loss beginning at one week. Retrograde axonal degeneration and macrophage invasion into the ON stump was more marked after ON cut than crush, but progressive retrograde degeneration of axons into the retina did not precede the onset of RGC loss. In parallel experiments, I found evidence that brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA is expressed in non-neuronal cells of the uninjured ON. These observations suggest that events other than neuron-target separation play a role in the timing and severity of neuronal loss after axotomy.</description><creator>Berkelaar, J. A.

A unique transcription initiation site was detected at -967 bp 5$ sp prime$ to the translation initiation codon (+1 bp) and was specific to hippocampal tissues which are known to strongly express 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptors. By sequence analysis, a TATA consensus sequence was identified 58 bp upstream to the transcription initiation site and several other cis-acting elements were also observed. To assess potential transcriptional activity, deletion fragments of the 3.2-Kb 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptor gene 5$ sp prime$ region were linked to a luciferase reporter gene and transiently expressed in mammalian cells (P19 and Ltk) which do not endogenously express the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptor gene. Results indicated a strong promoter located between nucleotides -1187 and -117, followed by an upstream silencer region (-1390/-1188), the repressor activity of which is attenuated by the presence of additional upstream sequences. I suggest that repression of transcription may be a major mechanism restricting the expression of the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptor gene to the appropriate tissues.</description><creator>Charest, Alain</creator><contributor>Albert, Paul R.

Tissue from ten colorectal carcinomas and mucosa at 1, 5 and 10 cm from the primary lesion was obtained from surgical specimens and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Detergent-extracted protein was separated by electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gells and western blots performed using monoclonal antibodies against c-fos, mutant p53 and statin. Expression of c-fos within the carcinoma was increased relative to its expression at 1 cm, which was increased relative to 5 or 10 cm. The reverse results were obtained for statin with the lowest expression detected in the carcinoma, intermediate expression at 1 cm, and highest values at 5 and 10 cm.

Increasing evidence indicates that p56$ sp{ rm lck}$ participates in T-cell receptor-mediated signalling. Firstly, this enzyme is physically associated with the CD4 and CD8 T-cell surface glycoproteins. CD4 and CD8 are respectively involved in the recognition of major histocompatibility complex class II and class I, that are expressed on antigen presenting cells. Secondly, expression of activated p56$ sp{ rm lck}$ polypeptides in CD4- and CD8-negative T cells has been documented to enhance antigen-induced T-cell responsiveness. To understand the mechanism(s) by which p56$ sp{ rm lck}$ participates in this process, the effects of mutations in known regulatory domains of p56$ sp{ rm lck}$ on the ability of activated p56$ sp{ rm lck}$ to enhance antigen-induced T-cell responses have been examined.

Therapists were first asked to rate the importance of behaviours in facilitating student learning during clinical instruction. Then they were asked to report their attendance at continuing education courses on clinical instruction. The relationship between attendance at these courses, number of years of clinical experience and rating of behaviours was investigated. Therapists with few years of clinical experience had a low rate of attendance and rated behaviours as important more frequently. Therapists who attended a course rated behaviours as important less frequently. Behaviours rated as most important belonged to the area of communication, followed by the areas of teaching and interpersonal relationships. The results of this study demonstrated that a workshop on clinical instruction would benefit therapists by improving their clinical supervisory skills.</description><creator>Campanile, Loredana</creator><contributor>Thomas-Edding, Dorothy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Education.</subject><title>Effective clinical instruction : selection of behaviours by occupational therapy clinical supervisors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rx89z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kv039</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zs25x970n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The works of Marcel Dube are a testimony of the French Canadian society's evolution, at a time when its cultural and social identity was being questioned. Beyond any doubt, his plays had a strong influence upon Quebecers during the fifties and sixties. Dube's dramatic works have instigated the interest of critics throughout Canada and also in the United States and Europe. This thesis represents an analysis of five plays written by Marcel Dube giving clear indication of the universality of his works, particularly based on unpublished documents. These plays were written almost thirty years ago; nevertheless, they are still alive and applauded nowadays, which corroborates their universality. Also, on the unpublished recording tapes, actress Monique Miller, actor Jean Duceppe and author and critic Jean Ethier-Blais dwell precisely on the universality of Dube's works. Therefore I thought advisable to study this particular topic in the following plays: Zone, Florence, le temps des lilas, Bilan and Au retour des oies blanches. On these unpublished recording tapes, Marcel Dube talks about himself and his life as a writer. We learn about his childhood, the beginning of his career, the people who surrounded and encouraged him, the social, cultural, and political environment that prevailed at the time he wrote his most famous plays. He also acknowledges his mistakes, his weaknesses, his ambitions and talks about the motives that prompted him to become a writer. Furthermore, well known author and critic Jean Ethier-Blais expresses his ideas and feelings regarding the author and his works. Actors and personal friends Monique Miller and Jean Duceppe recollect the circumstances and the effect the dramatic art of Marcel Dube has had on French Canadian culture.</description><creator>Rivard, Jacques</creator><contributor>Smith, Andre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Dub√©, Marcel, 1930- -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>L'Universalit√© du th√©√¢tre de Marcel Dub√©</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064710f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x970n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>D√©partement de langue et litt√©rature fran√ßaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:df65v9119</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The integration of students with an intellectual disability has been a long standing issue and goal in special education. It is usually assumed that such educational integration will terminate following completion of high school. There are examples however, where persons with an intellectual liability have participated in higher education. One example of an integrated program has been implemented at a junior college in Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Quebec. This is a work-study type of program in which students 18-21 years of age follow a specific curriculum in the closed classroom and also participate in certain regular college classes, including physical education. The purpose of the present study was to investigate this unique program with particular emphasis on physical education. More specifically, it was the intent to measure the perceptions of persons directly involved with the program on such variables as social acceptance, social interaction, self-concept, motor performance, peer performance, attitude, expectations, and perceptions. A questionnaire was distributed to subjects in four groups: students, peers, physical educators, and parents. Mean response scores from each group were reported for each variable. Results indicated a general positive perception regarding the integrated program from all groups.</description><creator>Pfeiffer, Laura</creator><contributor>Reid, Greg (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Physical education for youth with mental disabilities -- Case studies.</subject><title>Perceptions of physical activity integration at a junior college</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/765372384.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v9119</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0g354g490</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis critically reviews medical journal literature on the physician-patient interview. The review focuses on literature which is written by and for physicians, in Canadian and American, English language medical journals. Articles, essays and letters to the editor are examined as a cultural exchange amongst physicians that both shapes and is shaped by the values of the medical profession. Chapter One presents literature concerning physician-patient communication in general. The following Chapters Two, Three and Four ("The Physician as Medical Interpreter," "Physician and Patient: in Conflict and in Silence," and "The Patient as Narrator,") focus on themes in the medical journal literature written by physicians on the clinical interview. These Chapters examine the values, explicit and implicit, of this literature. The values are examined for possible epistemological origins in traditional medical ethics, philosophical bioethics, contemporary social movements for the dignity and rights of the individual, and other sources. Thematic shifts in these values over the past twenty years, and the sources of these shifts, are also examined. Finally, the Conclusion evaluates the significance of this literature for the development of a medical morality.</description><creator>Pierce, Lynn Margaret</creator><contributor>Keyserlingk, Edward (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Medical history taking -- Moral and ethical aspects</subject><subject>Physician and patient -- Moral and ethical aspects</subject><subject>Medical ethics</subject><title>Physicians who write about talking with patients : the interview</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79407z49q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354g490</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tx31qj92s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis deals with al-Ghazali's works and their influence on Indonesian Islam, an influence which, to a considerable extent, has marked the nature of the religious life practiced by the majority of Indonesian Muslims from the very beginning of its history until today. Their influence can be seen in the fact that Indonesian Islam appears to be a harmonious reconciliation between both the esoteric life represented by Sufism (tasawwuf) and the exoteric life which manifests itself in ritual obligation (shari'a). This characteristic owes much to the availability of most of al-Ghazali's works in the languages which Indonesian Muslims understand well. Many of these works have in fact been published repeatedly since they have long been considered by most Indonesian Muslims to be significant sources from which they might improve their understanding of Islam. Having investigated most of al-Ghazali's works which have been known in Indonesia, it would appear that his mystical works have been more popular than any other aspect of his teachings. Finally, this study comes to the conclusion that al-Ghazali's works have played an important role in the development of Indonesian Sunni Islam which has its roots in many of his teachings.</description><creator>Said, Nurman</creator><contributor>Ormsby, Eric L.

Field observations conducted in 1990 and 1991 involved geomorphological and cryostratigraphic examinations of twenty-eight ground ice sections exposed in retrogressive thaw slumps and ground probing radar surveys of two of the thaw slumps. Samples were taken of ground ice and sediments exposed in thaw slump headwalls for laboratory analysis. Samples were analyzed for moisture content, grain size distribution, and Atterberg limits. Gravimetric ice contents were calculated and an average ice content profile was constructed for the study area. Ground ice was found to be an important component of permafrost on the Fosheim Peninsula and was widely observed in Holocene marine sediments. The ice occurred in two stratigraphic settings at depths of one to five meters in silt and clay, and at ten meters or deeper beneath massive clay. Ice contents were generally found to increase rapidly with depth down to three meters, below which ice content was stabilized. Ground probing radar was found to be a useful tool for permafrost research, given its ability to discriminate between ice and soil, as well as between frozen and unfrozen water.</description><creator>Barry, Peter</creator><contributor>Pollard, W.

The results indicate that DA depletion in PFC facilitates the sensitizing effect of repeated d-amphetamine on locomotion elicited by a subsequent injection of the drug without enhancing spontaneous locomotion or locomotion elicited by acute d-amphetamine administration. The enhancing effect of repeated drug injections on d-amphetamine-elicited DA overflow in nAcc was also potentiated by depletion of PFC DA. These effects were likely not the result of a nonspecific effect of 6-OHDA since DA depletion of the basolateral amygdala, which like PFC, receives a DA input from the ventral tegmental area, did not enhance the effects of either acute or repeated d-amphetamine administration on locomotion. These results suggest that long-term reductions in meso-PFC DA neuronal activity underlie the development of sensitization of mesolimbic DA function.</description><creator>Banks, Kate.</creator><contributor>Gratton, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Role of prefrontal cortex in d-amphetamine-induces sensitization of mesolimbic dopaminergic function in rat</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085m451.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289k34n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jh343t43q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Lattice codes find good use as higher dimensional signal constellations. When used with QAM, the constituent 2-D constellations of a lattice code determine important properties of the transmitted signal. Using multidimensional Fourier techniques, this work presents a robust method to efficiently generate the point distribution of all the constituent 2-D constellations of a lattice code. The multidimensional discrete Fourier transform (MDFT) is computed for a periodic extension of the lattice code. The MDFT is used in conjunction with a version of the Projection-Slice theorem, derived for the discrete case, to obtain the point distribution of all the constituent 2-D constellations. The implementation of the MDFT is via a multidimensional generalization of the FFT using the Cooley-Tukey decomposition, well matched to lattice properties. Numerical results show that for signal constellations which are not large, the continuous approximation technique is not accurate, and therefore the exact calculations should be used.</description><creator>Mehta, Kiran</creator><contributor>Leib, Harry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Fourier domain techniques for lattice codes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wh25n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jh343t43q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tn20n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Four low carbon steels were drawn from rod to wire on a commercial multi-die wire drawing machine. Samples were obtained from between dies. Internal damage, as a function of cold work, was determined using precision density measurements. Nitrogen was observed to have the greatest effect on the ductility of low carbon steel. Interstitial nitrogen causes internal damage, which results in wire breaks. The mobility of nitrogen increases with temperature, which could account for the increased probability of wire breaks at high drawing speeds.</description><creator>McCallum, Roger David Ian</creator><contributor>Jonas, J.
