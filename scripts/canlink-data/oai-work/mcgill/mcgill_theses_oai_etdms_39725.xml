Recently, a multi-centre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the efficacy of HBO2 therapy for children with CP. Using the same cohort, the purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of HBO2 therapy on hand function using the Jebsen-Taylor test. All children received 40 treatments over a 2-month period. HBO2 treatments were 60 minutes with 100% O2 at 1.75 atmospheres absolute (ATA). Placebo treatments were also 60 minutes with air (21% O2) at 1.3 ATA. Seventy-eight children with CP, aged 3--12 years completed pre and post hand function assessments. Hand function was evaluated using one quantitative measure (time) and three qualitative measures. There were no significant changes between baseline and follow-up tests for any of the measures, although both experimental and control groups improved ( p = 0.08) their total times for the Jebsen test. The HBO2 group improved by 54.5 seconds (8.8%) while the placebo group improved by 47.8 seconds (7.7%). The results indicate that HBO2 therapy did not enhance the hand function of children with CP.</description><creator>Liebich, Ingrid.</creator><contributor>Montgomery, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Cerebral palsied children.</subject><subject>Hyperbaric oxygenation.</subject><title>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for children with cerebral palsy : Jebsen-Taylor test of hand function</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zz417.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nn18q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5t34sm303</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:58:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since its beginnings a decade ago, the mass media, niche media, subculturalists and participants alike have fumbled around cumbersome descriptions and depictions of the essence of rave. For outsiders, rave may symbolize difference, defiance, escapism and meaningless hedonism. For insiders, rave can mean transgression, transcendence, freedom, unity and meaningful fun. All rave elements, such as the lights, lasers, stomping feet, raised arms in ecstatic bliss, the DJ and the ceaseless beats seem to synchronize in a unifying pulse. As communal as rave's facade may seem, the experience is wholly personal. Rave has been disseminated to undeveloped nations, and remote towns; as it grows in one area it decays in another and morphs into another sub-scene, dress code, venue, and soundscape. As an insider stepping outward, I peer into my memories of rave and catalogue of blissful moments in an attempt to articulate its essence and its cyclical perpetuation.</description><creator>McCall, Tara.</creator><contributor>Straw, Will (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Raves (Parties)</subject><title>Barbie's wearing "phat" pants : rave culture, emergence to convergence</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n514m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sm303</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:12579v10m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:58:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The use of the exodus theme in the interpretation of scripture has been espoused by a number of liberation theologians, notably Jose Severino Croatto. The responses to the use of this theme vary. This thesis examines Croatto's use of the hermeneutic circle, as a method of biblical interpretation, in its application to the narratives of Exodus 1--15. The process of interpretation and application are examined against the background of the liberation movement and liberation theology. As an advocate of the liberation movement, Croatto uses the hermeneutic circle to relate the meaning of the exodus narratives to the socio-political situation of oppression in Latin America. This use of the hermeneutic circle, therefore, allows the meaning of the exodus narratives, in interaction with a contemporary socio-political context, to facilitate the creation of a message of liberation for the present.</description><creator>Minott, Garth.</creator><contributor>Kirkpatrick, Patricia G.

If we accept the notion that language learning results from involvement in communicative events, then to what degree learners participate in an event, if at all, is crucial to that learning. In this thesis I add to the body of research that has begun to examine the complexities of the interface between individuals and learning contexts. I examine the historical, cultural and personal influences that a group of Ukrainian military officers bring to a NATO sponsored immersion program, as well as their perceptions of their place within the power structures that are inherent to this setting. I argue that for the group of learners in this study, second language acquisition theories have not provided an adequate explanation for the reason why they did or did not participate in communicative events both inside and outside the classroom. Drawing on Vygotsky's (1962, 1978) language learning theories and Peirce's (1989, 1993, 1995, 1997) notions of social identity and investment to support my findings, I identify elements that served to marginalize these learners and disempower them, and which were responsible for their apparent lack of investment in language learning. I also suggest how, for some of these officers, changes in their social identities led to more opportunities to practice English and eventually to feel empowered both during the language course and once they returned home.</description><creator>Charbonneau-Gowdy, Paula.</creator><contributor>Maguire, M.

In an effort to legitimize his reign as ruler of the Holy Roman Empire and to raise the profile of his ancestral Bohemian lands, he leaned on the power of history to reveal his heritage as stemming, on one side, from an illustrious line of emperors including Charlemagne, and on the other, from the dynasty of Bohemian sovereigns. He recognized that art could display this legitimization and so implemented a programme of historicism in his artistic commissions. His impact on Bohemian art was indirect as well: his ideas influenced the art patronage of his closest court advisers, as seen in this paper through the examples of two illuminated manuscripts, the Evangeliary of John of Opava and the Liber viaticus.</description><creator>Bushnell, Taissa.</creator><contributor>Boker, Hans (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Bohemian school of art.</subject><subject>Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, 1316-1378 -- Art patronage.</subject><title>Thronis meis binis : validation through history in the court art of Charles IV</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr172012g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cv81r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237ht61d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:58:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recently, musicologists Linda Austern and Suzanne Cusick have examined the socio-cultural implications of gender issues in Renaissance music. Drawing on Cusick's research on gender-based binary oppositions in Italy and Austern's studies of women and music in England, I propose a related set of gender binary oppositions in English society. I apply these oppositions in detail to two specific works from the Elizabethan madrigal and lute song repertoire, then examine the remaining pieces from these collections as a whole and find that an overlap of four particular oppositions better captures the contradictory nature of the music. Examining pieces that fall into each category, I observe how the composer manipulates each to complicate the piece's gender character. I conclude that while binary oppositions grasp the artistic and political trends of an era, a closer look at the tensions at work between them provides a more nuanced view of the music's gender character.</description><creator>Campbell, Annette.</creator><contributor>Cumming, Julie E.

Due to the scarcity of ancient written material and physical evidence, most of our knowledge of the sport must be based on the depictions themselves. This thesis sets out to discover whether or not our basis of knowledge, the vases and their depictions, are accurate and reflect what truly happened in a boxing match. To accomplish this, two main variables are put to test: the ratio of left- and right-handed boxers, and the occurrence of certain tactics used when right-handed and left-handed fighters face each other. Primary sources of depictions are drawn from the Panathenaic amphorae together with some other Attic Black and Red Figure vases. Boxing knowledge is that of the author, who has studied in the field for the past five years.</description><creator>Boivin, Lawrence J.</creator><contributor>Fossey, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Sports in art.</subject><subject>Boxing.</subject><subject>Art, Classical.</subject><subject>Art, Greek.</subject><title>The depiction of boxing in classical Athenian art /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fj93z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j6731579g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qj72p896r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:58:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we are exploring agile, animal-like performance for our four-legged robot, Scout II, by developing the running and dynamic step climbing controllers. Scout II is a legged platform of which only a subset of its degree of freedom is activated. The low number of actuators is an advantage for power autonomy. However, it reduces the flexibility in controlling this robot by introducing an underactuated system. Despite being a highly complex system to control in the classical sense, Scout II reveals stable open loop behaviors by exploiting simple structured tunable controllers, which partly rely on the passive dynamics of the system. To gain better understanding of the robot dynamics, which affects the performance of the controllers, a thorough analysis of the equations of motion is conducted based on which behavior of the robot is simulated. An extensive simulation study is carried out to tune the controller for the running motion of the robot. Simulation and experimental results are studied in parallel. Actuator limitations, as the main barrier to the performance of the running controllers, are verified based on the experimental data. The measured energy efficiency of the robot places it among the most efficient legged platforms in the world. Lastly, a novel dynamic step climbing algorithm is developed and implemented in practice, which shows that the robot is capable of climbing steps of 10cm in height.</description><creator>Talebinejad, Shervin.</creator><contributor>Buehler, M.

A novel parallel architecture, called double triangular (DeltaDelta), was proposed and studied in depth by Daniali in anticipation of applications which require fast and precise motion. However, Daniali failed to find the minimal solution to the spherical DeltaDelta parallel manipulator, which he suspected is quadratic. Here, projective geometry and Grassmannian incidence relationships are used to unify the method of direct kinematic analysis (DKP) of two types of three degree-of-freedom manipulators, viz., the planar and spherical versions of DeltaDeltaPM, while preserving the geometric meaning of the solution. This method was to demonstrate for the first time that SDeltaDeltaPM can have only two real assembly modes; however, the minimum solution is found to be of order eight. An example is included to show that SDeltaDeltaPM can actually possess eight real assembly modes. Only two of the eight real poses lie within the workspace, while the other six arise due to a quadruple triangular tesselation of the sphere. Furthermore, a method to solve the general three-points-on-three-lines problem along with application to statics and spatial parallel manipulators is presented.</description><creator>Shum, Chung Fai Jonathan, 1975-</creator><contributor>Zsombor-Murray, P.

The first plant included biofilters supplemented by alum addition during the summer for phosphorus removal. The second plant used an oxidation ditch and no coagulants were added. Iron was added to the UV pilot system influent in both cases to simulate post-coagulation of phosphorus. The Trojan UV System 3000 pilot consisted of three separate channels each containing 2 lamps. Two channels were used as controls by having just the sleeves (without UV lamps) in one of them and non-UV lamps (i.e. lamps with visible light output only) in the other. The third channel contained sleeves with two low-pressure UV lamps. The flow in each channel was maintained around 1--1.5 L/s and the ferric chloride concentration was varied from 0 to 6 mg/L.

It has been shown that the optical properties are strongly influenced by surface morphology. In this project, we use non-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) and polarized light microscopy (PLM) to visualize surface and bulk morphology. Various techniques, such as surface and line roughness, surface and line fractal dimension, pair-correlation function and nearest neighbor distance distribution function, are employed to quantify the description of morphology and to compare the morphological characteristics of a number of polyolefin films of commercial interest. A comprehensive quantitative analysis of surface topography has been performed. The co-monomer of the PE resins was found to play a significant role in the formation and the orientation of spherulite-like domains. The film cross-section microstructure has been evaluated qualitatively by using both AFM and PLM. However, quantitative analysis of bulk morphology cannot be obtained due to knife effects.</description><creator>Tang, Zuojian, 1967-</creator><contributor>Kamal, M. R.

The Bayer process, developed in 1888, involves the extraction of alumina (Al2O3) from bauxite. One of the key stage of Bayer process is the crystallization of aluminum trihydroxide (Al(OH) 3), an intermediate product from which alumina is obtained by dehydration. Crystallization behavior and the morphology of aluminum trihydroxide depend strongly on the reactor temperature, the supersaturation defined by the concentration ratio of soluble [Al2O3]/[Na2O], noted as A/C ratio, and the presence of impurities. This crystallization behavior of aluminum trihydroxide was examined at various temperatures, initial concentration ratios of [Al2O3]/[Na2O] and concentrations of titanium oxide and ferric oxide as impurities. The X-ray diffraction analysis showed that only gibbsite, a polymorph of Al(OH)3, was produced at the end of all the experiments. An increase in the temperature, as well as an increase of the initial A/C ratio, resulted in an augmentation of the slurry density and the particle size distribution. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of aluminum trhydroxide crystals revealed that the presence of titanium oxide favored the production of the small single crystals minimizing agglomeration. In the case of ferric oxide, the agglomerates were formed but showed a decrease of the average diameter as compared with the crystals formed without any impurities. Zeta-potential and settling velocity of aluminum trihydroxide in the presence and absence of impurities were also measured.</description><creator>Dumortier, Remy.</creator><date>2000</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Crystallization of aluminum trihydroxide : evolution of the morphology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dp23x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w156p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214q99t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:58:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Refractive-index profile reconstruction methods for optical slab (direct and inverse analysis methods) and channel (inverse analysis method) waveguides are proposed and compared. Both methods are based on the output near-field measurement at the cleaved edge of a waveguide. Theoretical simulations of each method are demonstrated. Effects of noise and of the optical imaging system are taken into account and are minimized. As an application, the near-field patterns of planar and channel optical waveguides fabricated by purely thermal K+-Na+ ion-exchange in soda-lime glass substrates are measured using a CCD camera. The resultant refractive-index profiles of the slab waveguide samples are then compared with data obtained by optical characterizations done by others. Index profiles of channel waveguide samples are also reconstructed. A Runge-Kutta (RK) method and a One-Dimensional Finite-Difference Method (1D-FDM) are used to model planar waveguides, while an Effective-Index Method (EIM) and a variable grid 2D-FDM are implemented to model channel waveguides.</description><creator>Fung, Hak Keung, 1975-</creator><contributor>Pavlasek, Tomas J.

Compression specimens, with diameters of 7.6 mm and lengths of 11.4 mm, were prepared from four Nb microalloyed steels containing a range of Si concentrations from 0.01 wt% to 0.41 wt%. The stress relaxation method was used in the beginning of this work, but the majority of the experimental results were derived from double-hit compression tests, with a strain of 0.3 applied to represent each pass at a strain rate of 0.1/sec. A solution heat treatment was applied immediately prior to each test. It was found that the rate of Nb(C,N) precipitation in hot deformed austenite increases with Si concentration. This phenomenon is attributed to the increases in both the Nb diffusivity and the activities of C and N that result from Si addition. Based on the Dutta and Sellars model, an expression for the effect of strain rate on the precipitation start time has been proposed. The present experimental results can then be extrapolated to mill conditions.</description><creator>Dong, Jin Xiang, 1961-</creator><contributor>Jonas, J. J.

Our co-design approach aims at shortening the design cycle and requires a separation of the internal behavior from the interface behavior for the design blocks. We propose to use, SystemC, a recently introduced description language. SystemC promises a homogeneous design flow and allows to take advantage of C++ expressiveness to model the system. An approach for abstracting and synthesizing the interfaces is proposed. A methodology that minimizes the coding effort to reach the synthesized hardware and compiled software from the high-level model, while simplifying the mapping of the blocks during architecture exploration and providing opportunities for IP reuse, is proposed. The approach is validated through a set-top box case study.</description><creator>Fayad, Ghassan.</creator><contributor>Zilic, Z. (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Negulescu, R.

As a result of the sedentarization process, which started in the beginning of 1970's, the Bedouins moved from a nomadic to sedentary life-style in which their customs, their houses, and their ethnic habits were deeply influenced. Their new settlements remind more of the Jordanian suburban landscape that characterizes most of the urban centers. These settlements provided them with dwelling units influenced by some of the western planning models. To explore the issue of housing design policies of the Bedouins population, the author conducted an extensive literature review that deals with the complexity of the relation between culture, housing, identity, and user participation. It highlighted the process of sedentarization and its impact on their housing environments. The received literature, was supplemented by a field case study that aimed at showing to what extent the permanence of tradition and change can be perceived in the variety of modifications and extensions carried out by the Bedouins as users of the government built housing, projects. It also, aimed to investigate what kind of transformation the Bedouins introduced to their traditional habits while moving from nomadic life-style to the permanent settlement. The case study of Bedoul housing settlement (Um Sayhun), shows that the Bedouin families life-style has became more diversified between traditions and modernity. The inappropriate housing environment design tend to influence the way the Bedouins use the living spaces in their houses. The thesis pointed out the role of community participation in enhancing the Bedouins understanding of the different issues related to their housing and their sense of identity.</description><creator>Tarawneh, Musa.</creator><contributor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Bedouins -- Jordan -- Housing.</subject><subject>Bedouins -- Jordan -- Dwellings.</subject><title>House form and cultural identity : the case of Bedouin housing in southern Jordan</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bn59z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gf82p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vq37j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:58:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Building with glass, Mies van der Rohe expressed his singular vision of glass---almost nothing. Among the few things that remain in his minimalist domestic space, the body of a female sculpture holds conspicuous opacity. To seek the signification of this opacity in the transparency of Mies's architecture, this thesis analyzes his design drawings and the photographs of his buildings through a phenomenological reading. The juxtaposition and a parallel development between the presence of the opaque body and the view of glass throughout the evolution of his glass house are discovered. The discovery brings to light the finding that the opaque body is an irreducible substance in fulfilling Mies's ideal of modern house. This opacity in transparency reveals the maternal materiality that is the essence of human dwelling. Three chapters constitute this thesis, Chapter 1 introduces Mies's vision of glass and its representations; chapter 2 examines various views of the architect's glass house designs in drawings and photographs; chapter 3 explores the significance of the inherent opacity in Mies's design philosophy of modern house.</description><creator>Wu, Xin, 1970-</creator><contributor>Adams, Annmarie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Architecture, Domestic.</subject><subject>Mies van der Rohe, Ludwig, 1886-1969.</subject><subject>Glass construction.</subject><title>Opacity in transparency : from drawings and photographs of the modern domestic spaces by Mies van der Rohe</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b791w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vq37j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mc87ps282</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:58:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Carlo Lodoli (1690--1761), architect, storyteller, and generally caustic individual, was a friar at San Francesco della Vigna in Venice, where he offered non-professional lessons in architecture. In his garden, he had collected a series of architectural fragments for use in his dialogues with students. He would use the fragments as examples of good and bad architecture to allow for his peripatetic teachings. These lessons, described by his faithful student Andrea Memmo as talking in images were sweeping, often ethical. As the Socratic Lodoli did not commit to text any formal treatise, we must look to his student's interpretations and various built projects. It is within these traces we begin to discover Lodoli's proposal for a non-reductive functional architecture based upon the imagination. By looking into this performing aspect of function we may begin to realize an architecture that both invites and constitutes essential meaning.</description><creator>Neveu, Marc J.</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Functionalism (Architecture)</subject><subject>Lodoli, Carlo, 1690-1761.</subject><title>Architecture-as, an ethics of function</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th31m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87ps282</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45qb689</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:58:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this essay I look at the significance of Inigo Jones's annotated copy of Andrea Palladio's I quattro libri dell'architettura in a time of momentous change in the habits of readers and writers, printers and publishers, architects and kings.

The feed enzymes tested containing xylanase activities failed to produce any positive performance response when used in a 10% flaxseed diet with manufacturer recommended dosage for broilers (D 1 to 21). Autoclaving of flaxseed at 16.5 kg/cm2 and 120°C for 15 min slightly improved the performance of young broilers fed a 10% flaxseed diet. This improvement was not observed at lower temperature and shorter period of autoclaving, but was magnified at higher flaxseed level. Autoclaving, microwave roasting, pelleting significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced HCN content in flaxseed. The greatest HCN reduction was observed with repeated pelleting (54.9%) and microwave roasting (83.2%), from its 377 mg/kg of raw flaxseed. When tested with roosters, flaxseed processing effectively increased ME values, dry matter, and ether extract utilization. The raw flaxseed TME and TMEn of 3343 and 3225 kcal/kg, respectively, was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) increased by repeated pelleting (44%) and microwave roasting (32%). It was the result of significant improvement (P &lt; 0.05) of EE utilization by the relevant processing. These improvements had a similar effect on total FA and linolenic acid utilization. The processing method and flaxseed level had a very significant effect on deposition of total T-3 FAs in breast and thigh meat (P &lt; 0.001) of 40 days old broilers. The highest level of T-3 FAs in muscle lipids of 23.04% and 26.46% for breast and thigh, respectively, was achieved with the highest flaxseed level (14% in days 1 to 21 days, and 17% in days 22--40) and pellet-then-mash processing, which lead to low T-6/T-3 ratios of 0.81 and 0.80 in breast and thigh muscle lipid, respectively. The proper flaxseed processing allowed more flaxseed (up to 12%) to be included in broiler diets without obvious growth depression, while achieving the higher desired T-3 FAs deposition in meat.</description><creator>Shen, Yingran, 1964-</creator><contributor>Chavez, E.

With more emphasis being placed on community-based services, it has been advocated that more importance should be placed on early supported discharge for stroke patients. Studies have shown that early supported discharge is as effective as conventional care. However, very few of these studies have associated costs. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of prompt discharge with home rehabilitation compared with usual post acute care for stroke patients. A cost effectiveness analysis was performed on data originating from a prior randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of prompt discharge combined with home rehabilitation. Information on health care utilization and the associated costs were obtained from the Quebec Health Insurance Board and determined for the first three months following discharge. Scores from the Short Form 36 health survey were used as the measure for effectiveness. Results demonstrated that early supported discharge with home rehabilitation is a cost effective alternative to conventional hospital discharge procedures.</description><creator>Teng, Josephine, 1973-</creator><contributor>Mayo, Nancy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Health Care Management.</subject><title>Early supported discharge for stroke patients : a cost effectiveness analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mp19k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579v11w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6d56zz42h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:58:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A study is performed to assess the utility of a computer numerically controlled (CNC) mill to produce missing tissue compensating filters and for the delivery of intensity-modulated beams for inverse treatment planning. A computer aided machining (CAM) software is used to assist in the design and construction of such filters. Geometric measurements of stepped and wedged surfaces are made to examine the accuracy of surface milling. Results show that the deviation of the filter surfaces from design does not exceed 1.5%. Effective attenuation coefficients are measured for CadFree and Cerrobend in a 6 MV photon beam. The ability of the CNC mill to accurately produce surfaces is further verified with dose profile measurements in a 6 MV photon beam. Dose profiles, measured beneath the test phantoms and beneath a flat phantom are compared to those produced by a commercial treatment planning system. Agreement between measured and predicted profiles is within 2%, indicating the viability of the system for filter production.</description><creator>Thompson, Heather K.</creator><contributor>Fallone, B.

As a result, numerous research initiatives involving fluidic, molecular, and quantum computing are in full gear. This thesis discusses the aforementioned alternate computing methods by presenting the advantages those methods enjoy over their digital counterparts. The current state of the industry and the roadblocks encountered in physically implementing such alternate computing devices are also presented. Finally, in order to display the power of such concepts, fluidic systems that may be capable of cracking certain cryptographic algorithms as well as solving complex graphical problems such as the travelling salesman problem in a fraction of the time it would take digital computers, are presented.</description><creator>Siourbas, Constantin.</creator><contributor>Whitesides, Sue (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Microfluidic informatics : an alternative model of computation for the solution of intractable problems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042v80g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hm06m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05fd657</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:58:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to image diffusion in liquids, such as water in brain structures. Molecular diffusion can be isotropic or anisotropic, depending on the fluid's environment, and can therefore be characterized by a scalar, D, or by a tensor, D, in the respective cases. For anisotropic environments, the eigenvector of D corresponding to the largest eigenvalue indicates the preferred direction of diffusion. This thesis describes the design and implementation of diffusion tensor imaging on a clinical MRI system. An acquisition sequence was designed and post-processing software developed to create diffusion trace images, scalar anisotropy maps, and anisotropy vector maps. A number of practical imaging problems were addressed and solved, including optimization of sequence parameters, accounting for flow effects, and dealing with eddy currents, patient motion, and ghosting. Experimental validation of the sequence was performed by calculating the trace of the diffusion tensor measured in various isotropic liquids. The results agreed very well with the quantitative values found in the literature, and the scalar anisotropy index was also found to be correct in isotropic phantoms. Anisotropy maps, showing the preferred direction of diffusion, were generated in human brain in vivo. These showed the expected white matter tracts in the corpus callosum.</description><creator>Campbell, Jennifer, 1975-</creator><contributor>Pike, G.
