It was not only the inquisitive interest in discovery, the lust for adventure, and the sudden patriotic fervour that sent the little wooden ships across the Atlantic to Canada, from France and later from England, to poke tentatively around the Maritime coast and sail up the St. Lawrence; it was trade. In the same way that the famous East India and French East India Companies with their strong mercantile backing opened India and the treasures of the East to Europe, so French businessmen (such as DeChastes, Delients, and LaSalle) and the Hudson’s Bay and North West Trading Companies were responsible for the opening and early development of Canada. At every step we find a trading interest responsible for Canadian growth. Indeed, on many an occasion, such as the dispute between Frontenac and Bishop Laval over the liquor trade with the Indians, and Governor Murray’s trouble with the merchants, the domestic interest of the colony came into conflict with the trading interest, controlled from abroad; and the latter usually won out.

Myocardial damage was usually induced by coronary artery ligature. Significant protection was achieved by ligature of either the left or right coronary artery one week prior to the isoproterenol injection (P &lt;0.01 for the left ventricle). Previous isoproterenol administration also provided significant grade of protection (P &lt;0.05) in the one group tested. Necrosis of another organ in the body (kidney infarct) afforded no protection. Adrenal regeneration hypertension markedly increased the animals’ sensitivity to isoproterenol. In a subsequent study, the time relationship of protection produced by ventricular infarct was followed. It was found that protection appears as early as 24 hours after coronary artery ligature, but recedes later in the course of healing, there being almost no signs of a protective effect after one month. In the third experiment, the possible role of endogenous catecholamines in protection was sought in animals treated with reserpine, iproniazid (Marsilid R) and by a combination of both. No significant differences from the control group were found.</description><creator>Dusek, Jaroslav</creator><contributor>Klassen, G.

Foetal distress is an obscure term requiring further research towards establishment of a precise definition. The progress in physiology and pathophysiology favours a biochemical definition of foetal distress as being a metabolic or respiratory acidosis. Acidosis in the foetus may be determined by scalp sampling and measurement of blood gases. By routine use of this technique in obstetrical units, it is hoped that the stillbirth rate will be decreased, the apgar score at birth will.be increased, and mental retardation with or without neurological deficit will also be decreased. Other areas of research will blossom from the availability of the foetus for study, such as the physiology of the foetal pancreas.</description><creator>Desjardins, Paul</creator><contributor>Maughan, G.

In most of the free transplants, the articular cartilage ultimately was completely destroyed, whereas in those with a preserved blood supply normal structure was retained. S35incorporation studies in free whole joint transplants in rabbits demonstrated normal uptake in the grafted articular cartilage up to four to five weeks. Beyond twelve weeks, there was marked decrease to eventual complete absence of uptake. Free hemi-joint transplants in dogs showed a somewhat slower pattern of deterioration but similar to that of the whole joint transplants. Analysis of the above results suggests that post transplantation ischemia is the principle factor in the ultimate articular degeneration and that this is mediated through its effect on the subchondral circulation. In addition altered mechanics seem to play an important secondary role.</description><creator>Daniel, George A.</creator><contributor>Entin, M.

Evidence indicates gastrointestinal hormones mediate the response. Mostly on the basis of in vivo studies, it is thought that secretin and enteric glucagon mediate the effect during glucose absorption and pancreozymin and pancreatic glucagon probably are involved during amino acid absorption. Gastrin may produce secretin release and act indirectly. The present studies were performed using isolated islets of Langerhans of the rat obtained according to the method of Lacy and Kostianovsky. Secret in and glucagon have been demonstrated to produce insulin release at both 50 and 300 mg% glucose. Gastrin was without effect. Pancreozymin produced insulin release at 300 but not 50 mg% glucose. Arginine produced insulin release at both 50 and 300 mg% glucose but leucine was without significant effect. The significance of these findings in relation to in vivo findings is discussed and the need for further work is stressed.</description><creator>Curtis, James D.</creator><contributor>Dupre, J.

We have demonstrated that bound HGH is immunoreacti ve; but that its reactive sites are partially blocked by the binding protein at least when HGH concentration is in the physiologic range. Indeed, the precipitation of α2-M by a specific G-globulin resulted in the appearance of a greater quantity of HGH in the supernatants than in the initial sera. Furthermore, by incubating fluorescein-tagged HGH with normal, acromegalic and hypopituitary sera, we demonstrated with chromatographic studies on Sephadex G-200 an inverse relationship between the endogenous HGH plasma concentration and the percentage of binding of FITC-tagged HGH to α2-M "in vitro". We have also shown the existence of an influence of HGH on the metabolism of α2-M allowing us to propose a role for α2-M in the growth promoting effect of HGH. The variations of α2-M levels observed after administration of HGH to 3 normal subjects and 8 hypopituitary patients, could represent the overall result of an equilibrium between synthesis of α2-M and its utilization as a "building block" of connective tissue, both synthesis and peripheral utilization being influenced by HGH.</description><creator>Collu, Robert</creator><contributor>Leboeuf, G.

Although the study fell short of isolating the active principle(s), it succeeded in obtaining a highly purified tannin-tree fraction by silica gel G and sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. According to the thin layer chromatography, the active tractions so obtained still contain at least 4 - 8 substances. The antihistamine-like activity of the purified oak gall extract was compared to that of tomatine and gomatine in the guinea pigs. All three substances significantly inhibited histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. Tomatine and gomatine significantly reduced the effects of both histamine and bradykinin but the purified oak gall extract only antagonized the histaminic affects. Gomatine and the purified oak gall extract but not tomatine exerted anti-anaphylactic activity.

Three different techniques were used to accomplish labeling: 1. single injection, 2. a 4-day administration in drinking water and 3.continuous infusion up to 10 days. One-µ thick, Epon-embedded, single or seriaI sections were stained with Regaud's iron-hematoxylin, radioautographed and counterstained with safranin O. Paneth cells were shown to be a distinct cell type independent of columnar or goblet cells. They did not divide but arose by transformation of a precursor cell which is believed to be the intercalated columnar cell. The Paneth cell population was a slowly renewing one with a turnover rate of 14-16 days. The population consisted mostly of mature cells which differed from young newly-formed ones in their granular and nuclear characteristics. The maturation process consisted of gradual changes in the granules and nucleus.</description><creator>Cheng, Hazel P.</creator><contributor>Leblond, C.

On the average, one micron separated a colloid droplet from the nearest dense body. TSH did not significantly affect these values. 2) Colloid droplets varied in density between gray and white. The lighter droplets showed matrix filaments of a size similar to reported dimensions of thyroglobulin crystals. Density variation may represent stages of thyroglobulin digestion. 3) The relative infrequency and non-specificity of close association of dense bodies with colloid droplets, and the absence of electron density changes in colloid near dense bodies, suggest there is possibly only a minor contribution by dense bodies of enzymes for colloid droplet degradation.</description><creator>Adams, James R.</creator><contributor>Nadler, N.

Pretreatment for one half hour with phenelzine (40 mg./kg. i.p.) prolonged the mean ethanol sleeping time in mice by more than 350%, but, unexpectedly, decreased the toxicity of ethanol, as reflected in a change of LD 50 from a control value of 4.14g./kg. to 5.16 g./kg. A partial explanation of these results was thought to reside in the effect of phenelzine on the rate of ethanol degradation. Determinations of ethanol concentrations in whole mice over a 4 hour period indicated that phenelzine caused a 43% increase in the time required to eliminate one half the amount of ethanol initially injected. Acetaldehyde concentrations after ethanol were found to be lower in phenelzine pretreated mice. In vitro, phenelzine inhibited the oxidative activity of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase by a competitive interaction with both DPN+ and ethanol at enzymic receptor sites. In contrast, the inhibition of liver alcohol dehydrogenase by phenelzine was competitive with + DPN only, and non-competitive with respect to ethanol.</description><creator>Wade, Daniel J.</creator><contributor>Trifaro, J.

Although no experimental arthritis satisfactorily resembles  human rheumatoid arthritis, adjuvant polyarthritis appears to be highly promising because of its systemic manifestations, the clinical course, the migratory polyarthritis, the serological alterations, the roentgenologic changes and the histology. The disease is reproduced by a single subcutaneous injection of the rat’s tail with 0.8 mg. of dead mycobacterium butyricum suspended in 0.1 ml. paraffin oil.</description><creator>Zahiri, Hormoz</creator><contributor>Laurin, C.

A single dose of cortisone caused a significant increase in plasma histamine level. Cortisone also increased the level of blood glucose. When cortisone induced hyperglycemia was abolished by the injection of insulin, no rise in the level of plasma histamine occurred. The increase in plasma histamine level following a single cortisone injection could be duplicated by the administration of glucose. These results suggest that the increase in plasma histamine concentration induced by cortisone was mediated by the hyperglycemic effect of cortisone. The chronic administration of cortisone or glucose over a period of 10 days showed that both substances decreased tissue histamine. Histamine depletion by cortisone was greater than that caused by glucose and could be partially blocked by daily injections of insulin.</description><creator>Suffiad, Kader</creator><contributor>Kovacs, E.

When 14C-I5α-hydroxyandrostenedione was incubated with a fortified human placental 10,000xg supernatant fraction, the major metabolite was 15α-hydroxyestradiol, while smaller amounts of 15α-hydroxytestosterone and 15α-hydroxyandrostenedione were also detected. When the human placenta was perfused in situ with the same substrate, 15α-hydroxyestradiol was isolated from the placenta and perfusate while 15α-hydroxyestrone and 15α-hydroxyandrostenedione were found only in the perfusate. In view of the presence of neutral and phenolic 15α-hydroxysteroids in late pregnancy urine, it can be concluded that 15α-hydroxyestrogens are partly derived from neutral 15α-hydroxysteroids by placental aromatization. Furthermore, in the perfusion studies the distribution of metabolites isolated from the placenta and perfusate indicates that 15α-hydroxyestradiol is bound to placental tissue.</description><creator>Stern, Michael D.</creator><contributor>Solomon, S.

It is presented in two sections and Section l is sub-divided into two parts. The first part of Section I deals with the effect of unilateral vagotomy in the rat. Unilateral vagotomy reduced the spontaneous secretion of gastric juice in the pylorus-ligated rat. The mean acid output after unilateral vagotomy was significantly smaller than the acid output in control rats, and significantly greater than the mean acid output after bilateral vagotomy. Similar differences were observed whether unilateral vagotomy was performed in the abdomen at the time of pyloric ligation, or in the neck one week prior to pyloric ligation. Part two of Section l is concerned with the effect of unilateral vagotomy on dogs with a gastric fistula, following sham-feeding and gastrin infusions. Difference between pre- and post-unilateral vagotomy results only became apparent at the upper levels of stimulation. Explanations have been advanced for the results but the gross reduction may represent the sum of a number of different effects. It is suggested that only ‘maximal stimuli’ may be useful experimentally and clinically for differentiating varying degrees of partial denervation of the stomach. In Section II the effect of immunosympathectomy on gastric secretion is considered in the rat. The immunologically suppressed sympathetic nervous system gives rise to an increased incidence of gastric glandular ulceration in pylorus ligated rats. This is accompanied by a decreased mucus content in the gastric juice with no appreciable change in acid or pepsin output. Adrenaline treatment of these animals seems to reverse the ulcerogenic effects of sympathetic ablation and restores mucus production to normal and above normal levels.</description><creator>Rivilis, Jeffrey</creator><contributor>Wlodek, G.

An outline has been given to the previous methods of studies, It is concluded that: There is pelvic perestalsis. The frequency of contraction of the renal pelvis is greater than that of its corresponding ureter .The average intrapelvic contraction pressure is lower than ureter. The amplitude of contraction wave is higher in the upper and middle third of the ureter than in the lower third. The pelvic "Pacemaker" exists. The ureteric contraction wave in lower third is higher in Paraplegics than in non-Paraplegics. The electrical impulse in the pelvis and ureter precedes the contraction wave. The actual electrical impulse giving rise to the contraction wave in the ureter is preceded by several smaller impulses. Recommendation has been made for improvement of material and technique for future experiments.</description><creator>Parvin, Mohamad</creator><contributor>MacLean, J.

The present study was undertaken to determine whether a significant decrease in the extracellular water volume occurs in experimental hemorrhagic shock or in a series of patients with septic shock. Multiple isotope dilution techniques were employed for simultaneous measurement of the total body water (TBW), ECW and plasma volume. In addition, red cell mass vas measured in many of the human studies. In hemorrhagic shock multiple tracers of varying function and molecular size were used. Deficits observed were not statistically significant and could be accounted for byvascular compartment loss due to the withdrawal of blood samples. In 11 patients in septic shock the observation of an increased ECW and increased total exchangeable Sodium not associated with an increase in TBW has been recorded. In addition, no correlation was found between this observation and the more usually performed tests of hemodynamic and metabolic functions in the shock patient. These studies do not support the concept of selective extracellular fluid deficits in hemorrhagic shock or septic shock. Unwarranted infusion of large amounts of salt-containing solutions should be avoided unless further scientific support for their use can be obtained.</description><creator>Lopez, Gilberto A.</creator><contributor>Gutelius, J.

After delivery, the placenta, umbilical cord, and ten fetal tissues from two male fetus, gestational age 21 weeks, were selected for the isolation of labeled metabolites. A total of eight unconjugated metabolites of progesterone were isolated and identified. The reduced metabolites were 20α-dihydroprogesterone, pregnanolone, 3β-hydroxy-pregnan-20-one and pregnanediol; the hydroxylated metabolites identified were 6β-hydroxyprogesterone, 16α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and hydrocortisone. These results demonstrated that the human fetus at midterm pregnancy can actively transfom progesterone reaching it from the placenta into a number of reduced and hydroxylated metabolites and that the fetal adrenal and the liver were the most active sites of this metabolism.</description><creator>Ling, William Y.</creator><contributor>Solomon, S.

The umbilical circulation was left intact for 10 minutes after which time a number of fetal tissues and the placenta were analyzed for labeled metabolites of progesterone. Eight metabolites were identified and these are: allopregnanedione from placenta, pregnanolone from liver and intestine, 3β-hydroxy-sα-pregnan-20-one from testes, lung and placenta, 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one and pregnanediol from liver, 20α-dihydroprogestarone from intestine and lung, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone from adrenal and testes, and androstenedione from adrenal. From this data it was concluded that progesterone is mainly metabolized to reduced products by the placenta and fetal tissues of pregnant Rhesus monkey. In contrast to the human fetus, conjugation of metabolites with sulfuric or glucuronic acid does not occur to any extent in fetal tissues of the Rhesus monkey.</description><creator>Leung, Kiu</creator><contributor>Solomon, S.

Their maximum histamine stimulation tests and perorally obtained duodenal cap biopsies were compared to those of patients suffering from proven duodenal ulcer, functional dyspepsia and to those of a group of normal controls. Patients with typical duodenal ulcer symptoms without radiological evidence of ulcer had normal maximum histamine tests but their duodenal biopsies showed inflammatory changes comparable to those of patients with proven duodenal ulcers. The ulcer group had, in addition, elevated maximum histamine test results. Normal controls and patients with “functional dyspepsia" had normal maximum histamine tests and normal biopsies.
