Sphere Decoder (SD) is a low complexity Maximum Likelihood (ML) method of  decoding LD codes. Using Subspace Matched Filtering principles, two complexity  reducing front-ends to any variant of the SD, are developed. These two-stage  decoders are designed to only have marginally worse performance than  SD. Computer simulations confirm the lower complexity and close to  ML performance of the two-stage decoders. For a two transmit and two receive antenna  LD coded MIMO system at an SNR of 22dB, the two-stage decoder reduces the average  size of the SD search tree by a factor of 5. The BER performance of the two-stage  decoder is within 0.25dB of the ML performance.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper  copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).</description><creator>Bergeron-Burns, Philippe</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Reduced complexity decoding for multiple antenna wireless communications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913q465.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322d91p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jp249</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Modelica is a recently developed object-oriented language for  physical systems modeling. It is a modern language built on non-causal modeling with  mathematical equations and object-oriented constructs. An open source research prototype compiler for muModelica, a  subset of Modelica, is presented. The compiler takes textual Modelica source as  input, translates it into flat Modelica, then performs a series of symbolic  transformations on the differential-algebraic equations, most notably, assigning  causality, and generates input suitable for processing by a numerical simulator such  as Octave. Design and implementation issues of the muModelica compiler are  discussed in some detail in this thesis. These issues include the general  architecture of the compiler, semantic analysis, formula manipulation, and code  generation. Some advanced formula manipulation techniques are also studied, and are  proposed to be implemented as future work.</description><creator>Xu, Weigao, 1974-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>The design and implementation of the [mu]Modelica compiler /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sq673.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jp249</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811kk15k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Functional RNA sequences typically have structural elements that  are highly conserved during evolution.

Furthermore, we performed a comparative analysis on pairing  probability matrices of a set of aligned orthologous sequences and predicted the  conserved secondary structure. Our alignment method outperforms the most widely used  multiple alignment tool - Clustal W, and the structure prediction approach we  proposed can generate a more accurate secondary structure for 5S rRNA compared to  the existing approaches such as Alifold.

This thesis reports efforts to apply surface complexation modeling to  agricultural and forest soil and to relate model parameters to common soil  properties. This study considered Ca, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn but the methods here could  be applied to other metals. In Chapter 2, the surface charge and adsorption  behaviour of a set of Ap horizons was characterised using back-titration and batch  adsorption techniques. With the objective of simplifying the application of the  NICCA model to surface charge and cation adsorption in whole soils the parameters of  the NICCA model were related to soil properties (Chapter 3). Four of the six surface  charge parameters could be predicted from soil properties and this enabled me to  reasonably predict the surface charge of a second group of soils from soil  properties. These results suggest that it is possible to make reasonable predictions  about the surface charge and adsorption behaviour of a given type of soil using some  easily measurable soil properties and a set of generic NICCA adsorption parameters  for that soil type. In Chapter 4 this idea is applied to the determination of lime  requirement for the agricultural soils.</description><creator>Taillon, Kate</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Soil absorption and adsorption -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Soils -- Trace element content.</subject><subject>Soils -- Heavy metal content.</subject><subject>Forest soils.</subject><title>Modeling surface complexation relationships in forest and agricultural soil</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558d84h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f171g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5t34sk14h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>On 18 June 2002, the anomalous X-ray pulsar 1E 2259+586  underwent a major X-ray outburst that lasted several hours and consequently linked  AXPs to the class of magnetar-candidates known as soft gamma repeaters (SGRs). Three  days after the outburst, observations with the Gemini Observatory showed a  near-infrared flux enhancement, presumably associated with the X-ray activity. We  have since performed a ~1.5 year monitoring program of the Ks band (2.5 mum)  photometry, and find that the flux decreased continually, reaching its pre-burst  level after about one year. Comparing both the near-IR flux increase and subsequent  decay to those of the X-ray afterglow, we find them to be remarkably consistent.  This correlated post-burst activity confirms the association between the X-ray  outburst and IR enhancement, and implies a physical link between their origins. In  the context of the magnetar model, both types of emission appear to be from the  neutron star magnetosphere, although the mechanism powering IR radiation is still  unclear. We also compare our results to recent optical/IR observations of other  AXPs.</description><creator>Tam, Cindy R.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics.</subject><title>Monitoring of post-outburst near-infrared flux from the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1E 2259+586</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322d937.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sk14h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rf55z832m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Face recognition from 3D shape information has been proposed as  a method of biometric identification in recent times. This thesis presents a 3D face  recognition system capable of recognizing the identity of an individual from his/her  3D facial scan in any pose across the view-sphere, by suitably comparing it with a  set of models stored in a database. The system makes use of only 3D shape  information ignoring textural information completely. Firstly, the thesis proposes a generic learning strategy using  support vector regression [11] to estimate the approximate pose of a 3D scan. The  support vector machine (SVM) is trained on range images in several poses, belonging  to a small set of individuals. This thesis also examines the relationship between  size of the range image and the accuracy of the pose prediction from the  scan. Secondly, a hierarchical two-step strategy is proposed to  normalize a facial scan to a nearly frontal pose before performing recognition. The  first step consists of a coarse normalization making use of either the spatial  relationships between salient facial features or the generic learning algorithm  using the SVM. This is followed by an iterative technique to refine the alignment to  the frontal pose, which is basically an improved form of the Iterated Closest Point  Algorithm [17]. The latter step produces a residual error value, which can be used  as a metric to gauge the similarity between two faces. Our two-step approach is  experimentally shown to outdo both the individual normalization methods in terms of  recognition rates, over a very wide range of facial poses. Our strategy has been  tested on a large database of 3D facial scans in which the training and test images  of each individual were acquired at significantly different times, unlike several  existing 3D face recognition methods.</description><creator>Rajwade, Ajit</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Facial pose estimation and face recognition from three-dimensional data</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418n76f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z832m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3484zh40n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Knowledge of optimum concentrations and ratios of major  nutrients in tree foliage is required to assess the nutrient status of the boreal  forest.

MAPK signaling pathways include  the ERK, p38 and JNK cascades. All MAPK family members are activated by the dual  phosphorylation of a tripeptide motif located in their activation loop. JNK is  phosphorylated and activated by two upstream MAPKKs, termed MKK4 and MKK7. These  kinases are themselves activated through phosphorylation of serine/threonine  residues in their activation loop by upstream MAPKKKs. MKK7 is thought to be  activated primarily by cytokines while MKK4 is primarily activated by environmental  stress. For my M.Sc. project, I have validated and characterized several  phospho-MKK7 specific antibodies directed against MKK7 Ser271, Thr275 and Ser277,  which are phospho-acceptor residues located in the MKK7 activation loop. By  producing MKK7 mutant constructs in which each of the phospho-acceptor sites were  substituted with Ala or Asp, I have demonstrated that we succeeded in generating  phosphospecific antibodies against each of the phospho-acceptor sites. Of the three  sites, only Thr275 is regulated by external stimuli whereas Ser271 and Ser277 appear  to be constitutively phosphorylated. Both TNFoc and sorbitol treatment induce  phosphorylation of the Thr275 residue in MKK7 activation loop; surprisingly, our  results show that osmotic stress activates MKK7 more strongly than TNFa. By using  RNA interference and immunoprecipitation, we have demonstrated that in endogenously  expressed MKK7, Ser271 and Ser277 are constitutively phosphorylated while Thr275 is  stimuli-regulated. Together, these studies provide fundamental new insights into  MKK7 regulation in mammalian cells.</description><creator>Montcalm, Samuel</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>New insights into MKK7 regulation in mammalian cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jf32c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zx06f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hc79h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular tumor in adults.  Despite advances in the accuracy of diagnosis, the ten-year mortality rate for  patients has remained constant at approximately fifty percent. This indicates that a  further understanding of the biological mechanisms behind this malignancy is  required. Our laboratory utilizes five human uveal melanoma cell lines  (92.1, MKT-BR, OCM-1, SP-6.5, UW-1) that have a previously described metastatic  potential from an animal model (MP). We used four methods to characterize the  proliferation rate of these five cell lines. We also used a Matrigel invasion assay  to assess the invasive ability of the same cell lines in response to the potential  chemo-attractants: interleukin-6, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, and Fetal  Bovine Serum. From these results we were able to propose a novel  classification system for our cell lines: high proliferation and high invasion/high  MP, low proliferation and low invasion/low MP, and high proliferation and  invasion/no MP. From these results we were able to propose a novel  classification system for our cell lines: high proliferation and high invasion/high  MP, low proliferation and low invasion/low MP, and high proliferation and  invasion/no MP.</description><creator>Marshall, Jean-Claude</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>The proliferative and invasive capabilities of five human uveal melanoma cell lines /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf114.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hc79h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v405s987h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>I used microsatellite markers to assess reproductive isolation between cryptic, sympatric lineages of a freshwater catfish (Pimelodella chagresi ). These are "cryptic" lineages because they cannot be distinguished visually on the basis of morphological characters, and currently they are recognized as a single species. Previous analyses utilizing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) indicated that two highly divergent lineages are present in lower Central America, and that these lineages are the result of independent colonization events from South American source populations. I isolated eight dinucleotide repeats from P. chagresi and designed primers to amplify these microsatellite loci. I sampled fishes from four Panamanian watersheds. The congruence of microsatellite data with mtDNA indicated that these taxa are reproductively isolated and should be considered as separate species despite the lack of morphological differentiation. Both lineages exhibit a high degree of divergence among populations inhabiting isolated freshwater drainages, but the lineages differ in their intra-watershed population structure.</description><creator>Moeser, Andrew A.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Pimelodella chagresi -- Variation -- Panama</subject><subject>Pimelodella chagresi -- Panama -- Classification -- Molecular aspects</subject><subject>Pimelodella chagresi -- Panama -- Molecular genetics</subject><title>Genetic analyses of sympatric cryptic species in the Neotropical catfish, Pimelodella chagresi</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g074n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405s987h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:000000574</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to explore aboriginal perspectives  of diabetes, nutrition and health so as to eventually develop culturally-appropriate  means of implementing diabetes prevention and intervention activities.

Intriguingly, in the absence of stimuli, the DosR regulon is constitutively over-expressed in Beijing lineage strains (72).  Expression of the DosR regulon is controlled by the DosR/DosS/DosT two-component system (TCS).  Analysis of Beijing (n=26) and non-Beijing (n=50) isolates revealed a frameshift mutation in the dosT gene that is restricted to the most recently evolved Beijing sub-lineages (groups 2 to 5).  The presence of this mutation is positively correlated to the level of dosR expression under normal growth conditions.  However, expression of mutant dosT in a non-Beijing strain did not increase dosR expression and complementation of Beijing strains with wild-type dosT did not reverse the DosR regulon phenotype, together indicating that the dosT mutation is not directly responsible for DosR regulon over-expression in Beijing strains.  When Beijing isolates were exposed to a NO-donor known to induce dosR expression, dosT mutant strains exhibited a decreased response to NO compared to wild-type dosT strains, while strains complemented with wild-type dosT had an increased response to a NO-donor.  The dosT frameshift appears to be a compensatory mutation that may act to limit further induction of the DosR regulon in response to stimuli like NO.  This work shows that M. tuberculosis strains are variable in their response to signals encountered during host infection and further characterizes the unique biochemical features of the Beijing lineage.</description><description>Le régulon de dormance (DosR) de Mycobacterium tuberculosis est normalement induit en réponse à l'hypoxie ou à l'oxide nitrique (NO).  Étonnament, parmi les souches bactériennes de la lignée Beijing, le régulon DosR est surexprimé même en l'absence de stimulus (72).  L'expression du régulon DosR est contrôlée par le système à deux composantes DosR/DosS/DosT.  L'analyse d'isolats des lignées Beijing (n=26) ou non-Beijing (n=50) a révélé une mutation décalant le cadre de lecture du gène dosT parmi les lignées Beijing les plus récentes (sous-lignées 2 à 5).  La présence de cette mutation est positivement corrélée avec le niveau d'expression du gène dosR en condition de culture normale.  Cependant, l'expression du gène dosT muté dans une souche de la lignée non-Beijing n'a pas résulté en une augmentation de l'expression du gène dosR et l'introduction du gène dosT type sauvage dans une souche de la lignée Beijing n'a pas permis de diminuer la surexpression du régulon DosR.  Ces deux observations indiquent que la mutation du gène dosT n'est pas directement responsable de la surexpression du régulon DosR dans la lignée Beijing.  Lorsque des isolats de la lignée Beijing furent exposés à un doneur de NO reconnu comme étant un inducteur de l'expression du gène dosR, les souches possédant le gène dosT muté démontrèrent une réponse diminuée au NO comparée aux souches possédant un gène dosT type sauvage.

D'abord, elle suggère que la référence par un décideur au « bon raisonnement  » et à la « parole » d'une autorité « experte » sert surtout les intérêts de la justice judiciaire. Deuxièmement, elle cherche au-delà de la « règle »  d'une crainte fondée et analyse le rôle de la langue et de la rhétorique face à la construction du demandeur « authentique » au statut du réfugié. Enfin, elle suggère qu'une forme de justice éthique et responsable pour le demandeur homosexuel au statut du réfugié est possible et se trouve derrière la « règle » de l'identité homosexuelle authentique, au moment de l'identification de son visage particulier et de sa vulnérabilité. </description><description>This thesis scrutinizes the IRB's designation as an "expert tribunal" over the content of a "well-founded fear of being persecuted".  Firstly, it suggests that a decision-maker's appeal to the "good reasons" and "say-so" of an "expert" authority serves only the interests of legal justice.  Secondly, it looks behind the "rule" of a well-founded fear and considers the role of language and rhetoric in the "expert" construction of the "genuine" refugee claimant. Finally, it argues that the possibility of an ethical and responsible form of justice for the gay refugee claimant lies behind the "rule" of an authentic homosexual identity, in the moment of recognition of the distinct face and vulnerability of the gay refugee claimant.</description><creator>Yiu, Alexander</creator><contributor>Evan Fox Decent (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2010</date><subject>Language - Rhetoric and Composition</subject><title>Looking behind the "Rule" of a well-founded fear: An examination of language, rhetoric and justice in the "Expert" adjudication of a refugee claimant's sexual identity before the IRB</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w9505106r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246s62g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rf55z8345</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a community  pharmacy based education program for asthma patients. Design. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 16  community pharmacies. Interventions: Patients in the intervention group (n=53)  received three sessions of individualized asthma education from pharmacists. In  addition, pharmacists also prepared a written action plan in consultation with  patients' physicians. Patients in the control group (n=53) did not receive any  asthma education during the study. Outcome Measures. Asthma symptoms (the primary outcome), asthma  knowledge, medication compliance, deep expiratory pressure percentage (DEP%),  inhaler technique, quality of life (QOL), and heath resources utilization were  measured. Results. The mean score of asthma symptoms, the primary outcome,  decreased more in the intervention group than in the control group (between group  difference = -0.299, 95% CI, -0.71; 0.11), though this between group difference was  not statistically significant (P=0.148). As to the secondary outcomes, patients in  the intervention group had significant improvements in "overall mean score of  QOL" (between group difference = 0.43, 95% CI, 0.023; 0.83), "symptom  domain of QOL" (between group difference = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.04; 0.96), and  "inhaler technique of Aerosol-dosing only" (between group difference =  1.77, 95% CI, 0.36; 3.18). Except for QOL and inhaler technique, the other four  secondary outcomes did not achieve any significant differences between the two study  groups. Conclusions. Most of the study results were not statistically  significant. One important reason for this was the lack of power due to the poor  success in patient recruitment. The study also highlighted some of the limitations  and difficulties in implementing a community pharmacy based asthma education  program. Despite these difficulties, some benefits were found. Therefore, we suggest  that future studies should focus on overcoming the limitations and difficulties  observed in this study.</description><creator>Huang, Jian Hua, 1970-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacy.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>A randomized controlled trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a community pharmacy based asthma education program /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870w45n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z8345</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wp988k430</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Thermal processing is the primary mode of preservation of mango  products, which can be considerably damaging to the delicate quality of mango.

Smaller research laboratories' LIMS often lack support for automatic task execution,  an omission that becomes more critical as experiments become increasingly automated.  This thesis describes Exp-WF, a workflow management module specifically designed to  be easily incorporated into a typical small-scale LIMS. Scientists describe the  execution order of experiments as a workflow model. Exp-WF then automatically  selects experiments for execution and dispatches them to the people or machines  responsible for performing them. Exp-WF can be incorporated into an existing  web-based LIMS in a non-intrusive way by using servlet filter technology to observe  user actions and act upon them. Exp-WF uses agent-based technology with asynchronous  communication to dispatch tasks to remote machines. This guarantees correctness even  if the machines are not available all the time.</description><creator>Gabor, Brian</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>EXP-WF : a workflow management module for web-based laboratory information management systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547r97z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45q950n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:th83kz92j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this study was to assess the oxygen cost of  various intensities of steady-state cycling.

To predict potential melting caused by  natural and human disturbance, we need to know the nature and origin of massive ice  deposits. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the nature of massive ice in  coarse-grained sediments that accepted theories suggest should not  occur. Degradation of ice-rich granular resources is expensive and  difficult to rehabilitate and can cause developmental thermokarst, overestimation of  granular resources, disturbance of wildlife habitat and create conflicts with  traditional land uses. To locate massive ice we used a resistivity geophysical  technique and to characterize the ice we used geochemical, petrographic and  stratigraphic techniques. The resistivity technique detected bodies of massive ice  and ice-rich sediments and coarse-grained sediments at high resolutions and  laboratory analysis reveal that the ice was of glacial origin. These findings indicate that massive ice of glacial origin  occurs in coarse-grained sediments in permafrost. The techniques used in this study  could form the basis of a predictive model of massive ice  occurrence.</description><creator>De Pascale, Gregory P.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Glaciers -- Mackenzie River Delta (N.W.T. and Yukon)</subject><subject>Glacial landforms -- Mackenzie River Delta (N.W.T. and Yukon)</subject><subject>Frozen ground -- Mackenzie River Delta (N.W.T. and Yukon)</subject><title>Massive ice in coarse-grained sediments, Western Canadian Arctic</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c805m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53jx58f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5q47rp24h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is an introduction to the study of convexification  problems involving smooth functions in the area of continuous mathematical  programming.

Yet factors that determine their post-transplantation  outcomes remain poorly defined. The aim of this study was to identify pre- and post-transplant  predictors of patient and graft survival in elderly recipients of kidney  grafts. We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study  involving patients aged 60 years or older who received a first cadaveric kidney  transplant. Potential outcome predictors were identified with survival analyses  based on a Cox proportional hazard model. Active smoking at transplantation, increased body mass index and  time on dialysis before transplantation were significantly associated with an  increased risk of post-transplant mortality and graft loss. Decreased graft function  at one year was associated with a higher risk of mortality and graft loss beyond one  year post-transplant. In conclusion, our study has identified potential targets for  interventions aimed at improving patient and graft survival in elderly  patients.</description><creator>Cardinal, Héloise</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Gerontology.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Determinants of patient and graft survival in the elderly recipients of a kidney graft</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m226h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021f791</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xd07gt23d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Non-contact atomic force microscopy (NC-AFM) has been applied to  the prototypical molecule-insulator system C60 on KBr. Both contact and non-contact  imaging modes were used to characterize the KBr(001) surface. C60 molecules were  deposited on UHV-cleaved KBr(001) surfaces and imaged with NC-AFM. Surveys of the  surface revealed an island growth mode with a tendency towards nucleation at step  edges. A long diffusion length was also estimated (600-800nm) from survey images.  Molecular resolution images were also obtained revealing a coincident epitaxy  between the C60 molecules and the substrate. Also, a 20 +/- 3pm height difference is  observed between some first layer molecules, closely corresponding to the  geometrical height difference between two orientations of C60. Nucleation of C60 at  kink sites was directly observed by NC-AFM and a calculation of the electrostatic  forces on a C60 molecule at a kink in a KBr step confirms an additional contribution  to the substrate-adsorbate interaction.</description><creator>Burke, Sarah A.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Buckminsterfullerene on KBr studied by high resolution NC-AFM : molecular nucleation and growth on an insulator</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375w90d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gt23d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4x51hj65c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the  mitochondrial respiratory chain, is composed of thirteen structural subunits, and  requires the addition of several prosthetic groups including, copper and heme  moieties, and magnesium and zinc ions. Deficiencies in the assembly of COX lead to  several clinical phenotypes including Leigh syndrome and hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy. In this study, RNA interference was used in a human cell line to  stably knockdown the expression of COX11, a COX assembly factor thought to be  involved in Cu B site metallation. These cells showed a reduction in both COX  assembly and activity, which were suppressed by overexpression of COX17, but not by  SCO1 or SCO2, two proteins involved in CUA metallation.

In the first study, the effects of NSC source on dry matter (DM) intake, milk  yield and milk fatty acid composition were evaluated using fifteen lactating  Holstein cows in a 3 x 3 Latin square design. In the second study, fifteen lactating  Holstein cows were used in a completely randomized design to determine the effects  of NSC on the total tract nutrient utilization. The third study was designed to  determine in situ ruminal degradability of DM, CP, NDF and starch of dietary  treatments of study one and two, where two ruminally fistulated cows used in a  randomized complete block design. Results of the in situ ruminal degradability trial  showed that BC and CBC had similar effective ruminal degradability of DM and CP  which was higher (P &lt; 0.05) than that of CC. However, starch ruminal  degradability was highest for BC, intermediate for CBC and lowest for CC. Sources of  NSC had no effect on the NDF in situ ruminal degradability. It was concluded that  changing the source of NSC and feeding sunflower seeds can modify milk fatty acid  composition without any adverse effect on milk yield or milk components, and with no  detrimental effect on nutrients utilization.

Numerical parameters and scales allow measurement of product development  and onward adjustment as the process unfolds. In QFD, customer requirements are  usually defined in terms of design characteristics. In the method developed here,  customer requirements are related to product functions. The use of value engineering  then allows costs to be quantified. The analysis of design uncertainties allows the  determination of risk factors. By introducing the new concepts of customer  satisfaction value and an integrated evaluation index, an appropriate balance  between customer and enterprise satisfaction can be attained in the final product.  The new QFD method provides a quantitative approach based on cost and risk for  evaluating how well customer requirements are taken into account in the development  of a product.</description><creator>Zhao, Shan, 1972-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>A quantitative QFD method taking into account cost and risk factors /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zf08r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w533c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35725</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
