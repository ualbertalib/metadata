This decline consciousness, which later crystallized into a reform literature, is reflected in the works of this period's major historians. Chapter I surveys the development of Ottoman historiography prior to the late sixteenth century, with the aim of highlighting the novelty of the critical perspectives developed by historians of the era like Ali, Lokman and Selaniki. The attitudes and analyses of these historians concerning disturbing economic processes such as monetary turbulence and price movements constitute the focus of Chapters II and III respectively. These chapters argue that Ottoman decline consciousness grew partly in response to a keen awareness of newly emerging social and economic forces that Ottoman reform literature chose not to understand and accomodate but to resist and suppress. The failure of Ottoman intellectuals to come to terms with the new market forces of the early modern world was not due to an anti-mercantile bias, but to the primacy of politics in the Ottoman order. Chapter IV traces the international commercial activities of Ottoman Muslims in the context of a comparison between Ottoman decline consciousness and European mercantilism.</description><creator>Kafadar, Cemal, 1954-</creator><date>1986</date><subject>Merchants -- Turkey -- History -- 16th century.</subject><subject>Turkey -- Economic conditions</subject><subject>Turkey -- History -- Ottoman Empire, 1288-1918</subject><title>When coins turned into drops of dew and bankers became robbers of shadows : the boundaries of Ottoman economic imagination at the end of the sixteenth century</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558f00p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch198</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8k71nh74g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:56:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The nodulin-23 gene is an abundantly transcribed soybean gene induced in nodules during symbiosis with Rhizobium. Sequencing of the cDNA and genomic clones revealed one intron within an open reading frame. A 24,275 dalton protein was predicted. The transcription of nodulin-23 gene occurs concomitantly with Lbc$ sb3$ and nodulin-24 genes. The 5$ sp prime$-regions of nodulin-23 and Lbc$ sb3$ genes were sequenced and compared with that of nodulin-24. Three potential cis-regulatory sequences were identified. The presence of trans-acting molecule(s), possibly regulating the expression of these genes, was tested for in vitro by preincubating nuclei from embryonic axes with nodule extract and assaying for gene activation. Nodulin-23, nodulin-24, and Lbc$ sb3$ genes were specifically activated and demonstrated similar kinetics. Several genes used as controls were not stimulated. A nodule factor(s) was shown to bind the 5$ sp prime$-region of nodulin-23 gene.

These two models are examples of control of expression of specific genes at the translation level. It was shown that the presence of the 5$ sp prime$ non-coding regions of the human and murine c-myc oncogenes strongly inhibits the in vitro translation of their respective mRNAs. The presence of the 5$ sp prime$ non-coding region of the mouse c-myc gene is sufficient by itself to reduce the translational efficiencies of messages since, when it is placed at the 5$ sp prime$ end of coding sequences, it also reduces the translational level of these messages to similar levels observed with c-myc. Secondary structure at the level of the 5$ sp prime$ end non-coding region might be the origin of the observed inhibition since this has been shown to be a determinant in translational efficiency. There was however no correlation between the results obtained from in vitro translation systems and observations made in cells transfected with genes containing the inhibitory region at their 5$ sp prime$ end. The presence of the HIV mRNAs TAR sequence at the 5$ sp prime$ end of the hybrid CAT message also reduces the in vitro translational efficiency of this mRNA. No transactivational activity in the presence of the tat III protein could be observed in the in vitro translation systems that were used in these studies. However, the cross-linking of an 80 kDa polypeptide (most likely eIF-4B) to the mRNA cap structure was enhanced by the presence of the TAR region at the 5$ sp prime$ end of hybrid messages. Moreover, cross-linking of a novel set of proteins to the cap structure of hybrid mRNA with the TAR sequence at the 5$ sp prime$ end was detected in HeLa cells transfected with the tat III gene and expressing the transactivation activity in vivo.

Following clearance of parasitaemia, a mouse is cured and immune to reinfection. The present studies examine the immune mechanisms which operate during the elimination phase. Passive transfer of plasma from an immune mouse to an infected recipient brings about rapid and complete clearance of parasitaemia in C57BL/6 mice. This curative activity is labile to heat treatment for 30 minutes at 56$ sp circ$C. A protein A- derived immunoglobulin fraction of immune plasma (IP) shares these properties. Further purification shows that the curative activity resides primarily in the IgG2a subclass, and that this antibody is intrinsically heat-labile. Complement component C3 (but not the lytic C5-C9 sequence) is necessary for antibody-mediated cure of infection. Cellular elements (macrophages) are also essential for elimination of parasitaemia to occur. The ultimate T. musculi effector mechanism thus requires the interaction of both humoral and cellular components.</description><creator>Wechsler, Daniel Steven Gary.</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Immune mechanisms of cure in Trypanosoma musculi infection</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784m45f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214p83q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:70795843h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:56:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sodomy and buggery are two elements of the wide historical and literary problematic of the Gay Past. During the French Renaissance, many images were closely related to unnatural vices: hermaphroditism, representation of the foreigner, effeminacy, and so on. In order to avoid anachronical statements, our study will be preceded by an historical and methodological essay that will bring us to a literary concept, l'imagologie. In many ways, religious reforms in the last decades of the Sixteenth Century added to the complexity of the image of the sodomite. We know that the Holy Bible and religious writings put a stigma on such practices. But the hermaphrodite, the mignon, and some motifs from Antiquity were also known or discovered, transformed or travestied. Finally, the image of the sodomite built up in French Renaissance literature is neither similar to today's Gay person, nor to an oversimplified figure of a medieval sinner. Its organization and meaning will depend mostly on the type of work in which it appears. Moreover, Italian and North-African epistemologies, and polemics using effeminacy or mollities set-ups add to the complexity of the discursive structure.</description><creator>Poirier, Guy</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Homosexuality -- France -- History</subject><subject>Homosexuality in literature</subject><title>Sodomicques et bougerons : imagologie homosexuelle à la renaissance</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m2435.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795843h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k0698820z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aggregate market of the Eastern United States is quantitatively modelled and the interaction of its components measured. Concrete and paving aggregate were the selected types for the purposes of this study. Using 1987 as base year, production is segmented into geographic units by using information obtained from the Mine Safety and Health Administration. The quarry price is given by an empirical relation, accounting for urbanization, and based on an extensive telephone survey. The global demand is determined by econometric procedures. The break-down by geographic unit is performed using construction data in an input/output manner. Transport, which is multi-modal, is simulated by linear programming. These concepts are consolidated by the optimisation of aggregate distribution.

Two major aspects of the work are: (1) to explore the importance of various model parameters which lead to the rapid intensification of the surface cyclone through sensitivity tests, and (2) to unravel the cause-effect relations responsible for rapid surface pressure falls through a study of the heat budget, geostrophic vorticity budget, and a Lagrangian trajectory analysis of the simulated cyclone. The results from six experiments are presented. The main conclusions are: (a) By using analytic initial conditions based on typical wintertime conditions prior to explosive cyclogenesis, it is possible to obtain very realistic simulations of rapid cyclogenesis. (b) The use of high horizontal resolution is important in simulating the mesoscale features of rapidly deepening cyclones. In particular, the structure of the intense warm front observed ahead of the cyclone is very sensitive to changes in horizontal resolution. (c) The destabilization of the lower troposphere prior to the period of rapid deepening is essential in the formation of an extremely intense frontal structure, which in turn is instrumental in the rapid spinup of the storm. (d) In the presence of strong surface fluxes, the development of the simulated cyclone is affected by the depth of the planetary boundary layer. A detailed diagnosis of the control case is then presented. Quasi-Lagrangian heat budgets are calculated for several vertical columns about the vortex center. Very large variations in the heating were found to occur over a relatively small horizontal distance of 180 km. The reason for the mesoscale variations was traced to the intense warm front ahead of the cyclone and the bent-back warm front trailing behind the surface vortex. The results of the heat budget were then used in the interpretation of the geostrophic vorticity budget. It was found that the primary mechanism for geostrophic vorticity growth at the surface is through horizontal variations in the horizontal potential temperature advection. In particular, the timing of the most rapid surface geostrophic vorticity growth coincided with the formation of the bent-back warm front. Although the forcing from diabatic heating is large, it is nearly cancelled by the forcing from vertical advection of potential temperature. Instantaneous surface fluxes of sensible heat provide very little direct generation of geostrophic vorticity. The airflow in the vicinity of the intense warm front was diagnosed by a fully Lagrangian trajectory analysis. A schematic flow diagram is presented which illustrates the overturning of the air in the warm front. Calculations on the evolution of the circulation for closed loops of air parcels indicate that the warm front is responsible for the generation of large vorticity values at the surface.</description><creator>Hedley, Mark</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Anelastic modelling of expolosive cyclogenesis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g39n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z1516</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Meteorology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dz010q77f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present study investigated the neural mechanisms by which environmental stimuli guide conditioned behaviors in the amphetamine conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Systemically injected D1 and D2 dopamine antagonists blocked both acquisition and expression of the CPP: the selective D1 antagonist more effectively blocked expression than the D2 antagonists. The site of action of the antagonists on expression was the nucleus accumbens. Systemically injected reserpine, but not intra-accumbens a-MPT microinjections, also blocked the expression of the amphetamine CPP. Pre-conditioning and post-conditioning electrolytic or excitotoxic lesions of the lateral amygdaloid nucleus impaired the CPP. It was concluded that the effect of conditioned incentive stimuli is mediated by a neural system which involves the reserpine-sensitive dopamine pool and the D1 dopamine receptor in the nucleus accumbens and the lateral amygdaloid nucleus.</description><creator>Hiroi, Noboru, 1961-</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Amphetamines -- Physiological effect.</subject><subject>Conditioned response.</subject><title>A pharmacological and neuroanatomical investigation of the conditioned place preference produced by amphetamine /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zr41j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q77f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150j94w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The efficiencies of several Cu(II) complexes in promoting the hydrolysis of bis(2,4-dinitrophenyl) phosphate (BDNPP) have been compared. Copper complexes of the type ((L)Cu(OH$ sb2$)$ sb2$) $ sp{2+}$, where L represents a bidentate diamine ligand, can be effective in promoting the hydrolysis of BDNPP.

We propose a framework that unifies competing approaches to shape. The basis for our approach is an analysis of deformations of shape designed to induce a topology over shapes suitable to support object recognition. We show that deformations classify into constant motion and curvature motion, which intriguingly lead to conservation laws for shape. These conservation laws are nonlinear and lead to singularities. A notion of entropy for shape is developed which limits the singularities of shape to shocks. The formation of shocks and their classification under arbitrary deformations is the basis of our representation for shape. The space of deformations leads to a reaction-diffusion space for shape in which the formation of shocks is studied. This leads us to propose parts, protrusions, and bends as the computational elements fo shape. A notion of scale on these elements then naturally emerges, which is captured by the entropy scale-space. Any particular shape is finally described as the interaction between processes for computing parts, protrusions, and bends, the perceptual reality of which is illustrated via qualitative experiments.</description><creator>Kimia, Benjamin B.

The study attempts to answer questions pertaining to the diagnostic accuracy, the generation and change of diagnostic hypotheses, and the use of clinical findings in the course of solving clinical cases with similar presenting complaints. Two specific issues are addressed: (1) how does the initial case presentation suggesting a common disease schema affect the diagnostic problem solving process of novices and intermediate subjects? (2) what are the processes the subjects used in coordinating hypothesis and evidence during diagnostic problem solving? Medical trainees (students and a resident) were given four clinical cases to solve and think-aloud protocols were collected. The verbal protocols were analyzed using methods of protocol analysis. The results show that second year medical students interpreted clinical cases in terms of the more common disease schema, regardless of the initial presentation of the case. More advanced students, although unable to make a correct diagnosis in most instances, were less susceptible to such confusions. Only the resident was able to interpret the cases in terms of different disease schemata, reflecting knowledge of the underlying disease process. The semantic analysis of the protocols revealed that most students, especially at lower levels of training, misinterpreted or ignored the evidence that contradicted their initial hypotheses and made use of a mixture of forward and backward reasoning; a finding consistent with previous research. Implications for educational training and for a theory of novice problem solving in medicine are presented.</description><creator>Arocha, José F.

The laminar structure forms in the core of the extrudate when a slit die is incorporated into the extrusion process. Morphological studies, including a study of morphology development inside the die and studies of the effect of processing conditions on the morphology of the final product, revealed that the laminar structure is a result of die design. Processing conditions influence mainly the shape and dimensions of the laminar core region of the extrudate. Oxygen permeation tests have shown that the blend exhibits lower oxygen permeability than pure PP, when EVOH is incorporated as a dispersed phase into the system. Oxygen transmission rates obtained with a blend system can be as low as those obtained with a multi-layer coextrusion product, although only at high EVOH concentrations. Comparison of experimental data with theoretical permeation predictions shows that, up to 20wt% EVOH, the reduction in oxygen transmission rate is only minor, and follows the prediction for a homogeneous system. At 25wt%, a considerable decrease in oxygen transmission rate is noticeable, and the trend for higher EVOH contents is towards the behavior of a multi-layer system.</description><creator>Lohfink, Günter Werner</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Morphology and permeability in extruded polypropyleneethylene vinyl-alcohol copolymer blends</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z153r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z152g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qr46r166k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The carboxyl-terminal sequences of the $ alpha$ and $ beta$ subunits of the secreted yeast K1 toxin have been determined by protein sequencing and amino acid analysis of peptide fragments generated from the purified toxin. It revealed that the $ alpha$ and $ beta$ subunits consist of amino acid residues 45-147 and 236-316 from the preprotoxin, respectively. The preprotoxin configuration can be represented as: prepropeptide-ArgPro-$ alpha$-ArgArg-$ gamma$-LysArg-$ beta$. This structure for the preprotoxin defines a specific processing pathway in yeast involving a dibasic endoprotease, encoded by the KEX2 gene and a carboxypeptidase B like enzyme which is probably encoded by the KEX1 gene. By using the patch-clamp technique, it is shown both in vivo with sensitive yeast spheroplasts and in vitro with asolectin liposomes that the toxin forms ion permeable channels. The toxin induced ion channels are voltage independent with a unit conductance of 118pS, often appearing in pairs and prefer monovalent cations. K1 toxin has a much wider killing spectrum at the spheroplast level than at the whole cell level as demonstrated by the fact that the toxin kills spheroplasts from the genera Candida, Kluyveromyces, and Schwanniomyces, whose cells are toxin insensitive. A toxin binding study shows that the wall receptor can define toxin specificity and is necessary but not sufficient for toxin action on intact cells. Using various mutagenesis techniques, a set of mutations throughout regions encoding the $ alpha$ and $ beta$ subunits that allow secretion of mutant toxins were generated. By analyzing the phenotypes of these mutant toxins, the ion channel forming domain is assigned exclusively to the hydrophobic $ alpha$ subunit and the cell wall receptor binding domain is localized to both the $ alpha$ and $ beta$ subunits.</description><creator>Zhu, Hong, 1963-</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Toxins</subject><subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</subject><title>The structure and function of yeast k1 toxin /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv07t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r166k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qr46r167v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The inclusive pizero and direct photon productions by 300 GeV/c $ pi sp-$ and $ pi sp+$ beams on a lithium target, were measured using the E705 spectrometer at Fermilab.

However, the identity of these agents is still uncertain. In this study, the cartilage matrix protein, link protein, has been used as an in situ probe of endogenous proteolysis, due to its relative resistance to proteolysis and the accumulation of its proteolytically-modified form with age in the matrix. Stromelysin, a metalloproteinase secreted in a latent form by human articular cartilage in organ culture, was shown to play a major role in the matrix degradation of neonatal cartilage. In adult cartilage, additional proteolytic agents, besides stromelysin, are involved. The data are compatible with the action of cathepsins B and G, and probably cathepsin L and hydroxyl radicals. The same multiple proteolytic agents appear to have acted on the cartilage remaining in both osteoarthritic and rheumatoid arthritic joints. To further investigate the role of the stromelysin in the degradation of arthritic cartilage, relative steady-state mRNA levels of prostromelysin in normal and arthritic cartilage were also examined. Northern blots indicated that abundant amounts of prostromelysin mRNA were present in normal adult cartilage, whereas relatively lower levels were found in arthritic and neonatal cartilage. Relative to prostromelysin mRNA, little procollagenase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) mRNA were expressed in vivo by chondrocytes in human articular cartilage. In situ hybridization revealed that the metalloproteinase message was being expressed predominantly in the superficial chondrocytes of normal adult and osteoarthritic cartilage. If the observed low levels of latent metalloproteinase precursor are characteristic of all phases of the disease process, then it would appear that the level of activation rather than the amount of the metalloproteinase pre</description><creator>Nguỹên, Quang.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Biophysics, Medical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Characterization of proteolytic agents involved in the degradation of human articular cartilage proteoglycan during aging and arthritis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c824t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mc666</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vh53ww494</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A number of investigators have suggested that the early and late phases of the formalin test are mediated by separate neural systems. Evidence is presented which suggests that in addition to a dissociation between the two phases based on nociceptor stimulation and inflammation, the late phase of the formalin test is also dependent upon plasticity in the central nervous system which occurs during the transient early phase. Selectively blocking neural activity during the early phase with local anesthetics given peripherally, or in the cingulum bundle or fornix, prevents the development of these changes. Locally anesthetizing the cingulum bundle, fornix or medial bulboreticular formation prior to testing in the late phase produces analgesia which exceeds the duration of the anesthetic. It was also demonstrated that a thermal injury to the hindpaw or electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve prior to neurectomy produces changes in the pattern and severity of self-mutilation following peripheral neurectomy, suggesting that the injury is encoded and maintained in central structures.</description><creator>Vaccarino, Anthony Leonard</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Pain.</subject><subject>Analgesia.</subject><subject>Phantom limb -- Research.</subject><title>Temporal factors and limbic system : mechanisms in pain processes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333292k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53ww494</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vq27zp08n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The flow characteristics of two dimensional spouted beds (2DSBs) were studied experimentally for various bed heights in a variety of air-particle systems. The effects of fluid-solid system properties, fluid flow rates, vessel dimensions, bed height, etc. on both fluid and solids flow characteristics were examined. A new approach to analyze the fluid-solid-wall interaction forces in packed and spouted beds was developed; it is based on the elastic-plastic deformations of the porous medium at failure. Equations for the design and simulation of the overall fluid-particle flow in a 2DSB were obtained on the basis of a solid stress analysis of the spout-annulus interface region. These include: (a) a correlation for the maximum spoutable bed height; (b) equations for the minimum spouting pressure drop and the minimum spouting velocity; and (c) an equation for the solids circulation rates near minimum spouting. These equations were verified by the experimental results obtained in this study as well as those from published literature. The effect of introduction of additional air in the annular region of a 2DSB on the bed aerodynamics and solids circulation rates was also examined. Fluid flow regimes were mapped as functions of the spouting flow rate, the annular flow rate and the bed height. A preliminary comparison between a two dimensional spouted bed and a two dimensional spout-fluidized beds was made on the basis of the results obtained.</description><creator>Passos, Maria Laura de Azevedo</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Flow characteristics of two-dimensional spouted and spout-fluidized beds of particles</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cr08c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp08n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hd76s0898</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A novel reaction for the dehalogenation of aryl halides is discussed in terms of its stoichiometry, mechanism, yields and potential for analytical purposes. The active dehalogenation reagent can be prepared through the reaction of molten potassium with polyethylene glycols (MW $&gt;$ 200), in the absence of oxygen, to form the corresponding potassium glycolate, a powerful nucleophilic agent. This reaction is applied to the determination of PCBs in waste oils. Following dechlorination, the reaction sample is analyzed for chloride using a flow-injection analysis system employing a novel thin-layer amperometric detector with a silver working electrode. The liquid chromatographic retention behaviour, separation and detection (UV and electrochemical) of nineteen monoaromatic chlorophenols was investigated on a $ beta$-cyclo-dextrin bonded-phase column with respect to mobile phase composition, pH, temperature and ionic strength; this behaviour was compared with other reversed phase columns. The same methodology was also applied to the study of the retention behaviour and gradient elution separation of fourteen diaromatic chlorophenols (PCB metabolic analogues).</description><creator>Paleologou, Michael</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Chemistry, Analytical.</subject><subject>Environmental Sciences.</subject><title>Aryl halides and metabolites : new approaches to quantitation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s320q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s0898</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vp273</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Experimental evidence shows that initially homogeneous bidisperse suspensions become unstable due to initial perturbations in particle concentrations. As a result of this instability, the particles segregate and form vertical streams (so-called fingering phenomena) during their sedimentation process. In this thesis we deal with modelling the macroscopic behaviour and studying the stability of the suspension. A continuum model is developed and used in order to model the formation of vertical streams and study the instability of dilute bidisperse suspensions. The macroscopic behaviour of the suspension is closely related to and depends on the microstructure and the relative motion of particles in the suspension. Thus the calculation of the trajectories of the particles is an essential step in the mathematical modelling of the behaviour of the suspension. Classical low Reynolds number hydrodynamics predicts that sedimenting solid spherical particles approach one another typically to within 10$ sp{-3}$ of a radius, indicating that the surface roughness of the particles can become significant and takes part in the interaction process. The trajectories of two solid spheres sedimenting in either a quiescent fluid or a shear flow are calculated. It is shown that as a result of physical contact between the particles, a horizontal flux of each species of particles is generated. These results are used to calculate the detailed macroscopic equations for the concentrations. Finally the macroscopic equations are solved for two specific suspensions using a linear stability analysis and also numerically using a Control-Volume-Finite-Difference technique. The obtained results predict the instability of these specific suspensions and the formation of vertical streams which have been observed experimentally.</description><creator>Tabatabaian, M.

The occurrence of a novel scene in the midst of a series of other scenes normally induces forgetting of the scene that had preceded the novel one. This phenomenon was not observed following right frontal- and right temporal-lobe lesions, and was only partially present after left temporal-lobe excisions that included the hippocampus (LTH). These brain regions were thus seen as part of a circuit that codes novel stimuli. In Part 2, recall of lists of words was examined in 77 patients and 12 normal control subjects. Both the left frontal-lobe (LF) and LTH groups recalled fewer words overall than the other groups; their performance was normal, however, when the words were pre-organized into categories and when category labels were supplied during test. In another experiment it was demonstrated that the LF group was impaired when category exemplars were provided together with the category labels, the LTH group being unaffected in this condition. It was concluded that left frontal-lobe lesions may affect retrieval mechanisms.</description><creator>Incisa della Rocchetta, Antonio</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Frontal
