Anthelmintic efficacy was markedly decreased in iron-deficient mice; the deficiency was also associated with a decrease in body weight, altered hematological parameters and a decreased net egg output; worm establishment in the deficient group was not affected by the deficiency. Although anthelmintic efficacy was significantly decreased by the iron deficiency, plasma concentration profiles of the main metabolites, albendazole sulphoxide and albendazole sulphone, were not changed by the deficiency. Levels of intestinal cytochrome P-450, the main metabolizing enzyme of albendazole however, was significantly depressed in iron-deficient mice. These observations suggest that although pharmacokinetic parameters are not affected by iron deficiency, nutritional status has the potential to influence anthelmintic efficacy and thus warrants further study.</description><creator>Nielsen, Kim</creator><contributor>Scott, Marilyn E.

A review of stereotaxy and radiosurgery, particularly for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), is presented. The stereotactic apparatus and linear accelerator-based irradiation techniques used at McGill University are described in some detail. The image-dose analysis software, running on a UNIX workstation, is presented, including software utilities for the evaluation of radiosurgery treatment plans based on magnetic resonance (MR) images. The importance of dose-volume histograms (DVHs) in the assessment of treatment plans is discussed, and the software developed to generate DVHs is described. A technique for the experimental verification of calculated three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions is presented. This computerized approach is based on stereotactic principles and uses a plastic phantom and radiotherapy verification film as the dosimeter. The results indicate that, with some improvements, this is a viable technique for the experimental validation of stereotactic 3D treatment planning software.</description><creator>Narayanan, Sridar, 1966-</creator><contributor>Peters, Terence M.

As one of the R &amp; D projects for the PHENIX experiment at RHIC, a double-sided Si $p sp+nn sp+$ junction pad detector is developed. One side of the detector measures the particle distribution and the other side the total multiplicity. A prototype detector made of 7.6 cm diameter, 300 $ mu$m thick Si wafer with 512 pads on one side and 16 larger pads (petals) on the opposite side has been successfully developed, constructed and tested, both in-beam and off-beam at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.

The replication of the A. moorei entomopoxvirus was inhibited by bromodeoxyuridine, whereas the baculovirus of Autographa californica was insensitive to this drug. This result was a biochemical indication that entomopoxviruses contained a kinase that phosphorylated this nucleoside analog and thus viral DNA synthesis was inhibited. TK genes from the three different insect poxviruses, Cb, Cf and Am, were identified, cloned and sequenced. AmEPV TK gene was expressed in Escherichia coli mutants lacking the enzyme. These bacteria were converted to a phenotype that could incorporate radioactive thymidine into their chromosomal DNA. These results provided an impetus for the design of a recombinant entomopoxvirus expression system. A recombination vector, designated RecVecTK, containing AmEPV TK gene and its flanking sequences, a late gene promoter, and a multiple cloning site, was constructed. $ beta$-Galactosidase reporter gene was cloned into a unique restriction site, and the resulting RecVecLacZ was tested in a transient expression assay. The results indicated that the late promoter used was sufficient to drive expression of $ beta$-galactosidase, whose activity peaked two days after the transfection of the RecVecLacZ into AmEPV-infected cells. RecVecLacZ and RecVecLuc, a similar vector containing bacterial luciferase as a reporter gene, were transfected into AmEPV-infected cells in an attempt to introduce the reporter genes into the viral genome by a process of homologous recombination. Various infection and transfection parameters were tested but a recombinant virus has not yet been isolated.

An in vitro model of an "alveolar pavement" using the MAC-T3 bovine mammary epithelial cell line was developed to assess neutrophil diapedesis. Features of this biologically-meaningful barrier include: characteristic transepithelial resistance, tight junction complexes and polarity. Continuous transepithelial resistance measurements showed no significant changes throughout the assay period. Neither a Staphylococcus aureus challenge ($1 times10 sp7$ and $2 times10 sp9$ cfu/ml), or the presence of neutrophils, both resting and challenged had any deleterious effects on monolayer integrity over a short term (1-2 h) exposure. Neutrophils, both resting and challenged gave no indication of causing damage to the epithelium over the short term. Neutrophils isolated from proven sires and evaluated for phagocytic activity were found to differ significantly (p $&lt;$ 0.05) in activity, rate and capacity to uptake particles. Correlations between phagocytic parameters and production traits were negative and small in magnitude. Microbicidal activity of neutrophils isolated from proven sires showed a highly significant variation between animals due to test day (p $&lt;$ 0.001), however variation due to source of cells (i.e. animal) was not significant. in vitro analysis of diapedesis and phagocytosis is promising as a tool for the assessment of resistance or susceptibility to mastitis.</description><creator>Macdonald, Elizabeth A.</creator><contributor>Turner, J.

The effects of IL-1$ beta$, TGF-$ beta$, and IGF-1, individually or in combination on expression of mRNAs for type II collagen, aggrecan, stromelysin, collagenase, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) were quantitatively determined by competitive PCR. The results revealed that each of these mRNA species had an unique response pattern to these external agents. TGF-$ beta$ enhanced expression of mRNAs for type II collagen, aggrecan, and TIMP, while it depressed the expression of metalloproteinases. In contrast, IL-1 regulated expression of these mRNAs in an opposite fashion. The magnitude of response to IL-1 and TGF-$ beta$ varies for different target mRNAs. A prolonged incubation with TGF-$ beta$ effectively reversed the IL-1-induced depression of TIMP-1 mRNA level. IGF-1 increased the mRNA levels for aggrecan and type II collagen, and effectively reversed the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on these two genes. This study indicates how physiologically-relevant cytokines and growth factors regulate the expression of structural and degradative components by articular chondrocytes. The understanding of the factors regulating the biosynthetic behaviors of articular chondrocytes under various physiological and pathological conditions is important if effective repair of the tissue is to be achieved.</description><creator>Lum, Zhao-Ping</creator><contributor>Mort, J.

While these methods helped solve many real problems, a general theory of diagnosis remained undiscovered. Reiter's paper presented a general theory of diagnostic reasoning based on behavior and structure. He developed an algorithm for diagnosis but did not produce an implementation. This thesis reviews the theoretical and algorithmic results of Reiter's paper, and then derives the data structures and procedures necessary to implement the theory. We motivate and develop the algorithm based on a correction to Reiter's algorithm and the discovery of other exceptions not apparent in the general theory. We conclude by noting some interesting relationships that could be the basis for further study.</description><creator>Mahal, Dalip Singh</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>A hitting set tree implementation /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k82p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kp06x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wm117p81x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The deterioration of freshly harvested horticultural crops prior to storage can be minimized by rapid pre-cooling. This deterioration occurs for two reasons: (i) the respiration rate is typically high due to high ambient temperatures at harvest, and (ii) physiological activity of the produce is at peak levels. Thus, precooling is essential. Many precooling techniques are used in the horticulture industry today. Their main purpose is to rapidly extract heat from the produce by using a suitable fluid for the heat extraction/rejection process. The efficiency of a cooling method depends on many factors: the cooling fluid used, the morphological characteristics of the product, the type and shape of packing, the system design, etc.. It is therefore relatively difficult to compare the efficiencies of cooling systems or to evaluate the effect of each parameter on system efficiency. A new method for assessing cooling system efficiency was therefore developed. The technique was based on the capacity of the system to maintain the product temperature at the surface as low as possible without affecting the morphological characteristics of the product. It was shown that this method of assessing efficiency was effective under field conditions. A low cost liquid-ice system was designed and tested for broccoli precooling. It is based on ice particle injection into a water stream, the mixture then being pumped into the box of produce to be precooled. The effects of different ice particle sizes and ice-water ratios on the medium temperature of broccoli, the mass of ice remaining in the boxes of produce and the icing efficiency were analyzed. The results led to the establishment of optimum conditions for the parameters of the proposed system.</description><creator>Goyette, Bernard</creator><contributor>Raghavan, G. S. V.

The best studied example is that of gastrin-releasing peptide or GRP, the mammalian homolog of the amphibian bombesin. Three human bombesin receptor subtypes have been cloned. They are the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R), the neuromedin-B receptor (NMB-R), and the bombesin-receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3). Low level expression of the GRP-R and NMB-R mRNA was detected in cultures of human bronchial epithelium. BRS-3 mRNA was undetected in these cells. An elevation of intracellular calcium concentration was observed in response to bradykinin, but not to bombesin, vasopressin or cholecystokinin. Such responses are frequently noted in lung cancer cell lines. This suggests that broad responsiveness to multiple neuropeptides is acquired during bronchial carcinogenesis. However, homologous desensitization of intracellular calcium responses to bombesin is present in lung cancer cells and can be mimicked by protein kinase C-activating phorbol esters. However, upon inhibition of protein kinase C, homologous desensitization to bombesin persists. The data indicate that protein kinase C is not a dominant component in the homologous desensitization to bombesin in small cell lung cancer cells.</description><creator>Frankel, Andrea</creator><contributor>Viallet, Jean (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The regulation of mitogen stimulated signal transduction pathways in human lung cancer /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k8073.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q239b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dq54w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Among the most significant features of satellite magnetic anomaly maps is the association of negative anomalies with deep sedimentary basins, as observed in the Nova Scotia basin. A possible explanation is partial demagnetization of the oceanic lithosphere by thermal blanketing of sediments and subsidence of the lower crust and uppermost mantle. I test this hypothesis by computing magnetization of oceanic lithosphere beneath the Nova Scotia basin based on a detailed thermal evolution model which includes rifting, subsidence and sea-floor spreading. The results confirm the possibility of demagnetization, however it is not substantial to explain the observed negative magnetic anomaly. As an alternative explanation, I propose a model in which the oceanic crust and uppermost mantle have age-varying magnetization and the continent has an average total magnetization contrast of 20000 A greater than the oceanic. This model produces a magnetic anomaly map having first order features which are in good agreement with satellite magnetic anomaly maps.</description><creator>Ghods, Abdolreza</creator><contributor>Arkani-Hamed, Jafar (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Geophysics.</subject><title>Negative magnetic anomalies at satellite altitude over passive marginal basins</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj54m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dq54w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w078h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A historical cohort of 3014 individuals who sustained a whiplash injury resulting from a motor vehicle accident in Quebec in 1987 was assembled and followed up to six years using data obtained from the computerised databases of the province's universal automobile insurance plan.

Inspired by his mentor, Morris wrote extensively on semiotics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, aesthetics, axiology and religion. Morris has received wide acclaim for his writings on semiotics. However, his writings pertaining to religion--the study of which preoccupied him throughout his life--have been all but entirely overlooked. Morris first presented the "Maitreyan path" in his Paths of Life: Preface to a World Religion (1942). The expression "Maitreyan path" is derived from the Sanskrit name Maitreya (Metteyya in Pali) meaning "the friendly one." Morris' understanding of this symbol is unorthodox and must be differentiated from traditional Buddhist conceptions. According to him, the Maitreyan path is best understood in terms of the paradoxical expression "generalized detached-attachment." At the centre of this expression is the idea of overcoming. Yet it is not a symbol in the traditional sense of the term. It is beyond all form yet open to all forms; it neither prescribes nor ascribes any path, yet it is open to all particular paths. If the Maitreyan path is without any specifiable form or content, how can it be an effective symbol for self-overcoming? In answering this question this study will apply Morris' well-known theory of signs to his little-known study of religious behaviour. This being done, it is then possible to analyze the Maitreyan symbol in terms not only of overt behaviours, but also of sign functioning. Based on the preceding analysis, this study argues that self-overcoming is achieved not via negativa by diminishing the self through the negation and abandonment of language, but rather via positiva by increasing the self through the affirmation and reclamation of language.</description><creator>Wilson, Harold H.

The former is characterized by formal style, use of verbal associations, and philosophical subject matter. The latter is informal, uses worldly images and makes specific points. When elevated style uses common language, i.e. words drawn from specialized contexts, those words bring with them the down-to-earth spirit. They convey an effect of honesty, indicting the abstraction of elevatedness as an evasion. John Ashbery calls up that effect to discredit it, to show that down-to-earth poetry's implied access to the world is delusive and his personalized internal view is honest. Amy Gerstler accepts the indictment, letting it bring her poems to an epiphanic connection with reality. This distinction reflects their generational difference, between Ashbery's postmodernists who see no possibility of understanding reality, and Gerstler's post-postmodernists who instinctively hope for that understanding while accepting postmodernist epistemological pessimism.</description><creator>Wisse, William R.</creator><contributor>Gibian, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Gerstler, Amy -- Style</subject><subject>Ashbery, John -- Style</subject><title>The scheme of common language : a comparison of John Ashbery and Amy Gerstler</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60cx26h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547s32b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qb98mg348</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis tries to circumscribe the carnavalesque narrative strategies that Miguel Angel Asturias (1899-1974) uses in Mulata de tal (1963) to project his pessimistic vision of the social, cultural and religious mixing in Guatemala. The purpose of our work is to make an interpretation of the novel through the analysis of the carnavalesque elements of the work. To achieve this goal, we base our analysis on the Russian critic Mikhail M. Bakhtin's theories of the literary carnavalization and the dialogical principle, which we describe in the first chapter. In the following chapter we examine the formal and semantic components of the novel. In the third chapter we analyse the contrasting and deformed images that represent the social, cultural and religious mixing. Finally, in the fourth chapter we study the different social languages which the author stylizes or parodies to express his ideas in a refracted manner.</description><creator>Wilson, Cristiana Margarita Callejas</creator><contributor>Michalski, A.

It is based on evaluations of the Canada Manpower Training Program (CMTP), the National Institutional Training Program (NITP) and the Direct Purchase Option (DPO) of the Canadian Job Strategy (CJS). Comparisons among the tools and techniques used in evaluating these three programs reveal that improved methods have been incorporated over time. However, a review of United States literature on social program evaluation reveals that these upgrades have not kept pace with research advances in this area. This thesis concludes that the methods used in evaluating federal institutional training and problems in their application have prevented evaluators from reliably assessing the performance of the CMTP, NITP and DPO programs.</description><creator>Winters, Jennifer</creator><contributor>Ingerman, Sid (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Occupational training -- Canada</subject><title>Evaluating federal institutional training programs : a study in methodology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dd29r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v6305</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4b29b704j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Within the latitude of a science-fictional elsewhere and elsewhen, women can establish their own social norms and accepted praxis. The modification encountered in alternate feminist spacetimes specifically incorporate many new ideologies concerning motherhood. Central to this discussion is the means by which feminist authors regard the influences of patriarchal institutions and the subsequent changes in society because of, or in spite of, these changes. The male-dominated fields of technological patriarchy (reproduction and fertility "specialists") and the military, for example, are areas upon which feminist authors speculate. Three feminist strategies for coping with a patriarchal social order, as seen in the works of science-fiction, are entrance into the male world and attempts to change it, competition in the patriarchal world on its own terms and total retreat from an oppressive society, accompanied by the creation of a feminist utopian otherworld. These feminist spacetimes share a number of convictions. Most important, conception is never an unwilled experience. The "maternal instinct", is redefined as a calling which, in some cases, extends to males and non-biological mothers. Traits that are salient in the childraisers are those which are mirrored by these alternate feminist spacetimes as a whole and which contribute to the definition of these societies as utopias. The treatment and/or possession of children as property is frowned upon in the novels. Some points of dissent amongst feminist SF authors include the existence of technology in an utopian or dystopian future for motherhood, and whether or not males are permitted and/or encouraged to participate in society as a whole and more precisely in the experience of mothering. The dystopia, for its part, can thus be regarded as a warning against the encroachment of rampant patriarchal enterprises through their representation of the extrapolation of male-centred value systems.

It has come to mean different things to different people. In particular, four broad approaches have been advanced as ways in which to assess the goals and objectives of multiculturalism in Canada. These four approaches are multiculturalism as a social reality, an ideology, a policy, and as a resource. This paper examines how multiculturalism is viewed as a resource. As a resource, multiculturalism constitutes a vehicle by which various stakeholders can advance their particular goals and objectives. Since there are three primary stakeholders (the government, non-visible minorities, and visible minorities); each group seeks to employ multiculturalism to advance their respective interests. Using the 1991 Multiculturalism Attitude Survey, this paper empirically examines the hypothesis that non-visible minorities are more predisposed towards utilizing multiculturalism to address their symbolic needs, whereas visible minorities are more predisposed towards utilizing multiculturalism to advance their instrumental goals. Furthermore, this paper contends that these different visions of multiculturalism as a resource are better understood as outcomes of intrinsic differences in the very meaning of ethnicity and race to its adherents. While symbolic multiculturalism may be a suitable sociological framework to characterize the meaningfulness of ethnicity for white ethnics, this paper suggests that instrumental multiculturalism is more appropriate to characterize the meaningfulness of race for racial minorities. The results, however, demonstrate that it is inaccurate to dichotomize the expectations that non-visible and visible minorities maintain towards multiculturalism. Although non-visible minorities are more predisposed to support multiculturalism being used to service symbolic as opposed to instrumental goals, visible minorities are not exclusively preoccupied with advancing instrumental initiatives. Visible minorities demonstrate greater levels of support for resourcing multiculturalism towards symbolic and instrumental ends compared to their ethnic counterparts. This paper suggests several potential explanations for these outcomes.</description><creator>Lakhani, Aleem S.</creator><contributor>Black, Jerome A.

The result of this contact is a goddess whose nature both remains unchanged and is changed, being at the same time both Greek and Oriental, and whose new image, reshaped after the Asiatic Mother Goddess, reflects the religious needs of her new worshippers, who were themselves a mixture of Greek and indigenous peoples. The first part of this work investigates the nature and functions of Artemis in Greece, exploring in the greater detail the goddess' connections with nature, childbirth, and the different transitions undergone by individuals and communities. The second part looks at the cult of Artemis in the four major centres of the goddess' worship in Asia: Ephesos, Sardis, Magnesia on the Maiander and Perge. In order to explore more closely Artemis' connections with the Mother Goddess, whom the former replaces, a survey of the Asiatic precursors of Artemis was necessary. Consequently, this study attempts to analyse the nature and functions of other goddesses in Asia, related to the Mother Goddess, namely Kubaba-Kybele, Ma, Atargatis (a conflation of Anat, Astart and Asherah), Anahita and Ishtar, goddesses who share various features not only with each other, but with the Hellenic Artemis as well. The study of these goddesses follows the order in which Greek colonists encountered them. The thesis concludes with a synthesis and summary of the particular features of the Hellenic Artemis which facilitated her identification with various examples of the Asiatic mother goddess.</description><creator>Leibovici, Mirela E.

I present a review of the connectionist approach to psychological models that contrasts it with the classical symbolic approach, focusing on the nature of their respective representations. While defending the legitimacy of the connectionist approach, I find that its most useful application is as a basis for neuroscientific investigation. Discussing connectionist psychology, I find it inconsistent with folk psychology and therefore consistent with eliminative materialism. I argue also for the naturalization of epistemology and thus for the relevance of psychology for epistemology. The conclusion of the essay is an outline of connectionist epistemology, which centres around two mathematical analyses of the global activity of connectionist networks; I argue that connectionist psychology leads to a version of epistemic pragmatism.</description><creator>Krieger, Gordon S.

This concept seems to be one of the central themes of Nasir's thought system. From Nasir's works, it appears that according to him the concept of pleasure is not simply an ethical problem but a cosmic principle active and functional on all the existential levels. Every being experiences pleasure in its specific way by performing the function assigned to it. Through this function or activity every being perpetuates its existence and preserves its well-being. On the sub-human levels i.e. mineral, vegetative and animal, the principle of pleasure is a driving force which enables these levels to preserve their respective well-being. However, from the human level till the level of the Universal Soul this principle gains an increasingly epistemological character as it is connected with the soul's activity of acquiring knowledge. Nasir has extensively quoted and criticised Muhammad-i Zakariyya-yi Raji's views on pleasure. This situation has called for a comparative study of their concepts of pleasure in their respective metaphysical and historical contexts. This comparative study reveals that Nasir and Razi's concepts of pleasure are ultimately grounded in their metaphysical principles, and their interpretations of pleasure are influenced by Aristotelian and Platonic interpretations respectively, as these models suited their respective metaphysical world-views.</description><creator>Abbas Hunzai, Ghulam</creator><contributor>Landolt, H.

Eighty-two young adults were interviewed using a structured, written questionnaire, which included the index of Family Relations (IFR) developed by Hudson (1982). Respondents in the main group (n = 41) had siblings with either a single-gene, hereditary illness or a physical/intellectual handicap. A multiple regression analysis examined how different group and subgroup combinations of the sibling factor might predict reproductive attitudes, controlling for sociodemographic, family, and developmental variables. Contrary to expectation, experience with an affected sibling predicted acceptance of potentially affected offspring. The significance of this finding was marginal for the main group, but more favorable when the sibling was intellectually handicapped. Respondents with siblings in genetic categories felt more obliged than others to test their own genetic risk status, but were least likely to favor abortion for medical indication.</description><creator>Sabetti, Judith J.</creator><contributor>Duder, Sydney M.

The Self Evaluation in Volleyball Questionnaire (SEV) was designed to include a series of self-evaluation items within the five areas identified in a knowledge-based approach to skill acquisition; namely: procedural, declarative, affective, metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive skill. The reliability, face and content validity of the SEV were found to be very acceptable. The scores on the SEV show that the questionnaire was easily understood by the students, but the students found certain sections were more difficult to answer. Students were categorized by their teacher into top, middle and bottom skill groups. Analysis of variance procedures showed that there were significant differences in SEV scores due to skill level, which demonstrated the value and the sensitivity of the SEV in differentiating such skill levels. Even though this was a descriptive study, it was also shown that the instructional programme did have a positive effect on the students' SEV scores.</description><creator>Alnwick, Margot D.

He is an intellectual and reformer born in the Indian subcontinent who witnessed the struggle for independence and migrated to Pakistan. During his medical studies he was a member of the Jam'iyat-i Talabah, and after becoming a doctor, he joined the Jama'at-i Islami formed by Mawlana Mawdudi but later left it. The objectives of this thesis are to analyze the main influences on him. This study focuses particularly on Dr. Israr Ahmad's contribution to political thought, that is, his derivation of the process of Islamic Revolution from the sirah, and his modification of this process to suit the present times. He has not only articulated and communicated his thought widely but also formed three organizations to implement the process in Pakistan. The aims, modes of operation, and achievements of the Anjuman and Tanzim are discussed and compared with the Jama'at-i Islami at times. Since Tahrik-i Khilafat is a recent addition, it is discussed only briefly.</description><creator>Ahmad, Shagufta.</creator><contributor>Adams, Charles J.

The performance of these models is evaluated by comparing the numerical results with the experimental data obtained from the previous investigation. The flow simulation is characterized by two basic dimensionless parameters: a turbulent Reynolds number, $Re sb{T},$ which defines the level of eddy viscosity, and a bed-friction number, S, which represents the effect of bed friction. The study shows that in the limit of shallow water depth, that is S $&gt;$ 0.10, the mean flow is quite successfully predicted by all employed models. However, in the limit of deep water depth, S $&lt;$ 0.10, both $ kappa- epsilon$ models under-predict the length of the recirculating region due to the high level of computed eddy viscosity. On the other hand, the study indicates that the constant viscosity model gives quite acceptable results for most engineering applications. Advantageously using the constant viscosity model's simple concept, an attempt is made to define a criterion for numerical stability of the computational procedure. The stability of the algorithm is assessed by varying the flow Reynolds number, the bed-friction number as well as the mesh size. The Courant number, a dimensionless parameter, is then introduced and correlated with the $Re sb{T}$ and S, thus providing the means to determine the stability of the numerical calculations. As most of the recirculating flows observed in natural waterways are dominated by the bed-friction effect, accurate simulation of the mean flow field is possible even with an incorrect model for the lateral exchange process.</description><creator>Nassiri, Masoud</creator><contributor>Chu, Vincent H.

A kernel of values corresponding to the spatial-domain impulse response of the filter is applied to the original image in order to perform desired operations such as low-pass filtering or edge enhancement. Since convolution is basically a two-dimensional multiply and accumulate operation, it is computationally intensive. General-purpose computer architectures are often ill-suited to perform two-dimensional convolutions, since they lack the required processing speed or memory bandwidth. This motivated the project to design and build a specialized device which can compute the convolution operation efficiently for such applications. This thesis addresses the design and implementation of a specialized processor which can perform two-dimensional convolution using double-precision floating-point operands. The selected architecture is based on the concept of the systolic array. These architectures are reviewed particularly for the constraints which impact their logical and physical design, as well as for the numerous applications for which they have been proposed in the literature or have been implemented. After outlining the overall system architecture of the convolution processor, the thesis focuses on the details of the implementation of the bus interface and Direct Memory Access controller. Finally, the performance of the proposed design is evaluated and compared against alternative software implementations of the convolution algorithm on representative architectures.
