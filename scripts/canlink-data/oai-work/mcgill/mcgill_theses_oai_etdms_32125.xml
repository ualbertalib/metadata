The aim of the work presented here was to answer whether disease resistance is offered within the cell or at the level of intercellular movement of the virus. The protoplast system was used for this purpose. Conditions were optimized to isolate viable protoplasts from the leaves of Lactuca sativa cultivars. Protoplasts and leaves from resistant and susceptible Lactuca sativa cultivars were inoculated separately with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) and lettuce mosaic virus (LMV), Virus multiplication was examined over time using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Resistant cv. Kordaat did not support TuMV multiplication in protoplasts as well as in leaves. The results indicated that resistance to TuMV is available within the cell. The results ruled out the possibility of involvement of cell to cell movement and resistance to TuMV seems to be constitutive. On the other hand, protoplasts and leaves from both resistant and susceptible lettuce cultivars supported LMV multiplication. This suggested that resistance to LMV may not be offered within the cell. The results also indicated that the resistance to LMV was partly due to a hypersensitive response though virus was still able to spread systemically. To contribute towards mapping of the Tu resistance gene, the genotype of F$ sb2$ individuals was determined by screening an F$ sb3$ population from 71 F$ sb2$ individuals of a cross between cv. Calmar and cv. Kordaat for TuMV-infection. These data were useful for the production of bulks around the Tu locus to facilitate the search for new molecular markers linked to the Tu gene.</description><creator>Singh, Rampal</creator><contributor>Fortin, Marc G.

These biodegradable plastics have the potential to be used as substitutes for conventional petroleum based plastic provided that the production costs can be greatly reduced. The high cost of biopolymer production is due to the cost of substrate which mainly is glucose. The enzymatic hydrolysis of potato processing wastes was to produce glucose as a least expensive feedstock substrate for the production of biopolymers of polyhydroxybutirate (PHB) from the bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus was studied. The enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were carried out using $ alpha$-amylase liquefaction enzymes from Aspergillus oryzae and barley-malt, and amyloglucosidase saccharification enzyme from Rhizopus. The results indicated that the production of glucose from potato starch waste to be used as a substrate to produce biopolymers was both technically and economically feasible. A 10 to 90 ratio of barley-malt to potato starch waste gave the highest conversion of starch to glucose of 194.30 gL$ sp{-1}$ (96.56%), and the lowest liquefaction enzyme cost ($0.054) to hydrolyze one kg of potato starch waste. { it A. eutrophus /} produced PHB of 5.0 gL$ sp-1$ (76.9 % of biomass) using the glucose substrate generated from the potato starch waste.</description><creator>Rusendi, Dadi</creator><contributor>Sheppard, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Starch -- Industrial applications.</subject><subject>Hydrolysis.</subject><subject>Potato waste -- Recycling.</subject><title>Enzymatic hydrolysis of potato processing waste for the production of biopolymers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860823c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kp407</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hd38g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Parathyroid glands are responsible for maintaining normal extracellular calcium concentrations through their release of PTH. Calcium and 1,25-(OH)$ rm sb2D sb3$ have been demonstrated to be potent regulators of PTH and CgA synthesis and release. Primary cultures of quiescent bovine parathyroid cells proliferate in response to high concentrations of serum. Next, I examined the role of c-myc in the proliferation of the PT-r cell line, which was cloned from rat parathyroid cells. In order to study the role of c-myc in PT-r cell proliferation more precisely, I used antisense RNA technology to inhibit c-myc mRNA. In summary, my studies have shown that parathyroid cells respond to selected growth factors. This proliferative response involves increased expression of c-myc, c-fos, c-jun and PTHrP. 1,25-(OH)$ rm sb2D sb3$ inhibits the expression or c-myc, and cell proliferation is inhited. The differentiated parathyroid cell expresses high levels of CgA and PTH. However, during proliferation these high levels are not sustained.</description><creator>Sohi, Jasloveleen</creator><contributor>Hendy, Geoff (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Investigation of factors regulating parathyroid cell proliferation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547s65w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hd38g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kw52j933b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis introduces the notion of procedural abstraction in a relational database system. Procedures are treated as special forms of relations, and called computations. Like relations, a computation is defined over a set of attributes. Subset of attributes can be defined as input attributes and the remaining attributes are output. Beyond the notion of procedures that a procedure can have only one set of input and output parameters, computations are symmetric: a computation may have a number of different subsets of input attributes. Computations can be recursive and called by other computations. States are introduced so that computations can remember values from previous evaluation and use them in next invocations. Stateful computations may be instantiated to have new sets of states. This thesis contains the design and implementation of a parser for compiling computations as well as operations to evaluate them. All operations are coincident with relational algebra, a set of operations for manipulating relations.</description><creator>Sutyanyong, Nattavut</creator><contributor>Merett, T. H.

We conducted a series of experiments in rats to examine the role of histamine within the HPA axis. We first determined if histamine undergoes diurnal variations in the paraventricular nucleus, the periventricular nucleus, and the ventro-medial nucleus of the hypothalamus, the frontal cortex, septal nucleus, median eminence, posterior hypothalamus, mammillary bodies, supraoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dentate gyrus, and the CA1, CA2, and CA3 cell fields of the hippocampus. We further examined the effect of adrenalectomy and corticosterone replacement in these areas to determine if the histaminergic system is susceptible to glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibition. Finally, histamine levels in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, the periventricular nucleus, the median eminence, the posterior hypothalamus, the mammillary bodies, the supraoptic nucleus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus were measured in rats that were either intact, adrenalectomized (ADX), or ADX and treated with corticosterone and were stressed for various periods of time. The results suggest that (1) histamine may mediate basal plasma levels of ACTH through the regulation of paraventricular hypothalamic activity, (2) the histaminergic system may not be susceptible to glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibition under normal, non-stress conditions, (3) histaminergic neurons stimulate the HPA axis but may not be able to maintain their activity for extended periods of time, and (4) glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibition can occur but may only be effective within a specific period after HPA activation due to stress.</description><creator>Gillich, Anton</creator><contributor>Meaney, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The role of histamine in the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967499z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/000001295</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c821gm09w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Previous measurements show that the thermal conductivity of $Y Ba sb2 Cu sb3 O sb{7- delta}$ in the basal plane is anisotropic with a large peak in the superconducting state. The magnitude of this anisotropy in the superconducting and normal states, and the dominant mechanism for heat conduction in the superconducting state are currently the subject of debate. We have measured the thermal conductivity of high quality $Y Ba sb2 Cu sb3 O sb{7- delta}$ for deoxygenated, twinned and detwinned samples along the a and b axes to shade light on this issue. We were able to measure the electrical and thermal conductivity using the same contacts and hence determine the Lorenz number L = $ kappa$p/T accurately. Attributing the normal state anisotropy in the heat transport to electrons in the Cu-O chains, the Lorenz number takes on its full Sommerfeld value i.e. $L = L sb0.$ Under this assumption, the phonon conduction is about the same in the superconducting and deoxygenated samples. Our results are discussed in connection with the two possible mechanisms for heat conduction in the superconducting state. We find that although a strong case can be made for the "electronic scenario" whereby the peak is due to rapidly increasing electron mean free path below $T sb{c},$ it is still not compelling at this stage. In addition, it is found that the thermal conductivity along the a and b axes is isotropic at low temperatures, with a nonzero linear term in $ kappa,$ indicative of some uncondensed electrons as $T rightarrow$ 0. This low temperature isotropy contradicts previous explanations in terms of non-superconducting chains.</description><creator>Gold, Ziv</creator><contributor>Taillefer, Louis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>The thermal conductivity of the high temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-delta /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc908.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gm09w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z903119m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Two approaches were taken to investigating constraints on kinship in predicting social behaviour in the vervet monkey Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus in Barbados. in Chapter 1, behavioural interactions between an adult female and an unrelated adopted infant were compared with those between mothers and their natural offspring. The adoptive mother consistently scored higher than mothers with their own offspring in pre-weaning contact-maintaining behaviours, but the difference was not statistically significant. Post-weaning aggression and support interactions between mothers and infants also suggest no difference in parental behaviour and parental costs between adoptive and natural mothers. During post-weaning, the adopted infant was more aggressive to other troop members, and provided more maternal support in aggressive disputes, than another high ranking infant of the same year. In Chapter 2, effects of kinship on the distribution of aggression and support in feral vervet monkeys were investigated by comparing aggression and support between full sibs and maternal half sibs (within matrilines), and between paternal-half sibs and unrelated juveniles (between matrilines). The strong tendency to behave affiliatively to matrilineal members in Old World monkeys, and maternal control of offspring rank within matrilines, may constrain the ability of offspring to enhance inclusive fitness by behaving differentially to either paternal or maternal sibs based on their degree of relatedness.</description><creator>Govindarajulu, Purnima T.</creator><contributor>Hunte, W.

The results presented in this thesis show that two species of MAP kinase, p42 and p44, are present in their unphosphorylated forms in oocytes as early as 5 days of age. At this age, oocytes are small and have not acquired the capacity to resume meiosis. They are referred to as meiotically incompetent. MAP kinase continues to be present throughout the growth phase and up to the acquisition of meiotic competence. In growing mouse oocytes, a group of partially competent oocytes are abundant. Such oocytes arrest at metaphase I where they assemble a morphologically normal spindle. Immunoblotting results of partially competent oocytes show that MAP kinase is present and becomes phosphorylated following culture as is indicated by the retarded mobility on the SDS gels. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phospharases 1 and 2A, induces incompetent oocytes to enter metaphase. These oocytes contain the slow migrating phosphorylated forms of p42 and p44, indicating that okadaic acid causes the phosphorylation of MAP kinase. A time course study shows that the okadaic acid-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinase occurs coincidentally with entry into metaphase in incompetent oocytes. In fully competent oocytes, this phosphorylation occurs after entry into metaphase. In addition, these oocytes do not assemble a spindle, indicating that phosphorylation of MAP kinase, although it may be necessary, is not a sufficient event to induce spindle formation.</description><creator>Harrouk, Wafa</creator><contributor>Richardson, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Mitogen-activated protein kinase during oocyte growth in the mouse</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881n201.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074w39v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9880vs21h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder with an incidence of 1 in 48,000, which may be due to a defect in the mitochondrial homodimeric enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase (mut MMA). mut MMA is subdivided into $mut sp circ$ and $mut sp-$ subclasses on the basis of complementation analysis; $mut sp circ$ cell lines have very low incorporation of ($ sp{14}$C) from propionate into acid precipitable material while incorporation in $mut sp-$ cells is increased when cells are incubated in cobalamin. Intragenic complementation was first observed with WG 1130, a $mut sp circ$ fibroblast line with a homozygous R93H mutation, that is capable of complementing MCM activity when fused with some $mut sp circ$ and some $mut sp-$ cells (1). Extensive intragenic complementation in mut MMA was subsequently observed. Fibroblasts cultured from thirteen unrelated patients (6 $mut sp-$, 7 $mut sp circ$) were fused in all possible pairwise combination and MCM activity was assayed in the heterokaryons by measuring the incorporation of ($ sp{14}$C) from propionate into acid precipitable material. Intragenic complementation, indicated by stimulation of ($ sp{14}$C) -propionate incorporation following cell fusion with polyethylene glycol, was observed in fusions involving twelve of the thirteen strains. Of these thirteen strains, mutations have been identified in six; four have a homozygous mutation (WG 1130 (R93H), WG 1511 (H678R), WG 1610 (G717V), WG 1609 (G630E)), and two cell lines are compound heterozygous (WG 1681 (G623R and G703R), WG 1607 (W105R and A377E)); the remainders are yet to be determined. These intragenic complementations will provide information for grouping the mutations in defined domains in order to correlate structure and function of MCM.</description><creator>Farah, Rita S.</creator><contributor>Rosenblatt, D.

Structural analysis and testing were carried out to establish the feasibility of geodesic domes as manure reservoir roofting. A stress analysis, conducted by computer was used to determine maximum compression loads on roof members. Compression tests were carried out in the laboratory to test two laminated designs and to evaluate the performance of a member joint. Structural analysis showed that the Lamella type dome, with a diameter/height ratio of 4, offers the best geometry considering design criteria for manure roofs. Compression tests confirmed that laminated members, made of 38 x 89 mm and 38 x 140 mm pieces, can resist the design stress developed in a 22 meter diameter dome. Loading tests revealed that non laminated wood members failed at 80% of the design load. However, the joints (formed by two 3,1 mm thick steel plates bolted to the members) were still able to resist an increase in loading. Data obtained from the tests were used for a preliminary design of a geodesic roof taking into account specific conditions such as humidity and manure gas. However further study is required to adapt this concept to real conditions over a manure reservoir. The cost of a 22 meter diameter dome, for covering manure reservoirs, is estimated at 79$/m$ sp2$ which is more expensive than the cost of the currently used, least expensive manure pit roof (wood truss design).</description><creator>Dup√©r√©, Richard</creator><contributor>Barrington, Suzelle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Geodesic domes.</subject><subject>Roofs -- Design and construction.</subject><subject>Farm manure, Liquid -- Storage.</subject><title>Conception d'un d√¥me g√©od√©sique pour des r√©servoirs √† lisier</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qb13q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cc08h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ng451j79c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Two deep-sea cores from the Labrador Sea have been examined using a variety of techniques. Sediments from the eastern levee of the North Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel consist of spill-over turbidites interstratified with hemipelagic sediments and ice-rafted detritus which are correlatable with levee cores described in earlier studies. The same facies are found on the lower Labrador Slope except that, here, the amount of ice-rafted detritus in the hemipelagic facies is more variable. Compressibility tests have enabled an evaluation of the porosity-permeability character of the levee spill-over facies at deeper levels of burial. Organic- and inorganic carbon contents, shear strength and porosity are unique to each facies. These, and the chemistry of the pore waters have been used to infer the early diagenetic processes occurring at both sites.</description><creator>Fay, Mark E.

Reengineering these old interfaces to make them more user friendly would extend the life of the systems in which they are embedded. This thesis specifically addresses the issue of user interface reverse engineering. It attempts to define a method and to develop tools to assist programmers in obtaining structural and behavioural specifications of existing user interfaces. These specifications can be used to redesign new interfaces, generate new ones and integrate them into the old systems. A research prototype to infer user interface specifications from COBOL/CICS source code was developed. Using this tool, we successfully produced specifications of the user interface of an industrial MIS system.</description><creator>Gagn√©, Pierre-Yves</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Reverse engineering of user interfaces : inference of structural and behavioural specifications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558f50w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm29m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9593tw45v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of isozymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with electrophiles; this function plays a protective role as the addition of GSH to an electrophile generally forms a less toxic product. The main focus of this investigation was to immunolocalize the Y$ sb{ rm f}$ and Y$ sb{ rm o}$ subunits of GST in various regions of the adult male rat reproductive system using light and electron microscopy. In the testis, Leydig cells were intensely immunoreactive for both the Y$ sb{ rm f}$ and Y$ sb{ rm o}$ subunits however, a strong reaction localized to Sertoli cells was seen only for the Y$ sb{ rm f}$ subunit. The low cuboidal epithelium of the rete testis was intensely reactive for both GST subunits however, in the ductuli efferentes, intense immunoreactivity was observed exclusively over ciliated cells immunostained for the Y$ sb{ rm f}$ subunit. Strikingly, in the corpus and proximal cauda, intense immunoreactivity was found exclusively over epithelial basal cells. The intensely stained basal cells showed extensive processes which covered most of the base of the epididymal tubule. With the electron microscope, immunogold labeling for both subunits was found randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus of all immunoreactive cells and was not associated with any membrane-bound organelles or nuclear structures. The strikingly different patterns of immunoreactivity for these 2 members of the GST protein family in the various cell types and regions of the tissues studied suggest they may have different functions, substrates, and/or are under different regulatory control.</description><creator>Veri, John-Paul</creator><contributor>Hermo, Louis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Immunocytochemical distribution and quantitative analysis of the Yf and Y0 subunits of glutathione S-transferase in the testis, rete testis, ductuli efferentes, and epididymis of the adult rat</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451j804.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tw45v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bj45j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:30:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cell transplantation to the brain and spinal cord is a well-established tool for studies on cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in development and plasticity. Experimental data from animals has suggested that restoration or preservation of function through cell transplantation has potential as a useful therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative disorders. Experimental evidence of graft-induced behavioral ameliorations has raised the question of the applicability of this technique to the cognitive neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease (AD). This present study is based on previous work from our lab that has indicated a potential for cortical grafts of chromaffin cells of the adrenal medula to alleviate nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm) lesion-induced cognitive and neurochemical deficits; such lesions produce deficits which mimic certain of the deficits seen in AD. This study has found that chromaffin cell grafts ameliorate behavioral deficits and that a neurochemical recovery occurs in the cortex consequential to it. This particular behavioral improvement was evidenced 6 weeks but not 5 days post-graft, indicating a gradual effect by the graft. Additionally, in this behavioral test, control grafts of kidney cells were found to have no ameliorating effects. A final objective to establish immunocytochemical techniques for detection of graft constituents was also actualized.</description><creator>Yuzda, Edward Stephen</creator><contributor>Welner, S. A.
