In the Province of Quebec one firth of the farmland is devoted to pastures of one soil or another, representing three and three quarter million acres. Although adequate grassland resources are evidently of primary importance in grassland farming, pasture improvement progresses slowly, for mainly two reasons, firstly, the pastures are usually the most neglected crop on the average farm, and secondly, an entire misconception or the nature of grassland, i.e. the non-recognition of its complex nature.</description><creator>Knutti, Hans.

The measurement is independent of the detector law, and incorporates compensation for fluctuations in the absolute level of the source. Recordings are possible in linear scales in decibel, relative power, or relative field strength unite. The system is an adaptation of the r. f. substitution method of attenuation measurement. A servo-driven Bowen type attenuator is used as the reference standard. The attenuator settings are translated by a function generator into a voltage analog signal for recording on a strip chart recorder.</description><creator>Kho, Thwan.

In the division and weakness of Afghanistan lay India's instability. A unified Afghanistan, under firm British influence, believed Lord canning, the Governor-General of India, would serve as a forceful barrier against the expansion of Russia in Central Asia. And Herat, the most north-western province of Afghanistan was the strength of this barrier. From the dawn of its history, India had been invaded from its north-western borders.

The altered perspective has been due in part to the development of behavioral methods of analysis together with an enormous increase in knowledge of subcortical and lower brain-stem structures and of the complexity of their connections with the cortex. Bard (1934) and Cannon (1927) made a first step toward the anatomical analysis with a theory that was almost as simple as James’s: namely, that emotion is localised in the hypothalamus.</description><creator>Kenyon, John.</creator><contributor>Hebb, D.

These differences in perceptions are attributable to differences in experiences and contacts with the environment. Through repeated contacts, the individual gradually learns to perceive stimuli in predictable relations and is able to improve his future reactions to the same or similar stimuli. In other words, perceiving meaningful elements in one's environment is a matter of learning.</description><creator>Kanungo, Rabindranath.</creator><contributor>Lambert, W.

Loss of lung elasticity appeared to be the most prominent mechanical abnormality in the group with normal arterial blood gases. Airway obstruction due to expiratory check valving was less marked than in the hypercapnic group where it seemed to be the major difficulty, impairment of lung elasticity being a secondary feature. These and other demonstrated differences, suggested that qualitatively different disease processes were represented in the two groups, possibly centrilobular emphysema in the hypercapnic group as opposed to diffuse emphysema in the group with normal blood gases. In addition, the findings suggested that the chief mechanism producing chronic hypercapnia in emphysema is an inability to compensate for distributional defects by increasing ventilation, due to mechanical restriction of the respiratory bellows.</description><creator>Kahana, Leo.

Still, in spite of excellent descriptions on the form variation of mycobacteria, and despite continuous observations on developmental processes in the warm stage, serial micrographs showing the origin and the further development of aberrant forms have never been presented.

(2, 3) This concept, enunciated in 1859, stimulated intensive research, from which several theories have evolved to explain the formation of edema. If today different schools of thought are still opposed with respect to the intrinsic mechanism of edema formation, they at least agree as to its definition. Edema is a condition which is manifested by chronic, progressive accumulation of salt and water in the extra-cellular space, accompanied by an increase of body weight. This definition allows the exclusion of all syndromes in which there is only redistribution of fluid within the body, as in acute pulmonary edema.</description><creator>Huyghues Despointes, René.</creator><contributor>Giroud, C.

Some alternate proofs to theorems pertaining to sampled-data systems are offered in addition to the derivation of a general expression for the transfer function of the hold circuit which restores sampled-data signals to an analog form. An analysis of the errors arising in such a restoration is presented. A method of simulating such filters using operational amplifiers is suggested and the requirements which the various components in such a schema must satisfy is investigated. The circuitry employed in such a system is described, including the design and performance of a direct-coupled diode switch, capable of high operating speeds which may be used for sampling and gating. The experimental results obtained with a prototype simulation system are compared with z- transform predictions. • Some applications of these sampled-data filters are suggested as areas for future research.</description><creator>Howarth, Barry.

The nature of the forces between these elementary particles are not known, and elucidation of this is occupying the attention of a great many nuclear scientists. Many approaches, theoretical and experimental, have been developed for the understanding of nuclear structure over the past several years. The theoretical approaches have led to the development of models describing nuclear phenomena.</description><creator>Hontzeas, Sotirios.</creator><contributor>Yaffe, L.

As such, it forms part of a series of studies of the Ordovician formations in this region, carried out by graduate geology students at McGill University. It follows the work of Harris (1933) and Okulitch (1934) on the Black River group, and that of Byrne (1958) on the Beekmantown group. Despite the excellent accessibility of the best exposures in the vicinity of Montreal, the Chazy group here, as a unit by itself, has not previously been studied in detail.</description><creator>Hofmann, Hans.

They are more part of the past than of the present. They played a decisive role in daily life. As places of assembly they fostered the exchange of ideas; as architectural entities they expressed the vitality of the city; “Civitas” emerged from the square. Today the significance of the city square has diminished and with it the attachment of people to the values it expressed. People are often unaware of its significance other than as a place on the way to work from which a larger stretch of sky is visible than from a street.</description><creator>Hoffmann, Andrew.

It is underlain by a series of metamorphised basic intrusives, volcanic rocks, sedimentary rocks and two granitic intrusive of early (?) Precambrian age. All intrusives are apparently younger than the stratified rocks; the granites are probably the youngest rocks in the area. The meta-basic intrusives consist of a main mass of hornblende gabbro and lesser amounts of associated rocks which are thought to be differentiates of the gabbro magma.</description><creator>Hodgson, Charles.

This study proposes a methodological approach to the topic by exploring the division of tasks set out by Bernard Lonergan (1904-1984). Lonergan’s methodological framework, which he called functional specialization, provides a generic differentiation of tasks, each of which is central to the overall project of understanding religious diversity. This thesis explores the relevance and utility of functional specialization as a methodological approach to religious diversity in the philosophy of religion.

The results indicate that the static method employing higher compaction pressure tends to align particles in a more horizontal array as a result of the larger shear strains induced. Samples prepared by the same method of kneading compaction but using different compactive effort of twenty and ten blows with a 20-pound tamper on each of the five layers designated 20-20-5 and 10-20-5 samples respectively show that the less dense 10-20-5 samples have a higher pore pressure response than the 20-20-5 samples as predicted.</description><creator>Ho, Kum.

Under these conditions, the animals are frequently obliged to satisfy their total daily free water requirements in one or two drinking sessions with water at temperatures near freezing. The daily water requirements of all animals are known to be proportional to dry matter or energy intake. As environmental temperatures decline below the comfort zone, feed consumption and consequently water requirements increase.</description><creator>Hicks, Arthur.
