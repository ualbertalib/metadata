It is located along a linear trend of volcanic and plutonic rocks that once formed part of a widespread continental volcanic arc that extended from west-central British Columbia into southeastern Alaska and the southwestern Yukon Territory. The preserved stratigraphy within the SLVC is 1500 m thick, consisting of flat to gently dipping volcanic and pyroclastic flows, with minor well-bedded epiclastic strata that were likely deposited in a westward dipping half-graben. Four stratigraphic units are defined: 1) Lower Rhyolite Unit consisting of dominantly pyroclastic material, 2) Interbedded Unit of intermediate to mafic flow and tuffs, 3) Upper Rhyolite unit comprising felsic pyroclastic flows and coarse grained epiclastic lithologies, and 4) Upper Series Unit of agglomerate and intermediate to mafic flows. Dominant lithologies within the SLVC comprise plagioclase phytic to porphyritic basaltic andesite to andesite with subordinate basalt, rhyolite, dacite, quartz monzodiorite, and pyroclastic to epiclastic lithologies. SLVC rocks range from relatively primitive basalts (MgO ~ 8.00 wt. %) to highly evolved silicic rhyolites (Si02 77 wt. %). Rocks vary from Low-K to High K suites with increased differentiation, exhibit transitional calc-alkaline to tholeiitic differentiation trends lacking Fe enrichment, and exhibit typical arc derived depletions in HFSE relative to LILE. Crystal fractionation modeling between primitive basalt to andesitic rock compositions using phenocryst compositions and experimental data best fit a model in which magmas fractionated under water saturated conditions at upper crustal pressures (l-2.5kb) and/02 on the Q-F-M buffer. LILE concentrations rise significantly faster than crystal fractionation models with progressive differentiation, requiring open system processes, likely crustal assimilation/contamination. Intermediate dacitic magmas represent the least abundant volcanic rock type in the SLVC, yet the most abundant plutonic rock composition in the SLVC and regionally. The under representation of dacitic volcanic rocks is interpreted to result from rapid increase in viscosity between the andesite and dacite fields due to flocculation of phenocrysts, creating shear strengths, at which flow becomes energetically unfavorable, causing ponding, and the formation of plutonic bodies. Rhyolite magmas at the base of the SLVC exhibit unique major, trace, and rare earth element differences from overlying stratigraphy, and are interpreted to have formed by partial melting of country rock surrounding an early SLVC magma chamber. Ignimbrites are compositionally very similar to shallowly emplaced granitic intrusions along the western margins of the Coast Plutonic Complex.</description><creator>Resnick, Jonah</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Earth Sciences, Geology</subject><title>Petrogenesis of the Paleogene Sloko Lake Volcanic Complex Northwestern British Columbia and applications for early tertiary magmatism in the Coast Plutonic Complex</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b821d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r319m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0k225d24k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>While sociological studies of 'Jewish identity' have proliferated over the last several decades, these works often ignore the internal diversity found within Jewish populations. Because of the particularities of the gay Jewish case, there is a need to devote more scholarly attention to the 'Jewish identities' of this subpopulation. This study contributes to this under-studied area. Using qualitative methods (in-depth interviews and participant observation), this study explores the processes of Jewish identity construction among gay Jewish men. Despite the fact that Jews have historically held more liberal attitudes on social issues than non-Jews, the study found that Jewish families and communities often demonstrate a resistance to homosexuality and Jewish same-sex relationships. While most North American Jews, whether heterosexual or gay, partake in some form of negotiation between their Jewish identity and the non-Jewish world around them, because of the perceived stigmatization felt by gay Jewish men within the Jewish community, this group has added obstacles to overcome in constructing a personally meaningful Jewish identity. Due to the emphasis on 'traditional' gender roles, the 'nuclear family,' procreation and conservative religious values, the gay Jewish experience bears many similarities to the experiences of gay men in Black, Latin American, Asian, Greek and Italian communities. There are some distinctive features to the Jewish case, however. These include a particular aversion to same-sex relations due to the Jewish preoccupation with ethnic survival and continuity, especially in light of the Holocaust, and increased difficulty for the gay Jewish man to maintain privacy about his sexual orientation due to high levels of friendship and social networks within the Jewish community. Building upon theoretical models that attempt to acknowledge the complexities of multiple layers of stigmatized identities, the study develops a more nuanced analytical framework in which to understand the various strategies ethnic minority gay men implement as a means of negotiating their ethnoreligious and gay identities. The study illustrates, for example, that the variable of 'level of religiosity' serves as a key factor in this process. The study concludes with reflections on the implications of the findings for Jewish communities and recommends similar studies of other ethno-religious communities.</description><creator>Schnoor, Randal F.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Jewish gay men -- Identity.</subject><subject>Jews -- Identity.</subject><title>Finding one's place : ethnic identity construction among gay Jewish men</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558g33f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225d24k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9306t135s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Against the background of Indonesia's ethnic resurgence and social cleavage in the wake of the fall of Soeharto regime in mid-1998, this thesis seeks to identify the factors that have led to a particular incidence of this discord: the perceived inequity in access to economic and governmental resources, i.e., access to jobs in the public sector and to public health services. Taking modernization theory as its framework, the thesis compares the ascribed factor, i.e., Javanese or non-Javanese ethnicity, and certain other factors, i.e., level of education, region of origin and place of residence (urban or rural area) and evaluates the resulting data. The thesis argues that respondents who have a high level of education, live in a region closest to a national center and reside in an urban area, which are relatively more exposed to modernization, are better off in terms of access to economic and governmental resources regardless of their ethnic membership.</description><creator>Zain, Rinduan</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Indonesia -- Ethnic relations -- Economic aspects</subject><subject>Indonesia -- Economic conditions</subject><title>Ethnicity and access to economic and governmental resources in Indonesia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806206h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t135s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nv935514z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The optimized Schwarz methods were recently introduced to enhance the convergence of the classical Schwarz iteration, by replacing the Dirichlet transmission conditions with different conditions obtained through an optimization of the convergence rate. This is formulated as a min-max problem. These new methods are well-studied for elliptic second order symmetric equations. The purpose of this work is to compute optimized Robin transmission conditions for the advection-diffusion equation in two dimensions, by finding the solution of the min-max problem. The asymptotic expansion, for small mesh size h, of the resulting convergence rate is found: it shows a weak dependence on h, if the overlap is 0(h) or no overlap is used. Numerical experiments illustrate the improved convergence of these optimized methods compared to other Schwarz methods, and also justify the continuous Fourier analysis performed on a simple model problem only. The theoretical asymptotic performance is also verified numerically.</description><creator>Dubois, Olivier</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Pure Sciences, Mathematics</subject><title>Optimized Schwarz methods for the advection-diffusion equation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257h129.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935514z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sj431</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the past century, the scope of patentable objects has greatly expanded. Patents are now being granted on living organisms, human biological material and genes. What are the consequences of such practices for scientific research and health care? One of the fundamental philosophical questions behind this issue is the following: are we justified in patenting human genetic material? An examination of the traditional philosophical justification of intellectual property will allow us to critically explore whether or not this practice is ethically justifiable. It will be argued that the consequentialist justification of intellectual property requires, in this present case, that we modify the patent regimes in order to maximise social benefits and minimize public burdens.</description><creator>Brouillet, Miriam</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Human genetics -- Moral and ethical aspects</subject><subject>Biotechnology industries.</subject><subject>Human genome -- Patents -- Moral and ethical aspects.</subject><subject>Medical genetics -- Moral and ethical aspects.</subject><title>Is it justified to patent human genetic resources?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913s00z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sj431</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05ff04q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>During 1995 and 1996, experiments with globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) were conducted in southwestern Quebec (lat. 45° 26 'N long. 73° 56 'W) to determine the optimum nitrogen fertilizer requirements and irrigation levels and to evaluate two widely grown cultivars for their suitability to Quebec regions. In order for flowering to occur plants must undergo a vernalization period. In 1995, plants received 32 chilling hours, an amount sufficient for 89 % Imperial Star plants and 39 % of Green Globe Improved to produce buds. In 1996, plants received 72 chilling hours, an amount sufficient for 94% of Imperial Star and 81 % Green Globe Improved plants to flower. Imperial Star produced 3 marketable lateral buds per plant compared to 2 buds per plant for Green Globe Improved in 1995. Both cultivars in 1996 produced 2 marketable lateral buds per plant. The average bud weight was higher for both cultivars in 1996 compared to 1995. Total yield was significantly higher with regular irrigation compared to variable irrigation. Nitrogen applications above 100 kg N/ha did not significantly increase weight of buds in both years suggesting that that this amount was sufficient for our culture situation. Imperial Star appeared to be a significant improvement over Green Globe Improved plants grown from seed.</description><creator>Husain, Saima</creator><contributor>Stewart, Katerine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Artichokes -- Fertilizers -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Artichokes -- Yields -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Artichokes -- Irrigation -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Effects of nitrogen fertilizer rate and irrigation on the annual culture of globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) in Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vn13t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05ff04q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:td96k479b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Haplodiploid Hymenoptera females control the sex of their progeny, and their sex allocation is influenced by several factors. The impact of intra- and interspecific competition and of inbreeding and outbreeding on sex allocation has been studied in some species of the egg parasitoid Trichogramma. The pre-mating dispersion has also been studied. Impact of competition on sex allocation was observed for Trichogramma minutum Riley and Trichogramma pintoi Voegele. These species were chosen because of the ease with which than can be distinguish. Results show that females of both species lay more males under intraspecific competition than alone, following the Local Mate Competition theory, while only T. pintoi modifies its sex ratio under interspecific competition. Multiparasitism and natural habitat could explain this shift in the sex ratio. Trichogramma minutum, T. pintoi and Trichogramma evanescens Westwood pre-mating dispersion show that most matings occur at the emergence site. However, the three species have a potential for off-patch mating, allowing genetic exchange between sub-populations. These three species were chosen because they are classified in different groups in the genus. Finally, T. evanescens did not modify its sex ratio  following inbreeding or outbreeding. The incapacity to discriminate between kin and non-kin, insufficient genetic distance in outbreeding, or the population structure could explain these results.</description><creator>Martel, Véronique</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Trichogramma -- Reproduction.</subject><subject>Sex allocation.</subject><title>Sex allocation and mating structure in the egg parasitoids of the genus Trichogramma (Hymenoptera:Trichogrammatidae)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t1362.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k479b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j098zd33f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the entirety of Joseph Heller's career as a novelist and explores the various existential themes uniting a seemingly diverse body of work. Considering Heller's relationship to the philosophy of Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, "Towards a Postmodern Absurd: The Fiction of Joseph Heller" suggests that the novelist promotes the same existentially authentic lifestyle of revolt originally articulated by the French existentialists. Refuting the critical assessment of Heller's fiction as formless, this thesis argues that Heller deliberately structures his fiction around the concept of dejd vu in order to buttress the author's existential concerns with the absurdity of human existence. Finally, in response to the recent debates over Joseph Heller's place in the postmodern American canon, the thesis identifies the author's use of such postmodern concepts as pastiche and paranoia as a further  reinforcement of the relevance of an absurdist worldview in contemporary America.</description><creator>Grayson, Erik</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Modernism (Literature)</subject><subject>Absurd (Philosophy) in literature.</subject><subject>Heller, Joseph -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Towards a postmodern absurd : the fiction of Joseph Heller</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jn720.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zd33f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:th83m171c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Marek's disease (MD) is a highly contagious and economically important disease in the poultry industry. It is caused by an oncogenic avian herpes virus. The ability of the virus to evolve into new strains is a continual threat. Vaccination, proper management and genetic resistance are required to completely eliminate the pathogen. The discovery of several markers associated with MD resistance shows that genetic selection for resistance is feasible. Our objective was to identify markers in QTL regions that are associated with MD viraemia. The markers analysed were in the ODC gene, the GH gene and two chemokine genes, all of which are candidate genes for immune responsiveness. A database in a commercial strain of White Leghorn chickens was created. Heterozygous males and homozygous females were identified. The offspring were challenged with MD virus and spleen and thymus samples were collected six days after infection. The viral titre was quantified using competitive PCR. The data was analysed using non-parametric statistics. We found that the paternal alleles of a Hindlll RFLP in the ODC gene were associated with differences in MD viraemia in one of the six sire families analysed. In addition, a Sacl RFLP located in the GH gene also segregated for alleles, which affected MD viraemia. The analysis of the ODC gene was extended to include a second RFLP at a Msp\ site. Together with the Hindlll RFLP it defines three different haplotypes. One genotypic class AB (Hindlll (+/-), Mspl (+/+)) was associated with low vireamia in the thymus and the genotype BB (Hindlll (-/-), Mspl (+/+)) with high viraemia in the spleen. The result suggests that genetic variations in the ODC and GH gene affect MD viraemia. However, we cannot exclude that the observed effects might be due to linkage disequilibrium with adjacent genes. In the latter case, chromosome 3 and chromosome 1, which harbour the ODC and GH gene respectively, must segregate for regions that affect viraemia. The markers identified in this analysis can be used in marker assisted selection.</description><creator>Masilamani, Twinkle Jasmine</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Marek's disease -- Immunological aspects.</subject><subject>Chickens -- Diseases -- Immunological aspects.</subject><subject>Natural immunity.</subject><title>Identification of genetic markers associated with Marek's disease resistance in chickens</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pv88c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m171c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zc77ss10c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The subject of this thesis is synchronous master-slave database replication, failover and distributed recovery for a cluster of database servers. Our replication solution allows updates on the master, and queries on ail sites. Updates of transactions are sent to ail sites before they are committed on the master. To do this, we take advantage of the semantics of group communication Systems. With failover, there is always a master in the group. Distributed recovery ensures that a site that has been introduced in the System brings its own copy of the database to be consistent with the rest of the other databases. It does this by getting all the transactions it missed from another site while it was not in the group.

Regulatory agencies, as well as members of the industrial and agricultural sectors, are obliged to develop methods for mitigating or preventing odorous impacts on communities. It has been proposed that combined application of the Industrial Source Complex-Short Term3 (ISCST3) dispersion model and the Odour Impact Model (OIM) can provide an improved basis for predicting odorous impacts. The objective of this investigation was to validate the use of ISCST3 and the OEM to predict the impact of emissions from a hog farm in rural Quebec in terms of probability of response and degree of annoyance. This was accomplished by predicting the impact through modelling for comparison with on-site field measurements that were conducted on three different occasions. The ISCST3 dispersion model was used to predict odour concentrations in the region in the immediate vicinity of the farm. Subsequently, the predicted concentrations were used in combination with the dose-response curves of the OIM to predict the probability of response and annoyance that would be experienced in the region surrounding the hog farm. When compared to field measurements, it was concluded that the model resulted in reasonably accurate predictions provided that the predicted one-hour time-averaged concentrations from the dispersion model were first transformed to one-minute timeaveraged values. Overall, once this transformation was made, there was a tendency to slightly under predict the probability of response and to slightly over predict the degree of annoyance. The difference in these tendencies may result from differences in the ways that odour are characterized in the laboratory as compared to how they are experienced in the field.</description><creator>Gorgy, Tamer G.

Robust estimators aim to reduce the influence of measurements with large errors, thus improve the estimate accuracy. This thesis applies Huber's M-estimator, one of the most important robust estimators, to two GPS relative positioning models, one based on the code measurements only and the other based on the code and carrier phase measurements. Two numerical methods, the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method and Newton's method, are used to compute Huber's M-estimates. In Newton's method, the singularity problem, the line search strategy and the updating/downdating techniques are discussed in details. For the code based model, our simulation results show that Newton's method can be much faster than the IRLS method. For the code and carrier phase based model, a modified Newton's method was proposed to reduce the computation cost and required memory. The simulation results show that Huber's M-estimator can greatly suppress the measurement outliers and yield more accurate position estimates for both models than LS method.</description><creator>Guo, Ying</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Applied Sciences, Computer Science</subject><title>Application and computation of Huber's M-estimator in the global positioning system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mp545.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vw20k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xg94hr89x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we present a systematic study of the subspace-based blind channel estimation method. We first formulate a general signal model of multiple simultaneous signals transmitted through vector channels, which can be applied to a multitude of modern digital communication systems. Based on this model, we then propose a generalized subspace-based channel estimator by minimizing a novel cost function, which incorporates the set of kernel matrices of the signals sharing the target channel via a weighted sum of projection errors. We investigate the asymptotic performance1 of the proposed estimator, i.e. bias, covariance, mean square error (MSE) and Cramer-Rao bound, for large numbers of independent observations. We show that the performance of the estimator can be optimized by increasing the number of kernel matrices and by using a special set of weights in the cost function. We also propose a novel adaptive implementation of the generalized subspace channel estimator. The low-complexity and numerical robustness of this adaptive implementation make it suitable for online estimation of time1-varying channels over long observation periods. Finally, we consider the application of the proposed estimator to a down-link CDMA system operating in frequency selective fading channel with negligible ISI. The results of the computer simulations fully support our analytical developments.</description><creator>Kang, Wei</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering - Electronics and Electrical</subject><title>Subspace-based blind channel estimation : generalization, performance analysis and adaptive implementation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hm395.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr89x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ng451k79k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Past studies of object recognition in vision and language have shown that (1) identification of the larger structure of an object is possible even if its component units are ambiguous or missing, and (2) contexts often influence the perception of the component units. The present study asked whether a similar case could be found in audition, investigating (1) whether melody recognition would be possible with uncertain pitch cues, and (2) whether adding contextual information would enhance pitch perception. Sixteen musically trained listeners attempted to identify, on a piano keyboard, pitches of tones in three different context conditions: (1) single tones, (2) pairs of tones, and (3) familiar melodies. The pitch cues were weakened using bandpass filtered noises of varying bandwidths. With increasing bandwidth, listeners were less able to identify the pitches of the tones. However, they were able to name the melodies despite their inability to identify the individual notes. There was no effect of context; whether or not listeners heard single tones, pairs of tones, or melodies did not influence their pitch identification of the tones. Several possible explanations were discussed regarding types of information that listeners had access to, since they could not have relied on detailed features of the melodies.</description><creator>Kim, Jung-Kyong</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Musical perception.</subject><subject>Musical pitch.</subject><title>Effect of degraded pitch cues on melody recognition</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng89g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451k79k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w2001</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis focuses on a particular class of representations of visual form, those based on the Blum skeleton [6].

Option analysis is very useful in helping investors decide investing strategies and predict the trend of the future stock movements. In this thesis, basic theory about stock option trading and some important approaches of option analysis such as option volume, open interest, put/call ratios and breakeven stock prices are discussed. A system called Stock Option Analyzer that can perform the option analysis based on these approaches is described in detail. The Stock Option Analyzer is able to automatically retrieve option quotes on any specified stock from the website Yahoo!Finance and present analysis results in the user's web browser. This analysis information is very useful for us to understand investors' opinions about the underlying stocks. The system is developed using JSP technology, utilizing JavaBeans, Java applets, and the help of the web server to generate web page contents dynamically.</description><creator>Lu, Xiaofan</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Applied Sciences - Computer Science</subject><title>Implementation of an information retrieval system for stock option analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sv99n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hm40x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4m90dx548</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study participates in a tendency of Rabelaisian criticism to consider the Pantagruelian text as a weaving of borrowed forms which rcho surrounding discourses. On thrse grounds, we argue that epideictic rloquence, which comprises praise and blame, forms up a network of recognisable passages. This corpus, which, frora the Gargantua to the Quart Livre, brings together pieces eclectic as much in claim as in structure, is tackled from a generic perspective and analysed in light of their common rhetorical components: dispositio, elocutio and inventio. In accordance with the aesthetic of imitation, which informs the making of texts in the Renaissance, Rabelais recasts models available from his predecessors. However, these textual reshufflings, whether it be a matter of early XVIth Century literary compositions or rehabilitated classical works, is effected through parody. But while the re-evaluation through laughter, in the cases of the Gargantua and the Pantagruel, concerns the occasional poetry of the rhetoriqueurs, parody is brought about within the genre itself in the Tiers and Quart Livres, which comprise paradoxical encomia only. Our interest here is in the modes of parody and the conditions for the provoking of laughter in which can be seen the will to reinvigorate a genre, which had by then become strictly codified. From the first two books to the last a certain way of thinking is being established. With conceptual space allowing such great breadth, the paradoxical encomium introduces into epideictic rhetoric contradiction and equivocation, thereby freeing that genre from its formal constraints. This propensity to paradox is significant for the rhetoric of praise and the textual representation of man. And yet, it is through the parody of the epideictic genre and the often grotesque figures it engenders, that Rabelais participates in the oratory genre, - an anthropology indeed, and, as such, a tool to conceive of man - which conveys the highest conception of the human.</description><creator>Breitenstein, Renée-Claude</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Rabelais, François, ca. 1490-1553? -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>La rhétorique épidictique de François Rabelais</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sw006.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dx548</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:76537333z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The first part of this thesis offers an analysis of the overtures and clausulas found in The Surveillant, a collection of short stories written by Québec author Gaetan Brulotte.

Semi-structured individual interviews consisting of open-ended questions were conducted with seven beach volleyball athletes. Cote', Salmela, and Russell's (1995) guidelines were used to inductively analyze and interpret the qualitative data. The results of the analysis revealed three higher-order categories concerning the dyadic relationship: (a) the sport environment, which included elements related to beach volleyball and an athletes' participation in it, the challenges a partnership sport presented, as well as comparisons between partnerships and other sports, (b) dyad structure and composition, which included elements that allowed a dyad to function and the importance of creating a sense of balance in the partnership, and (c) the dyadic interaction process, which focused on developing communication and cohesion in the partnership, and working towards an ideal state where interaction was efficient and effective, culminating in peak performance and a meaningful relationship.

Using Canada as an example, it is argued that there are three emerging global forces that directly challenge the sovereignty of the state in matters of immigration. These forces are neoliberal and global security discourses and international refugee rights standards. But these forces have not led to a decline in the power of the state. Rather, they have forced the state to develop new strategies in order to reassert its sovereignty and regain its legitimacy. The state has responded to neoliberal and security pressures by designing, implementing and reinforcing control policies over asylum seekers. It has reacted to the international refugee rights norms and the demands of the refugee advocacy groups by developing strategies to integrate some of their principles without relinquishing its authority and autonomy.</description><creator>Dorais, Sophie Thanh Lan</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Canada -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy</subject><subject>Globalization.</subject><subject>Refugees -- Government policy -- Canada.</subject><title>Conception et mise en place des politiques relatives au contrôle des demandeurs d'asile : nouvelles stratégies canadiennes dans le contexte de la globalisation</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m9000.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816p666</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5425kc87d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines architectural discourse and spatial practices as manifestations and experiences of order in eighteenth-century Qing dynasty China. It reviews the development of the historiography of Chinese architectural history as an academic discipline, and proposes that in the Qing there was an unprecedented rupture between domestic architectural style from that of the court. An alternative design strategy in spatial planning and detailing was adopted. It is argued that the Qing architectural discourse, its intertextuality, was implicitly linked to the historical formation of the Qing self, and that it was pivotal to the rise of domestic culture. The study approaches architecture as historical statements and arguments, and focuses on the production of space, human agency, gender, and subject positioning in early modern China. The study analyzes the Yugong mansion, Beijing, the Rong mansion in the Qing novel The Dream of the Red Chamber, and the Manchu imperial city, as examples.</description><creator>Mah, Kai Wood</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Architecture -- History -- China -- Qing dynasty, 1644-1912.</subject><subject>Architecture -- China -- Designs and plans -- Early works to 1800.</subject><subject>Architecture, Domestic -- China.</subject><title>Architecture and domestic culture in eighteenth-century China</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687k38k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kc87d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tq57nt14b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Many engineering materials call for increasing strength and ductility. Unfortunately, the material properties of high ductility and high strength are usually mutually contradictory. These conflicting requirements have generated interest in transformation induced plasticity or TRIP steels, which mainly consist of a mixture bainite, ferrite and retained austenite. The superior strength and ductility of these types of steels is due to the strain induced transformation of retained austenite to martensite. Intercritical deformation (i.e. deformation in the austenite + ferrite two phase region) has been extensively studied on C-Mn and microalloyed steels, but not on TRIP steels. Intercritical rolling increases the volume fraction and decreases the grain size of ferrite. These characteristics may be beneficial to the ductility of TRIP steels, since the volume fraction of retained austenite may increase with ferrite volume fraction by increasing the level of C segregation to the untransformed austenite. As well, the size of the retained austenite may decrease with decreasing ferrite grain size, thus increasing the stability of retained austenite against strain induced transformation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the intercritical deformation on the characteristics of retained austenite and resulting mechanical properties of a TRIP steel.</description><creator>Fei, Hong Tao</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</subject><subject>Engineering - Metallurgy</subject><title>Intercritical rolling of a Nb-bearing trip steel</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860905n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57nt14b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827d799</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Carl Nielsen, labelled as Denmark's national composer, has long been relegated to a secondary status in English-language musicology as a composer of great national significance but negligible importance outside of Scandinavia. This thesis explores the links between Danish nationalism and Nielsen's music, as well as the effects of Nielsen's status as a national composer on the reception of his symphonic music outside of Denmark. The first section of this paper is a study of Nielsen's music in the context of Danish cultural nationalism at the turn of the twentieth century, focusing on the folk influences or "Danish" aspects of his symphonic music. It also examines the extent to which the national or Nordic qualities of his music are constructions and later attributions. The following section looks at the development of Nielsen's status as a national composer in Denmark, as well as how this label has engendered the stereotyping of his music as regional in English-language musicology. Nielsen has been neglected by the Anglo-Germanic canon which privileges central European compositional styles and methods while viewing nationally inflected music negatively. Although Nielsen's Danish background cannot be ignored, his symphonic music needs to be studied in a wider European context for his universal message to be appreciated</description><creator>Gutsche-Miller, Sarah</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Nielsen, Carl, 1865-1931. -- Symphonies, no. 4, op. 29.</subject><subject>Nationalism -- Denmark.</subject><subject>Composers -- Denmark.</subject><subject>Nielsen, Carl, 1865-1931. -- Symphonies, no. 3, op. 27.</subject><subject>Nielsen, Carl, 1865-1931. -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>The reception of Carl Nielsen as a Danish National Composer</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p250q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827d799</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hf37d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a study of the Korean woman poet Ho Kyongbon (1563-1589) and her poetry. In it, I investigate Ho's two brothers' active involvement in her literary life, particularly her younger brother Ho Kyun's publication of her poetry collection, the Nansorhon chip and promotion of her literary works to Chinese scholars. I also examine late Ming and Qing anthologies which include Ho's poetry to disclose how late Ming and Qing scholars evaluated her poetry and represented her life. I argue that the attention these critics paid to Ho's literary works and talent reflected a blossoming of women's literary culture and a rapid growth in the anthologizing of women's poetry. I also undertake an analysis of Ho's poetry, with particular emphasis on the influence of Tang poetry on her poetic practice. This analysis is accompanied by a discussion of Ho's relationship to the "Tang revival movement" in which her two brothers were fervently engaged. This relationship provides a context through which to better understand not only Ho's particular interest in emulating Tang poetry, but also the very textual qualities of her poetry.</description><creator>Kweon, Young</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Ho, Nansorhon, 1563-1589</subject><subject>Korean poetry -- Women authors.</subject><subject>Chinese poetry -- Women authors, Korean.</subject><title>The textual and imaginary world of Ho Kyongbon (1563-1589)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj47d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hf37d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):2725</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
