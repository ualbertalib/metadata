This thesis proposes two such novel methodologies that are both based on large volumes of interest, are data driven, and use cross-sectional scans: appearance-based classification (ABC) and voxel-based classification (VBC). The concept of appearance in ABC represents the union of intensity and shape information extracted from magnetic resonance images (MRI). The classification method relies on a linear modeling of appearance features via principal components analysis, and comparison of the distribution of projection coordinates for the populations under study within a reference multidimensional appearance eigenspace. Classification is achieved using forward, stepwise linear discriminant analyses, in multiple cross-validated trials. In this work, the ABC methodology is shown to accurately lateralize the seizure focus in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), differentiate normal aging individuals from patients with either Alzheimer's dementia (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and finally predict the progression of MCI patients to AD. These applications demonstrated that the ABC technique is robust to different signal changes due to two distinct pathologies, to low resolution data and motion artifacts, and to possible differences inherent to multi-site acquisition. The VBC technique relies on voxel-based morphometry to identify regions of grey and white matter concentration differences between co-registered cohorts of individuals, and then on linear modeling of variables extracted from these regions. Classification is achieved using linear discriminant analyses within a multivariate space composed of voxel-based morphometry measures related to grey and white matter concentration, along with clinical variables of interest. VBC is shown to increase the accuracy of prediction of one-year clinical status from three to four out of five TLE patients having undergone selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy. These two techniques are shown to have the necessary potential to solve current problems in neurological research, assist clinical physicians with their decision-making process and influence positively patient management.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r523m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nz718</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602509n"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The separation of the enantiomers of asparagine by crystallization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Elgarhy, Karim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Enantiomers are chiral molecules (i.e. they are mirror-images of each other). They have identical physical properties except for the rotation of polarized light. However their chemical properties are different when reacting with other chiral molecules. The majority of biological processes involve the reaction of two or more chiral molecules. There is therefore a strong interest coming from the pharmaceutical, food and agricultural industry for the separation of enantiomers. Separation methods such as chromatography exist but are generally expensive and limited in scale. Stereosynthesis often has prohibitive development and operating costs. For 10 to 15% of known enantiomeric systems, a conglomerate is formed upon crystallization (each individual crystal contains only one type of enantiomer). Crystallization is widely used as an inexpensive separation process which takes advantage of the difference in solubility of the compounds to be separated and yields very high purities in one separation stage. There is no difference in solubility between two enantiomers but in the special case of conglomerates, a difference in crystallization rate can be used as the driving force for the separation of the enantiomers. In this project, the effects of the important parameters governing the crystallization of asparagine (ASN) were studied in order to develop a separation method based on crystallization. ASN is an amino acid having two enantiomers (L-ASN and D-ASN) and forming a conglomerate. The effects of mixing speed, crystallization temperature, initial supersaturation and seeds (amount, type and time of addition) on the crystallization rates were studied. The crystallization temperature was shown to have a negligible effect over the range studied. Increasing initial supersaturations had a strong accelerating effect on the crystallization. The addition of L-ASN seeds increased the crystallization rate of L-ASN without affecting that of D-ASN. The corresponding statement was true for D-ASN. Larger amounts of seeds and faster mixing increased crystallization rates. Separation methods were developed and 95.8-97.7% pure enantiomers with yields of 73.1% were obtained in a cyclic process. The growth and desupersaturation rates were also modeled.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mp06s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602509n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rz82h"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of the nod and sdh operons in the legume symbionts Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Sinorhizobium meliloti</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>D'Aoust, Frédéric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study was undertaken to characterize the nod and sdh operons of Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Sinorhizobium meliloti. Ten putative B. japonicum mutants with altered nod gene induction characteristics were isolated by screening mutants for genistein-independent nod gene expression. The mutants were found to have higher nodY expression than the wild-type in the presence of genistein. The increased sensitivity of all mutants to genistein was more apparent under suboptimal inducer concentration (0.1muM) and/or temperature (15°C). The expression of nodY gene induction was determined for five strains (Bj30050, 53, 56, 57, 58) under different temperature and inducer conditions. These five strains were also found to produce more lipochitooligosaccharide than the wild-type, at both 25°C and 15°C. Three of the ten mutant strains (including Bj30056 and 57) were unable to fix nitrogen with soybeans grown at optimal temperatures. Based on nodY gene expression and symbiotic phenotype the B. japonicum mutants were classified into three groups. A molecular genetic approach was taken to investigate the regulation of expression of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in S. meliloti. The sdhCDAB genes encoding SDH were shown by RT-PCR to be co-transcribed and thus constitute an operon. The transcriptional start site and putative promoter region of the first gene in the operon, sdhC , were identified by 5'-RACE and DNA sequence analysis. Transcriptional lacZ fusions to sdhC indicated that expression of the operon is regulated by carbon source in the growth medium but not by growth phase. The highest expression of the sdh operon was observed in cells grown with acetate, arabinose and glutamate, as sole carbon sources, and the lowest expression was observed in cells grown with glucose and pyruvate as sole carbon sources. Also presented is the isolation and characterization of the first defined sdh mutant in a rhizobial species. The mutants helped demonstrate that the total lack of SDH activity would be lethal to S. meliloti cells. Symbiotic phenotype of the mutants indicated that SDH is required for N2-fixation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55zc972.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rz82h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plant cellular signal transduction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rhizobium meliloti</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soybean -- Roots</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rhizobium japonicum</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aff365933r"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The quest for a social ethics : an intellectual history of U.S. social sciences : the case of Herbert Hoover, Wesley C. Mitchell, Charles E. Merriam and Mary van Kleeck</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Clermont-Legros, Jean-Francis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Between 1900 and 1930, social scientists attempted to refashion social ethics by conducting extensive social research. Some of them collaborated with Herbert Hoover before and after he became president. In the 1920s, they accepted positions on Herbert Hoover's various commissions. The work they did on these commissions made them a forum for manifesting their interest in modernizing social ethics. At one and the same time, they were in a position to define both social ethics and the purpose of the social sciences. Throughout this dissertation, I explore the cases of three social scientists involved with Hoover's commissions: the economist Wesley Clair Mitchell, the political scientist Charles Edward Merriam, and the industrial researcher and social worker Mary van Kleeck. Wesley Clair Mitchell addressed issues of American consumption and economic behaviour. Charles Edward Merriam analyzed the political behaviour of American citizens. Mary van Kleeck surveyed labour relations between American workers and employers. In this dissertation, I have employed methods developed by intellectual historians, focussing on the published and unpublished papers that these social experts and Herbert Hoover himself produced. This collaboration between Hoover and some of the most prominent social scientists of the day explains the ambitious project they undertook, that of adjusting social ethics to the modern living conditions they had discovered while carrying out their social research. In so doing, they sought to adapt the traditional code of conduct of most Americans to the new circumstances that prevailed in the first decades of the twentieth century.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sm48t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365933r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>United States -- Social policy -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social ethics -- United States -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505479w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Microalgal adaptation to changes in carbon dioxide</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Collins, Sinead</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is generally accepted that global levels of CO2 will roughly double over the next century. Because of their large population sizes and fast generation times, microalgae may adapt to global change through novel mutations fixed by natural selection, such that future populations may be genetically different from contemporary ones. The prediction that microalgae may respond evolutionarily to rising CO2 was tested using populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grown for 1000 generations at increasing CO2. Laboratory populations grown at high CO2 did not show a direct response to selection at elevated CO2, instead evolving a range of non-adaptive syndromes. In addition, populations selected at elevated CO2 often grew poorly at ambient CO2. The same evolutionary responses were seen in natural populations isolated from CO2 springs. CO2 uptake was measured in a subset of the laboratory selection lines, which were found to have cells that either leaked CO2, had lost the ability to induce high-affinity CO 2 uptake, or both. These phenotypes were tentatively attributed to the accumulation of conditionally neutral mutations in genes involved in the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM). The high-CO2-selected phenotypes were found to be reversible in terms of fitness when populations were backselected in air, though wild-type regulation of the CCM was not regained. It has been suggested that phytoplankton adaptation to changes in CO2 levels is constrained by selective history. This was tested by culturing genetically distinct populations of Chlamydomonas at decreasing levels of CO2. In this case, divergence between lines was attributable to chance rather than selective history.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mr628.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505479w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii -- Adaptation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii -- Effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide on</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r075039n"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Full spectrum propaganda : the U.S. military, video games, and the genre of the military-themed shooter</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Clearwater, David A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation explores the emerging relationship between the U.S. military and the commercial video game market. Specifically, this study situates this relationship in terms of the U.S. military's evolving role in a variety of media-such as Hollywood feature films, television, and television news-for the purposes of propaganda and the influencing of public opinion. Consequently, an analysis and critique of the U.S. military's production and commissioning of commercial video games will be advanced that takes into account contemporary analyses and media critiques with respect to war and representation. Since these games are also a part of the larger field of entertainment and cultural production, this study will attempt to understand these products for the complex ways they combine cultural expression, modern spectatorship and the desire to influence or mediate popular conceptions of war. Consideration will also be given to situating these products within the emerging field of video game studies and aesthetics, as well as questions concerning genre, realism, historical revisionism, and the ethics of simulation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149t89v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r075039n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Civil-military relations -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Video games -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Video games industry -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956m18z"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Dopaminergic response to drugs of abuse in healthy humans : insights from [¹¹C]raclopride studies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Boileau, Isabelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Radioligand to receptor binding assessed with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can be used to investigate dopamine (DA) concentration in vivo . The present dissertation focuses on the use of the PET DA D 2/3 receptor ligand [11C]raclopride to study DA release following the administration of drugs of abuse: amphetamine and alcohol. A number of experimental animal paradigms have indicated that DA transmission is generally potently engaged by the acute administration of addictive drugs (Di Chiara and Imperato 1988; Weiss, Markou et al. 1992), deficient during drug withdrawal (Markou and Koob 1991; Schulteis, Markou et al. 1995; Epping-Jordan, Watkins et al. 1998) and facilitated or sensitized when drug use is reinstated after repetitive exposure (Kalivas 1993; Pierce and Kalivas 1997). Despite the abundance of data establishing the role of mesolimbic DA in the acute reinforcing effects of drugs the exact nature of DA's contribution to reward or addiction is still a subject of debate. Studies I and II present direct evidence in humans that amphetamine and alcohol promote DA release (decreased [11C]raclopride binding) preferentially in the limbic striatum when given acutely by mouth. Changes in binding correlated with self-reported drug-wanting and heart rate but not with drug liking or euphoria and were positively related to the personality trait of novelty seeking a known vulnerability factor in alcohol and drug dependence (Howard, Kivlahan et al. 1997). Study III is primarily concerned with alterations in psychological function and in brain response (DA release) resulting from repeated drug exposure. In healthy human subjects, re-exposure to amphetamine 14 and 365 days after 3 repeated doses had greater psychomotor effects and a concomitant reduction of [11C]raclopride binding compared to an initial dose. This result is interpreted as sensitization. We found that trait novelty seeking was a predictor of subsequent drug-induced DA release and of neurochemical sensitization. Together our studies indicated that drugs abused by humans increase DA release in the striatum, and when given repeatedly their administration may lead to sensitization, expressed in the form of persistent changes in brain DA neurochemistry. Acute and sensitized DA responses were related to trait novelty seeking and to the psychomotor effects of drugs but not to its pleasurable effects; however enjoyment of the drug-experience seems to alter DA response at subsequent drug-use. The model provides a framework for analyzing the neurochemical alterations associated with repeated drug-use and also provides useful information regarding the development and triggering of chronic relapsing disorders such as drug addiction and psychosis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x3455.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956m18z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811kp890"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Physics students' approaches to learning and cognitive processes in solving physics problems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bouchard, Josée</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examined traditional instruction and problem-based learning (PBL) approaches to teaching and the extent to which they foster the development of desirable cognitive processes, including metacognition, critical thinking, physical intuition, and problem solving among undergraduate physics students. The study also examined students' approaches to learning and their perceived role as physics students. The research took place in the context of advanced courses of electromagnetism at a Canadian research university. The cognitive science, expertise, physics and science education, instructional psychology, and discourse processes literature provided the framework and background to conceptualize and structure this study. A within-stage mixed-model design was used and a number of instruments, including a survey, observation grids, and problem sets were developed specifically for this study. A special one-week long problem-based learning (PBL) intervention was also designed. Interviews with the instructors participating in the study provided complementary data. Findings include evidence that students in general engage in metacognitive processes in the organization of their personal study time. However, this potential, including the development of other cognitive processes, might not be stimulated as much as it could in the traditional lecture instructional context. The PBL approach was deemed as more empowering for the students. An unexpected finding came from the realisation that a simple exposure to a structured exercise of problem-solving (pre-test) was sufficient to produce superior planning and solving strategies on a second exposure (post-test) even for the students who had not been exposed to any special treatment. Maturation was ruled out as a potential threat to the validity of this finding. Another promising finding appears to be that the problem-based learning (PBL) intervention tends to foster the development of cognitive competencies, particularly physical intuition, even if it was only implemented for a short period of time. Other findings relate to the nature of the cognitive actions and activities that the students engage in when learning to solve electromagnetism problems in a PBL environment for the first time and the tutoring actions that guide students in this context.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bq736.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kp890</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cognitive styles</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics -- Study and teaching (Higher)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Learning</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A736669055"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Recognition, expression, and understanding facial expressions of emotion in adolescents with nonverbal and general learning disabilities</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bloom, Elana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Students with learning disabilities (LD) have been found to exhibit social difficulties compared to those without LD (Wong, 2004). Recognition, expression, and understanding of facial expressions of emotions have been shown to be important for social functioning (Custrini &amp; Feldman, 1989; Philippot &amp; Feldman, 1990). LD subtypes have been studied (Rourke, 1999) and children with nonverbal learning disabilities (NVLD) have been observed to be worse at recognizing facial expressions compared to children with verbal learning disabilities (VLD), no learning disability (NLD; Dimitrovsky, Spector, Levy-Shiff, &amp; Vakil, 1998; Dimitrovsky, Spector, &amp; Levy-Shiff, 2000), and those with psychiatric difficulties without LD controls (Petti, Voelker, Shore, &amp; Hyman-Abello, 2003). However, little has been done in this area with adolescents with NVLD. Recognition, expression and understanding facial expressions of emotion, as well as general social functioning have yet to be studied simultaneously among adolescents with NVLD, NLD, and general learning disabilities (GLD). The purpose of this study was to examine abilities of adolescents with NVLD, GLD, and without LD to recognize, express, and understand facial expressions of emotion, in addition to their general social functioning. Adolescents aged 12 to 15 were screened for LD and NLD using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children---Third Edition (WISC-III; Weschler, 1991) and the Wide Range Achievement Test---Third Edition (WRAT3; Wilkinson, 1993) and subtyped into NVLD and GLD groups based on the WRAT3. The NVLD ( n = 23), matched NLD (n = 23), and a comparable GLD (n = 23) group completed attention, mood, and neuropsychological measures. The adolescent's ability to recognize (Pictures of Facial Affect; Ekman &amp; Friesen, 1976), express, and understand facial expressions of emotion, and their general social functioning was assessed. Results indicated that the GLD group was significantly less accurate at recognizing and understanding facial expressions of emotion compared to the NVLD and NLD groups, who did not differ from each other. No differences emerged between the NVLD, NLD, and GLD groups on the expression or social functioning tasks. The neuropsychological measures did not account for a significant portion of the variance on the emotion tasks. Implications regarding severity of LD are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p465r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/736669055</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Face perception</dc:subject><dc:subject>Facial expression</dc:subject><dc:subject>Learning disabled teenagers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580r865"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Investigation of the wingtip vortex behind an oscillating airfoil</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Birch, David M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The near-field flow structure of the tip vortex generated by a NACA 0015 wing oscillating though the attached-flow, light-stall and deep-stall regimes was investigated at Rec = 1.86 x 105.

Phase-locked, ensemble-averaged cross-flow and axial velocity fields, vorticity distributions, and turbulence structures over a full cycle of oscillation were compared to static wing-tip vortex results, and the dynamic effects upon the vortex strength, size, trajectory and associated induced drag were examined. Through the attached-flow and light-stall oscillations, most vortex properties were qualitatively similar to the static cases, though a small degree of hysteresis between the pitch-up and pitch-down phases of motion was observed. The radial distributions of circulation within the inner region of the vortex were self-similar, and showed only small variations from the static case. When the wing was oscillated through the deep-stall regime, a dramatic decrease in tip vortex strength and concentration was observed at the end of the upstroke, as a result of the growth of the leading-edge vortex and subsequent catastrophic flow separation. The use of passive spoilers and active flaps to control the strength and trajectory of the tip vortex was also investigated.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892g30x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580r865</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vn18g"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Population dynamics of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) in turfgrass as influenced by a biological control agent, Sclerotinia minor</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abu-Dieyeh, Mohammed H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Control of Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) and other broadleaf weeds in turfgrass has been readily achieved with phenoxy herbicides, but the herbicide option has been revoked in many regions, necessitating alternative weed control strategies. One biological alternative is Sclerotinia minor, an Ascomycete fungus. The impact of S. minor on broadleaf weed dynamics and biotic interactions were studied in a turfgrass environment. The goal was to maximize effectiveness of a S. minor formulation as a biocontrol of dandelion using an ecological approach. S. minor efficacy was not affected by turf microenvironments and was similarly efficacious with spring or fall application. All accessions from a worldwide collection of dandelion and 32 turfgrass broadleaf species were susceptible to S. minor. Biocontrol efficacy was inversely correlated with dandelion age, but efficacy on all ages was enhanced in the presence of grass competition. When combined with regular mowing at 7-10 cm, the S. minor suppressive effect on dandelion was similar to the herbicide effect, particularly in the following season. Weed suppression was less with close mowing at 3-5 cm due to increased dandelion seedling recruitment. While spring herbicide application was effective to suppress dandelion population, the S. minor treatment has no residual activity, necessitating a second application to suppress seedling recruits. Root regrowth after S. minor infection was minimal and was further reduced in superior quality turf after season-long mowing, and after spring applications. S. minor infected dandelion seeds, reduced the dandelion seedbank, and reduced dandelion seedling emergence by 98%. S. minor did not affect the emergence or the total biomass of cool season temperate turfgrass species. Turfgrass quality was improved following S. minor application and populations of other broadleaf weeds were also controlled by S. minor. Understanding the biotic interactions within the turfgrass environment has rewardingly lead to successful integration of the S.minor biocontrol with the common management tools of mowing and over-seeding to achieve excellent control of dandelion and a healthy thriving turf.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70n056x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vn18g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sclerotinia minor</dc:subject><dc:subject>Common dandelion -- Biological control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lawns -- Weed control</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290f83k"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Stationarity in a prevalent cohort study with follow-up</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Addona, Vittorio</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a prevalent cohort study with follow-up, the incidence process is not directly observed since only the onset times of prevalent cases can be ascertained. Several important consequences follow if one can establish stationarity of the incidence process: (1) The useful epidemiological relationship between prevalence, incidence, and mean duration holds, (2) There is improved efficiency when estimating the underlying survivor function from a prevalent cohort study with follow-up, (3) The constancy of the incidence rate is established, and (4) The constant incidence rate can be estimated using data from a prevalent cohort study. We propose a formal test for stationarity using data from a prevalent cohort study with follow-up, and establish new characterizations of stationarity, and of useful types of departure from stationarity. A dual to the problem of establishing stationarity by comparing the backward and forward recurrence times is addressed. Assuming stationarity of the underlying incidence process, we use the backward and forward recurrence times to verify whether the underlying survival distribution is independent of the date of onset. In doing so, we characterize specific types of dependence of the underlying survival distribution on calendar time. If the data are consistent with stationarity of the incidence rate, then a natural next step is to estimate the (constant) incidence rate. We derive the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the constant incidence rate, prove that the estimator is weakly consistent, and show how one may construct an asymptotic confidence interval for the incidence rate. One main advantage of our procedure is that it only requires the completion of a single prevalent cohort study with follow-up. We apply our test for stationarity to data obtained as part of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging to verify that the incidence rate of dementia amongst the elderly in Canada has remained constant. Upon concluding that this constancy is, plausible, we estimate the incidence rate.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w4063.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290f83k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Statistics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap2677087g"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Imaging identity : a study of Aljazeera's online news and its representation of Arabness with particular attention to &amp;quot;Arabs in diaspora&amp;quot;</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abdel Rahim, Yasser</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis studies the relations between media image, online news design, and the framing of identity. It scrutinizes current images of Arab identity and their representation in Aljazeera Net in order to examine how Aljazeera Net constructs the 'reality' of Arabs. The dissertation begins by defining Arabness in terms of ethnic, cultural and postcolonial identities. It proposes and assesses the sources of Arab identity and examines Arab identity as a source of meanings for Arabs. Likewise, it evaluates the sources of Arab identity in the Arab diaspora. Through the lens of a remediation approach, the study explores newly emerging practices in the representation of news, and investigates how the design of Aljazeera Net alters the construction of meaning in news representation. The frames that govern the representation of Arab identity determine the complexity of the image of Arabness, and reveal the differences between the acknowledged perspectives and evolving identity of Aljazeera. The study conceives Aljazeera Net as a space for the reciprocal relationship between Aljazeera and Arabs in diaspora, and as a site for the overlapping between the local and the global in media representations. Finally, it considers how Arabs in the North American diaspora, particularly Arab media experts, academics and community leaders, perceive their identity, and how they evaluate Aljazeera as a Pan Arab media.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784q69n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2677087g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arabs in mass media</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arabs -- Foreign countries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Al Jazeera (Television network)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag732df20s"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Design and distortion analysis of fully integrated image reject RF CMOS frontends</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abdul Baki, Rola</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents the design and experimental results of a 7.3GHz notch image reject filter, combined with a 5.8GHz low-noise amplifier (LNA), for integrated heterodyne receiver front-ends. A new image reject filter implementation is proposed. Q-enhancement circuitry for on-chip inductors are used to optimize the depth of image rejection. Experimental results show that more than 62dB of image rejection at 7.3GHz can be obtained in a standard CMOS 0.18mum technology, while operating from a 1.8V supply. The LNA exhibits a gain of 15.8dB and an IIP3 of -5.3dBm while consuming 9mW of power. With maximum image rejection, the LNA-notch combination circuit achieves a 4.1dB noise figure at 5.8GHz. The proposed notch filter alone can operate from a 1V supply voltage. It is shown analytically how circuit stability can be ensured. The implementation of new robust and stable high-Q CMOS image reject filters, which enables the realization of fully integrated heterodyne 5GHz RF receivers is also presented. A cascade of two notch filters with their image reject frequencies slightly offsetted is proposed, in order to obtain a wide image rejection bandwidth, without having to resort to the overhead of automatic tuning circuitry. Thus, power consumption, area, and complexity are significantly reduced. Experimental results show that more than 30d$ of image rejection can be obtained in a standard 0.18mum CMOS technology, over a 400MHz bandwidth centered at 7.4GHz.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494d61p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732df20s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20sz14z"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Space-time-frequency channel estimation for multiple-antenna orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wong, Kar Lun (Clarence)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We propose a linear mean square error channel estimator that exploits the joint space-time-frequency (STF) correlations of the wireless fading channel for applications in multiple-antenna orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. Our work generalizes existing channel estimators to the full dimensions including transmit spatial, receive spatial, time, and frequency. This allows versatile applications of our STF channel estimator to any fading environment, ranging from spatially-uncorrelated slow-varying frequency-flat channels to spatially-correlated fast-varying frequency-selective channels. The proposed STF channel estimator reduces to a time-frequency (TF) channel estimator when no spatial correlations exist. In another perspective, the lower-dimension TF channel estimator can be viewed as an STF channel estimator with spatial correlation mismatch for space-time-frequency selective channels. Computer simulations were performed to study the mean-square-error (MSE) behavior with different pilot parameters. We then evaluate the suitability of our STF channel estimator on a space-frequency block coded OFDM system. Bit error rate (BER) performance degradation, with respect to perfect coherent detection, is limited to less than 2 dB at a BER of 10-5 in the modified 3GPP fast-fading suburban macro environment. Modifications to the 3GPP channel involves reducing the base station angle spread to imitate a high transmit spatial correlation scenario to emphasize the benefit of exploiting spatial correlation in our STF channel estimator.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bg94k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sz14z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing</dc:subject><dc:subject>MIMO systems</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3t945w23s"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Capacitance-based microvolume liquid-level sensor array</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Seliskar, Daniel Peter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A prototype sensor array was developed for use with laboratory automation to permit closed-loop control of liquid-levels in a multiwell microplate geometry. A simple electrical model for non-contact capacitance-based fluid sensors was extended to describe a fluid-level dependency. The new model shows that a charge-transfer based capacitance transducer employing a liquid-specific calibration can be used to obtain an output signal that varies linearly with the liquid-level when fringe-field effects are negligible. The calibration also compensates for liquid-to-liquid conductivity and permittivity differences. The sensor was tested using sodium chloride (NaCl) and ethanol solutions to simulate the range of conductivity and permittivity typical in biological and chemical research. Measured capacitance was a second-order function of liquid volume due to fringe-field effects and was compensated for by adding a hardware-based calibration. Liquid-volume measurement error averaged 0.2% of the 120mul fill volume with a standard deviation of 0.6% (&lt; mul).

Cooling curve analysis was used to determine the liquidus points in order to construct the liquidus surface of the ternary phase diagram in the Mg corner. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS), and x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were used to examine phases present at the compositions studied. A thermal arrest presumed to represent a eutectic transformation was discovered at 580°C. Two new intermetallic compounds, designated tau and theta, were found. Trace silicon present in the alloys was found to concentrate in one of the intermetallic compounds. To further investigate these compounds, an induction furnace was used to synthesize alloys containing the concentrations of Ce and In seen in electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) examinations of these compounds. The alloys were examined using the cooling curve technique and XRD, and proved to contain the compounds already observed with some variation in dissolved indium content. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to confirm the liquidus and solidus values determined using cooling curve analysis. A diffusion couple with terminal compositions of pure Ce and a Mg-In alloy was prepared in order to determine the equilibrium phases present in the system between these two compositions at 390°C. EPMA was used to identify the zones obtained, and confirmed the presence of several Mg-Ce compounds with 1 at% dissolved indium, as well as a ternary compound corresponding to the theta compound found in the dilute alloys. Finally, literature values and experimental data were used to calculate a preliminary ternary phase diagram using FACTSage, in collaboration with the CTRC at Ecole Polytechnique, in order to affirm the validity of the experimentally determined values as well as to project the diagram beyond the studied composition range.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zj81c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sz17s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Magnesium alloys</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cerium alloys</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indium alloys</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phase diagrams, Ternary</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0g354k561"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Precipitation of aluminum (oxy)hydroxides from concentrated chloride solutions by neutralization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gella, Vera</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The precipitation and crystallization of aluminum (oxy)hydroxides from chloride solutions by neutralization appears to be quite complex and depends on several parameters, namely, temperature, the OH/Al molar ratio, aging and solution composition. The precipitation of aluminum from AlC13 solutions was found to be complete at substoichiometric OH/Al ratios (typically ~ 2.7), and resulted in the production of an amorphous material that transformed to crystalline phases upon aging at OH/Al ≥3. The predominant phases precipitated from 0.5M AlCl3 solutions at 22, 60 and 95° C at an OH/Al ratio of 3 after 24 hours of aging were pseudoboehmite, bayerite and boehmite, respectively. Increasing the OH/Al ratio and aging time at both 22°C and 60°C promoted crystallization of bayerite over poorly crystalline boehmite. At 95°C, regardless of aging time or degree of neutralization, boehmite was consistently obtained. Increasing the AlCl3 concentration to 2.0M proved to suppress the crystallization of bayerite at 22°C and 60°C, and favoured the crystallization of pseudoboehmite instead. Between the bayerite and pseudoboehmite products, the former exhibited the best settling behaviour (30% settled slurry density after 1 week), while settling did not occur at all for the latter. Precipitates produced from mixed AlCl3-NaCl solutions exhibited an increasing tendency to form pseudoboehmite over bayerite with increasing sodium chloride concentration. Upon neutralizing mixed AlCl3-MgCl 2 systems, the final solution pH decreased significantly with increasing magnesium chloride concentration. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of MgCl2 promoted the precipitation of poorly crystalline mixed magnesium-aluminum-hydroxide hydrates, identified as Mg6Al2(OH)18·4.5H 2O by XRD. Increases in temperature (up to 125°C), aging time (48 hours) and OH/Al ratio (3.45) were unsuccessful in improving the crystallinity or transformation of these precipitates.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nz72j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354k561</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chlorides</dc:subject><dc:subject>Precipitation (Chemistry)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aluminum hydroxide</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67jw35r"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Robust beamforming for collaborative MIMO-OFDM wireless systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kwun, Byong-Ok.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Collaborative beamforming is a powerful technique to increase communication energy efficiency and range in an energy-constrained network. To achieve high performance, collaborative beamforming requires accurate knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters (collaborative nodes). In practice, however, such exact knowledge of CSI is not available. A robust transmitter design based on partial CSI is required to mitigate the effects of CSI mismatches. This thesis focuses on the design and evaluation of a beamforming scheme that is robust to CSI mismatches for collaborative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless systems. Using a max-min robust design approach, the robust beamformer is designed to maximize the minimum (worst-case) received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within a predefined uncertainty region at each OFDM subcarrier. In addition, several subcarrier power allocation strategies are investigated to further improve the robustness of collaborative systems. Numerical simulation results show that the robust beamformer offers improved performance over the nonrobust beamformers and the use of power allocation strategies among subcarriers further improves the system performance.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988q087.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jw35r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Antenna arrays -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing</dc:subject><dc:subject>MIMO systems</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1n79h854v"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cauchy interpolation for multi-variate and multi-derivative data</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kaufman, Jonathan, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is often a need to interpolate data that is obtained through experiment or computational analysis, because the data is difficult or expensive to obtain.

However, in natural visual scenes, we seldom know the precise stimulus location, rather, we often know the general area where target of interest may appear. Here, we investigated how human saccadic reaction time (SRT) and saccade final landing position may be affected by training to attend to an area where a target will appear. Additionally, we looked at how training to an area of one size may influence eye movements to targets presented in a larger area. Subjects were trained to attend to an area-cue of 6° in diameter, always presented in the same quadrant of the visual field, at the same spatial coordinates. During training, targets were presented at random locations inside the cued area. After training, targets were presented inside an area-cue (except for a few catch trials) of either the same size or of a larger size (i.e. 10° diameter). Results show that training-related saccades were directed toward individually distinctive preferred regions inside the trained area, and towards identical regions in relative coordinates inside the larger 10° area. Importantly, training-related saccades were mostly in the anticipatory range, a large proportion of which was followed by the corrective second saccades directed towards the target. Our findings suggest that anticipatory saccades should be considered in the assessment of training-related changes in oculomotor preparation of saccadic programming.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wm50m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g432z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Saccades</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pf80n"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A proteomic screen reveals novel Fas ligand interacting proteins within nervous system Schwann cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thornhill, Peter, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Fas Ligand (FasL) binds to the Fas receptor to induce apoptosis or activate other signaling pathways.
