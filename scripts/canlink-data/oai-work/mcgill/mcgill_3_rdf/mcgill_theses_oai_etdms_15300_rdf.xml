This dissertation will examine his highly personal and Judaic conception of the act of writing in order to demonstrate that it constitutes in fact the cornerstone of Kafka's activity as a writer and that it can be traced in a significant number of his literary works as their regulating instance. In order to do so, we will first examine the social, political and economic conditions prevailing in Central Europe at the turn of the 20th century, in order to ascertain its tremendous impact on the Jewish communities living in that part of the world, in terms of loss of traditional Jewish identity culminating in many cases in assimilation. Kafka's work will thus firstly be situated in the historical and political context out of which it emerged. In the course of this work, we have used the concepts of sacre and profane as developed by the historian of religions Mircea Eliade throughout in order to demonstrate that there exists in Kafka's work a constitutive tension articulated between those two poles, not only at the level of the plot, but at the level of language itself. Since the central element at the root of this tension is expressed in terms of presence and absence, we have also analysed the philosophy of language of Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem, which are themselves articulated exactly in those terms. The use of these categories has helped us show that if Kafka's work is indeed at time very close to that of Scholem and Benjamin, especially in its literary rendition of motives underlining the absence of the divine in language, it also distinguishes itself markedly from the work of the two philosophers by the use of other motives which underline the immediate presence of the message of Revelation, made directly accessible within the modern and profane language, which is also that of literature.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246w46q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h5121</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kafka, Franz, 1883-1924 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Judaism and literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion and literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t283n"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Community, marine rights, and sea tenure : a political ecology of marine conservation in two Bohol villages in central Philippines</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guieb, Eulalio R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study focuses on communities in conservation in central Philippines, with reference to marine protected areas. It analyzes communities as intersections of multiple actors with stratified interests and power, involving complex processes of place-making, ecological knowledge, tenure, governance, markets, and negotiation with domestic and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). As rights to places are fundamentally at issue with protected areas, matters of tenure are central for the study. And because marine protected areas (MPAs) are community-based, questions of local empowerment have equal centrality. The ownership of rights to marine resources by village members is a necessary if not sufficient condition for the political empowerment of communities in conservation. The issue of property rights in the Philippines is irrevocably linked to issues of equity, as social actors confront prevailing unequal relations of power. The development of community commitment to the reconfigured arrangements of marine protected area establishment depends on substantial economic gains for marginalized villagers, an equitable distribution of those gain, the ecologically sound management of resources over which rights are negotiated and gains generated, and a socially meaningful realignment of relations of power among nested sources of authority. My analysis points to the advantages of a reinforced community property regime that would call for measures by the national government to enhance villagers' tenure over their settlements and community waters (katubigang barangay). Such a regime is no panacea for the manifold social and environmental challenges faced by communities, but it would enable them to engage more confidently and constructively with state, NGO and other interests in conservation, and to address the real or perceived threats of dislocation by externally proposed schemes. Two villages with MPAs in the province of Bohol in central Philippines serve as case study sites to explore intertwined social, economic and political variables that influence issues of conservation, equity and empowerment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c4130.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t283n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bohol (Philippines) -- Social conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bohol (Philippines) -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marine resources conservation -- Political aspects -- Philippines</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marine resources conservation -- Philippines</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jj04t"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The domestic sources of regional orders : explaining instability in the Middle East</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mansour, Imad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation addresses the puzzle as to why some regions in the world are engulfed in militarized disputes among member states, while other regions live under peaceful conditions. It argues that domestic regime-societal management strategies have significant explanatory value to understand variance in regional orders. These domestic factors have largely been ignored in International Relations (IR) literature. A domestic politics-based analytical framework explains how states with inclusionary governing regimes (those which account for the interests of societal actors in policy formulation and consequently give them stakes in the survival of the regime) are more likely to move the regional order towards stability. On the other hand, states with exclusionary regimes (those which do not account for the interests of societal actors in policy formulation and consequently do not give them stakes in the survival of the regime) are more likely to push the regional order toward instability. The dissertation also addresses a frequently underexposed dimension of IR theory: exactly how do major powers influence regional orders? It argues that major powers penetrate regional states in support of either societal actors or regimes (and sometimes both). In that process major powers help alter the power asymmetries inside regional states affecting their preferences and strategies, and hence their behaviour towards the regional order. The analytical framework is used to explain variations in Middle East regional orders through four paired comparisons of six states: Israel-Egypt, Israel-Turkey, Israel-Syria, and Iran-Saudi Arabia. The time frame under study is from 1950 to 2000. The change in the Middle East regional order post-1990 did not correspond in magnitude to the change in the international system, adding credibility to this framework which prioritizes domestic level variables in shaping regional orders.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bg20s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jj04t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>International relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Middle East -- Politics and government -- 1945-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political stability -- Middle East</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zm26f"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>spa</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Hispanic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Recepción político-literaria de Calderón : de la querella calderoniana a Menéndez Pelayo y sus discípulos</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Manrique Gómez, Marta, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the political and literary reception in Spain of the figure of Pedro Calderon de la Barca, Golden Age playwright, during the years comprising the start of the querella calderoniana until the end of the nineteenth century; a period dominated by the intellectual figure Marcelino Menendez Pelayo. The nineteenth century is characterized by widespread social, political, economic, religious and cultural change, as much as for the development of the intention, on the part of political ideologies in positions of power, to generate a concrete idea of the Nation; in short, a specific way of interpreting Spanish national identify. This changes and the process which followed the configuration of this idea of the nation are recorded in little studied and highly politicized print media of the time, as well as in various verbal polemics maintained over the course of the century. The study of these has allowed me to demonstrate that the reception of Calderon has been strongly influenced by the presence and interaction of these aspects. As the century progresses, the figure of the playwright becomes increasingly identified with the ideals of the National identify established by political conservatives. In the first chapter, I analyse what happened in this intellectual conflict contextualizing it ideologically in the calderonian polemics of the eighteenth century, and frame it within relevant events in the formation of national identity. The next two chapters analyse the development of the querella calderoniana and the subsequent appropriation of Calderon, in one of the darkest moments for the written press in Spain, corresponding with Fernando VII's absolutist regime. This study has been achieved through close readings of various periodicals, literary and ideological discourses of this epoch. The final chapter concentrates on the conservative appropriation of Calderon effectuated by Menendez Pelayo, one of the most important intellectual figures of nineteenth century in Spain, who attempted to integrate this appropriation with others preceding it. A brief section of conclusions summarizes the theses, followed by a selected bibliography.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tz73f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zm26f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Calderón de la Barca, Pedro, 1600-1681 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nationalism and literature -- Spain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Literature and society -- Spain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spain -- Intellectual life -- 19th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pelayo, Enrique Menénde,z, 1861-1921 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rz087"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cartographies of cloth : mapping the veil in contemporary art</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pocock, V. A. (Valerie-Anne)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The veil is a historically constructed site, a fixed sign used in Euro-America to conveniently and clearly dress the borders between east and west. Recent disciplines like visual and cultural studies, Third World feminism, and postcolonialism have challenged this assumption positing instead the veil's polysemy and its different sometimes multiple meanings according to the individual, and the historical and geographical context. Representations of the veil in contemporary art have appeared quite frequently in Euro-America in the last couple of decades, and in the thesis I set out to demonstrate that many of these visual texts also propose significant reinscriptions of the sign capable of displacing dominant discourse. However, because of the veil's metonymy in Euro-American mainstream culture and 'collective gaze,' the thesis first charts the topography of the trope in history, discourse and visual culture as its entrenchment obviously complicates any use of the sign by artists of Muslim origin exhibiting within the western art apparatus. It then traces three alternative narratives of the veil evident in contemporary practice underscoring their critical importance with regards to gender, politics, representation and the conception of self. I must however concede that the major impetus behind the analyses of the contextualized veil, the postcolonial veil and the subject-ive veil is a belief in the radical power of visual texts to facilitate transnational literacy and translation. The study therefore focuses on the relationship between the location -territorial or ideological- of the gaze and the image. It demonstrates that this relationship or space is protean, plural and full of promise both individually and collectively.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hw19t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rz087</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Veils in art</dc:subject><dc:subject>Muslim women in art</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asf268880p"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Single women and infidelity : a feminist qualitative analysis of extramarital relationships and their termination</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Oala, Monica</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Extramarital relationships and women's sexuality are by far some of the most controversial and elusive subjects in our society, and most of the empirical literature and popular opinion about the connection between women and infidelity perceive it as unequivocally taboo. Following the work of feminist researchers who valorize the potential for women's sexual experiences and view heterosexual relationships as a form of oppression, I explore the extramarital relationships between single women and married men. To perform this exploration, I completed two-part, in-depth interviews with eleven single women who had an intimate relationship with a married man. Once the interviews were transcribed verbatim, I completed a four-step voice-centered relational reading and analysis of the interviews in which participants' experiences were summarized into three relationships: with themselves, with the married man, and with the married man's wife. I set aside the themes that emerged from this inquiry and I performed a discourse analysis on the participants' narratives for each of these three relationships. Since the resulting themes from the voice-centered relational analysis overlapped considerably with the dominant discourses that emerged from the discourse analysis, a more in-depth feminist analysis was performed exclusively on the latter. In summary, the most commonly occurring dominant discourses were a struggle with morality, identity development and identity reconstruction; responsibility toward women (the married man's wife); and a negative emotional aftermath following the end of the relationship. Consequently, this analysis also found an occurrence of three types of extramarital relationships: satisfying, distressing/distancing, and emotionally abusive. Each dominant discourse was deconstructed per participant and per interview by using a feminist theoretical lens. The analysis paved the way for a relational and socio-political examination of single women's experiences of infidelity. The implications of this study are discussed by comparing them to existing investigations, both feminist and traditional, of women's intimate relationships. This study thus aimed to understand the experiences of single women who have had intimate relationships with married men, to empower them as well as the mental health professionals and educators who work with this particular clientele.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92gb80r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf268880p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Man-woman relationships</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Sexual behavior</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adultery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290f081"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Desautels Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Understanding the individual turnover decision as a temporal process : an interpretive study of physicians</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Klag, Malvina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Though turnover researchers have called for a deeper understanding of the temporal and contextualized process of individual voluntary turnover, little empirical progress in this direction has been made. Adopting Price's (1977) dynamic conceptualization of turnover as moving from one social system to another, and drawing upon knowledge across organizational, social psychological and psychological domains, this exploratory thesis uses in-depth topical life histories to examine individual experiences with stay/leave decision processes in their construed context. Findings challenge longstanding assumptions of linearity and continuity in turnover decision processes, as well as the conventional wisdom that utility-maximizing logic underlies these decisions. The data suggest that the pursuit of context-self congruence is a driving force in stay/leave decision processes, and that self-concept, emotions and psychological states may be under-studied influencers of these decisions. Results further uncover decision process characteristics previously rendered inaccessible to researchers, due to the predominant use of correlational studies in turnover research. These characteristics include: a) pivotal points of transition; b) the story lines that underlie influencing factors; c) the nature and role of context; and d) the consequences of engaging in these decision processes, for participants and for their workplaces, regardless of the outcome. This idiographic study, using a purposive sample from a single population of Quebec physicians, is intended to provide turnover researchers with a starting point for cross-group retrospective and longitudinal comparisons. It also aims to stimulate hypothesis generation that accounts for time and the contextual conditions under which particular factors are likely to affect the turnover decision. From a practical viewpoint, this thesis begins to answer the call from Canadian and Quebec Health Care Human Resource specialists for a deeper understanding of the psychosocial aspects of Canadian healthcare worker turnover and retention (British Columbia Office of the Auditor General, 2004; Dubois &amp; Dussault, 2002).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63t0427.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290f081</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physicians -- Québec (Province) -- Personnel management -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Career changes -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207ts649"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A social-cultural-historical analysis of Chinese return migration : case studies of ten Chinese MBA students' migration experiences</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ma, Li, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent years have witnessed the large number of Chinese immigrants in Canada. However, talk about the return migration of Chinese immigrants is circulating within the Canada's Chinese communities, especially among Chinese immigrants who have obtained Canadian academic credentials. This inquiry explores ten Chinese immigrants' perceptions about their immigration and living experiences in Canada. My goal is to understand, from a social-cultural-historical context, the phenomenon of Chinese-Canadian return migration among recent Chinese immigrants in Canada. The theoretical framework is derived primarily from Bourdieu's capital theory and his critical approach to the concept of habitus . Drawing on an interpretative, qualitative approach, I examine social, cultural, historical forces that influence the ways these Chinese immigrants perceive, negotiate and reposition themselves in facing various challenges and struggles. Traditionally, research on return migration of Chinese immigrants in Canada has focused on the economic and social integration of immigrants in the host country. I argue that "Chinese cultural habitus", such as the profound influence of Confucianism and Taoism that Chinese immigrants inherited, played critical roles in their actions, attitudes and decision-making about their return migration. I collected the participants' narratives for a one and half year period from August 2006 to March 2008 primarily through open-ended interviews, and various documentation such as field notes, reflexive notes and Canadian Statistics. Analyses of the data suggest that the unrecognized foreign credentials and the limited social capital of Chinese immigrants are the primary factors that disadvantage their social mobility. Chinese cultural values and beliefs have great impact on Chinese immigrants' perceptions and behaviors during their journey of crossing different social spaces, assuming different positionings and negotiating among their multiple identities.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322j20j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207ts649</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Return migration -- China</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chinese -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816r022"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The efficacy of manager teaching to enhance leadership learning and effectiveness</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Saggers, Robert E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>"Development of others" appears consistently in leadership competency frameworks; managers are now being asked to think of themselves as teachers in addition to their myriad other roles.

This study found support for this claim. Twenty managers and forty-three of their employees participated in this study. Data were collected from both groups, before and after the managers attended a workshop designed using activity systems theory. Results indicate that employee perceptions are positively influenced by manager teaching, managers can learn to be situational leaders and that post-workshop teaching by managers to employees facilitates manager learning and leadership effectiveness.

More specifically, this doctoral thesis seeks to contribute to organizational theory and strategic management by (1) reviewing and systematizing legitimacy types discerned in the literature and contrasting legitimacy with related concepts of reputation and status, (2) identifying the properties of legitimacy, and (3) exploring some of the implications of these properties for management practice and strategic management research. The doctoral research is presented in the form of a manuscript-based thesis consisting of three interrelated papers: 1. Organizational Legitimacy as a Form of Judgment. Through the analysis of legitimacy definitions, types and typologies, and operationalizations, this study first develops an enumerative definition of organizational legitimacy, maps different types of legitimacy discerned in the literature onto the process of legitimacy judgment formation and highlights the fundamental differences between cognitive and sociopolitical legitimacy types. This paper then advances a conceptualization of cognitive and sociopolitical types of legitimacy, reputation and status as four different types of judgment that actors can render in respect to an organization and explores some implications of this approach for organizational research, namely the role of social judgments in exchange partner selection and the use of social judgments under conditions of uncertainty. 2. Legitimacy-Based Entry Deterrence in Inter-Population Competition. This paper develops a theory of competitive social norm manipulations and explores the strategies that well-established organizational populations use to build legitimacy-based barriers to entry into their domain. The study develops a typology of legitimacy manipulation strategies that established organizational populations use to prevent, eradicate or palliate the new entrants' impact by: (1) changing the relative importance of legitimacy dimensions, (2) raising the legitimacy threshold and (3) altering perceptions of competitors' performance. Successful legitimacy manipulations are shown to lead to institutional immunization of the incumbents against similar competitive challenges in the future. 3. Defensive Institutional Strategies in Emergent Industries. Through a comparative analysis of two emergent industries in Canada, this study advances a conceptualization of the process of emergence of a new industry from a successful innovative business model, focusing on sequential lines of institutional defense that are available to emergent industries that come under such attacks: (1) keep a low profile; (2) form a trade association; (3) develop an industry code to provide guidelines and member coordination; (4) enforce the code through self-policing; (5) if everything else fails to end the attack, invite the government to impose regulation. Illustrations of the application of these strategies are provided.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gp412.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f4713</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Strategic planning</dc:subject><dc:subject>Management</dc:subject><dc:subject>Organizational sociology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50tw098"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Three essays on labour mobility</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Von Restorff, Claus-Henning, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation looks at three different aspects of labour mobility. The first essay examines the movements of workers between wage-employment and self-employment in the United States and the returns to various forms of experience in that context. The second essay studies the long-term unemployed in Canada, and the transitions that they make into other labour market states. The final essay deals with the implications of movements of workers between countries -- specifically, it analyzes earnings distributions to obtain a more complete picture about the declining economic fortunes of immigrants to Canada in recent times. They key contribution of the first essay lies in the recognition that consideration must also be given to industry and occupation specific experience when studying returns to experience in the context of movements between wage and self-employment - otherwise the returns to other forms of experience will be biased. Using data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, I find that past occupational experience can, among the different forms of experience, best explain the hourly rate of pay for workers, especially among the self-employed. Using data from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics, the second essay examines the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed (defined as being unemployed for at least a year) in Canada, in view of what is known from the research literature in Europe. Canada has a relatively low rate of long-term unemployment when compared to most European countries, but the proportion of long-term unemployed who remain unemployed for another year or more is surprisingly close to the high European levels. Examination of the factors affecting the chances of the long-term unemployed to obtain regular employment reveals, however, that several of the factors that hinder the chances of the long-term unemployed in Europe are not major obstacles, including age, gender and immigrant status. Low skill, on the other hand, does appear to be a major contributor to very long-term unemployment in Canada as elsewhere. The findings appear to support the view of Canada as belonging firmly with the 'liberal' welfare state and labour market regimes. The final essay studies earnings distributions of recent immigrants to Canada in 1980 and 2000, as well as those of their native-born counterparts; moreover, I make a distinction between individuals in wage work and in self-employment. Using Canadian Census data, the essay studies two aspects -- immigrant/native-born earnings gaps, and earnings inequality within the immigrant and native-born populations. With regard to the observed growth in earnings gaps, I find that changes in observed characteristics and earnings structure effects were both responsible. With regard to the observed growth in earnings inequality, I find that residual inequality was largely responsible. But while this increase in residual inequality appears to reflect the effects of comprehensive skill biased technical change among the wage-employed, this is not the case among the self-employed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qq69r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tw098</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Labor mobility -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Labor mobility -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Labor mobility</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agm80j009s"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le maître à écrire selon Valéry, Pessoa et Jaccottet</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Léger, Ariane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main objective of this study is to understand how Valery, Pessoa and Jaccottet created or recreated the figure of the master. This figure has truly made its entry into the literary scene in the second half of the nineteenth century, and it contributed to impose a profane and more egalitarian vision of writing. In the writing of the three authors studied, the master is still seen as a strategy to develop a concept of creation, since it allows the writers to define their poetic. It is therefore a matter of maitres a penser (literally "thinking masters") or, better yet, maitres a ecrire ("writing masters"). For Valery, the desire to make Mallarme his master is best explained by his search for mastery. Even if he is eager to understand what makes Mallarme an exceptional creator, Valery's quest is hindered by Mallarme's refusal to explain his poetic. This resistance seems to encourage Valery to make the creative act a major concern of his work. By coming up with a "non-existent coterie" made up of imaginary writers, and by recognizing one of them as his own master, Pessoa hopes to fill the gaps in his literary filiation. In the concert of voices that compose his work, it is yet the master himself which undermines the very legitimacy of the master, and that is why Pessoa finally gets rid of his invention. Finally, Jaccottet creates his masters for the learning they could provide to him: in Jaccottet's unique story, the character of the master fails, allowing the poet to take his distance from assumptions related with the romantic vision of creation; then, a "good master" whose agony is described by poems becomes a model whose wisdom is inseparable from a kind of ignorance. The presence of the master generates a story elaborated from the writings of these writers: the development of their poetic requires not only the creation of a master figure, but also its removal. Ultimately, the maitre a ecrire is not only one who induces writing in a unique way, but also the one which should be written in order to succeed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xn105.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80j009s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pessoa, Fernando, 1888-1935 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jaccottet, Philippe -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Valéry, Paul, 1871-1945 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adz010t57k"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Lifelines : matrilineal narratives, memory and identity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Attarian, Hourig</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This inquiry explores matrilineal autobiographical narratives in the contexts of family stories and memories. This self-study traces the stories of a collective of five women of a common Armenian heritage, who represent various generational, homeland and diasporic portraits and experiences. Carrying the burden of being descendants of genocide survivors, the memories we reconstruct and interpret deal with issues of inherited exile, dispossession, loss, trauma, survival and healing. In exploring these narratives, I engage in self-reflexivity as we construct, re-construct, re-present our narratives and their impact on our constructions and negotiations of self and identity. I use the family album metaphor as a foundation for my narrative framework and weave together the participants' and my autobiographical reconstructions through the intertwined stories of memory, trauma and displacement. The self-reflexive nature of our multilayered autobiographical narratives reconnects our selves with our pasts. Within a diasporic frame, I use the narratives as interpretive tools to explore the effects of multigenerational diasporic experiences on constructions of identity and agency. The relationships we develop using face-to-face group conversations, virtual discussions through a Web forum and emails, personal reflexive journals, photo props and collaged images, highlight a dialogic process of imagined possibilities for the transformative power of storying. The autobiographical inquiry bridges voice to self and self to voice. This authoring process is an essential medium to writing ourselves as women. The process also allows us to reclaim our vulnerabilities as sources of inner strength and to embrace this understanding as the locus of writing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440x35w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010t57k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Matrilineal kinship</dc:subject><dc:subject>Armenians</dc:subject><dc:subject>Armenians -- Foreign countries -- Biography</dc:subject><dc:subject>Autobiography -- Women authors</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5t34sn81s"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Multicultural counselling competencies with adolescents : a qualitative examination of client experiences</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kassan, Anusha</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In recent years, an important focus has been placed on training counsellors to attend to cultural diversity. In an effort to assist counsellors in this process, models of Multicultural Counselling Competencies (MCC) have been developed for work with adult populations. Unfortunately, little attention has been given to adapting these models or developing specific models for counselling with adolescents. While clinical guidelines have been proposed for counsellors working with culturally diverse youth, they have yet to be empirically tested. The present study investigated the MCC which former adolescent clients believed to be important to them when they attended counselling. Participants included 20 women between the ages of 18 and 23 who sought counselling when they were between the ages of 12 and 19. Participants completed an in-depth qualitative interview about their counselling experiences and were asked to discuss the aspects of counselling they found to be most and least helpful. The interview data was analyzed using phenomenological methodology. The components of cultural competence (counsellor awareness, knowledge, and skills) proposed in the tripartite model of MCC and the multicultural counselling relationship were used as points of entry in the data analysis process. The results of this study provided support for the integration of these competencies in counselling with female adolescents. However, participant's accounts indicated that the competencies of awareness, knowledge, skills, and relationship are not sufficient for culturally competent counselling to occur. Additional MCC were found to be important for work with female adolescents, including cultural sensitivity, family interventions, and help beyond counselling. The results of this study have important implications for the training and practice of psychology. Obtaining the viewpoint of female clients who attended counselling during their adolescence was invaluable, as they offered a unique perspective, which was not previously available in the literature. This unique viewpoint informs us about the specific needs of female adolescents and provides useful information about the MCC counsellors may need to develop in order to work with this population.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj139558d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sn81s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cross-cultural counseling</dc:subject><dc:subject>Counselors -- Training of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adolescent psychotherapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924g208"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Les représentations sociales de la violence conjugale chez les couples de lesbiennes : points de vue d'actrices sociales qui contribuent à leur construction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thibault, Sylvie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines how lesbian domestic violence is constructed by various social actors from within a social representations framework. In particular, the study compares and contrasts the ways in which social representations on lesbian domestic violence are constituted by practitioners working within the spheres of both domestic violence and lesbian mental health in Quebec. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with workers from the shelter movement and with practitioners who work with lesbians. Findings indicate that proximity, either by identifying as a lesbian or by having lesbian friends or family members, is an important and central factor in understanding how social representations of lesbian domestic violence are constructed within and these social actors. The results also suggest that the silence surrounding lesbian domestic violence in Quebec reflects particular preoccupations within each group. Implications for practice research and policy in Quebec are considered in light of these findings.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qd25x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924g208</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Abused lesbians -- Public opinion</dc:subject><dc:subject>Family violence -- Public opinion</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afq977z500"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Enabling the collective to assist the individual : a self-organising systems approach to social software and the creation of collaborative text signals</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chiarella, Andrew Francesco, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Authors augment their texts using devices such as bold and italic typeface to signal important information to the reader. These typographical text signals are an example of a signal designed to have some affect on others. However, some signals emerge through the unplanned, indirect, and collective efforts of a group of individuals. Paths emerge in parks without having been designed by anyone. Objects accumulate wear patterns that signal how others have interacted with the object. Books open to important, well studied pages because the spine has worn, for example (Hill, Hollan, Wroblewski, &amp; McCandless, 1992). Digital text and the large-scale collaboration made possible through the internet provide an opportunity to examine how unplanned, collaborative text signals could emerge. A software application was designed, called CoREAD, that enables readers to highlight sections of the text they deem important. In addition, CoREAD adds text signals to the text using font colour, based on the group's collective history and an aggregation function based on self-organising systems. The readers are potentially influenced by the text signals presented by CoREAD but also help to modify these same signals. Importantly, readers only interact with each other indirectly through the text. The design of CoREAD was greatly inspired by the previous work on history-enriched digital objects (Hill &amp; Hollan, 1993) and at a more general level it can be viewed as an example of distributed cognition (Hollan, Hutchins, &amp; Kirsh, 2000). Forty undergraduate students read two texts on topics from psychology using CoREAD. Students were asked to read each text in order to write a summary of it. After each new student read the text, the text signals were changed to reflect the current group of students. As such, each student read the text with different text signals presented. The data were analysed for each text to determine if the text signals that emerged were stable and valid representations of the semantic content of the text. As well, the students' summaries were analysed to determine if students who read the text after the text signals had stabilised produced better summaries. Three methods demonstrated that CoREAD was capable of generating stable typographical text signals. The high importance text signals also appeared to capture the semantic content of the texts. For both texts, a summary made of the high signals performed as well as a benchmark summary. The results did not suggest that the stable text signals assisted readers to produce better summaries, however. Readers may not respond to these collaborative text signals as they would to authorial text signals, which previous research has shown to be beneficial (Lorch, 1989). The CoREAD project has demonstrated that readers can produce stable and valid text signals through an unplanned, self-organising process.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30px35r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977z500</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Books and reading -- Technological innovations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education -- Data processing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Online social networks</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967711f"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Information Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The information-seeking behaviour of grade-three elementary school students in the context of a class project</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nesset, Valerie, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This qualitative phenomenological study is one of few that investigate the information-seeking behaviour of younger elementary school children. Recent cognitive research has established that there are considerable and rapid intellectual changes throughout childhood, meaning that studies and/or models outlining the information-seeking experiences of older students and adults might not identify, explain or address the unique information needs of younger elementary school students. The study, conducted over 14 weeks in Winter 2006 with 12 volunteer students from two grade-three classes within a Montreal elementary school sought to answer three research questions: 1) How do grade-three students seek information in support of a class project? 2) What are the barriers faced by grade-three students in seeking and using information? 3) Do any models of information-seeking behaviour in whole or in part inform a model specific to grade-three students? Six different types of data collection techniques were employed: participant observation, interviews with the students, class teacher and parents, questionnaires, self-evaluations, journals, and final projects. The study revealed that students in the earlier grades of elementary school are seeking and using information in both print and digital formats and experiencing difficulties in both media. In print, selection of materials was not straightforward nor was the location of information within them. Difficulties were encountered with the selection criteria and the use of metadata lists. In the digital domain, lack of strategic planning before starting a search, problems in generating search queries, spelling, keyboarding, and extracting information were observed. In addition to these problems, several barriers outside of the students' control were identified that impact on their information seeking on the Web (e.g. search engine design, lack of appropriate sites for young students, inefficient filtering systems) and in print (e.g. out-of- date and/or lack of print reference resources, classification and/or indexing schemes). Information culled from the Internet was rarely read in any depth on-screen; instead, the students printed the material in order to peruse it at a later time, much as they would with a book. The study provides insight into the barriers faced by children when seeking information, how they use information in an educational context, and how they can be helped to better exploit the information resources available to them, as well as a model of information-seeking behaviour specific to grade-three students.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408152m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967711f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Information behavior</dc:subject><dc:subject>School children -- Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q7791"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identifying hidden boundaries within economic data in the time and space domains</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ntantamis, Christos</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents methodological contributions to the modeling of regimes in the time or space domain of economic data by introducing a number of algorithms from engineering applications and substantially modifying them so that can be used in economic applications. The objective is twofold: to estimate the parameters of such models, and to identify the corresponding boundaries between regimes. The models used belong to the class of Finite Mixture Models and their natural extensions for the case of dependent data, Hidden Markov Models (see McLachlan and Peel 2000). Mixture models are extremely useful in the modeling of heterogeneity in a cluster analysis context; the components of the mixtures, or the states, will correspond to the different latent groups, e.g. homogeneous regions such as the housing submarkets or regimes in the case of stock market returns. The thesis discusses issues of alternative estimation algorithms that provide larger model flexibility in capturing the underlying data dynamics, and of procedures that allow the selection of the number of the regimes in the data. The first part introduces a model of spatial association for housing markets, which is approached in the context of spatial heterogeneity. A Hedonic Price Index model is considered, i.e. a model where the price of the dwelling is determined by its structural and neighborhood characteristics. Remaining spatial heterogeneity is modeled as a Finite Mixture Model for the residuals of the Hedonic Index. The Finite Mixture Model is estimated using the Figueiredo and Jain (2002) approach. The overall ability of the model to identify spatial heterogeneity is evaluated through a set of simulations. The model was applied to Los Angeles County housing prices data for the year 2002. The statistically identified number of submarkets, after taking into account the dwellings' structural characteristics, are found to be considerably fewer than the ones imposed either by geographical or administrative boundaries, thus making it more suitable for mass assessment applications. The second part of the thesis introduces a Duration Hidden Markov Model to represent regime switches in the stock market; the duration of each state of the Markov Chain is explicitly modeled as a random variable that depends on a set of exogenous variables. Therefore, the model not only allows the endogenous determination of the different regimes but also estimates the effect of the explanatory variables on the regimes' durations. The model is estimated on NYSE returns using the short-term interest rate and the interest rate spread as exogenous variables. The estimation results coincide with existing findings in the literature, in terms of regimes' characteristics, and are compatible with basic economic intuition, in terms of the effect of the exogenous variables on regimes' durations. The final part of the thesis considers a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach in order to perform the task of detecting structural breaks, which are defined as the data points where the underlying Markov Chain switches from one state to another: A new methodology is proposed in order to estimate all aspects of the model: number of regimes, parameters of the model corresponding to each regime, and the locations of regime switches. One of the main advantages of the proposed methodology is that it allows for different model specifications across regimes. The performance of the overall procedure, denoted IMI by the initials of the component algorithms is validated by two sets of simulations: one in which only the parameters are permitted to differ across regimes, and one that also permits differences in the functional forms. The IMI method performs very well across all specifications in both sets of simulations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117s44d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q7791</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Econometric models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78tg52q"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Circumventing the state : illegal labour migration from Ukraine as a strategy within the informal economy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Patsyurko, Nataliya</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines labour migration as an outcome of the interaction between the state and the informal economy, by considering the trends of contemporary labour migration from Ukraine to Southern Europe. It contends that in both the sending and receiving countries, migration policies either disregard or severely limit labour migration, while their informal economies facilitate the development of migration. This basic contradiction sustains migration flows over time. The main argument of the thesis is that migration develops within the system of interacting informal economies. I demonstrate the embeddedness of migration in the informal economy by using the case of Ukrainian migration to Italy. The role of the informal economy in the development of migration is examined across several dimensions. First, I argue that the recent labour migration from Ukraine emerged as a strategy of the informal economy, continuing the previous strategies of cross-border trading and short-term migration to Central Europe. These economic practices were the innovative responses of the population to the decline of the state economy and to the absence of economic reforms. Migration developed in the space between the state and the market economy. Second, the flows of labour migration were 'invisible' to states, and developed outside state control and regulation. This thesis demonstrates that the migration policies of the Ukrainian state disregarded the process of out-migration of Ukrainian citizens. Similarly, Italian immigration policies did not recognise the existing flows of labour migration. The informal economy of the receiving state resolved the contradiction between the economic demand for migrant workers and restrictive migration policies and enabled access to the receiving economy. However, access to the receiving labour market through the informal economy contributed to the disadvantaged incorporation of migrants and prevented their integration into the receiving society. The analysis of economic incorporation demonstrates that the informal economy channelled Ukrainian migrants to the secondary labour market with low earnings, a lack of benefits, and no possibility of professional advancement. The mode of access to the receiving economy and the resulting illegality heavily influenced the position of Ukrainian migrants in the labour market. Finally, the analysis of Ukrainian labour migration to Italy demonstrates that alternative migration-facilitating institutions were developed in the absence of the state recognition of labour migration. These institutions paralleled the institutions of the official labour markets and allowed migrants to implement income-generating projects. In addition, migration was facilitated by the supporting institutions of the receiving society, which counteracted the restrictive immigration laws and political controls on migration. The migration-supporting institutions were predicated on the strategies of circumventing state control which developed from participation in the informal economy of the sending country. Labour migration from the former Soviet Union would not be possible without these informal practices and the culture of avoiding state control in economic activities. The proposed analysis answers the challenge posed by the recent Ukrainian labour migration to conventional theories on migration, whose approaches usually omit references to the meso-level of migration processes, and consider either the structural-economic or the micro- determinants of migration. This thesis presents the informal economy both as a structural factor which enables migration and as a characteristic of the migrant agency that facilitates it. By doing that, the thesis also complements the literature on migration to Southern Europe and argues that migrations are not simply encouraged by the informal economies of the receiving countries, but they emerge from, and are facilitated by, the informal economies of the sending countries. To perpetuate migration migrants creatively use the resources of the informal economy in conjunction with strategies of circumventing the state. This argument holds for a number of ex-Soviet countries, which suffered severe economic crises during the disintegration of the state-controlled socialist economies, and consequently produced significant labour migrations to Western Europe.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mg427.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tg52q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Informal sector (Economics) -- Ukraine</dc:subject><dc:subject>Labor market -- Italy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Labor market -- Ukraine</dc:subject><dc:subject>Foreign workers -- Italy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Illegal aliens -- Employment -- Italy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Informal sector (Economics) -- Italy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Migrant labor -- Italy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892f52r"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Desautels Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Three essays on information technology sourcing : a multi-level perspective</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Qu, Wen Guang</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite the amount of literature on the antecedents and outcomes of IT outsourcing, the vast majority of this research has focused on factors at the firm level. Environmental factors such as industry and country characteristics have received little attention. Environmental factors should be taken into account in IT outsourcing research because firms are open systems and their behaviors are significantly influenced by material-resource and institutional environments. Moreover, previous research at the firm level has not evaluated the effectiveness of IT outsourcing and insourcing in terms of how they create value for firms. To address the paucity of macro-level research in IT outsourcing as well as to augment our knowledge at the firm level, this thesis investigates IT outsourcing issues at three levels, namely, at the firm, industry, and country level. More specifically, I expand firm-level research by jointly examining the impacts of IT outsourcing and insourcing on IT-enabled organizational capabilities and firm performance (Essay #1). I also investigate the roles of industry-level factors such as munificence, dynamism, concentration, and capital intensity (Essay #2) and country-level variables such as the maturity of the IT-related legal system, generalized trust, uncertainty avoidance, Internet penetration, and the maturity of the IT outsourcing market of a country (Essay #3) in the diffusion of IT outsourcing practice.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956k53b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892f52r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Information technology -- Management</dc:subject><dc:subject>Contracting out</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712mb384"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Conceptual complexity and accessibility of the article &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; : is the traditional interpretation of &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; enough for ESL learners ?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hinenoya, Kimiko</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The English article system is extremely complex because of its conceptual abstractness and context-dependent usage. For these specific features, some second language learners (e.g., Japanese) find article acquisition to be very difficult. Traditionally, the definite article the is thought to express exclusively the referential function of "identifiability", that is, the is there to identify or pick out the referent so the hearer can identify what is being discussed (Lyons, 1999). This view has been widely accepted and has served as the foundation of research as well as for pedagogical orientations. Recently, however, these traditional notions have been heavily criticized as 'insufficient'. As a result, a cognitive, mental space notion of "accessibility" has been introduced (Epstein, 2002). This study was designed to investigate the effectiveness in teaching the English article the by comparing two instructional approaches: a traditionally-based approach and a cognitively-based approach. The study hypothesized, first, that article usage is contextually and conceptually configured; therefore, not all definite articles the exhibit the same level of difficulty (some are conceptually more complex than others). Second, the higher the complexity, the more difficult it is for learners to understand. Third, in light of these hypotheses, learners are predicted to benefit more from conceptually oriented instruction than structurally oriented traditional instruction. In order to measure the effectiveness of these approaches, two comparable, computerized instructional treatments were created. The mental space treatment shows the learners the framework in which 'accessibility' to the object is emphasized, whereas the traditional treatment shows learners the framework in which 'identifiability' of the object is emphasized. Eighty-three Japanese learners of English (41 in the mental space treatment and 42 in the traditional treatment) were recruited to test the hypotheses. Three lessons were administered individually; each lasted 1.5 to 2 hours (4.5 to 6 hours per participant). As predicted, the results revealed that there is a distinct order of complexity according to the conceptual load of the article the. The study also confirmed that the higher the complexity levels, the more difficult it is for the learners to learn. However, this conceptual complexity can be significantly alleviated when the conceptual framework is taught.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579w776.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712mb384</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Article</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axw42nc36b"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sur le chemin de Jérusalem : étude archéologique et iconographique de mosaïques paléochrétiennes de la Syrie du Nord</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jwejati, Rafah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>"Sur le chemin de Jerusalem" is the comprehensive examination of three unknown mosaic pavements, exhibited in the Museum of Maaret-en-Nouman in Northern Syria. A comparison with other known documents brings together elements of evidence to their provenance, to the type of building they had adorned, and to the underlying links between architectural organization and mosaic ornamental decoration in an ecclesiastic environment. The picture catalogue detailing the size and composition of each of the three mosaics dates the iconographic material from the third quarter of the fourth century to the first half of the fifth century, that period in time which witnessed the Christianization of the North Syrian countryside and a great development of Christian pilgrimages to the Holy Sites of Palestine. The mosaic of Temanaa features the cosmographic representations of late antique Near East. With the mosaic of Beseqla, we find the earliest dated example of a decorated pavement of a paleochristian baptistery. Tell Aar is the fragmentary mosaic of an unusually early example of a five-aisle transept basilica housing apostolic remains. The exceptional quality of these documents demonstrates how close attention to material history can effectively increase our knowledge of the growth and expansion of early Christianity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634713j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42nc36b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mosaics, Early Christian -- Syria</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vf93c"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Exploring the behavioral and cognitive profile of children with autism and children with pragmatic language impairment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Reisinger, Lisa M., 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background: The diagnostic and clinical differentiation between children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and children with pragmatic language impairments (PLI), two populations that share a similar linguistic profile, was examined in school-aged children. Charting the behavioral and cognitive profiles of these populations can serve to aide diagnostic differentiation and educational intervention. Objectives: The objectives of this study were two-fold. One, to compare scores on diagnostic measures of autism between school-age children with ASD and those with PLI Two, to investigate differences between children in these groups and typically developing children in the areas of social cognition and executive function (EF). Methods: The participants included 22 school-age children diagnosed with ASD (mean age = 10.2; 18%female), 19 children with PLI (mean age = 9.6; 11% female) and 35 typically developing (I'D) comparisons (mean age =10.5, 23% female) matched on non-verbal IQ and language age. All of the participants had fluent language and an IQ above 80. In study 1, the participants with ASD and PLI were tested on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). In study 2, the participants in all three groups were tested on the measures of three hierarchical levels of Theory of Mind (ToM), a planning measure, and a response inhibition measure. Results: There was a significant difference between diagnostic groups in the level of the severity of behaviors represented by the Communication and Reciprocal Social Interaction subdomains on both diagnostic measures. However, in the sub domain of Repetitive and Rigid Behaviors, the difference between groups was subtler and not useful as a differentiating factor. While both the children with ASD and those with PLI violated more rules on the 'planning in problem solving' task than the typically developing group, only the children in the ASD group demonstrated impaired functioning on the planning measure. Performance on the inhibition task was significantly impaired in both atypical groups compared to the typically developing group. The findings of the study suggest that children with PLI may be more vulnerable than children with ASD to developmental lags in understanding false belief but less vulnerable in planning and monitoring behavior. Conclusions: The diagnostic differentiation between ASD and PLI is complex, especially in school-age populations. Behavior symptoms may be more subdued in school-age children and thus should not be used as a tool for diagnostic differentiation. Social communication delays are generally more severe in children with ASD, with some children with PLI presenting with comparable levels of severity. Educational planning for these two populations must be informed by both group similarities (e.g., difficulty forming theories about the false beliefs and desires of others in order to predict future behavior) and group differences (e.g., planning in problem solving) in cognitive and social development. Thus, the development of individual education plans should be created within the general framework of known areas of strengths and weaknesses related to diagnostic categorization and then further tailored to childrens' personal profiles based on an assessment of skills.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd3761164.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vf93c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Language disorders in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Autism in children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zx77p"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Readings from a life : rural educators read our rural selves</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kelly, Tony Nelson</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Readings from a Life: Rural Educators Read our Rural Selves is a cultural study of identity in place in Atlantic Canada. The study is developed based on hybrid methodology drawing on key elements of literary anthropology, self-study, autobiography, auto-ethnography, and geo-poetics. The literary landscape of rural Nova Scotia provides the principal site for the readings which are developed throughout in contrapuntal fashion, that is to say the readings move back and forth between global and local representations of rural space. Key to the development of each of the chapters is the concept of distance as a device for making the world strange and therefore knowable. The readings are contained within seven chapters based on the research question, 'What are you doing here?' This question is deconstructed first through establishing the literary landscape of rural Nova Scotia as a site for analysis, followed by a discussion of literary anthropology as method, which leads in turn to a close examination of how particular teachers read themselves through their engagement with the literary texts. These readings are followed by a critical examination of what kinds of reading count in official policy discourses when compared to the more literary representations. As self-study the readings are used to provide insight into a life lived for the most part in rural Nova Scotia and at the same time are used to highlight aspects of education and teacher identity in this place. The concluding chapter moves recursively in order to strengthen the insights contained in the previous chapters and at the same time articulates the ambivalent nature of the project as a whole. Policy implications, potential beneficiaries, limitations of the study, and future directions are indicated in the final chapter.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r459s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zx77p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education, Rural -- Nova Scotia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644w21p"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Kel Azjer Tuareg culture : public and private space in Ghat</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jamal, Amal Mohammed Hassan, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation presents a study of the urban form of the Old Town of Ghat, the historical sultanate of the Azjer Tuareg. An analysis of the public and private spaces of this collective artifact is presented in order to comprehend and document the relationship between this Saharan town's architecture and Ghatian society. This study illustrates how Ghat's vernacular architecture represents a range of culturally distinct meanings and values and how this architecture reflects Ghatian life. In order to analyze the built environment of Ghat and the pattern of use of public and private spaces, this dissertation investigates Azjer Tuareg culture and documents the various existing nomadic and semi-nomadic Azjer Tuareg housing typologies in Libya. It investigates not only the contribution of the socio-cultural practices of this culture to the way spaces were configured, organized, and used, but also the Ghatian peoples' daily and seasonal life routines as well as their various social and economic activities. This dissertation explores Ghat's spaces at three levels of its urban environment: the home (domestic), the neighbourhood (communal), and the town (public). It focuses on the relationship between the social aspects of Ghatian culture and the formation and use of the town's spaces. It also investigates the affect of trans-Saharan trade and the colonization and ruling history of Old Ghat on its formation and/or growth and the creation of public and private spatial domains in an attempt to understand the embedded meanings of Ghat's built environment. This study also investigates the role of climate in the formation of Old Ghat and the ingenious architecture and structure of its dwellings. This architecture reflects local construction techniques and limited local resources, consequently imparting distinct meaning to the built form of Ghat.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j67317559.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644w21p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Public spaces -- Libya -- Ghāt</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tuaregs -- Libya -- Ghāt</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ghāt (Libya)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vernacular architecture -- Libya -- Ghāt</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
