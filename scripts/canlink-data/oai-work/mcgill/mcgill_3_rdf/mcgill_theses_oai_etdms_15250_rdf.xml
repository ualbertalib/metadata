The protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST contains multiple motifs mediating its recruitment to signalling components, and is required for actin filament organization. However, little is known regarding either the importance of PTP-PEST subcellular localization, or the role of PTP-PEST in either parasitic infection or apoptosis. My doctoral research was therefore focussed on elucidating the effect of subcellular distribution on PTP-PEST activity, specifically with respect to regulation of p130Cas (a PTP-PEST substrate), as well as on the involvement of PTP-PEST in both host-pathogen relations and apoptosis. First, PTP-PEST was found both within the cytosol and at the plasma membrane. Using PTP-PEST -/- rescued cell lines, I observed that tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent p130Cas interactions were controlled primarily by cytosolic PTP-PEST. Secondly, infection of fibroblasts with Leishmania major was observed to induce dramatic actin rearrangements, and to alter the phosphorylation state of numerous proteins. Importantly, both PTP-PEST and p130Cas were processed by the parasitic protease GP63 during infection. GP63 was also required for the cleavage of additional host proteins: cortactin, TC-PTP and caspase-3. Of note, Leishmania parasites mediated p38 inactivation, correlating with the proteolysis of its upstream activator TAB1, in a GP63dependent manner. These results indicate that GP63 plays a key role in a number of biochemical events, potentially contributing to Leishmania infectivity. Finally, PTP-PEST was found to relocalize to the edges of retracting membrane ruffles of apoptotic cells. Surprisingly, PTP-PEST was specifically cleaved by caspase-3 at the 549DSPD motif during apoptosis; leading to modification of catalytic activity and scaffolding properties, and sensitizing cells to Fas-mediated detachment. As this data demonstrated a potential role for caspase cleavage in PTP regulation, I also investigated the presence of conserved putative caspase-c1eavage sites in other family members. In summary, the data presented herein links PTP-PEST with various biological processes: oncogenic signalling, host-pathogen interactions, and apoptosis. In addition to demonstrating the involvement of PTP-PEST in diverse signalling pathways, these studies underscore the importance of subcellular localization and proteolysis in the regulation of this PTP.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pr305.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bg191</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 12 -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Leishmaniasis -- enzymology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Apoptosis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nf63c"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The pharmacological and cellular effects of human somatostatin receptor homo- and heterodimerization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Grant, Michael, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Somatostatin (SST) is a peptide hormone that was originally identified in the hypothalamus and subsequently found throughout the central nervous system and in various peripheral organs. Generally classified as an inhibitory factor, SST is secreted by endocrine, neuronal and immune cells and acts to regulate cell secretion, neurotransmission and cell proliferation. There are five receptor-subtypes known to engage SST, termed SSTR1-5, all belonging to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Within the past few years, there has been a prepondef8:llce of evidence to suggest the importance of GPCR dimerization in receptor-biogenesis, regulation and pharmacology. It has been previously reported in our laboratory, that human (h) SSTR5 homo- and heterodimerizes with hSSTR1 in an agonist-regulated manner. However, it was unclear as to the contribution of each subtype in the formation of the hSSTR1/hSSTR5 heterodimer, the possible molecular determinants involved and the effects of heterodimerization on the pharmacology of the receptors. Furthermore, the dimerization properties of other hSSTRs including their heterodimerization remain undetermined. Here, we demonstrate that agonist binding to hSSTR5 and not hSSTR1 modulates the formation of the heterodimer, with particular emphasis on its carboxyl-terminal tail in specifying the interaction. We also determined the mechanics of the hSSTR2 homodimer, unlike the previous hSSTRs investigated, forms constitutive dimers that dissociate into monomers following activation with agonist. This feature is important for receptor trafficking, as preventing their dissociation impairs agonist-mediated endocytosis. Lastly, we investigated the heterodimerization of hSSTR2 and hSSTR5, an interaction that, like the hSSTR1/hSSTR5 heterodimer, is subtype-specific, requiring selective-activation of hSSTR2 and not hSSTR5. The heterodimer exhibited enhanced signalling characteristics including, prolonged activation of MAP kinases and an increase in the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. These enhanced properties of the heterodimer conferred an extended growth inhibitory response. Dimerization of GPCRs, with particular emphasis on heterodimers, generates novel receptors with unique properties distinct from those of the individual receptor monomers/homodimers. An understanding on the mechanisms involved in GPCR dimerization could provide a rationale in future drug design.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z441k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nf63c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Receptors, Somatostatin -- chemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled -- chemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, Somatostatin -- agonists</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dimerization</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214s733"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Investigating glial dynamics in the developing hippocampus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Haber, Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Glial cells represent the most abundant cell population in the central nervous system (CNS), and yet, have historically been thought of as merely support cells for neurons. Over the past few decades, however, the number of identified roles that glial cells play in the CNS has expanded at an exponential rate, revealing new and exciting functions in neuron-glial communication. At synapses, astrocytes are now recognized as part of a "tripartite" complex with pre- and postsynaptic structures and can modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity. Accumulating evidence has also revealed new roles for oligodendrocytes in regulating axon diameter and integrity, and ion channel clustering. Despite our knowledge of the physiological connections between neurons and glia, relatively little is known about the morphological interplay of these cells during development and in the mature brain. The results presented in this thesis reveal the extent and time-course of rapid remodelling of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in close proximity to dendritic spines and axons respectively. These findings provide further evidence that glia play an important role in regulating the structural plasticity of the brain. The methodology developed also provides a powerful system for the study of neuron-glial structural dynamics and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases affecting the central nervous system.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924g19h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214s733</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Astrocytes -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dendritic Spines -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Axons -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oligodendroglia -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hippocampus -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cell Communication -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hippocampus -- growth &amp; development</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892f506"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Body image during adolescence : behavioural and neuroimaging studies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Aleong, Rosanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The primary objective of this thesis was to investigate body image at both the behavioural and neural levels. We describe three studies aimed at: (1) developing a novel digital methodology with which to assess perceptual aspects of body image during adolescence; (2) investigating perceptual accuracy and sensitivity to changes in the size/shape of body images among healthy adolescents; and (3) identifying the neural mechanisms of body perception using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A novel library of digital images of adolescent bodies was created and used to characterize natural covariations in body size and shape using principal components analysis. Identified principal components were used to morph body images in a realistic manner to generate larger or smaller bodies. These morphed body-image stimuli were then used in a behavioural investigation of self body-image perception among adolescents. Male and female adolescents overestimated the size of their bodies. When compared with males, females overestimated their body size to a greater extent and showed greater sensitivity in detecting changes in body size. Overestimation of body size and detection sensitivity increased with subject age. Detection sensitivity decreased as a function of subjects' body mass index (BMI). In order to identify the underlying neural mechanisms of these effects, functional block-design and fMR-adaptation experiments were completed in healthy young adults. During both experiments, females, and not males, showed greater fMR signal in the right versus left hemisphere in the extrastriate body area (EBA) and fusiform body area (FBA). During the block-design experiment, females also demonstrated greater right EBA response compared with males. Observer BMI modulated the EBA hemispheric effect in both experiments. A significant recovery from adaptation was found in EBA and FBA with body-image morphing, indicating that both regions were sensitive to body-size changes. Ultimately, we demonstrated the successful use of a novel body-morphing method for the assessment of body image, established that sex, age, and BMI modulate accuracy of self body-size estimation and detection of changes in body size, and described evidence of EBA and FBA as the likely neural substrates of these behavioural effects.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h302m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892f506</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body Image</dc:subject><dc:subject>Visual Perception</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adolescent</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body Mass Index</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dk13n"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Organizational capacity and dissemination practices for chronic disease prevention in the Canadian public health system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hanusaik, Nancy Anna</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Introduction: The public health system is of central importance in efforts to reduce the burden of chronic disease, yet there are no national data on organizational capacity (OC) or dissemination practices pertaining to chronic disease prevention (CDP) programming in the public health system. The aim of this thesis is to investigate OC and dissemination practices within the Canadian public health system. Two new conceptual models pertaining to these constructs were developed, and a survey of all public health organizations across Canada engaged in CDP was conducted in 2004-5. Method: Data were collected in telephone interviews with persons most knowledgeable about CDP programming in 77 "resource" organizations that develop and transfer CDP innovations to other organizations, and 216 "user" organizations that adopt and deliver CDP programs in specific populations. Reliable measures of the constructs of interest were developed using principal components analyses. Levels of OC, its potential determinants, and involvement in CDP programming were compared across three types of organizations and across Canada. In addition, levels of 13 dissemination-related practices were compared across organizations and independent correlates of dissemination were identified in multiple linear regression. Results: Levels of skill and involvement were highest for tobacco control and healthy eating programming; lowest for stress management, social determinants of health, and program evaluation. Any notable differences in skill levels favoured central Canada. Resource adequacy was low overall; lowest in eastern Canada and within formal public health organizations. Supports for OC were highest in central Canada and in grouped organizations. Dissemination practices most heavily engaged in included: Identification of barriers to adoption/implementation of the innovation, tailoring dissemination strategies and design of dissemination plan. There was little coherence across organizations in the number or types of dissemination practices engaged in. Skill at planning/implementing dissemination, external sources of funding, type of resource organization, attitude toward the process of collaboration, and user-centeredness were all positively associated with dissemination (R2=0,42; F value 8.20, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: These results provide a backbone for organizational research in public health systems. Strengths and gaps identified in OC and dissemination practices will guide strategic investment in the public health system.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z876z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dk13n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chronic Disease -- prevention &amp; control -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>State Medicine -- organization &amp; administration -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Policy -- economics -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Promotion -- organization &amp; administration -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qt405"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Investigating the nucleotide-binding domains of Abcb1a (mouse P-glycoproteinMdr3) : a mutational analysis approach</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Carrier, Isabelle, 1976 Dec. 18-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>ABC transporters consist of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form the transport channel and two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that energize transport via ATP binding and hydrolysis. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the role of highly conserved residues in the NBDs of Abcb1a was investigated. In both NBDs of Abcb1a the A-loop aromatic residue is a tyrosine: Y397 in NBD1 and Y1040 in NBD2. Another tyrosine (618 in NBD1 and 1263 in NBD2) also appears to lie close to the ATP molecule. These four tyrosine residues were mutated to tryptophan and the effect of these substitutions on transport properties, ATP binding, and ATP hydrolysis was analyzed. Y618W and Y1263W enzymes had catalytic characteristics similar to wild-type (WT) Abcb1a. On the other hand, Y397W and Y1040W showed impaired transport and greatly reduced ATPase activity, including an ~10-fold increase in KM(ATP). Thus, Y397 and Y1040 play an important role in Abcb1a catalysis. Since it was speculated that ABC transporters utilize a catalytic base to hydrolyse the beta-gamma phosphodiester bond of ATP, a search for that residue was undertaken. Six pairs of highly conserved acidic residues in the NBDs of Abcb1a were investigated. Removal of the charge in D558N and D1203N as well as in E552Q and E1197Q produced enzymes with severely impaired transport. These mutants were purified and characterized with respect to ATPase activity. Mutants D558N and D1203N retained some drug-stimulated ATPase activity and vanadate (Vi) trapping of 8-azido-[alpha32P]nucleotide confirmed slower basal and drug-stimulated hydrolysis. The E552Q and E1197Q mutants showed absence of ATPase activity but Vi trapping of 8-azido-[alpha 32P]nucleotide was observed, at a level similar to that of WT Abcb1a. Photolabelling by 8-azido-[alpha32P]nucleotide, in the presence or absence of drug, was also detected in the absence of Vi. The ATPase activity, binding affinity, and trapping properties of these glutamate residues were further analyzed. In addition to the E‚ÜíQ mutants, the glutamates were individually mutated to D, N, and A. The double mutants E552Q/E1197Q, E552Q/K1072R, and K429R/E552Q were also analyzed. The results obtained suggest that 1) the length of the side-chain is important for the catalytic activity, whereas the charge is critical for full turnover to occur, 2) formation of the catalytic transition state does occur in the mutant site in the single-site mutants, suggesting that E552 and E1197 are not classical catalytic carboxylates, 3) steps after formation of the transition state are severely impaired in these mutant enzymes, 4) NBD1 and NBD2 are functionally asymmetric, and 5) the glutamates are involved both in NBD-NBD communication and transition-state formation through orientation of the linchpin residue.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vv39c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qt405</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>P-Glycoproteins -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice</dc:subject><dc:subject>P-Glycoproteins -- chemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters -- chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tq41t"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Direct observation of correlated motions in colloidal gels and glasses</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gao, Yongxiang</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Dynamical heterogeneity (DH) has been observed in many systems approaching the glass or jamming transition. Whether DH has a structural origin is under heated debate. To provide a deeper understanding, in this thesis I investigate the microscopic dynamics in weakly attractive colloidal systems by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The van Hove density-density correlation function is applied to our systems. Separable fast and slow populations emerge in the self part (svH), while the distinct part shows a strong signature of DH close to the gel transition. At intermediate time, svH shows a purely exponential tail, mainly arising from the fast population. I show that this broad tail is a direct consequence of the occurrence of rare large jumps that are statistically distributed. The slow population tends to form a space-spanning backbone, and its mean squared displacement close to the gel transition exhibits a plateau, whose height is consistent with the range of attraction, suggesting a bonding mechanism for the dynamical arrest. I further examine various quantities characterizing local structure and local dynamics and a strong correlation is identified between them. Subsequently, I develop order parameters for quantifying amorphous structure and apply them to our systems. I find that attractive colloidal systems exhibit higher order under higher attraction tension, while hard spheres become more ordered under higher compression. Finally, I investigate the effect of the range of attraction on the structure and dynamics of attractive colloidal systems. I observe that the system with shorter range of attraction forms a denser and more heterogeneous structure. Meanwhile, I observe an even stronger dynamical heterogeneity. These observations provide further evidence of a connection between structural heterogeneity and dynamical heterogeneity in these systems, providing guidance for a theoretical description of the dynamical arrest as well as the relaxation mechanisms upon gelation and its relation to solidification in glasses. In order to do all of this, I first implemented full 3D subpixel resolution localization of particles and improved particle tracking algorithms tailored for the sorts of heterogenous dynamics these systems exhibit, that otherwise confounds existing methods such that the very relaxation mechanisms would be missed. This allows us to obtain unprecedented precision in positions of all of the particles and complete tracking, both of which are essential for correctly determining system properties that depend on measured particle dynamics.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sh10t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tq41t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Glass transition temperature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gelation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Confocal fluorescence microscopy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thermodynamics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w816b"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation into the use of functional biomarkers as a measure of nutritional status in edentulous elders</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ghanem, Henry</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background and hypothesis. Edentulous patients may be at risk for malnutrition and cardiovascular disease even with well made dentures. Improvements in methods used to assess nutritional status suggest that functional biomarkers such as plasma homocysteine (tHcy), in addition to traditional methods, will provide a better quality assessment. The hypothesis is that there is an association between functional biomarkers of nutritional status and traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors in a community dwelling edentulous elderly population. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study of the baseline characteristics of a convenient sample of 254 edentulous community dwelling elderly over 65 years. Measurements included anthropometric, body composition, homocysteine, vitamins and relevant blood components. Correlations, multiple regression models and Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) for tertiles were used to assess the relationship between vitamins and other parameters with hyperhomocystenemia, defined as THcy value of ‚â• 14mmol/L. The independent effect of edentulism on hyperhomocysteinemia was sought using the NHANES III data. Results. The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia was 49.2%. Effect of folate on hyperhomocysteinemia was significant (p = 0.037). Low folate tertile group had a 2.45 times higher odds (CI: 1.23, 4.87) of hyperhomocysteinemia than patients in the higher tertile (p = 0.019). Groups with normal folate did not have higher odds of hyperhomocysteinemia regardless of levels of vitamin B6 or B12. AOR for vitamin B12 tertiles in relation to hyperhomocysteinemia were 2.36 (CI: 1.18, 4.75) and 2.12 (1.07, 4.22) for lower vs. high. A weak inverse relationship existed between tHcy and vitamin C (r= -0.11, p= 0.045). A borderline negative correlation existed between HDL and THcy adjusted for age (r = - 0.12; P = 0.05). Significant correlation existed between THcy and BMI (r = 0.15, P = 0.02), small waist circumference (r = 0.22; p = 0.0004) and waist/hip ratio (r = 0.23, p = 0.0003). In a multivariate analyses, edentulism was associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (p = 0.012). Conclusions. In this sample, homocysteine levels appeared much higher than one would expect with folate fortification, and were related to several cardiovascular risk factors. Using data from NHANES III, edentulism was found to independently predict hyperhomocysteinemia. The inverse relationship between homocysteine and vitamin C and the effect of folate on hyperhomocysteinemia suggests that increasing dietary intake of fruit and vegetables in edentulous individuals might be beneficial. Furthermore, the latter are at risk of developing hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition associated with cognitive impairment, dementia and coronary artery disease risk.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s5981.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w816b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Homocysteine -- blood</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mouth, Edentulous -- complications</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aged</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hyperhomocysteinemia -- complications</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tooth Loss -- complications</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nutritional Status</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aged, 80 and over</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r074z56x"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Gene expression profiling of the breast tumour microenvironment : characterization of gene expression heterogeneity in the breast tumour microenvironment and its influence on clinical outcome</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Finak, Grzegorz</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease. This heterogeneity can be observed at many levels, including gene expression, chromosomal aberrations, and disease pathology. A clear understanding of these differences is important since they impact upon treatment efficacy and clinical outcome. Recent studies have demonstrated that the tumour microenvironment also plays a critical role in cancer initiation and progression. Genomic technologies have been used to gain a better understanding of the impact of gene expression heterogeneity on breast cancer, and have identified gene expression signatures associated with clinical outcome, histopathological breast cancer subtypes, and a variety of cancer-related pathways and processes. However, little work has been done in this context to examine the role of the tumour microenvironment in determining breast cancer outcome, or in defining breast cancer heterogeneity. Additionally, little is known about gene expression in histologically normal tissue adjacent to breast tumour, if this is influenced by the tumour, and how this compares with non-tumour-bearing breast tissue. By applying laser--capture microdissection and gene expression profiling to clinical breast cancer specimens the research presented in this thesis addresses these questions. We have generated gene expression profiles of morphologically normal epithelial and stromal tissue, isolated using laser capture microdissection, from patients with breast cancer or undergoing breast reduction mammoplasty. We determined that morphologically normal epithelium and stroma exhibited distinct expression profiles, but molecular signatures that distinguished breast reduction tissue from tumour-adjacent normal tissue were absent. Stroma isolated from morphologically normal ducts adjacent to tumour tissue contained two distinct expression profiles that correlated with stromal cellularity, and shared similarities with soft tissue tumors with favourable outcome. Adjacent normal epithelium and stroma from breast cancer patients showed no significant association between expression profiles and standard clinical characteristics, but did cluster ER/PR/HER2-negative breast cancers with basal-like subtype expression profiles with poor prognosis. Our data reveal that morphologically normal tissue adjacent to breast carcinomas has not undergone significant gene expression changes when compared to breast reduction tissue, and provide an important gene expression data set for comparative studies of tumour expression profiles. We compared gene expression profiles of tumour stroma from primary breast tumors and derived signatures strongly associated with clinical outcome. We present a new stroma-derived prognostic predictor (SDPP) that stratifies disease outcome independently of standard clinical prognostic factors and published expression-based predictors. The SDPP predicts outcome in several published whole tumour--derived expression data sets, identifies poor-outcome individuals from multiple clinical subtypes, including lymph node--negative tumors, and shows increased accuracy with respect to previously published predictors, especially for HER2-positive tumors. Prognostic power increases substantially when the predictor is combined with existing outcome predictors. Genes represented in the SDPP reveal the strong prognostic capacity of differential immune responses as well as angiogenic and hypoxic responses, highlighting the importance of stromal biology in tumour progression. We show that gene expression in the breast tumour microenvironment is highly heterogeneous, identifying at least six different classes of tumour stroma with distinct expression patterns and distinct biological processes. Two of these classes recapitulate the processes identified in the stroma-derived prognostic predictor, while the others are new classes of stroma associated with distinct clinical outcomes. One of these is associated with matrix remodelling and is strongly associated with the basal molecular subtype of breast cancer. The remainder are independent of the previously published molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Additionally, based on independent data from over 800 tumors, the combinations of stroma classes and breast cancer subtypes identify new subgroups of breast tumors that show better discrimination between good and poor outcome individuals than the molecular breast cancer subtypes or the stroma classes alone, suggesting a novel classification scheme for breast cancer. This research demonstrates an important role for the tumour microenvironment in defining breast cancer heterogeneity, with a consequent impact upon clinical outcome. Novel therapies could be targeted at the processes that define the stroma classes suggesting new avenues for individualized treatment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k866v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074z56x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gene Expression Profiling</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stromal Cells -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast -- pathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Breast Neoplasms -- pathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prognosis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wt97n"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>From physical abuse victim to aggressor : exploring the relationship</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ellenbogen, Stephen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation represents an attempt to better understand why physically abused children are more likely to develop aggressive tendencies. A sample of adolescents receiving child protection services was administered a battery of self-report measures on maltreatment, health, and well-being; an aggression measure was administered a year later. The specific focus was to determine whether aggressive youth were more likely to (1) have suffered harsher physical abuse, (2) generate violence outcome expectancies that favour recourse to aggression, and (3) report higher levels of abuse-related shame. Respectively, the second and third hypotheses were based on social information processing and shame-rage models of aggression. Only the hypothesis of the fast study on maltreatment characteristics was supported. Victims of frequent and severe abuse were more likely to report aggression. As for the second and third study, the expectation of positive outcomes from violence and feelings of shame-rage (as indicated by high levels of guilt-free shame) were actually inversely related to aggression. Even though these results went in the opposite direction of the hypotheses, they are not altogether in conflict with theoretical models. According to L. Rowell Huesmann's description of social information processing, a hostile worldview was considered a mediating factor in the development of aggression problems. The tendency for aggressive youth to expect negative rather than positive outcomes from violence can be interpreted as support for this view. Abuse-related shame was not related to aggression, but it did demonstrate the predicted association with anger and hostility. The suggestion therefore is that feeling shame as a result of abuse leads to pent-up rather than expressed rage. Given these results, it is suggested that victims of harsh maltreatment be targeted for appropriate prevention and skills promotion programs. Also, future research should investigate whether the formation of problematic relationship schemas and the tendency to suppress abuse-related emotions contribute to the maintenance of aggression problems.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hd28j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wt97n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Abused children -- Psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aggressiveness in children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atd96k593c"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of the Gab family of docking proteins in Met mediated membrane ruffle formation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Frigault, Melanie M. (Melanie Mae), 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In response to extra-cellular cues, cells activate signal transduction pathways to elicit a biological response. Cell surface growth factor receptors such as the Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activate signals that result in cellular proliferation, survival, migration, as well as epithelial morphogenesis. In order for signal transduction to occur, docking proteins are recruited to the activated RTK, become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, which then serve as docking sites for the recruitment of other signaling proteins. Docking proteins function to diversify the signal by assembling multi-protein complexes. The Gab1 docking protein is the most tyrosine phosphorylated protein upon Met receptor activation and is required for Met mediated signaling and biology. Gab1 belongs to a family of docking proteins including the highly related Gab2 protein. Gab1 promotes signals for epithelial morphogenesis downstream of the Met receptor, however Gab2 is unable to do so. Insertion of the Gab1 Met binding Motif (MBM) which confers direct binding to the Met receptor, as well as membrane targeting of Gab2 is sufficient to switch the capacity of Gab2 to activate the morphogenic program, cell scatter and lamellipodia formation. This is achieved via activation of sustained signaling pathways, and redistribution of the Gab protein, and associated molecules to sites of lamellipodia formation at the peripheral edge of the cell. Activation of the Met RTK, promotes the formation of dorsal ruffles on the apical surface of epithelial cells. The Met receptor, Gab1 and Gab1 associated molecules Shp2, Crk, and p8S subunit of PI3K, are localized to these structures, however only the Gab1erk complex is required to drive dorsal ruffle formation. Gab1 is required for Met induced dorsal ruffles as well as downstream the PDGF and EGF RTKs. These are a signaling micro-environment which results in enhanced receptor degradation. Inhibition or enhancement of Met mediated dorsal ruffle formation correlates with receptor stability. Dorsal ruffle formation downstream of Met requires the enzymatic activity of PI3K and PLCgamma, both enzymes that metabolize PIP2, and form complexes with Gab1 downstream of Met. PLCgamma and the PIP3 lipid product of PI3K are co-localized with Gab1 in dorsal ruffles. Gab1 engages with elements of the cytoskeleton, actin and cortactin, providing a link between growth factor signaling and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Gab1 is localized to membrane protrusions of the basal surface in organoid cultures and is required for actin protrusions of the basal surface of breast cancer cells.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60d109n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k593c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cell Shape</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cell Membrane -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epithelial Cells -- cytology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met -- metabolism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225f60n"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Quality of service routing using decentralized learning</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Heidari, Fariba</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents several decentralized, learning-based algorithms for on-line routing of bandwidth guaranteed paths. The presented routing algorithms do not need any a-priori knowledge of traffic demand; they use only their locally observed events and update their routing policy using learning schemes. The employed learning algorithms are either learning automata or the multi-armed bandit algorithms. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the proposed routing algorithms and prove the convergence of one of them to the user equilibrium. Discrete event simulation results show the merit of these algorithms in terms of improving the resource utilization and increasing the network admissibility compared with shortest path routing. We investigate the performance degradation due to decentralized routing as opposed to centralized optimal routing policies in practical scenarios. The system optimal and the Nash bargaining solutions are two centralized benchmarks used in this study. We provide nonlinear programming formulations of these problems along with a distributed recursive approach to compute the solutions. An on-line partially-decentralized control architecture is also proposed to achieve the system optimal and the Nash bargaining solution performances. Numerical results in some practical scenarios with well engineered networks, where the network resources and traffic demand are well matched, indicate that decentralized learning techniques provide efficient, stable and scalable approaches for routing the bandwidth guaranteed paths. In the context of on-line learning, we propose a new algorithm to track the best action-selection policy when it abruptly changes over time. The proposed algorithm employs change detection mechanisms to detect the sudden changes and restarts the learning process on the detection of an abrupt change. The performance analysis of this study reveals that when all the changes are detectable by the change detection mechanism, the proposed tracking the best action-selection policy algorithm is rate optimal. On-line routing of bandwidth guaranteed paths with the potential occurrence of network shocks such as significant changes in the traffic demand is one of the applications of the devised algorithm. Simulation results show the merit of the proposed algorithm in tracking the optimal routing policy when it abruptly changes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w0326509.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225f60n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Telecommunication -- Traffic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Online algorithms</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer networks -- Quality control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Network performance (Telecommunication)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heuristic algorithms</dc:subject><dc:subject>MPLS standard</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rp73r"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Scale formation and descaling in hot rolling of low carbon steel</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Basabe Mancheno, Vladimir Vinicio, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this research, the effects of gas composition, elapsed time of reaction and temperature on scale formation and descaling of low carbon steel were investigated and results were discussed from the viewpoint of the phase composition of the scales, oxidation rates, oxidation mechanisms, adhesion, fracture mechanics, porosity and residual scale. The phase composition and morphology of scales grown under conditions similar to those of reheating furnaces were analyzed. Low carbon steel was oxidized over the temperature range 1000-1250¬∞C in gas mixtures of O 2-CO2-H2O-N2, O2-H 2O-N2 and O2-CO2-N2. The mole fraction of each phase, wustite (FeO), magnetite (Fe3O 4) and hematite (Fe2O3) was determined by the direct comparison method Two types of scales were observed. The first type was a crystalline scale with an irregular outer surface composed mostly of wustite, and a negligible amount of magnetite. The second type was the classical three-layer scale composed of wustite, magnetite and hematite. In general, the experiments showed that the furnace atmosphere, oxidation time and temperature influence the phase composition of the scales. Low carbon steel was oxidized in air over the temperature range 600-1200¬∞C for 120 s to approximate the formation of secondary and tertiary scale in hot rolling. The mole fraction of wustite, magnetite and hematite was determined by the direct comparison method The phase composition of the scales changed with temperature and time. During the initial 30 s of oxidation, wustite was the predominant phase in the temperature range 800-1200¬∞C, and as oxidation proceeded, the percentages of magnetite and hematite increased. In addition, the texture of the scales was investigated by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM); it was found that temperature influences the texture of the scales. The experiments indicated that 850¬∞C is the ideal temperature for the finishing mill in order to reduce surface defects and work roll wear. The adhesion of scales formed in air on low carbon steel in continuous heating and isothermal conditions was investigated with a four-point bending test. The separation (crack) always occurred inside the scale indicating that the strength of the scale is lower than the strength of the scale/steel interface. It was found that scale adhesion is related to scale porosity, blister formation and stresses acting in the scale. A spallation process was observed when cooling from 800¬∞C to room temperature. The microscopic observations revealed that spallation followed route 1 "strong interface and weak oxide." Low carbon steel was oxidized over the temperature range 1050-1250¬∞C in O2-CO2H2O-N2 gas mixtures in order to study the hydraulic descaling process. The oxidation times were 15-120 min. and the scales were 130-2000 mum thick. The experimental parameters were chosen to approximate scale formation under conditions similar to those of reheating furnaces. In the hydraulic descaling tests, two modes of scale removal were observed. In the first mode, observed in classical three-layer scales that developed an inner porous layer with low or medium porosity, the horizontal undercutting occurred at the boundary of the inner porous layer and dense scale. The second mode was observed in classical three-layer scales that developed an inner porous layer with high porosity and in crystalline scales. In the second mode, the horizontal undercutting occurred at the first plane of large pores relative to the scale/steel interface. In general, the experiments showed that scale morphology controlled the removability of scale.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qd24n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rp73r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rolling (Metal-work)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbon steel -- Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94ht19n"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The neural progenitor to neuron transition : role and regulation of GrouchoTLE proteins</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Buscarlet, Manuel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Groucho/transducin-like Enhancer of split (Gro/TLE) family proteins are corepressors found as part of multiple transcriptional complexes that play significant roles during many developmental processes, including neurogenesis. This thesis sought to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of Gro/TLE1. More specifically, the aim was to clarify the contribution of different transcriptional cofactors, as well as phosphorylation events induced by cofactor binding, to Gro/TLE1 ability to inhibit neuronal differentiation from proliferating neural progenitor cells. By characterizing specific point mutations within the C-terminal domain of Gro/TLE1, we were able to selectively impair binding of Gro/TLE1 to different classes of DNA-binding proteins and then assess the effect of those mutations on Gro/TLE1 anti-neurogenic function. These studies showed that the inhibition of cerebral cortex (cortical) neuron differentiation by Gro/TLE1 requires interaction with transcription factors that use short tetrapeptide sequences, WRP(W/Y), to recruit Gro/TLE1. In contrast, interactions with proteins that either interact with the C-terminal domain of Gro/TLE1 using a different type of binding sequence, termed engrailed homology 1 (Eh1) motif, or bind to the N-terminal part of the protein, are not required for Gro/TLE1 anti-neurogenic function. Using a similar strategy based on mutation analysis, we characterized point mutations that block the hyperphosphorylation of Gro/TLE1 induced by transcription cofactor binding ("cofactor-activated phosphorylation") without impairing cofactor binding and transcriptional corepression ability. These mutations map at phosphorylatable serine residues, Ser-286, Ser-289, and Ser298. Mutation of those residues to alanine blocks/reduces both cofactor-activated phosphorylation and anti-neurogenic activity of Gro/TLE1, demonstrating that cofactor-activated phosphorylation is required for that function. Tandem mass spectroscopy analysis showed further that Ser-286 is phosphorylated. Taken together, these findings characterize the role of cofactor-activated phosphorylation and identify residues important for this mechanism. Our studies also showed that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) mediates phosphorylation of Gro/TLE1 when the latter is complexed with transcriptional partners of the WRP(W/Y) motif family. However, HIPK2 is not involved in Gro/TLE1 cofactor-activated phosphorylation. Rather, HIPK2--mediated phosphorylation is antagonistic to the latter and decreases the ability of Gro/TLE1 to interact and repress transcription with WRP(W/Y) motif proteins. Taken together, these results improve significantly our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the anti-neurogenic function of Gro/TLE1. This information provides new insight into the regulation of mammalian neuronal development and, possibly, other developmental processes controlled by Gro/TLE proteins.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085p691.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94ht19n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Repressor Proteins -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neurons -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cerebral Cortex -- metabolism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q778r"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structural and evaluative aspects of the self-concept in the development of depression in adolescence</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Adams, Philippe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Rates of depression have been observed to increase markedly during adolescence. In addition, depression rates for adolescent girls have been reported to be up to twice those of boys. A wide variety of factors have been proposed to account for these changes, including psychological factors derived from cognitive theories of depression. Such theories have often awarded an important contributory role to a negative self-concept. In the meantime, research in child and adolescent development has revealed that the self-concept undergoes profound changes during adolescence, and that these changes affect boys and girls differently. Thus the significant sex difference in rates of depression occurring in adolescence appear to develop against the backdrop of significant structural and evaluative developmental changes in the self-concept that appear to differentially affect adolescent girls and boys. The current research project was aimed at examining the roles of two aspects of the self-concept proposed to be involved in the development of depressive symptoms and clinically significant episodes of depression in adolescence, namely: self-complexity and contingency of self-worth. These constructs were selected based on their empirically demonstrated relationship with depression in youth or adults, as well as their relationship with changes occurring in the self-concept during early adolescence. In order to examine the roles of self-complexity and contingency of self-worth, a large community sample of early adolescents was recruited and followed for a period of two years. During this period, participants were contacted to monitor changes in depressive symptoms, the occurrence of negative life events, and the onset of clinically significant episodes of depression. Results reveal that self-complexity best predicted depressive outcomes when deconstructed into its positive and negative components. Moreover, negative self-complexity successfully predicted the prospective onset of clinically significant episodes of major depression. In regards to the contingency of self-worth, results supported a previous self-worth contingency model of depression, but suggest that this conceptualization cannot account entirely for the phenomenology of depression in adolescence. Two additional conceptualizations of contingent self-worth were proposed and supported. Sex differences were observed. Results were interpreted within a cognitive vulnerability framework.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860b27w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q778r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Depression in adolescence</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self-perception</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r4577"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Supramolecular DNA nanotechnology : discrete nanoparticle organization, three-dimensional DNA construction, and molecule templated DNA assembly</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Aldaye, Faisal A., 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The field of structural DNA nanotechnology utilizes DNA's powerful base-pairing molecular recognition criteria to help solve real challenges facing researchers in material science and nanotechnology, some of which include synthesis, sensing, catalysis, delivery, storage, optics, electronics, and scaffolding. In it, DNA is stripped away from any of its preconceived biological roles, and is treated as a powerful synthetic polymer. A subarea of research that our group has recently termed supramolecular DNA nanotechnology is emerging, and is proving to be a powerful complement to some of the already established rules of structural DNA nanotechnology. The work within this thesis falls under the umbrella of supramolecular DNA nanotechnology, and can conceptually be divided into three parts. (1) The first deals with the problem of discrete nanopartic1e organization. In it we present an approach for the facile and economical access to libraries of discrete nanoparticle assemblies that are addressable and switchable post-assembly. (2) The second deals with the synthesis of three-dimensional DNA assemblies. In it we present an approach for the facile construction of discrete three-dimensional DNA cages that can be structurally oscillated between pre-defined lengths, and adapt this approach to generate geometrically well-defined DNA columns of modular stiffness. (3) The last part deals with the use of small molecules to reprogram the assembly behavior of DNA. In it we use molecules to address the issue of error-correction, during and after the assembly process, and to facilitate the synthesis of "higher-order" DNA helices composed of more than two DNA strands. This work collectively offers a set of simple solutions to some of the bigger challenges currently facing researchers in DNA nanotechnology, and provides a snapshot of what is to be expected from tehe emerging discipline that is supramolecular DNA nanotechnology.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vv404.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r4577</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biomedical engineering</dc:subject><dc:subject>DNA</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nanoparticles</dc:subject><dc:subject>Molecular electronics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nanomedicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atd96k594n"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Haptic synthesis of dynamically deformable materials</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gosline, Andrew H., 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Haptic simulation of medical procedures is an active area of research in engineering and medicine. Analogous to flight simulators for pilots, surgery simulators can allow medical students and doctors to practice procedures in a risk free and well monitored virtual environment. The quality of interaction that a surgery simulator can generate is dependent upon many components. In this thesis, careful attention is paid to the haptic display of viscous effects. Viscous terms, defined here as terms that are dependent upon velocity, are typically computed 'using a discrete time backwards difference estimation of the velocity. It is well known that differentation has the tendency to amplify high frequency noise, and as a result, the backwards difference estimation generates considerable errors when applied to the quantized position readings from a digital encoder. Prior to this work, the only feasible method to improve velocity estimation was to use a variety of observation or filtering techniques, all of which inevitably add phase delay. In this thesis, the backwards difference operation was analyzed in detail. It was found that feedback viscosity simulation is very non-robust to noise, and oscillations exist in the presence of quantization noise regardless of the physical parameters of the plant. A typical haptic interface for surgery simulation consists of a mechanical linkage driven by electric motors. These linkages are controlled with a computer using a discrete-time force update law that generates a prescribed force given the user's position in the medical virtual environment. It is clear from the literature that a haptic interface must have some level of physical dissipation to enable a passive rendering due to the inherent instability associated with time delayed systems. However, dissipation in typical haptic interfaces is a byproduct of their design, and is neither controllable nor easily identifiable. A prototype haptic interface is presented in this thesis that uses eddy current brakes to add high bandwidth programmable dissipation to an existing motor linkage. The new hardware has been optimized experimentally to maximize damping and minimize inertia given conventional machining and available material constraints. A new paradigm in the control of haptic interfaces is time-domain passivity control. Passive systems are desirable in haptics because a passive system is globally stable, passivity theory applies to linear and nonlinear systems alike, and a user cannot extract energy from a passive system. Passivity controllers monitor the energy flow in the device and add virtual damping to remove any energy that violates the passivity constraint. Unfortunately, the amount of virtual damping available to a given device is limited by the physical dissipation that it exhibits. If the device is directly driven and light, such as the pantograph, the available virtual damping is insufficient to maintain the passivity constraint. The eddy current brakes allow programmable physical damping to be used in place of virtual damping which has been shown with experiments to improve the stable impedance range of a haptic interface. It is clear from the literature that most tissues in a human body exhibit viscoelastic behavior. Simulation of viscoelastic objects requires that the velocity of interaction be known. Because typical haptic interfaces use digital encoders to sample position, the estimated velocity signal is noisy, delayed or both. Eddy current brakes are viscous actuators by nature, as they generate a resistive force proportional to the velocity. To take advantage of this fact, viscoelastic decomposition algorithms were developed that can output viscous components to the eddy current brakes and elastic components to the motors. This technique reduces or eliminates the use of a velocity estimation signal in the feedback loop which improves passivity, reduces motor saturation effects, and allows for a wider stable range of mechanical impedances than conventional haptic interfaces can achieve.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085p70s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k594n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Haptic devices -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Virtual reality in medicine</dc:subject><dc:subject>Viscoelastic materials</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahq37vs077"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Analysis and design of a gated envelope feedback technique for automatic hardware reconfiguration of RFIC power amplifiers, with full on-chip implementation in gallium arsenide heterojunction bipolar transistor technology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Constantin, Nicolas, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this doctoral dissertation, the author presents the theoretical foundation, the analysis and design of analog and RF circuits, the chip level implementation, and the experimental validation pertaining to a new radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) power amplifier (PA) architecture that is intended for wireless portable transceivers. A method called Gated Envelope Feedback is proposed to allow the automatic hardware reconfiguration of a stand-alone RFIC PA in multiple states for power efficiency improvement purposes. The method uses self-operating and fully integrated circuitry comprising RF power detection, switching and sequential logic, and RF envelope feedback in conjunction with a hardware gating function for triggering and activating current reduction mechanisms as a function of the transmitted RF power level. Because of the critical role that RFIC PA components occupy in modern wireless transceivers, and given the major impact that these components have on the overall RF performances and energy consumption in wireless transceivers, very significant benefits stem from the underlying innovations. The method has been validated through the successful design of a 1.88GHz COMA RFIC PA with automatic hardware reconfiguration capability, using an industry renowned state-of-the-art GaAs HBT semiconductor process developed and owned by Skyworks Solutions, Inc., USA. The circuit techniques that have enabled the successful and full on-chip embodiment of the technique are analyzed in details. The IC implementation is discussed, and experimental results showing significant current reduction upon automatic hardware reconfiguration, gain regulation performances, and compliance with the stringent linearity requirements for COMA transmission demonstrate that the gated envelope feedback method is a viable and promising approach to automatic hardware reconfiguration of RFIC PA's for current reduction purposes. Moreover, in regard to on-chip integration of advanced PA control functions, it is demonstrated that the method is better positioning GaAs HBT technologies, which are known to offer very competitive RF performances but inherently have limited integration capabilities. Finally, an analytical approach for the evaluation of inter-modulation distortion (IMD) in envelope feedback architectures is introduced, and the proposed design equations and methodology for IMD analysis may prove very helpful for theoretical analyses, for simulation tasks, and for experimental work.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zh95h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vs077</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Power amplifiers -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Radio frequency integrated circuits -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Code division multiple access</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bipolar transistors -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gallium arsenide semiconductors -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580r181"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pharmacogenomics and genetic risk factors of coronary artery disease</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Duan, Qingling</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most prevalent disorder and the leading cause of death worldwide. There are a number of CAD medications, which are effective and safe in most patients, but have been associated with adverse reactions such as angioedema induced by angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (AE-ACEi). In this study, we identified aminopeptidase P (APP) activity as an endophenotype for AE-ACEi, which is a heritable quantitative trait (heritability =0.336 +/- 0.251 SD) and is significantly reduced in a majority of our cases. Although initial mutation screening did not reveal any coding variants in XPNPEP2, which encodes membrane-bound APP, subsequent linkage analysis of APP activity in eight families provided a maximum LOD score (3.75) for this locus. Sequencing of additional cases identified a splice variant (314_431del) and a non-coding polymorphism (rs3788853) in this locus, which cosegregate with low plasma APP activity. The latter accounts for the linkage signal and is associated with AE-ACEi (P = 0.036). In addition, we identified other potential loci for APP activity and demonstrated that certain ACEi (Captopril and Enalapril) non-specifically inhibit APP activity. Furthermore, we detected polymorphisms associated with reduced APP and ACE activities among females with estrogen-dependent inherited angioedema. We also conducted a genetic investigation of depression among CAD patients to identify common susceptibility loci which might explain the correlation between these diseases. Our candidate gene association study identified a polymorphism (rs216873) in the von Willebrand factor gene that was significantly associated (P = 7.4 x 10-5) with elevated depressive symptoms in our CAD cohort. These results suggest that risk factors for atherosclerosis also underlie susceptibility to depression among CAD patients. This dissertation contributes to the field of genetics and pharmacogenomics of CAD. A better understanding of the toxic effects of CAD drugs will assist in the development of safer and more effective treatments. In addition, our results may facilitate clinical assays to identify individuals who are susceptible to angioedema prior to ACEi or estrogen therapy. Finally, our genetic investigation of depression in CAD patients reveals a novel drug target (VWF) for treatment of depression in cardiac cases.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655k99d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580r181</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aminopeptidases -- blood</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pharmacogenetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors -- adverse effects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coronary Arteriosclerosis -- genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r2086"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Epidemiology of delays in care of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dang-Tan, Tam, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background: Although rare relative to adult cancers, cancer is still the leading cause of disease-related death in children in developed countries, including Canada. Few studies have specifically examined the epidemiology and public health significance of diagnosis and treatment delays in childhood cancer. This study aimed to investigate the nature of delays in care for children and adolescents with cancer in Canada and to assess the potential impact of such delays on clinical outcomes. Study Design: I conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate the delays of cancer symptoms reporting, diagnosis, and treatment in children between 0-19 years of age in Canada. This study used a database from Health Canada's Treatment and Outcomes component of the Canadian Childhood Cancer Surveillance and Control Program. Methodology: Patients were identified from 17 paediatric cancer centres across Canada. Subjects included in this study were residents of Canada, aged less than 20 years, diagnosed with a malignant tumour and had information on date of first symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and outcome available. Descriptive statistics and regression techniques (linear, logistic and Cox regression) were used as appropriate. I measured the individual impact of patient and provider delays on disease severity and prognosis by using judicious control for potential confounding mechanisms and mediating factors. Study Findings and Significance: By measuring various types of delays in Canada, I found that varying lengths of patient and referral delay, across age groups, types of cancers, and Canadian settings, are the main contributors to diagnosis, HCS and overall delay. Factors relating to the patients, the parents, healthcare and the cancer may all exert different influences on different segments of cancer care. I also found a negative association between diagnosis delay and disease severity for lymphoma and CNS tumour patients. Furthermore, I found that diagnosis and physician delay had a negative effect, while patient delay had a positive effect, on survival for patients diagnosed with CNS tumours. The information provided from this study may form the basis for new effective policies aimed at eliminating obstacles in cancer the diagnostic and care trajectories for Canadian children with cancer and for improving their prognosis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193d42w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r2086</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neoplasms -- epidemiology -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Delivery of Health Care -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adolescent -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neoplasms -- therapy -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neoplasms -- diagnosis -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801pk762"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mathematical modeling of airflow, heat and mass transfer during forced convection cooling of produce in ventilated packages</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dehghannya, Jalal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Forced convection cooling process is the most widely used method of cooling to extend shelf life of horticultural produce after harvest. However, heterogeneous cooling of produce inside different parts of ventilated packages is a serious problem. Therefore, it is essential to design packages that facilitate air circulation throughout the entire package to provide uniform cooling. Selection of appropriate combinations of air temperature and velocity for a given vent design is currently done largely by experimental trial and error approach. A more logical approach in designing new packages, to provide uniform cooling, is to develop mathematical models that would be able to predict package performance without requiring costly experiments. In this study, mathematical models of simultaneous airflow, heat and mass transfer during forced convection cooling process were developed and validated with experimental data. The study showed that produce cooling is strongly influenced by different ventilated package designs. Generally, cooling uniformity was increased by increasing number of vents from 1 (2.4% vent area) to 5 (12.1% vent area). More uniform produce cooling was obtained at less cooling time when vents were uniformly distributed on package walls with at least 4.8% opening areas. Aerodynamic studies showed that heterogeneity of airflow distribution during the process is strongly influenced by different package vent configurations. The highest cooling heterogeneity index (108%) was recorded at 2.4% vent area whereas lowest heterogeneity index (0%) was detected in a package with 12.1% vent area. The magnitudes of produce evaporative cooling (EC) and heat generation by respiration (HG) as well as the interactive effects of EC, HG and package vent design on produce cooling time were also investigated. Considerable differences in cooling times were obtained with regard to independent and simultaneous effects of EC and HG in different package vent configurations. Cooling time was increased to about 47% in a package with 1 vent compared to packages with 3 and 5 vents considering simultaneous effects of EC and HG. Therefore, the effects of EC and HG can be influential in designing the forced-air precooling system and consequently, in the accurate determination of cooling time and the corresponding refrigeration load.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848v001.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pk762</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Farm produce -- Storage</dc:subject><dc:subject>Farm produce -- Packaging</dc:subject><dc:subject>Precooling</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab2774015g"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Physical and functional evidence in support of candidate chromosome 3p tumour suppressor genes implicated in epithelial ovarian cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cody, Neal A. L., 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is difficult to detect in early stage disease, resulting in a high mortality rate. The molecular events underlying EOC development remain largely unknown. Chromosome 3 exhibits frequent deletions and rearrangements in EOC by cytogenetic analysis. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mapping of matched ovarian tumour and constitutional DNA samples exhibits specific regions of chromosome 3 loss involving distinct regions: 3p25-p26, 3p24 and a region proximal to 3p14. Thus, chromosome 3p loss points to the location of tumour suppressor genes (TSG) implicated in tumourigenesis, based on Knudson's 'two-hit' model and the paradigm of the classical TSG. The dissertation hypothesis states at least one TSG implicated in EOC is located on chromosome 3p. A novel complementation approach based on the transfer of normal chromosome 3 fragments into OV-90, a tumourigenic EOC cell line harbouring LOH of the 3p arm, was used to generate functional evidence for chromosome 3p TSGs. Three hybrids exhibited complete suppression of tumourigenic potential based on the inability to form colonies in soft agarose, spheroids in cell culture, and tumours in nude mice xenograft models. While all hybrids had acquired various chromosome 3 regions, they all shared in common a 3p12-pcen interval, suggesting at least one common gene may have affected the suppression of tumourigenicity in the OV-90-derived hybrids. Twelve known/hypothetical genes mapping to 3p12-pcen region were characterized based on gene expression and mutation analysis following a classical model for TSG inactivation. To establish the relevance to EOC, gene expression of candidates was investigated in primary cultures of normal ovarian surface epithelial cells and both malignant serous and benign serous tumour samples. The gene expression and genetic analysis identified seven TSG candidates, none of which appeared to be mutated or transcriptionally silenced based on classical mechanisms of TSG inactivation in OV-90, thus suppression of tumourigenicity may have resulted from the functional complementation of one more haploinsufficient 3p12-pcen genes. Several genes (GBE1, VGLL3, ZNF654 ) appeared underexpressed in malignant tumours and these findings suggest the intriguing possibility that more than one 3p12-pcen gene was involved in the suppression of tumourigenicity in OV-90, and by extension, EOC.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nv37v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2774015g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ovarian Neoplasms -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genes, Tumor Suppressor</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agb19f9556"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Physiological and molecular functions of the murine receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (RPTP[sigma])</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chagnon, M√©lanie J., 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The control of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation levels is of great importance in many biological systems. Among the kinases and phosphatases that modulate these levels, the LAR-RPTPs have been suggested to act in several key aspects of neural development, and in a dysfunctional manner in various pathologies from diabetes to cancer. The aim of this thesis is to describe the physiological functions of one of the members of this subfamily of RPTPs, namely RPTPsigma. First, we showed that glucose homeostasis is altered in RPTPsigma null mice. They are hypoglycemic and more sensitive to exogenous insulin and we proposed that the insulin hypersensitivity observed in RPTPsigma-null mice is likely secondary to their neuroendocrine dysplasia and GH/IGF-1 deficiency. In addition to regulating nervous system development, RPTPsigma was previously shown to regulate axonal regeneration after injury. In the absence of RPTPsigma, axonal regeneration in the sciatic, facial and optical nerves was enhanced following nerve crush. However, myelin-associated growth inhibitory proteins and components of the glial scar such as CSPGs (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) have long been known to inhibit axonal regeneration in the CNS, making spinal cord injury irreversible. In collaboration with Dr Samuel David, we unveiled that RPTPsigma null mice are able to regenerate their corticospinal tract following spinal cord hemisections as opposed to their WT littermates. We then isolated primary neurons from both sets of animals and found that the absence of RPTPsigma promotes the ability of the neurons to adhere to certain inhibitory substrates. Finally, in order to better understand the physiological role of RPTPsigma, we used a yeast substrate-trapping approach, to screen a murine embryonic library for new substrates. This screen identified the RhoGAP p250GAP as a new substrate, suggesting a downstream role for RPTPsigma in RhoGTPase signaling. We also identified p130Cas and Fyn as new binding partners. All these proteins have clear functional links to neurite extension. The characterization of RPTPsigma and its signaling partners is essential for understanding its role in neurological development and may one day translate into treatments of neural diseases and injuries.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h7922.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f9556</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Proteochondroitin Sulfates -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2 -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice, Knockout</dc:subject><dc:subject>Axons -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spinal Cord Injuries -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice, Inbred BALB C</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nerve Regeneration</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94ht20d"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Circuits, communication and polynomials</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chattopadhyay, Arkadev</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we prove unconditional lower bounds on resources needed to compute explicit functions in the following three models of computation: constant-depth boolean circuits, multivariate polynomials over commutative rings and the 'Number on the Forehead' model of multiparty communication. Apart from using tools from diverse areas, we exploit the rich interplay between these models to make progress on questions arising in the study of each of them.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Our first result on circuits is derived by introducing a novel notion of computation of boolean functions by polynomials. The study of degree as a resource in polynomial representation of boolean functions is of much independent interest. Our notion, called the weak generalized representation, generalizes all previously studied notions of computation by polynomials over finite commutative rings. We prove that over the ring Zm , polynomials need Wlogn 1/r-1 degree to represent, in our sense, simple functions like MAJORITY and MOD‚Ñì. Using ideas from arguments in communication complexity, we simplify and strengthen the breakthrough work of Bourgain showing that functions computed by o(log n)-degree polynomials over Zm do not even correlate well with MOD‚Ñì.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Extending the recent breakthrough works of Sherstov [She07, She08b] for two-party communication, we prove strong lower bounds on multiparty communication complexity of functions. First, we obtain a bound of n O(1) on the k-party randomized communication complexity of a function that is computable by constant-depth circuits using AND/OR gates, when k is a constant. The bound holds as long as protocols are required to have better than inverse exponential (i.e. 2-no1 ) advantage over random guessing. This is strong enough to yield lower bounds on the size of an important class of depth-three circuits: circuits having a MAJORITY gate at its output, a middle layer of gates computing arbitrary symmetric functions and a base layer of arbitrary gates of restricted fan-in.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Finally, we study the 'Number on the Forehead' model of multiparty communication that was introduced by Chandra, Furst and Lipton [CFL83]. We obtain fresh insight into this model by studying the class CCk of languages that have constant k-party deterministic communication complexity under every possible partition of input bits among parties. This study is motivated by Szegedy's [Sze93] surprising result that languages in CC2 can all be extremely efficiently recognized by very shallow boolean circuits. In contrast, we show that even CC 3 contains languages of arbitrarily large circuit complexity. On the other hand, we show that the advantage of multiple players over two players is significantly curtailed for computing two simple classes of languages: languages that have a neutral letter and those that are symmetric.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Boolean circuits are natural computing devices and are ubiquitous in the modern electronic age. We study the limitation of this model when the depth of circuits is fixed, independent of the length of the input. The power of such constant-depth circuits using gates computing modular counting functions remains undetermined, despite intensive efforts for nearly twenty years. We make progress on two fronts: let m be a number having r distinct prime factors none of which divides ‚Ñì. We first show that constant depth circuits employing AND/OR/MODm gates cannot compute efficiently the MAJORITY and MOD‚Ñì function on n bits if 'few' MODm gates are allowed, i.e. they need size nW(1s(log n)1/(r-1)) if s MODm gates are allowed in the circuit. Second, we analyze circuits that comprise only MOD m gates, We show that in sub-linear size (and arbitrary depth), they cannot compute AND of n bits. Further, we establish that in that size they can only very poorly approximate MOD‚Ñì.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Second, we obtain nO(1) lower bounds on the k-party randomized (bounded error) communication complexity of the Disjointness function. This resolves a major open question in multiparty communication complexity with applications to proof complexity. Our techniques in obtaining the last two bounds, exploit connections between representation by polynomials over teals of a boolean function and communication complexity of a closely related function.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jf67q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94ht20d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Commutative rings</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polynomials</dc:subject><dc:subject>Boolean rings</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bj420"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sedentarization and tourism : the case of the Zalabia Bedouin tribe of the southern Jordan</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tarawneh, Musa Salim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most of the recent studies on the southern Jordan Bedouins portray the Bedouins as being resistant to change and development.

It is based on an examination of the relationship between the socio-cultural, economic and political aspects of Bedouin society and the physical environment in which they live.
