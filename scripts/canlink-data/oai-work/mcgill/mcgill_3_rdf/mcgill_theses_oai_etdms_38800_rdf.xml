The results indicate that as the corrosion level increased, the tension stiffening of the concrete decreased and also the bond between the reinforcing steel and the concrete diminished considerably. Further, the comparison was made between the normal portland cement (NPC) concrete with a water-cement ratio (w/c) of 0.32, NPC concrete a with w/c ratio of 0.52 and NPC concrete with high volume (58% by total weight of cementitious materials) fly ash content, in terms of bond characteristics and corrosion resistance. It was found that as the w/c ratio increased, the corrosion resistance as well as the bond strength decreased and also the use of fly ash was very effective in improving the impermeability of the concrete and the bond between the reinforcing steel and concrete.

The "action-radii" of children between the ages of 6 years to 10 years is limited to the surrounding neighbourhood. This is also the age of physical exercise, emotional, social and full personality development in which play constitutes an important education tool. Over the years, the urgent need to create high-density housing led to subsidized housing projects. During this process, providing an ideal environment in which to raise children has been overlooked. So, what do the children do? Where do they play? The objective of this study is to decipher the functional and safe outdoor areas preferred by children living in high-density housing in Montreal. This led to the evaluation of various mini-parks in the neighbourhood of the Plateau Mont-Royal with respect to their design elements and the play patterns of the children. The identification of positively and negatively perceived play areas demonstrates the child's point of view. This research investigates the relationship between the child, the open spaces and the surrounding built environment in an effort to create an awareness of the need to design a more responsive, cooperative and sympathetic environment for children in urban settings.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mellion, Robert</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns0647651.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f537p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Playgrounds -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m367z"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The house building activities of the informal sector : a case study in Las Pinas City, Philippines</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Maribbay, Annalyn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>House building activities of the informal sector constitutes the acquisition, consolidation and use of building materials and labor that may contravene existing standards, but affords them a coping mechanism to a dynamic urban environment.

This infiltration is combined with a high expression of interferon gamma (IFNgamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and inducible nitric oxide mRNA in the maternal tissue. After receiving proper priming (IFNgamma) and triggering signal (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or TNFalpha), decidual macrophages can secrete TNFalpha, nitric oxide (NO) and other cytotoxic molecules that could potentially damage placental cells and consequently compromise embryo survival. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of activated decidual macrophages on the fetoplacental unit. High and low loss murine mating models have been used to perform cytotoxicity assays. Our results show that: (1) decidual cells from the high loss model have a greater capacity to kill YAC-1 targets than those from the low loss model; (2) when decidual macrophages and NK cells are separated, both cells demonstrate cytotoxic activity by inducing lysis of the YAC-1 targets; (3) decidual macrophage-mediated killing of YAC-1 cells is not related to NO and TNFalpha production but is inhibited by the oxyradical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine in a dose-dependent manner: (4) murine trophoblast cells are resistant to decidual cell-mediated lysis in vitro and inhibit decidual cell-mediated lysis of YAC-1 targets. Taken together, these results confirm that decidual macrophages and NK cells could be cytotoxic effectors at the maternal/fetal interface, demonstrate that trophoblasts are properly adapted to resist decidual cell-mediated lysis, and suggest that certain reactive oxygen intermediate, might damage cells other than trophoblasts around the fetoplacental unit.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baines, Malcolm G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732db80m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hb58v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jw45g"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Determining dopamine D1 receptor changes in cocaine abusers using positron emission tomography and SCH 23390</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Penney, Christine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An underlying mechanism of cocaine is its ability to bind to the dopamine transporter thus preventing dopamine (DA) reuptake, and leading to an increase of endogenous DA in the synapse. Excessive synaptic DA may lead to neuroadaptions of the DA receptors. In vitro animal studies have demonstrated a cocaine-induced down-regulation of D1 receptors in limbic regions of the brain. PET studies in rats have also noted a decrease in D1 receptor numbers in the striatum. In humans, D1 receptors have not been examined using either in vitro or PET techniques. The present investigation was conducted to determine if there were changes in D1 receptor density in cocaine abusers. Eight cocaine-addicted were examined within their first week of abstinence using PET and the D1-receptor radioligand SCH 23390. The binding potentials (BP) of the nucleus accumbens, putamen and caudate nucleus were obtained and compared to eleven control-group subjects. The results indicate no group differences in BP between the two groups. There was no correlation found between amount and duration of cocaine use and BP. There was a significant negative correlation between age and BP. The results suggest that, contrary to findings obtained in animal research, there is no evidence of D1 receptor changes in chronic cocaine abusers compared to controls.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gill, Kathryn</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741t606.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jw45g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Psychobiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj96022732"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dietary composition alters gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Paquette, Melanie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Macronutrient composition of food was shown to have a potent impact in modulating circadian rhythms of gentamicin toxicity.

Two models were designed to answer these two questions. The first was a multinomial logit model in which socio-economic indicators were related to the incidence of malaria. The second model was specified as a conditional logit model aimed at determining people's choice between seeking treatment at a hospital/clinic or at a pharmacy/community health worker. Economic development is the key to eradication of the major parasitic diseases, particularly malaria. An interesting result was obtained on the gender of the respondent; women in Tigray are less likely to report having had malaria than men. Education level was found to be positively correlated with the likelihood of choosing the Hospital/Clinic option over the Pharmacy/Community Health Worker. The Hospital/Clinic option was less likely to be chosen with increasing cost of treatment.

The time-course of the response to intraplantar formalin and formalin-induced c-FOS expression and alterations in substance P (SP) immunoreactivity (IR) were assessed in capsaicin-treated rats. The foot withdrawal latency to 48°C water was also recorded from 1--75 days after surgery. Formalin-induced pain was reduced by both capsaicin and its vehicle at the earliest test, 3 days after surgery. Formalin pain in the vehicle-treated group recovered by 14 days, and scores in the capsaicin-treated group remained depressed until 28 days. By 75 days, capsaicin-treated rats were hyperalgesic in the first phase. Thermal hyposensitivity was apparent from the first day after surgery until day 75. Capsaicin reduced c-FOS IR and both treatments reduced SP IR at day 14. Thermal hypoalgesia occurs prior to changes at the terminals of unmyelinated afferents and may involve depletion of peptides in the periphery due to disrupted axonal transport. The effects on formalin-induced pain may be due to axonal transport disruption, and by desensitization of the afferents.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Franklin, Keith B.

These sites are considered difficult to clean-up using bioremediation technologies because of the toxicity of heavy metals to microorganisms. Laboratory experiments were conducted to verify if biodegradation of a model PAH, naphthalene, could be sustained over a long time-period (weeks) in the presence of a common heavy metal contaminant, Cr (VI). Complete reduction of Cr (VI) at concentrations up to 6.3 mg/L was achieved by Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17484 in the presence of naphthalene that was continuously released from an immiscible organic liquid, 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane (HMN). The presence of Cr (VI) inhibited bacterial growth and reduced naphthalene biodegradation rates. Despite this the microorganisms were able to degrade significant masses of naphthalene, quantities much greater than those reported in earlier studies. The addition of 1,2-Naphthoquinone, a possible by-product of naphthalene degradation and an oxidizing agent, resulted in improved naphthalene biodegradation rates in the presence of Cr (VI).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182n072.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n053v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Environmental</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zj60b"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of a pediatric oral health-related quality-of-life questionnaire</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Basri, Etidal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Oral and dental health illness among children is prevalent, and associated impairments are common.

These links function with no physical contact but suffer from poor tolerances to misalignment. This thesis presents the design and implementation of an optical link which exploits the spatial redundancy between arrays of active optoelectronic elements in order to obtain a high misalignment tolerance between them. The system consists of four optical links operating between two printed circuit boards. Each optical link pair constitutes a bi-directional channel. Each of the links is designed to function at 1.25Gb/s, yielding an aggregate bandwidth of 5Gb/s for the system. The system is design to function under +/-1 mm and +/-1° of lateral and angular misalignments, respectively, with a working distance between the boards varying from 5 cm to 22 cm. The design of the system makes it ideal for rack or shelf based optical interconnections. The design of this optical link exploits the spatial redundancy between a two-dimensional array of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) and a two-dimensional array of photodetectors (PD). The link makes use of a refractive microlens array as a collimating optic, and of bulk achromatic lenses for both collimation and focusing of the beams at each end of the optical link. This thesis presents the optomechanical packaging, optoelectronic packaging and precision alignment of the active and passive elements of the optical link. Experimental results for the link, showing misalignment tolerances greater than +/-1.25mm laterally and +/-1° angularly are presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kirk, Andrew G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580p383.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440v49t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak643b301f"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Telemetric measurement of compressive loads in the sheep lumbar spine</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hauerstock, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this study was to develop and validate a system for the telemetric measurement of in vivo compressive intervertebral loads in the sheep, and to measure these loads in a variety of activities. A miniature load cell and radio transmitter were implanted in the L3--L4 space of the spine. A total of four sheep were operated on; one was sacrificed five days after surgery, due to failure of the transmitter, and another was sacrificed after failing to ambulate for two weeks after surgery. The other two animals (average mass 67 kg) were kept for five weeks, during which a range of activities were performed, including standing, lying prone, walking/trotting, and jumping. Results for a range of activities were as follows: in walking at 1.5 m/s, average maximum and minimum loads were 461 N and 256 N, respectively; in walking at 2m/s, average maximum and minimum loads were 684 N and 303 N, respectively; in standing, loads averaged 161 N; and in lying prone, loads averaged 212 N. The highest loads were recorded in jumping, where the peak load was 1290 N. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, the magnitude of in vivo axial loads in the sheep lumbar spine. These findings have implications for the evaluation of studies which employ the sheep model to test spinal implants.

The development of the Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL), which provides high yields and low cost makes FSOI possible. However, the packaging and alignment of opto-electronic components still dominate the manufacturing costs. A solution to the problem of alignment is to use spatial redundancy. One way to accomplish this is by increasing the number of possible optical links and using only a subset of those links to provide a collection of reliable high-speed channels. This thesis presents the implementation of a transmitter specially developed for a redundant channels alignment FSOI. The implementation consists of a 1.25Gb/s transmitter chip driving one element of a 3 x 3 VCSEL array. The driver chip was designed and fabricated from a commercial 25-Ghz Silicon bipolar process. The design, construction and integration aspects covering the microelectronics, electronics and packaging for the transmitter are summarized. Characterization results are presented for a transmission rate of 1 Gbit/s per channel.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Plant, David V.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n515w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676x55m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f312q"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Analysis of the flexural behaviour of a fibreglass composite seawall</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Giroux, Cynthia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Design of fibreglass composite sheet pile seawalls is traditionally based on the flexural rigidity (EI) of the piling system. To compare with commonly used steel or wood sheet piling, there is a strong need to properly characterise the flexural behaviour of composite piling systems. Directed by this industrial need, the research reported herein is focused on the flexural response of a pultruded sheet pile seawall panel consisting of E-glass fibre-reinforced polyester. The analysis consists of an experimental investigation, analytical modelling, and finite element simulation to determine the flexural and shear rigidities of the seawall panel for use in computing the deflections of the piling system. A novel testing method was developed to simultaneously determine the flexural rigidity (EI) and shear rigidity (kAG) of the panel using Timoshenko's beam theory. Three- and four-point bending tests were performed on six different span lengths and the results were self-consistent from the two different tests.

Database searching revealed that three additional and unrelated Ciona mRNAs contained the same, or almost identical, 16 nt sequence at the 5' -end. Reverse-transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments proved that at least three additional mRNAs contain the same 5' -end sequence. These results suggested the possibility that the 5 ' end of the TnI, and other, Ciona mRNAs is derived by spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing. Also consistent with SL trans-splicing were Ciona embryo transfect ion studies with a TnI/beta-galactosidase reporter construct that demonstrated the existence of a functional TnI promoter within 1.5 kb of ATG-upstream DNA Moreover, RT-PCR experiments showed that TnI/beta-galactosidase transcripts contained the 16 nt mRNA common 5' end sequence despite the absence of this sequence from the transcriptional template construct. This data is a demonstration of SL trans-splicing and represents the first reported case of SL trans-splicing among the deuterostomes. It suggests that SL trans-splicing may represent an ancestral metazoan feature. Moreover, because vertebrates probably arose from ascidian-like ancestors, it may be that many vertebrate genes, none of which are thought to undergo SL trans-splicing, are descended from trans-spliced ancestral genes. Such a history could explain the common occurrence in vertebrate genes of 5' untranslated region enhancer-containing introns.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hastings, Kenneth</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zd02f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032484q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ciona intestinalis -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Muscle proteins</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722hb594"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of Plagiorchis elegans (Trematoda : Plagiorchiidae) infection on the carbohydrate metabolism of fourth instar Aedes aegypti (Diptera : Culicidae) larvae</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wallage, Helena Rachelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Glucose was present in substantially greater concentrations in whole body extracts of fourth instar Aedes aegypti L. larvae than was trehalose; in contrast, trehalose was more abundant than glucose in haemolymph extracts.

Within 24 hours of cercarial penetration, total body extracts of infected fourth instar larvae exhibited decreased trehalase activity, increased trehalose-6-phosphatase activity, and an accumulation of trehalose in comparison to uninfected larvae. Concentrations of glucose, glycogen and lipids, and the activity of glycogen phosphorylase a were similar in extracts of infected and control larvae. The predominant fatty acids, in both control and infected larvae, were C 18:0, C 18:1 and C 18:3. There were no significant differences in the types and proportions of fatty acids found in control and infected larvae.

Glomus intraradices sporulation was highest at 23°C, while spore metabolic activity was significantly reduced with temperature below 10°C. Root length and colonization percentage decreased at 10°C. Mycorrhizal fungi increased 32P activity of leek leaves at a root zone temperature of 23°C 7 days after 32P injection, and at both 23°C and 15°C 14 days after injection. No difference was found at 0°C between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. Amounts of total and metabolically active spores and hyphae varied over sampling times.

Parallel alphabeta game tree search is a powerful tool in this endeavor. Most parallel alphabeta algorithms involve some form of synchronization of processors during a search, generally resulting in a waste of time. Some algorithms, however, such as APHID, are asynchronous, with all processors working essentially independently during a search. Asynchronous algorithms are not necessarily limited to a search horizon in the way that synchronous algorithms are. Search beyond this horizon has been called speculative search. A series of experiments were conducted to determine how much value information from speculative search contributes to the overall search. Compared to a synchronized parallel alphabeta search, speculative search was found to contribute to the principle variation score up to 60% of the time and results in a different move selection up to 25% of the time on a nine processor network.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Newborn, Monty</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tn86r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m369h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab8515q28f"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Maasai use of plants in Loliondo, Tanzania, and their impact on wild populations of two of the most used trees : Juniperus procera Endl.

Three hundred persons were interviewed in ten Maasai communities concerning tree utilization for fence and house construction, firewood, traditional medicine and gourd sterilization. By comparing the indices for 169 species, J. procera and O. africana usage was significantly higher than all other species (Kruskal-Wallis, chi2 = 15.3, DF = 2, p = 0.0005). Ninety-six percent of interviewees have witnessed local decline in J. procera and O. africana. In conjunction with interviews, ecological sampling was carried out in community forests to determine species status. The correlations of size class distributions are not typical of "healthy" plant populations. If current trends continue local extinction of J. procera and O. africana may occur.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Johns, T.

Most of these coactivators exert their action through the receptor ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2). This interaction occurs between a coactivator LXXLL motif (NR-box) and a hydrophobic cleft located on the ligand-binding domain of the receptor. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of CIA, a novel C&amp;barbelow;oactivator I&amp;barbelow;ndependent of A&amp;barbelow;F-2 function. CIA displays specific interaction with the RVR orphan nuclear receptor and both specific interaction and transcriptional coactivation potential with the estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta. The interaction with ERalpha and beta is strongly enhanced by its natural ligand, estradiol (E2) and surprisingly also by pure antiestrogens EM 800 and ICI 164,384. While the E2-dependent CIA-ERalpha interaction requires an intact CIA LXXLL motif, CIA also interacts with an AF-2 null mutant of ERalpha. Therefore, CIA constitutes the first example of a novel type of ligand-dependent but AF-2 independent nuclear receptor coactivator that may play a specific role in the ER physiology via selective ER modulators (SERMs).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Giguere, Vincent</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gj332.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623j073k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462730r"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the evolutionary origin of angiosperms : characterization of MADS-box floral homeotic gene homologues in Ephedra andina (Gnetales)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Savard, Joël</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite a century of research, the evolutionary origin of angiosperms remains uncertain. Morphological studies have identified the gnetophytes as the sister group of angiosperms mainly because of the similar organization of their reproductive structures. Molecular studies have been ambiguous as to whether these two groups are closely related. Study of the development of seed plant reproductive structures can help to untangle this issue. Here, I report the cloning of five MARS-box floral homeotic gene homologues from the gnetophyte Ephedra andina. Three of these genes belong to AG, AGL6 and TM3 subfamilies. These monophyletic groups comprise angiosperm as well as conifer homologues. Phylogenetic analysis of the plant MADS-box gene family reveals that within subfamilies, Ephedra genes always form subclades with other gymnosperm genes to the exclusion of all angiosperm genes. These results suggest that gnetophytes are more closely related to conifers than to angiosperms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bell, Graham A.

The efficiency of these methods, however, is less than admissible for many interesting domains of mathematics.
