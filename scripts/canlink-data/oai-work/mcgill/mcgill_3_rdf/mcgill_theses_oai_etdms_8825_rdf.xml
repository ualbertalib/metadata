This thesisattempts to cover the adjustments in the means and modes of living of two irmnigrant groups in Montreal, Canada, the Italians and the Finns, and to present several general hypotheses concerning the assimilation process in these fields. The effects of the economic depression on these processes are noted. Spatial adjustment and chances in family organization are included in so far as these relate to our main points of reference. The principal source of information has been the family budgets of representative samples of the two groups. The Italians, of agricultural backgrounds, have settlednear the periphery of Uontreal. They have entered the building trades, dock labour, and factory trades. They exhibit a strong family unity. They are assimilating slowly towards the French. The Finnish men are migratory. Their employment is largely in the lumbering, mining,,farming and building industries. The women are domestic servants. The Finns have settled in a downtown area. They are assimilating quickly towards the English.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hughes, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mm826.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k548j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Québec (Province) -- Emigration and immigration</dc:subject><dc:subject>Europeans -- Montréal -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870z983"><ual:graduationDate>1934</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Nutrition and Breeding</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of fertilization on the nutritive value of pasture grass</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Finlayson, Duncan Archibald</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This paper reports a study of the nutritive value of fertilized vs. unfertilized pasture herbage, with particular reference to the quality of the protein, as measured by comparative feeding trials.

Now that the physiologist is more prone than formerly to fall back on the aids that have issued from the findings of physical science, a method taken directly from that field has been found to promise a means of accurately determining the changes in blood flow in a qualitative way and in some cases quantitative changes have been subjected to fairly accurate measuration. In this work the thermo-electric method as developed finally by Gibbs has been used in repeating some of the work that has recently been done with the use of older methods.

However, on closer study, it is apparent that a great deal of the work has been purely academic and of very little use to the practical mill operator. In the first place a large part of the llterature is devoted to the development of mathematical theories of crushing and their approval or condemnation; in the second place much of the practical work performed in laboratories has been done with inadequate equipment, that is if the results are to be applied to actual milling practice. Small laboratory mills with batch charges cannot be expected to give conditions approaching those in a full size mill with continuous feed and discharge. In the paper it is claimed that a 2 foot mill could be used to forecast the work of a commercial mill. This may be so, and, if truef establishes the 5 foot mill used at McGill University as a very desirable one for the same purpose. It supports the contention of the writer that anything smaller than a 2 foot mill is liable to give erroneous results.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McBride, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qg14j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676z716</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mining engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rx53v"><ual:graduationDate>1934</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Zoology Department</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Source of cells in regeneration and growth</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cohen, Arthur</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The source of cells which give rise to the new tissues and organs in regeneration has been described in a large number of animals.
