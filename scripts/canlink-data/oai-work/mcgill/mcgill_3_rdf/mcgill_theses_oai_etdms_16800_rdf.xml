B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The movement of a fluid stream relative to a solid boundary generates a complex syndrome of momentum transfer phenomena whose mechanisms still present fertile ground for investigation. The addition of solid particles to the fluid flow creates a new and even more complicated situation because of the interplay of momentum between the fluid-solid boundaries on the particles and the boundary containing the flow. In contrast with work in pure fluid flow, little has been done in the case of solids-gas movement, and the design of these systems remains, at times, a very costly art.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gauvin, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h805x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bg26f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q7901"><ual:graduationDate>1960</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Air law in Latin America</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tolle, Paulo.

In 1911, the Comité Juridique International d'Aviation presented the first suggestion of a uniform law, the Code International de l'Air.

Many writers in this field have emphasized the convenience of a broader unity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rosevear, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xn21p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q7901</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Air and Space Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h320j"><ual:graduationDate>1960</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The administration of scientific research: a case study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tiger, Lionel. S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Historically, the research scientist did not require a supporting organization for the pursuit of his scientific interests. There appears to have been a pattern followed by scientists until the early 18th century; many scientists were “gentlemen of leisure” and scientists by hobby. As well, the necessary equipment for scientific investigation in its rudimentary stages was inexpensive enough so that individuals could afford to purchase or construct their own. However the increasing complexity and cost of equipment and supplies used in scientific research has now made it practical and necessary for centralization and corporate ownership of research facilities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Solomon, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t5804.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h320j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sociology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r6830"><ual:graduationDate>1960</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The significance of light cells of the thyroid gland, and their relationship to thyroid tumors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thompson, Benjamin.

It is invested by a true fibrous capsule, which is continuous with the stroma of the gland. The thyroid consists of a pair of lobes joined across the anterior aspect of the trachea by the isthmus. Each lobe extends proximally along the lateral aspect of the thyroid cartilage, and distally along the upper part of the trachea. The lobes are related medially, to the thyroid and cricoids cartilages, to the trachea and oesophagus, and to the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Isler, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g860f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r6830</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
