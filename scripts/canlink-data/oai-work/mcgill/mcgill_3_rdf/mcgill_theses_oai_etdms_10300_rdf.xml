The labelled lipid moiety appears in the circulation after a shorter lag period than the protein indicating that the two components are not synthesized simultaneously. Puromycin inhibits the release of labelled lipoprotein following a delay which is due to exhaustion of an intracellular pool of apolipoprotein. More labelled lipoprotein lipid is released by the perfused liver when whole blood is used as the perfusate than when an albumin-Ringer preparation is used although there is no additional glyceride release. This indicates that there is an exchange of lipid between liver and plasma lipoprotein. This exchange has also been demonstrated by following uptake of doubly labelled lipoprotein by the perfused liver. The lipid component disappears more rapidly from the perfusate than the protein. Lipoprotein triglyceride is removed intact by the perfused liver in a three-stage process, initial trapping of the entire lipoprotein molecule, exchange, and uptake. The lipid fatty acid is incorporated primarily into liver phospholipid. The exchange has also been demonstrated in vivo where it appears more rapid indicating the participation of other tissues.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rubinstein, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4307713.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj1395086</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583xz21f"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Elastic surface wave propagation in anisotropic crystals</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lim, Teong C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A general numerical method has been developed for the determination of the propagation characteristics of elastic surfaces waves on anisotropic crystals. Extensive studies have revealed that these waves can be propagated in any direction on ail planes of anisotropic crystals. Near certain directions, in which the normal surface wave degenerates continuously into the transverse bulk wave, the penetration of the surface wave into the solid is deep. However, near these special directions, pseudosurface waves that can be propagated for a wide range of directions are found, and their form is explained. The effect of water loading on the propagation of both normal and pseudo-surface waves is also investigated. A gradient Method of finding the power-flow directions for normal surface waves has been developed. The results are compared with the more standard Poyntingvector method.

Expressions are obtained showing the relationships between the parameters of the various two-dimensional structures and the position and amplitude of the second, derivative maximum and minimum. The Fourier transform formulas for the gravity anomalies of the two-dimensional structures are derived. For small values of omega, the Fourier transforms give valuable information about the parameters of the structures. Under favorable conditions the amplitude spectrum of the Fourier transforms can give information about the depth as well as the inclination of the anomalous mass.

Actinomycin D affects with difficulty RNA synthesis and cytochrome c induction under the influence of oxygen in a brewer's strain of the yeast S. cerevisiae. Proflavine is completely and immediately effective in inhibiting RNA synthesis in these cells. The rapidly labelled RNA fraction decays to acid-soluble nucleotides at two different rates. Alpha-amino levulinic acid synthetase activity in these cells is reduced dramatically in the presence of oxygen. This effect of oxygen is not due to a repression of synthesis of the enzyme but appears to be dependent in some way on protein synthesis. Results indicate that oxygen-induced cytochrome c synthesis in these yeast cells involves de nova protein synthesis and is dependent on newly formed RNA of a limited lifetime; the induced synthesis, however, is not dependent on an increased formation of precursors of the prosthetic group.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quastel, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qg32g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj2365296</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k826w"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dissociative electron attachment in the halogens</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Moe, Hou-Kiat</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A trapped electron apparatus employing an R.P.D. electron gun has been built for electron impact studies of excitation and negative ion formation.

A decrement in urinary excretion of uric acid without rise in plasma urate concentration is also evident in these patients. Hyperuricemia per se does not appear to influence the mechanisms of urine acidification, since the induction of an acute hyperuricemia fails to modify urinary pH, renal excretion of titra table acid and ammonia in the mongrel dog. Experiments performed in both mongrel and dalmatian dogs reveal that ammonia is the main adaptive mechanism for hydrogen excretion during either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. Furthermore, the increment in urinary ammonia occurs rapidly and is not influenced by prolonged sodium restriction.

In the cortex of the thymus, these cells formed a continuous layer on the inner surface of the capsule and around vessels, and constituted a loose network over the remaining of the cortex. In the medulla, two zones were distinguished: the "outer medulla" in which cell web-containing reticular cells were abundant and formed a dense network and the "inner medulla" in which no such cells were found. In the spleen, cell web-containing reticular cells were abundant in the periarterial lymphatic sheaths and formed a distinct layer separating the white pulp from the marginal zone. They also formed a delicate layer separating the germinal center from the cortex of lymphatic nodules. Thus, the thymus and spleen appeared to be compartmentalized by sheaths of TPA-stained reticular cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sk38c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pq937</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dj72m"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of the limbic system upon single neurons in the tuberal and lateral hypothalamus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Murphy, John T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effects of electrical stimulation in the amygdala, septum, midbrain tegmentum and hippocampus upon extracellularly recorded unit and slow potentials in the tuberal and lateral hypothalamic regions were studied in cats. The results of these experiments provide a quantitative assessment of the convergence of limbic input to the tuberal and lateral hypothalamus, establish the ventromedial nucleus as a focal object of limbic influence, and identify two functionally distinct amygdaloid efferent pathways which reach identical neurons within the ventromedial nucleus. In addition the extreme sensitivity of the hypothalamic. response to variations in the frequency of impulses arriving from the amygdala is shown. Finally, the presence of inhibitory interneurons within and near the lateral border of the ventromedial nucleus is demonstrated using physiological criteria, and morphological identification of these interneurons is tentatively provided.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gloor, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cn96p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dj72m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abk128f07w"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of iodine deficiency and radiations in the production of thyroid tumors in the rat</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mandavia, Mansukhlal G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Tumors of the follicular cells of rat thyroid glands were produced with the intent of exploring the respective roles of radiations and hyperplasia. Such tumors, which can be malignant, were induced by x-irradiation, radioactivity, or prolonged low-iodine diet, alone or in combination. Thyroid glands were examined in serial sections; and, quantitative data were obtained on the incidence of tumor-bearing animals, the number of tumors per gland, and the total volume of tumors per gland. Hyperplasia, associated with low-iodine diet, induced in six to twelve months a greater yield of tumors than did radiations in the doses employed. However, when radiation was followed by hyperplasia, the yield was much more than expected by a simple additive effect of these two factors. The interpretation is that in carcinogenesis of the thyroid, radiation acts as an 'initiating' agent, whereas hyperplasia acts as a promoting agent (possibly also as an 'initiating' agent).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732dd03x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128f07w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gw81q"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Further studies on the distribution and mechanism of action of a tissue antihistamine principle</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lefcort, Marlene S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The distribution of antihistamine activity in extracts prepared from tissues of rat, guinea pig and dog has been investigated.
