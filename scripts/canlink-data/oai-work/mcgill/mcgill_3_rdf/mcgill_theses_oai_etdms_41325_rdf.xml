The theoretical model in its most general form is based on the premiss that philosophy, religion, and art can be thought of as conventionally defined linguistic fields analogous to Wittgensteinian language-games. Relations among the linguistic fields are, in turn, analysed as exclusive ("Disparate" Model), inclusive ("Reductionist" Model), or interactional ("Dialectical" and "Tensional" Models), the latter pair being most appropriate for figurative language, the former pair for non-figurative language. The Dialectical and Tensional Models are assimilated, respectively, to Roman Jakobson's theory of metaphor and metonymy as the fundamental poles of language. Emphasis falls upon the continuum between the dialectical-metaphoric and the tensional-metonymic poles as the area in which creative, imaginative activities, such as the writing of novels or deliberation upon ethical problems, takes place. Iris Murdoch's theories of "crystalline" and "journalistic," "open" and "closed" novels and the related ways of thinking are coordinated with this continuum as a paradigm. Moreover, a creative tension is revealed in her philosophical writings between a resisted impetus towards totalizing explanations and the experience of the inherent contingency of philosophical thought. Thus, there is in Murdoch's philosophy, as in her creative prose, an exploration of the dynamics between the dialectical-metaphoric pole of thought and language and the tensional-metonymic pole, with an increasing, though never finally realized tendency towards the tensional-metonymic pole. Detailed analyses of Murdoch's aesthetic and ethical thought and of a wide selection of her novels illustrate this thesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hg21g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634444x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Murdoch, Iris -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language and languages -- Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73pw803"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of devaluation in a short-run structuralist macro model for developing countries : a case study of India</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nigam, Ashok Kumar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Taking the structuralist approach as a starting point, this dissertation constructs a computable general equilibrium model for India using the social accounting matrix framework and along the lines of Lance Taylor's modelling of developing countries. The model is used to test the structuralist theories on the effects of a devaluation. The dissertation extends the testing of these models in two respects. First, by organizing the data in the form of traded and non-traded goods it studies the macroeconomic responses at a greater level of disaggregation than has been attempted earlier. Second, by constructing social accounting matrices for three time periods and using these to simulate the model, it examines the robustness of the predictions of the structuralist theories. The results indicate that the outcome of a devaluation depends on the structure of the economy and on the extent of the elasticity of exports, thus, generally supporting the structuralist theories.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sk294.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73pw803</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>India -- Economic policy -- 1974-1980 -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Monetary policy -- India -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>India -- Economic policy -- 1980-1991 -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Devaluation of currency -- India -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Devaluation of currency -- Developing countries -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Developing countries -- Economic policy -- Case studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zv094"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Qurʾan commentary of Sayyid ʻAlî Muḥammad, the Bab</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lawson, Benjamin T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Babi religion had, during its brief life, a tremendous impact on Iranian society.

The following study examines these two remarkably different commentaries in an attempt to appreciate the Bab's attitudes towards the Qur'an, Islam, and himself. The earliest work, the Tafsi r surat al-baqara, was written before the Bab had publicized a claim to messiahship. In the Tafsi r surat Yusuf, written only a short time later, this claim is made explicit. The radical difference in the style of the two commentaries, which may be seen as a reflection of a development in the Bab's perception of himself, is analyzed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722h9652.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zv094</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bāb, ʻAlī Muḥammad Shīrāzī, 1819-1850</dc:subject><dc:subject>Babism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj430553r"><ual:graduationDate>1966</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Diffraction of an electromagnetic wave by the aperture</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wu, Chuang-Jy.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Electromagnetic wave diffraction theories for large circular, rectangular, triangular and hexagonal apertures in a plane screen have been investigated theoretically and experimentally.

The eight component activities identified are: (1) influential variables, (2) perception and evaluation of the influential variables, (3) bargaining power, (4) prediction, (5) negotiation, (6) mechanism of dispute settlement, (7) feedback loops, and (8) the collective agreement. In addition to the model, an evolution of collective bargaining by teachers in the CEGEP sector of Quebec is presented. This is achieved by descriptive case studies of the first four rounds (1967-1980) of collective bargaining in this sector. The data for this study has been acquired through a review of the literature, documents of the parties concerned, newspapers and interviews. The model is used to analyse the four case studies. From the analysis it is concluded that collective bargaining in the CEGEP sector of Quebec has become highly centralized and politicised. This has contributed to numerous labour conflicts both during the negotiations and during the term of collective agreements. Recommendations are proposed to help resolve some of the problems encountered. The major recommendations include a labour relations board for the public sector and the division of bargaining issues into provincial and local levels. For the negotiations at the provincial level it is proposed to allow the parties to negotiate a mechanism of dispute settlement and a bargaining calendar with compulsory mediation. Also, it is proposed to base the acquisition of the right to strike and lockout on the refusal of the mediation report by one of the parties. For the negotiations at the local level, a system of permanent negotiation is proposed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65v8619.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451j32g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Universities and colleges -- Québec (Province) -- Employees</dc:subject><dc:subject>College teachers -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Collective bargaining -- College teachers -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fédération des cégeps -- Employees</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602146z"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Parental responsiveness and firstborn girls' adaptation to a new sibling</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gottlieb, Laurie Naomi, 1946-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigated firstborns' adjustment and responsiveness to a new sibling and parents' responsiveness to their firstborn before and after the second child's birth. Parental responsiveness was also examined in the context of predicting firstborns' adjustment and responsiveness to the sibling. Fifty families with firstborn daughters (26-55 mo) were visited at home 6-10 weeks before and 5-6 weeks after the sibling's birth. After the sibling's birth, young firstborns were more distressed than old firstborns; however, prenatal distress was the best predictor of postnatal distress. Old and young firstborns showed different patterns of responsiveness to brothers and sisters. In terms of parental responsiveness, firstborns perceived mothers as more responsive after the birth than before, while their perceptions of fathers remained unchanged. Mothers gave less support after the birth, particularly to old firstborns. Although fathers' support remained unchanged postnatally, fathers gave the least support to old firstborns with brothers. Time spent by mothers with firstborns decreased from before to after the birth, while fathers' time increased. Continuity was found for parental support but not for parental involvement, especially by fathers. Parental support was associated with low postnatal distress while parental caregiving was related to high postnatal distress. Prenatal maternal responsiveness and postnatal paternal responsiveness predicted postnatal distress. Firstborns' perceptions of parental responsiveness were generally associated with firstborns' responsiveness to the sibling. The results were discussed in terms of family-systems theory and stress-coping theory.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hj88p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602146z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Parent and child</dc:subject><dc:subject>First-born children -- Psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fathers and daughters</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mothers and daughters</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brothers and sisters</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687j23r"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Montreal Chinese property ownership and occupational change, 1881-1981</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Aiken, Rebecca B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Property ownership and occupational change are used to understand the social and economic organization of the Chinese community in Montreal. These data can be understood with a model of the lineage mode of production, situated within an ethnically defined dual economy. Original immigration data show distinct patterns for Eastern Canada, and the independence of migration from Canadian legislation. The history of Chinese property ownership reveals encapsulated, long term tenure with transfers related to life cycle crises rather than market conditions. Chinese occupations are highly concentrated in service sector specialities which support domestic production units. The Chinese community is present throughout the Island of Montreal, while Chinatown contains some specialized institutions rather than being a ghetto. Current demographic changes may jeopardize the future of secondary Chinese centers such as Montreal, in favor of larger centers such as Toronto and Vancouver.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n1958.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687j23r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chinese -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chinese Canadians -- Quebec (Province) -- Montreal -- Employment</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chinese Canadians -- Quebec (Province) -- Montreal -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Property -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chinese -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Employment</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956g65h"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>International legal status and institutional structure of Sita</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Majid, Amir Ali</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Through its Global Transmission Network, Societe Internationale de Telecommunications Aeronautiques (SITA) provides Aeronautical Telecommunications related to Safety of Air Navigation, Flight Planning Reservations etc., to two hundred and forty-three airlines of one hundred and fifty-four Nations.

This enzyme is neurally induced by subjecting rats to stress or to the injection of reserpine. Several neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists were administered in order to clarify the nervous pathways to this organ. The combination of the central or systemic administration of a catecholamine depletor and a serotonin depletor also increases the activity of this enzyme. Serotonin antagonists but not catecholamine antagonists potentiate the action of reserpine. However, the depletion of catecholamines or serotonin alone does not elevate the activity of this adrenal enzyme. Serotonin agonists block the effect of reserpine. Adrenal phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase exhibits a similar regulation. Electrolytic lesions and administration of a serotonin neurotoxin in the raphe area show that the medial raphe nucleus is the centre of the inhibitory serotonergic pathway regulating adrenal functions. The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine produces a centrally mediated induction of adrenal dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Depletion of central or peripheral catecholamines and serotonin does not modify the elevation of this enzyme activity by oxotremorine. Central and systemic administration of agonists binding to gamma-aminobutyric acid-receptors decreases adrenal dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity and impairs the effect of the cholinergic inducer. These negative effects are blocked by a specific antagonist of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A-receptors. This work suggests a central inhibitory action of the aminoacid and a gamma-aminobutyric-cholinergic interaction in regard to adrenal dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Corticotropin releasing factor, centrally administered at a constant rate, increases adrenal dopamine beta-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltranferase activities without elevating plasma corticosterone.

Head Nurses, nurses, Directors of Nursing, and doctors were respondents. The study examined three questions: What are the expectations held for the Head Nurse within groups? Are there differences in expectations held for the Head Nurse across groups? Are there differences between expectations of nurses and doctors for the Head Nurse, and Head Nurse perceptions of expectations of nurses and doctors? Factor analysis was performed on responses of Head Nurses, nurses, and doctors separately. Expectations within groups were determined by frequencies, means, and standard deviations. Differences in expectations between groups were tested by chi-squares. Conceptualizations of the Head Nurse as manager, clinician, patient care co-ordinator, and teacher were supported. Five factors, identified as doctor's helper, clinical leader, communication link, determiner of quality of care, and manager, accounted for 67 to 82% of variance in all groups. All groups agreed that the Head Nurse should be a determiner of quality of care given. Significant differences in expectations between groups were found in regard to the Head Nurse as doctor's helper, and clinical leader, and in regard to other activities related to patients, staff, and the unit. Head Nurses tended to overestimate nurse expectations for the Head Nurse, and underestimate doctor expectations for the Head Nurse.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rh80c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53ww61d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hospitals -- Employees</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nurse administrators</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nursing -- Research</dc:subject><dc:subject>Role expectation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apn89d7270"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Taxonomic revision of the Permo-Carboniferous lepospondyl amphibian families Lysorophidae and Molgophidae</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wellstead, Carl F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Lysorophia is an order of small, but extremely elongate and tiny-limbed aquatic lepospondyl amphibians existing from the Middle Pennsylvanian through the Lower Permian, primarily in North America. The order comprises one family, Cocytinidae, with three recognized species: Brachydectes newberryi (=Cocytinus gyrinoides), B. elongatus (=Lysorophus tricarinatus, partim) and Pleuroptyx clavatus. Other named species are considered Lysorophia, incertae sedis. Lysorophoids are distinguished by their fenestrated skulls, anteriorly sloping suspensoria, short mandibles (each bearing a lateral mandibular fenestra) and by extensive, well-ossified hyobranchial skeletons. Presacral vertebrae are holospondylous and number between 69 (B. newberryi) and 97 (B. elongatus). Neural arch halves are sutured at their midlines and to their centra. Aspects of lysorophoid anatomy, including the hyobranchial skeleton, suggest that the lysorophoids are neotenic. While closely similar to one another, lysorophoid species are highly derived relative to other Paleozoic amphibians. They are most closely related to microsaurs, principally through the morphology of the craniovertebral articulation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qc97p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d7270</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Paleontology -- North america</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amphibians, Fossil -- Classification</dc:subject><dc:subject>Molgophidae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lysorophidae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Paleontology -- Permian</dc:subject><dc:subject>Paleontology -- Carboniferous</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fp70n"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Etude de l'immunosuppression conséquente à la réaction du greffon contre l'hôte induite par une différence au niveau d'un seul ou de quelques antigènes mineurs d'histocompatibilite</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brousseau, Pauline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bone marrow transplantations frequently result in a graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) even when donors and recipients are HLA matched. In the present work with mice, an experimental protocol was designed to verify whether or not a GVHR ensuing immunosuppression can occur even in the absence of a difference at the level of the major histocompatibility antigens. Injection of lymphoid cells from donors histoincompatible with recipients at the level of one or multiple minor antigens induced a GVHR resulting in a marked decrease of humoral response of the recipients, and also a lack of ability of their lymphocytes to respond to mitogens. This immunosuppression was associated with the presence of suppressor cells in the spleen of these animals. Furthermore histopathological studies demonstrated that the thymuses from animals experiencing a late GVHR induced across multiple minor histocompatibility antigens, showed signs of dysplasia.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x473q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp70n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kb54n"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The neuroanatomical basis of the behavioral effects of amphetmine : an intracranial microinjection study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Carr, Geoffrey David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examined the contributions of different brain areas to several of the behavior effects of amphetamine. The drug was micro-injected into each of six discreet brain sites in rats and the effects on behavior were examined. Amphetamine's rewarding effects were studied using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Animals that had received injections into the nucleus accumbens showed a CPP, suggesting a rewarding effect of the drug. No effect was produced by injections into the medial frontal cortex, medial or lateral parts of the caudate nucleus, amygdala or the region around the area postrema. A conditioned taste aversion (CTA) towards a flavour that had been paired with the drug was produced by injections into the region around the area postrema, but not from the other sites. Anorexia and adipsia were both producted only by injections into the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. In the open field, increased activity was produced by intra-accumbens amphetamine injections, with smaller effects from the medial frontal cortex and medial caudate. Stereotyped behavior was not produced by any intra-cranial injection. The CPP, anorexia, adipsia and increase in activity that were produced by the intra-accumbens injections were interpreted as suggesting that the drug had stimulated approach behavior towards all stimuli, as if they had all become rewarding. The observation of a CPP from the accumbens and a CTA from the region around the area postrema suggests that the rewarding and apparently aversive effects of systemically injected amphetamine result from actions of the drug on different neuroanatomical substrates. Other hypotheses of the behavioral function of the neural substrates of the observed effects are presented.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st390.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kb54n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Amphetamines -- Physiological effect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rats -- Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain -- Localization of functions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rats -- Behavior</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vr66n"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of the snowpack and snowmelt runoff in the nutrient budget of a subarctic ecosystem</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>English, Michael Crawford</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines the impact of snowmelt runoff on nutrient transfer from the terrestrial to the aquatic (lake) portion of a subarctic catchment 6 km WSW from Schefferville, Quebec. Statistically significant differences in snow chemistry were recorded among the tundra, woodland and forest snowpacks. Significant overland substantial scouring of nutrients from the organic horizons were recorded in the tundra, woodland and forest. A calculation designed to generate, on a daily basis, 70% of the meltwater from the terrestrial catchment to the lake indicates overland flow is a predominant route of meltwater during the spring. This calculation made possible the determination of daily nutrient mass transfer from land to lake. The daily nutrient mass balance of input and output to Elizabeth Lake during springmelt indicates significant retention of land source nutrients. Deuterium/hydrogen measurements aided in determining mixing of snowmelt and lake water. The data indicate snowmelt water is undistinguishable from lake water at depths greater than 1.0 m. It is concluded that snowmelt runoff is an important event for nutrient transfer from terrestrial to aquatic systems in this environment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60cx09v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vr66n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Taiga ecology -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lake ecology -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville</dc:subject><dc:subject>Snow -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville -- Measurement</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tundra ecology -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602148h"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Optimization and enhancement strategies for data flow systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dunkelman, Laurence William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The data flow machine, which represents a radical departure from the conventional von Neumann architecture, shows great potential as a candidate for the future generation of computers. The difficulty in the usage of data structures as well as the effective exploitation of parallelism are two issues which have not as yet been fully resolved within the framework of the data flow model. This thesis concentrates on these important problems in the following manner. Firstly, the role memory can play in a data flow system is examined. A new concept called "active memory" is introduced together with various new actors. It is shown that these enhancements make it possible to implement a limited form of shared memory which readily supports the use of data structures. Secondly, execution performance of data flow programs is examined in the context of conditional statements. Transformations applied to the data flow graph are presented which increase the degree of parallelism. Analysis, both theoretical and empirical, is performed, showing that substantial improvements are obtained with a minimal impact on other system components.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4305541.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602148h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Data structures (Computer science)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Parallel processing (Electronic computers)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multiprocessors</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3n203z903"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Experiments with subsurface irrigation and drainage on a sandy soil in Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Memon, Nisar Ahmed</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Field experiments were conducted on St-Samuel sandy loam soil in 1982 and 1983, with eight replicates of irrigated and non-irrigated maize plots. Soil moisture regime, root density and maize yields were determined to demonstrate the effect of subsurface irrigation and drainage systems. Laboratory experiments were conducted on large and small undisturbed soil cores to determine pertinent soil properties, relating drainable volume and steady upward flux to water table depth. A water balance model was developed and used with a stress-day-index to predict water table depth, excessive and deficit soil moisture conditions and effects on corn yield. Economic analyses were made to identify subsurface irrigation/drainage designs which optimize the profit for a corn crop. A simple method based on first and second order moments was proposed to determine the effects of parameter uncertainty in the relationship of steady upward flux vs water table depth on subsurface irrigation/drainage design parameters. Based on the above information, a realistic subsurface irrigation/drainage design was proposed and operational recommendations were made for an example field.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472x17v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n203z903</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Subirrigation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Subsurface drainage -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sandy soils -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881m77z"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the physiological and pharmacological aspects of the lower urinary tract in normal and following spinal lesion</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hassouna, Magdy M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The mechanisms implicated in voiding and continence are far from being settled in the normal as well as in neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Understanding these mechanisms is an essential step in the management of the bladder dysfunction secondary to neurological lesions. In the course of our studies, we demonstrated the existence of a fine coordination "synergism" between the several components of the lower urinary tract i.e., detrusor, proximal urethral muscle and periurethral striated muscles. This synergism is found to be responsible for adequate bladder emptying during voiding in the animal model with intact neural axis. The synergism between the bladder and its outlet is under the control of a higher centre in the brain stem and mediated through the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. The cause of failure of bladder emptying following a spinal lesion was shown to be a lack of synergism between the bladder and its outlet. An animal model for chronic multiple sclerosis-like disease was developed and proved to show a good urodynamic and neurological correlation with that found in the human afflicted with multiple sclerosis. The pharmacological investigation on the bladder and urethra shows that there is selective distribution of cholinergic, adrenergic and purinergic receptors along the individual layers of the smooth muscles of the urethra. On the other hand, the importance of the Calcium ions in the contractility of the detrusor muscle was also studied. The effect of some Calcium ions antagonists on the detrusor contractility was evaluated. They show selective inhibition on the detrusor contraction both in vivo and in vitro. The calcium antagonists may present a new treatment modality for controlling bladder instability.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247ds851.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881m77z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wq96r"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The dramaturgy of John Arden : dialectical vision and popular tradition : a doctoral dissertation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Malick, Shah Jaweedul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The subject of this dissertation is John Arden's dramaturgy. It covers the stage plays written by Arden (alone or with Margaretta D'Arcy) during their career in the "professional" theatre--that is, from The Waters of Babylon to and including The Island of the Mighty. It approaches them as one dramaturgically coherent opus and identifies and examines the basic artistic and cognitive emphases immanent to it. The study explores two fundamental and related constitutive features of Arden's dramaturgy: diachronically, its adherence to the forms, conventions, and techniques of popular or traditional theatres, and synchronically, its radical political emphasis as expressed in a categorically plebeian and collectivistic bias. It begins by situating Arden in his time and his tradition, and then discusses how other significant choices of his--the emphasis on story-telling (Part 2), the supra-individual approach to dramaturgic agents (Part 3), and his ludic theatricality (Part 4)--flow out of and contribute to the consistency of his dramaturgy. Part 5 focuses on a detailed analysis of The Island of the Mighty. Arden's rejection of the established bourgeois theatre with its illusionist character and individualist ideology and his orientation towards a dialectical show distinguishes his work from that of his English contemporaries. It can be linked to that radical alternative tradition in modern dramaturgy which culminates in Bertolt Brecht.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xv797.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wq96r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drama -- Technique</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arden, John -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
