Lignin, which constitutes 20-30 % of the dry weight of plants, is formed of phenolic polymers. Phenolic compounds appear to be metabolically inert substances and are considered to be stable and characteristic end products in living plant tissues. No general function can be ascribed to these compounds and no explanation bas been given to their extraordinary diversity.

M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is axiomatic that taken together the works of Geoffrey Chaucer (1343? -- 1400) constitute the first sustained effort toward realism in fictional characterization found in English literature. This thesis examines the process whereby realism evolved in Chaucer's work and particularly the stylistic devices by which it was secured. In order better to understand Chaucer's contribution, we may briefly outline the obvious standards by which realm in characterization has come to be judged since his time.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hemlow, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z709131d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dt074</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz806368q"><ual:graduationDate>1960</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the suitability of some Newfoundland marine products in mink nutrition</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Friend, Douglas.

Until required for feeding, all the marine products were stored frozen. Chemical examinations of the frozen feeds for keeping quality over a prolonged period of time, demonstrated that storage conditions were adequate and that the levels of vitamin E remained remarkably constant.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Crampton, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f723r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806368q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nutrition</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz8063690"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Patterns of values among college women</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fitz-Gerald, Frances. L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research to be reported was concerned with the patterns of values among college women in a Canadian university. Through the study of a matched sample of freshmen and seniors, three interrelated problems were investigated: age differences in patterns of values, differences between usual and ideal patterns of values, and the relationships between patterns of values and behaviour. A study of the relevant literature reveals the patterns of values do charge during the four years of college, as well as after the college years, and that differences between usual and ideal patterns of values have been reported.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Douglas, V.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445ch86f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz8063690</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xw618"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agriculture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Investigation of the effects of fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorous on the yield and composition of the corn plant</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Findlay, Wallace. I.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Investigation in 1953 (M.Sc. thesis) showed that fertilization with 76 pounds of nitrogen and 72 pounds of phosphate per acre, in addition to a maintenance application of 600 pounds of a 4-12-6 fertilizer, increased the nitrogen and phosphorus percentages in the corn leaf at the flowering stage. The levels of these leaf constituents and the yields at harvest were closely correlated, confirming the idea that chemical analysis of the plant at this stage of growth was a useful diagnostic tool. It was also shown that nitrogen, rather than phosphorus, was a major factor in modifying these plant characteristics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DeLong, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kp26q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xw618</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agronomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
