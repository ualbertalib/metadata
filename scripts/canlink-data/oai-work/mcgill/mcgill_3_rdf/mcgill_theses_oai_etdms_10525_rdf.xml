Cette dissertation porte sur la décision de la politique étrangère sur le conflit prolongé. La question centrale est: qu’est-ce qui crée, prolonge, et termine un tel conflit? Le conflit Coréen, 1948-1993, est une étude d’un tel cas. Cette étude présente les arguments qui tous deux: l’intérêt national et l’identité sont des sources de conflit prolongé, ainsi que les trois facteurs importants dans 1’ affectation du conflit prolongé, c’est-à-dire: les preneurs de decision, la perception négative des adversaires; les commentaires institutionels des états impliqués entre eux; et les stratégies partielles préconçues. Les crises internationales, incluant la guerre, les rares succès sont des comportements dans un conflit prolongé. Le partage des valeurs, les intérêts complémentaires augmentés, et une menace diminueé de l’identité nationale ce qui peut mettre fin au conflit prolongé.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Although there are many studies on long-term conflict, e.g., ‘Enduring Rivalry Theory’ and ‘Protracted Conflict Theory’ , the literature suffers from neglect of the decisional dimension in such a conflict. This dissertation is on foreign policy decision-making in protracted conflict. The core question is: what creates, prolongs, and terminates such conflict? The Korean conflict, 1948-1993, is studied as a case. This study presents the argument that both national interest and identity are sources of protracted conflict, and that three factors are especially important in affecting the development of a protracted conflict, namely: decision-makers’ negative perceptions of their adversaries; institutionalized commitments of involved states against each other; and biased coping strategies. International crises, including war, and rare accommodation successes are behavioral patterns in a protracted conflict. Value-sharing, increased complementary interests, and a diminished threat to national identity may terminate protracted conflict.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brecher, Michael</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193c960.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719q30s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Korea -- Foreign relations -- 1945-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Sciences, Political Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Korean War, 1950-1953 -- Diplomatic history</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax346d730m"><ual:graduationDate>1975</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Distribution of anticonvulsant drugs in human epileptogenic brain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sokolowski-Harvey, Christine D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin were measured concurrently in cerebral tissue and plasma during neurosurgical therapy of epilepsy.

From pH 6.5-11, hydroxamate was found to chemisorb as malachite with a high specificity for copper. Below pH 6.5, the hydroxamate reacted with cupric and bicarbonate ions in solution to form a nonadherent copper octyl hydroxamate precipitate. Both adsorption and precipitation can be explained in terms of the malachite equilibrium solubility diagram, hydroxamine acid dissociation and electrical double laver theory. Malachite floated from pH 5 to 11 except at high collector concentrations where the upper pH limit appears to increase. Maximum floatability (99%) occurs between pH 6.5 to 10, this correlates with the solubility diagram and adsorption.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Salman, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv9356013.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dz43z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920g089k"><ual:graduationDate>1975</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of elemental diet on pancreatic secretion</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Echave, Vincent</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In order to study the exocrine secretion of the pancreas in response to the feeding of an elemental diet chronic pancreatic fistulas were made, in eight mongrel dogs, by cannulating the main pancreatic duct.

No change was found in the concentrations of amylase, lipase, trypsinogen or protein per, unit volume of juice on either diet. However a 60 percent reduction in the total volume of flow occurred after elemental diet feeding, resulting in an overall reduction in the total amount of enzymes secreted. The elemental diet has been shown to reduce gastric acid secretion, and this may affect the intestinal phase of pancreatic secretion, thus altering both total volume and enzyme output by the pancreas.

While rabbit anti-RSL sera was shown to stimulate increased uridine and thymidine incorporation, no effect on the AC system was observed. Freshly collected AS also did not affect AO activity although it stimulated thymidine incorporation in parallel cultures. In the MLR, on the other hand, an increased uridine and thymidine incorporation occurred in cultures which also showed an elevated intracellular cAMP level and AC activity. It is therefore concluded that the MLRs tested here proceed through the mediation of cAMP and does not involve the prior release of Ab.

Dexamethasone was removed from the tissue by conventional fixation and dehydration procedures and special techniques were needed for a study of its localization. The lung tissue was processed before the application of the emulsion with the following techniques: I. Freeze-dried tissue, paraformaldehyde vapor fixed and embedded in Epon. II. Freeze-dried tissue, paraformaldehyde vapor fixed and embedded in paraffin. III. Freeze-dried frozen sections. A large diffusion artifact was found with method I. The other methods showed dexamethasone localized in both the alveolar lining cells and in the stromal cells of the lung. A selective concentration of dexamethasone in a particular cell type was not seen. On the subcellular level, dexamethasone was concentrated over the cytoplasm and to a higher degree over the nuclei of the fetal lung cells. The validity and the difficulties of each, technique are discussed as well as new improvements in dry mount radioautography and in the preparation of freeze dried frozen sections. The mechanism by which glucocorticoids might influence the development of the fetal lung are also discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>More, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920g090b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mf952</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pd731"><ual:graduationDate>1975</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The pathophysiology of allergic bronchoconstriction in conscious guinea pigs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Michoud, Marie-Claire</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pulmonary resistance was measured in conscious, spontaneously breathing guinea pigs sensitized to horseradish peroxidase before and during 2 aerosolized challenges with this antigen.

The results showed that almost all leukocytes adhered to plastics in protein-free buffers, but cell adhesion was hindered in buffers containing plastic proteins. Dialyzed and heat-inactivated plasma, but not serum, were shown to inhibit leukocyte adhesion more than normal plasma. EDTA, Ca ++ - Mg ++ - free buffer or EDTA-pre-incubated leukocytes caused increased inhibition of leukocyte adhesion in the presence of plasma and some plasma proteins, but not others.

Previously reported decreases of phagocytosis after irradiation appear to he caused by the absence of intensively phagocytosing mononuclear cells rather than by a general inhibition of phagocytosing function.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macklem, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806315p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tz18c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395wb580"><ual:graduationDate>1975</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Intra-arterial vasopressin infusion: effect on normal and protected porcine gastric mucosa</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dutton, J. W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recently intra-arterial vasopressin infusion has been clinically utilized in an attempt to control massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from stress erosions, esophageal varices and numerous other splanchnic sources. Previous experimental work however, has indicated that vasopressin alone, or in concert with other forms of stress, may result in gastric mucosal damage and resultant hemorrhage. This study was designed to evaluate the incidence and severity of vasopressin induced gastric erosions and to determine if manipulation of intraluminal factors prior to vasopressin infusion could alter the degree of gastric mucosal damage. The incidence and severity of gastric erosions in 35 piglets subjected to laparotomy and coeliac axis infusion of saline or vasopressin was studie4 by gastroscopic, gross and microscopic techniques. The results of these experiments indicate that intra-arterial coeliac vasopressin infusion is harmful to normal porcine gastric mucosa. The degrees of mucosal damage can be significantly decreased by prophylactic administration of cholestyramine and hypertonic glucose prior to vasopressin infusion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chiu, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf268834k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395wb580</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225f23h"><ual:graduationDate>1975</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of the “late” electromyographic response to muscle stretch in man: is there a contribution by muscle afferents via long-loop pathway?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chan, Christina W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examined the neurophysiological origin of the "late" electromyographic response to sustained stretch in man, termed the "Functional Stretch Reflex". 1. The central conduction time for the FSR was found to increase with descending spinal level of muscle innervation, being 32.1, 47.2, and 73.1 msec resoectively for the biceps, quadriceps and gastrocnemius. This result therefore favours the view that a long-loop pathway contributes to the FSR. 2. No significant change of FSR latency was found with blockage of cutaneous and joint afferent impulses. Furthermore, the voluntary responses to jolt and auditory stimuli were both of significantly longer latency than that of the FSR (p &lt; 0.001). It appears, therefore, that the early component of the FSR originates predominantly from muscle afferents. 3. The FSR latency was found to be closely correlated with the amplitude of stretch and initial muscle torque. However, no strong correlation with angular velocity of joint movement was found.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Melvill, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dq30j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225f23h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6d570075k"><ual:graduationDate>1974</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Status inconsistency, cross-pressures and separatism: the Quebec case</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Carron, Christine A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Status inconsistency in this thesis is conceptualized as, a subset of cross-pressures, and as such, Lenski's theory of status inconsistency and Lipset’s theory of cross-pressures make contradictory predictions. While the former predicts that status inconsistents will support social change, the latter predicts that they will become politically apathetic. Each of these theories is tested along with certain modifications in order to resolve this contradiction. The results of the study show that status discrepancy is not related to support for social change (whether measured by vote for the Parti Quebecois or attitudinal support for separatism) as the Lenski hypothesis suggests, nor is it related to political apathy (measured by nonvoting) as the Lipset hypothesis suggests. Tests of the social-psychological model underlying the two theories reveal that while there is no relationship between discrepancy and stress or stress and political apathy, there is a relationship between stress and support for social change.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Carroll, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g807x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d570075k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sociology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225f24s"><ual:graduationDate>1974</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Makra: a translation and critical introduction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Barna, Laszlo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis is in two parts. The major part is a translation of the contemporary Hungarian play, Makra, written by Akos Kertesz. The translation is faithful to the original Hungarian and attempts to preserve the idiom of the play. However, wherever a choice had to be made, dramatic clarity and effect was favored over a literal or strict rendering of the Hungarian. There is also a critical introduction which has a twofold purpose. It provides the Western reader with some literary and social background that is necessary for a full comprehension of the play. Another function is to demonstrate that the play portrays a society, and particularly a working class, in conflict between old bourgeois ethics and new socialist ideals. The essay questions the validity of Hungarian literary criticism and suggests that the critics mystify and generalize the issues of the play in order to detract from the play’s crucial message.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t240v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225f24s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n4124"><ual:graduationDate>1974</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Meteorological aspects of radar depolarization at 16.5 GHz</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Anderson, Robert S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Radar polarization measurements of precipitation at 16.5 GHz are analyzed with reference to the ambient temperature profile of the atmosphere. The measured quantities are the reflectivity, the ratio of the main and cross-polarized signal powers, called the cancellation, and the correlation between these two signals. Polarization observations of the bright band are discussed. It is suggested that correlation gives an indication of the relative number of water drops in the scattering ensemble. From the characteristics of correlation and cancellation observations it is inferred that small snowflakes melt first with the result that radar returns are dominated by large water-covered snow aggregates at levels just below the reflectivity peak in the bright band. Correlation measurements are used to infer possible precipitation types at various altitudes in convective precipitation.

Many methods have been suggested for assigning ranks to tied observations in such problems. In this thesis we review and discuss these methods with regards to their relative merits under different situations. The recent extension of the asymptotic theory of rank statistics from continuous to discontinuous distributions has made it possible to calculate the Asymptotic Relative Efficiency (ARE) of different methods of handling ties. A comparison, based on ARE, among the three main methods of handling ties, namely, the average scores, midranks and randomized ranks methods, has been discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mehra, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pt708.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010t14s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A44558h313"><ual:graduationDate>1974</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Technique and the dynamics of social change in the political thought of Jacques Ellul</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>de Wilde, James</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ellul's conception of the technological society has specific implications for problems of democratic theory and the analysis of the forces of social change in the modern world. The technological order leads to standardization, a preoccupation with means that destroys the basis of ethics, and a tendency to use technical (i.e. scientific solutions), for all problems. Ellul does not explore the historical circumstances of the origin of the technological society. Nor does he examine possible alternative currents in modern thought which could be used in the formulation of a democratic theory which would incorporate planning in a different manner. His failure to distinguish between instrumentality, (as a capacity to plan, to innovate) and technique severely limits his theory.
