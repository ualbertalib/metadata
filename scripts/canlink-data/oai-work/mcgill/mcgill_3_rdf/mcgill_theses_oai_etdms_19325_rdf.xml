Thus, advances in our understanding of genetic mechanisms have already been made through studies of enzymatic adaptation. It has been predicted that further knowledge of enzymatic adaptation will throw light on some of the mechanisms of cellular differentiation in animal tissues.

Top-root ratios of O.A.C. 21 were lower and root weight relatively greater under normal winter daylengths than under 16-hour photoperiods. Correlations between maturity and root weight, and maturity and root number, of seventeen barley varieties were significant. Top-root ratios were not correlated with maturity but appeared to be associated with the relative moisture requirements of different varieties. Variation within varieties was such that only large differences between varieties were significant.

The importance attached to this problem is evident from the vigorous current attempts to set up international standards; from the number of organizations, governmental and private, engaged in instrumenting and perfecting textile tests; and from the demands of consumer groups for reliable information on the cloth they buy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Common R.

Other sources have been animal experimentation, and clinical cases of tumor or abscess, and accidental injury. In all of these cases the evidence has been difficult to interpret. In some respects, certainly, the evidence provided by lobotomy may be even harder to interpret, and it is not likely that it will lead immediately to the solution of a difficult problem - the localization of function in the frontal lobes - but the operation provides new and important data to put beside what has been learned from other sources. It originated with the experimental work of Jacobsen, who demonstrated an alteration in the emotional behavior of chimpanzee following ablation of the frontal areas, and this led Egas Moniz to the hypothesis that patients with mental illness would be benefited by the division of the fibers from the thalamus to the frontal lobes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jw140.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hh294</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject/></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pr81n"><ual:graduationDate>1952</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>theInfluence of Benzimidazole on the Metabolism of Tissue Preparations of the Rat</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hosein, Esau Abbas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In previous studies on benzimidazole (1), the chemistry and pharmacology of the compound were presented.

The asbestos has been obtained either from a large mass of partly serpentinized peridotite, thought to be laccolithic in shape, or from a narrow body of serpentinized peridotite that parallels the structural trend of the area, known as the Pennington Dyke. The mines and open pit workings of the larger mass have always encountered light-coloured holocrystalline dykes which vary in composition from a diorite to a quartzitic vein, but which are always referred to by the miners and mine operators as "granite". Small deposits of chromite are found in the same mass, associated with an olivine-rich phase of the peridotite. Here again, "granite" dykes are encountered, although not as extensively as in the asbestos workings. The object of this thesis is, by the study of published reports on these acidic intrusives and with the help of some original studies, to report on their petrographic character and their distribution, and draw conclusions as to their age, origin, and economic importance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stevenson, J.

Heraclitus, Plato, Leibnitz, Schopenhauer, and Eddington are only a few of the thinkers whose speculations have been intimately concerned with the problem of time. For Kant, all experience involves time as an a priori necessity.
