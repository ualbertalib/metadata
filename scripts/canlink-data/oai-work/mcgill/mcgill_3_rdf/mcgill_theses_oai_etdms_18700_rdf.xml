An ambiguous traditional ideology promoted supportive interpersonal relations through objective rules, isolating the individual behind tight boundaries, subordinating him to community discipline. Revivalism, however, introduced an alternative early in the 1900's-salvation through individual piety, not community ru1es-and opened boundaries. By the 1950's, prosperity and farm mechanization led to increasingly modernized outside contact for individuals, through wage labour and consumer purchases. Anomalous under traditional ideology, these experiences supported the revivalist ideal, and led to its eventual domination. Kuhn explains transformation through the interaction of scientific theory and independent phenomena; we show how new individualized experiences arising when ideological debate opened boundaries resolved questions about the validity of competing ideologies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Arcand, Bernard</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nq32z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vm95c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ontario -- Social conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amish -- Ontario -- Social conditions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb397d249"><ual:graduationDate>1955</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Spontaneous ignition measurements of some gaseous fuels injected into a hot air stream</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dodis, Nicholas.

Operations for the removal of cataracts are often complicated by visual hallucinations or delirium. A lesion in the visual pathways which immediately impairs only a portion of the field of vision may produce mild hallucinations with altered functioning or the intact visual areas. These disorders have a common feature, namely, that the central nervous system is being deprived of a former source of the normal and varying patterns of stimulation from the environment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hebb, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3336337.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26z2031</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4q77fw589"><ual:graduationDate>1955</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Measurement of fluctuations in radar echoes from snow</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dennis, Arnett. S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The radar signal from precipitation fluctuates from pulse to pulse because of relative motions of the precipitation particles. Pulse by pulse records of the signal received from snow at a vertical-pointing radar have been obtained. The records have been analyzed to give the autocorrelation coefficient, p (t), as a function of time; p (t) was found to decrease from 1.0 to 0.5 in from 2 to 15 milliseconds. By means of the Wiener - Khintchine Theorem, the rate of decrease of p (t) has been related to the total effect of sedimentation and turbulence upon the snowflakes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hitschfeld, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hh20n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fw589</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gx69n"><ual:graduationDate>1955</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Literature</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Charles Kingsley’s conception and treatment of history in his historical novels: ‘Hypatia’, ‘Westward Ho!’, and ‘Hereward the Wake’.</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dedering, Christa. E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In our time Charles Kingsley is considered hardly more than a demode novelist and an author of children's books. He himself believed that only his poetry and, perhaps, ‘Hypatia’ would survive, but time has decided differently. His poems are now largely forgotten and his social novels retain an attraction or interest mainly for the student of sociology. But ‘Westward Ho!’ and ‘Hypatia’ are as fresh and lively to-day as they were almost a hundred years ago, although they are now considered books for children rather than novels for the mature reader.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Beresford-Howe, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526h20p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gx69n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tq911"><ual:graduationDate>1955</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agriculture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Life history and importance of the clover root borer, Hylastinus obscurus (Marsham) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) in Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Deane, Burton.

E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The object of this work was to investigate the oxidation of methylated pyridine compounds by means of the mild oxidizing agent selenium dioxide. From previous publications it had been verified that methyl groups adjacent to activating groups, such as tertiary nitrogens in heterocyclic rings or amino groups in general, are capable of undergoing oxidation with selenium dioxide to the corresponding carbonyl or carboxylic group. Although work had been previously carried out on mono-methylpyridines the results obtained seemed to be unreliable. Therefore it was first decided to reinvestigate their oxidation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taurins, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g6481.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2677061b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2f75rc93f"><ual:graduationDate>1955</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The temperature dependence of the work functions of the monovalent noble metals</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Crowell, Clarence. R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A theory to explain the temperature dependence of the work function of the monovalent metals has been developed assuming a free-electron approximation for the valence electrons, and a Debye model for the thermal vibrations of the ion cores. The theory predicts that the electrostatic effect of thermal vibrations is the chief contribution to the temperature coefficient of the work function, all other contributions being either negligible or cancelling. Agreement between theory and experiment was obtained from observations made on silver and copper films but not from less reliable measurements made on gold films. Measurements were taken over the temperature range 300°K to 800°K using a capacitive contact potential method.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Woonton, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85ng17g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75rc93f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
