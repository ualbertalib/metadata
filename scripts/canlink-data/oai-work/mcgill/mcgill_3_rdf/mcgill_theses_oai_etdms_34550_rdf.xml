Integral to my argument is a description of geneticisation (i.e., the redefinition of family problems as genetic in origin), grounded in a set of detailed case studies of the development and use of visual tools in genetic practices. In recent years, medical sociologists have tended to link geneticisation to medicalisation (i.e., the social control by doctors over patients accompanied by the translation of social problems into medical issues). I argue that the twin notions of geneticisation and medicalisation are problematic, insofar as they embody a simplistic and negative understanding of medical activities and they prevent a sociological inquiry into the technical content of genetic practices. Medical pedigrees are visual tools used to translate family problems into visual inscriptions, in order to show the genetic nature of a given disease. The use of medical pedigrees in genetic counselling and research rests on a chain of genetic practices including the inscription of family trees, the standardisation of medical pedigrees, the combination of specialised forms of medical pedigrees with other diagnostic inscriptions, and the circulation of published pedigrees. The analysis is based on a genealogical approach, as built on a combination of historical and ethnographic methods. The genealogical approach was applied to the analysis of a long network of genetic practices centred on Huntington's disease. The analysis spans over 120 years and compares two different international settings (North America and Japan). The thesis examines how lay support group members and family members collect family narratives, family inscriptions and family trees, which were first translated by genetic counsellors into various forms of medical pedigrees, and then circulated as educational material among lay and medical practitioners. On the basis of these case studies, the conclusion is reached that the notion of geneticisation should be understood as a specific process resulting from an emerging cooperative practice between medical practitioners and lay support group members, rather than as a process of medicalisation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cambrosio, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763869r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dr28g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Huntington Disease</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetic disorders -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetic disorders -- North America</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genealogy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap2676x38z"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Substrate bias assisted RF thermal plasma diamond deposition</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Oberste Berghaus, JÃ¼rg</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Polycrystalline diamond films are produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in a r.f.-induction thermal plasma system. A dc bias voltage between -400 V and +500 V is applied to the deposition substrate. This is made possible by maintaining the reactor environment at ground potential and introducing a high-impedance, high-power filter network, eliminating the r.f. voltage drop across the plasma-probe junction. The Ar, H2, CH4 plasma (8.45% H2, 0.21% CH4) impinges on a molybdenum substrate probe (5 mm in diameter) in stagnation point flow. The resulting diamond films are analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Raman Spectroscopy. The initial nucleation density is enhanced at negative bias voltage. However, this comes at the expense of degradation in crystalline quality. Positive voltage improves the quality and augments the film growth rate. A threefold increase in linear growth rate is attained at +500 V as compared to the unbiased case. The growing diamond film is used as an electrical and thermal probe. Electron emission currents from the developing diamond structures are exploited to monitor the film evolution during deposition. Diamond nucleation and growth stages are identified, and the bias voltage is varied in-situ to adjust to the changing growth requirements. A numerical simulation and optical emission spectroscopic measurements are used to characterize the plasma free stream as well as the boundary layer region between the plasma and the substrate. Current-voltage characteristics of the substrate are interpreted, and electrical probe theory is applied. It is shown that at negative bias the plasma-substrate interface is described by an expanding collision-dominated sheath imbedded inside the chemically reacting thermal boundary layer. Contrary to dc arcjet CVD, there is no secondary discharge created in the r.f. system at positive bias voltage. Also, the role of ion bombardment at negative bias is shown to be of little importance.

Employing the method of memory-work to engage in self-study, the author worked with three other women teachers and teacher educators, as she explored the relationship between the memories of former teachers and their influence on her life as a woman and teacher educator. Although there has been a great deal of interest in the significance of autobiography and life history approaches to narrative inquiry over the last decade, and a considerable acknowledgment and appreciation for how past experiences shape the present, the act of remembering, memory itself, has rarely been looked at within the context of narratives in teacher education. Thus, while teachers' anecdotes and stories have gained acceptance and recognition as valuable educational research tools, aspects of memory that make up, influence and ultimately shape the narratives have not been the subject of much discussion. In response, this study investigated how the remembering process shapes the memories themselves in terms of how and what is remembered and how those memories may be constructed. Through the careful consideration and reflection of the past, there lies the potential to understand more fully why and how we have come to be who we are. Further, within this reflection there lies the potential for change as we endeavor to become whom we wish to be. The study concludes with a discussion of research implications and recommendations for further research in the area of self-study and memory-work in pre-service and in-service teacher education.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, Claudia</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214q73p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bj847</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teachers -- In-service training</dc:subject><dc:subject>Recollection (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Memory</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903159k"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>English newsbooks and the Irish rebellion of 1641, 1641-1649</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>O'Hara, David A., 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The outbreak and continued progress of the Irish rebellion of 1641 played a significant role in the birth and development of domestic newsbooks in England between 1641--49. This thesis examines the manner in which these periodicals reported the insurrection to their readers. As relations between king and parliament deteriorated during the winter of 1641--42, the attention awarded to this uprising by these publications helped to ensure that Ireland became a popular concern. Weekly chronicles of Irish affairs continued unabated after the onset of civil war in England. Amid fears that Ireland could be utilized by Charles I in his struggle with Westminster, pro-parliamentary, and subsequently pro-royalist editors employed the rebellion as part of a propaganda war that accompanied armed conflict in all three Stuart kingdoms. Accordingly, this study suggests that a principle stratagem of the newsbooks was not necessarily to communicate news of Irish matters, but more often than not, their motivation lay in manipulating accounts relating to the rebellion in order to wage political combat in England.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perceval-Maxwell, Michael</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246t647.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903159k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ireland -- History -- Rebellion of 1641</dc:subject><dc:subject>Great Britain -- Politics and government -- 1642-1649</dc:subject><dc:subject>Great Britain -- History -- Charles I, 1625-1649</dc:subject><dc:subject>Press and politics -- Great Britain -- History -- 17th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2227mr56w"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Neurotrophin receptor studies with functional nerve growth factor mimetics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Maliartchouk, Serguei</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Polypeptide hormone Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of certain neuronal populations, both within the central and peripheral nervous systems. NGF receptors and the hormone itself have been attractive pharmacological targets in the treatment of several neuropathologies including Alzheimer Disease, ischemia, brain trauma, peripheral neuropathies, neurotoxicity associated with chemotherapy of cancer and chronic inflammatory pain. NGF and its receptors are also expressed in several non-neuronal tissues and participate in their regulation. In addition NGF can be a survival or differentiation factor for human malignancies of neuroectodermal origin. Accordingly, NGF mimetics can be developed as anti-cancer drugs and non-invasive diagnostic agents. Two structurally distinct transmembrane proteins TrkA and p75 NTR have been characterized as NGF receptors. Each co-receptor is capable of ligand binding and signal transduction, however binding characteristics, activation and signaling of each co-receptor depend on the expression and occupancy state of the other. Functional interactions between NGF receptors TrkA and p75NTR have been studied using activating anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as specific ligands that, unlike NGF, can discriminate between the co-receptors. It has been shown that unbound p75NTR S could attenuate TrkA activation and trophic signaling, while p75 NTR expression and binding with an activating ligand was necessary to achieve optimal trophic signals similar to that induced by NGF. Both negative and positive TrkA regulation occurred within the same cellular context. It has been also shown that the trophic signals of a polypeptide growth factor could be fully mimicked by a combination of two mAbs against its co-receptors. Different artificial ligands of TrkA have been tested in functional assays alone or in a paradigm of synergy with a selective ligand of p75NTR . The studied TrkA ligands included Fab fragments of an anti-TrkA monoclonal antibody, small cyclic peptides derived from an NGF beta-turn region, and small molecule compounds selected from a focused beta-turn peptidomimetic library based on the pharmacophores of the anti-TrkA mAb and NGF peptide analogs. In contrast to NGF, all these three classes of NGF mimetics are monomeric, monovalent and can bind only a single defined epitope of the receptor. We have found that, despite of their fundamental differences from the natural ligand, these mimetic could induce agonistic responses in neuronal cell lines and cultured primary neurons. These finding have considerable implications for the rational design and development of agonistic ligands of cell surface receptors with a single transmembrane region, particularly small molecule therapeutics with neurotrophic activity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Saragovi, H.

This dissertation describes a hybrid method of simulating diffusion based on both physical and phenomenological modeling components. In 1979, Manfred Schroeder described a method of designing and constructing diffusing surfaces based on a rather simple mathematical algorithm which provides diffused reflections in predictable frequency bands. This structural device, now known as a "Schroeder diffuser," has become a standard geometry used in constructing diffusive surfaces for spaces intended for music rehearsal, recording and performance. While it is possible to use DSP to model the characteristics of reflections off such a surface, a reflection model based exclusively on a surface constructed of a Schroeder diffuser has proven in informal tests to be as aesthetically inadequate as a perfectly specular model. Control of both the spatial and temporal envelopes of the diffusive reflection are required by an end user in order to tailor the reflection characteristics to the desired impression. In 1974 an empirical model for computing light reflections off objects in a three-dimensional environment was developed by Phong Bui-Toung. This algorithm incorporated both a specular and diffuse component with relationships controlled by an end user. This dissertation describes the adaptation and implementation of the Phong shading algorithm in conjunction with a physical model of components of the Schroeder diffuser for the modeling of diffuse reflections in synthetic acoustic environments. The inclusion of the Phong algorithm provides precise control over the balance between the spectral and diffusive components of the reflection. In addition, directivity functions for sound sources and receivers in the virtual space are described. Analysis and evaluation of the model using mathematical and empirical methodologies are discussed and stereo and multichannel audio examples produced by the system are included.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Depalle, Philippe</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Woszczyk, Wieslaw</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237ht43g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558f868</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sound -- Reverberation -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj6731557f"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cloning and characterization of a novel steroid hormone responsive gene</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marcantonio, Daniela</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Estrogen modulates growth and function of female reproductive tissues, such as uterus and mammary gland, by eliciting an array of biochemical responses and is linked to mammary carcinogenesis. To further understand the involvement of estrogens in complex physiological processes, we sought to increase the spectrum of genes regulated by estrogens. We cloned a novel 3.719 Kb cDNA from rat uterine tissue, termed steroid sensitive gene-1 (SSG1), encoding a nuclear protein of 386 amino acids and demonstrated that it is regulated by 17beta-estradiol in the uterus and mammary gland. In the rat uterus, SSG1 mRNA is down-regulated by 17beta-estradiol in time- and dose-dependent manners. In the mammary gland, chronic 17beta-estradiol treatment resulted in a significant accumulation of the SSG1 protein, which was dependent on the presence of elevated levels of 17beta-estradiol. SSG1 was consistently over-expressed in estrogen-dependent 7,12-dimethylben(a)anthracene-induced rat mammary tumors which may be a consequence of an altered hormonal environment. In rat and human mammary tissue, SSG1 protein was localized to the myoepithelial cells of the mammary ducts and to the smooth muscle cells of the vasculature. In human mammary tumors SSG1 was predominant in the epithelial compartment. In males, we demonstrate that SSG1 protein expression, immunolocalized to the prostatic smooth muscle cells and to the smooth muscle cells of the vasculature, is dependent on the presence of androgens. We conclude that SSG1 expression is regulated by steroid hormones in both female and male reproductive systems. We propose that SSG1 is a target for both estrogen and androgen modulation and that it may be implicated in estrogen functions related to mammary carcinogenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alaoui-Jamali, Moulay</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b496w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j6731557f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qn67s"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of the p75 neurotrophin receptor in sympathetic neuron development</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Majdan, Marta</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, I investigated the role of the p75 neurotrophin receptor in neurons using transgenic, knockout, and cell culture approaches. Transgenic mice overexpressing the intracellular domain (ICD) of the p75 receptor in neurons exhibit severe losses in sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and axotomized adult facial motor neurons. Cell losses are also observed in transgenic neocortex, which contains little or no endogenous p75 or TrkA expression. These results indicate that ectopic expression of the intracellular domain of the p75 receptor acts in a constitutively activated manner to cause neuronal apoptosis in vivo. Neuronal counts of developing sympathetic neurons reveal an increased number of neurons in p75-/- SCG, due to a dramatic reduction in apoptosis during the early post-natal period, which is accompanied by decreased levels of several pro-apoptotic proteins. In culture, specific activation of the p75 receptor with the neurotrophin BDNF results in dose-dependent apoptotic cell death, and cultured p75-/- sympathetic neurons show enhanced survival in the absence of NGF. In the neonatal TrkA-/- SCG, decreased or absent p75 expression leads to a rescue of the dramatic neuronal loss observed in the absence of TrkA, and culture experiments confirm that p75-/- neurons show enhanced survival in the absence of all Trk signaling, demonstrating that p75 mediates neuronal apoptosis by signaling independently of Trk receptors. Together, these results indicate that p75 independently signals apoptosis in sympathetic neurons during development and in culture, and suggest that a major function of TrkA signaling is to silence p75-mediated apoptotic cascade(s) during neuronal cell death in vivo and in vitro.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Miller, Freda</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q320t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qn67s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967529g"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Liability risk management for activities related to the launch of space objects : today's environment and tomorrow's prospects</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kayser, ValÃ©rie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Launch activities are increasingly performed by private entities and launch participants deal with a complex legal environment. The Space Treaties provide a framework placing liability for non-governmental activities on the launching State and the duty to authorize and supervise them on the appropriate State. Launch participants are subject to specific regulation in certain States or are under institutional State control in others. They also have to comply with general domestic law of liability. Limited insurance availability led to the development of contractual risk allocation techniques, the inter-participants waivers of liability and claims, inspired by NASA practice. This thesis offers a contribution with the synthesis of information, so far scattered, on today's legal environment, providing an overview of the norms at play in this field to allow the grasp of their relative weight and interactions in the assessment of liability risk attached to launch activities. This synthesis reveals a legal framework presently lacking the predictability necessary for an efficient liability risk management: (1) inter-participants waivers of liability suffer the weaknesses of all limitation of liability clauses; they also lack uniformity and implementation rigor; (2) the Space Treaties contain ambiguous terms preventing predictable determination of the State liable for damage and the State obliged to authorize and supervise launch activities, and do not reflect the de facto primary liability of launch operators. This thesis offers a contribution to the advancement of legal work on these problems by suggesting new approaches emphasizing the need for: (1) harmonization of inter-participants waivers of liability to improve their consistency and validity and ensure identical flow-down by all participants; (2) improvements of the Outer Space Treaty, Liability Convention and Registration Convention for their implementation to non-governmental launch activities. Although the launch community is small and the need for lawmaking is not as compelling as in fields such as aviation. Nevertheless, tailored adjustments to the present legal framework are required and proposed in this thesis through model clauses and an international instrument, both of which are submitted for further thinking and contribution by those sharing the opinion that creative lawmaking is now necessary to prepare for tomorrow's endeavors.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf2686808.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967529g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Risk management</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liability for space vehicle accidents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Launch vehicles (Astronautics) -- Law and legislation -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Launch vehicles (Astronautics) -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liability for space vehicle accidents -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xk29g"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Transmembrane signalling and transport in Escherichia coli : crystal structures of FhuA and liganded complexes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ferguson, Andrew D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Escherichia coli, FhuA, together with the energy-transducing TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex, mediates the uptake of hydroxamate-type siderophores across the outer membrane. In addition to transporting ferrichrome, FhuA functions as the primary receptor for several bacteriophages, antibiotics, and colicin M. To comprehend how FhuA binds its cognate ligands, and to establish the molecular basis of active transport, the three-dimensional structure must be determined. In pursuit of this goal, an affinity tag was inserted into the fhuA gene at a known surface-exposed location. The recombinant FhuA protein was overexpressed and purified by metal-chelate chromatography. Sparse matrix screening established parameters for the growth of well-ordered crystals of FhuA. The crystallographic structure of FhuA and its complex with ferricrocin were solved at 2.50 and 2.70 A by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion. The crystallographic structure reveals that FhuA is a monomeric integral outer membrane protein that is composed of two domains. The C-terminal domain, a 22-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel, spans the outer membrane. Positioned within the beta-barrel is the N-terminal 'cork' domain, which is formed by a mixed four-stranded beta-sheet with four interspersed alpha-helices. Upon binding of ferricrocin, conformational changes are propagated from the extracellular pocket to the periplasmic pocket of FhuA; a transmembrane signal indicating the liganded status of the receptor. Structural analysis combined with sequence homologies and mutagenesis data are used to propose a mechanism for TonB-dependent siderophore-mediated iron acquisition. Noncovalently associated with the membrane-embedded surface of FhuA is a single lipopolysaccharide molecule. Following the examination of electrostatic protein-lipid contacts, a structure-based algorithm revealed a conserved four-residue LPS-binding motif that is present among known LPS-binding proteins. An expansion of these structural studies was the solution of the crystallographic structures of additional liganded complexes. The three-dimensional structures of FhuA in complex with the antibiotics albomycin and rifamycin CGP 4832 were determined at 3.10 and 2.90 A, respectively. In addition to probing the plasticity and accessibility of the ligand-binding site, these results establish a structural platform for the design of novel antibiotics. Moreover, insights into the physical association of FhuA with TonB can be derived from these data.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ward, Brian J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193b573.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xk29g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apn89d8276"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Numerical studies on the motion of particles in current-carrying liquid metals and its application to LiMCA systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Mei, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A numerical model is developed concerning the motion of particles in current-carrying liquid metals in a cylindrical coordinate system. The fluid flow is obtained by solving Navier-Stokes equations, and particle trajectories by equations for the motion of particles which incorporate the drag, added mass, history, fluid acceleration and electromagnetic force, with correction factors for particle shape and orientation. Wall effects and the flow conditions in the entrance region are considered. Dimensionless numbers Re, RH, gamma, and k are introduced to represent the fluid velocity, electric current, particle density and particle size, respectively. Electromagnetic force squeezes non-conducting particles away from, while pushes more conductive particles towards the symmetric axis. In a cylindrical pipe or ESZ orifice, particles follow the fluid flow closely in the axial direction. In the radial direction, at low current, non-conductive particles move towards the central axis first and then to the sidewall, while at high current, directly to the wall because of the competition between the fluid acceleration and the electromagnetic force which increases with particle size, electric current, and distance from the central axis. Lighter and larger particles move faster towards the wall. The dominating increase in added mass over electromagnetic force on oblates than on prolates, the smaller drag force and the lower added mass on prolates, with their symmetric axes perpendicular to the transverse axis of the ESZ, move prolates faster towards the wall. In parabolic ESZ orifice, bubbles lead and heavier particles lag behind the fluid flow in the axial direction, and the transient time difference makes particle discrimination realizable.

Following macrophages interaction with pathogens, macrophages become activated and attempt to eliminate the invader. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is one of the most important activators of macrophage function. In macrophages IFN-gamma is promoting the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules and other proteins directly involved in the process of containing infection. The effect of the Nramp1, on macrophage function is investigated in this thesis. Nramp1 has been shown to determine the resistance or susceptibility of mice to infections with several intracellular microorganisms, including Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Although the precise mechanism of Nramp1 action is unknown, there are several well-established effects associated with the Nramp1. In general, it has been shown that macrophages derived from mice susceptible to infections with M. bovis BCG are less efficient in the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), TNF-alpha, and MHC-II antigens in response to IFN-gamma. Using macrophage cell lines derived from mice that are either resistant (B10R) or susceptible (B10S) to M. bovis BCG infection, we have demonstrated that lower levels of IFN-gamma-induced expression of MHC-II antigens is correlated with less efficient phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein in B10S macrophages compared to B10R macrophages. We have shown that low levels of MHC-II expression in B10S macrophages correlate with less efficient expression of CIITA (Class II Transactivator). We have observed that infection of macrophages with M. bovis BCG has an inhibitory effect on both CIITA and MHC-II expression in macrophages stimulated with IFN-gamma. We have also studied the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on MHC-II expression in macrophages. We have found that the inhibitory effect of LPS on CIITA gene transcription does not involve changes in the binding of STAT1 to CIITA promoter IV. We have also demonstrated that unlike M. bovis BCG, the inhibitory effect of LPS on MHC-II expression is mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). In addition, we have shown that inhibitory effects of both LPS and M. bovis BCG depend on the adaptor protein MyD88. We have also analyzed the regulation of IFN-gamma- or/and LPS-stimulated expression of TLR2 in macrophages. We have shown that regulation of TLR2 expression by IFN-gamma depends on TLR4 expression. We have also determined that the phenol extractable fraction present in the commercial preparations of endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria is able to synergize with IFN-gamma and activate TLR4-deficient macrophages. Overall, we believe that these studies significantly contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the process of macrophage activation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Radzioch, Danuta</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xn336.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kv54s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451k23q"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Field and laboratory studies on egg parasitoids of the tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris (P. de B.) (Hemiptera:Miridae) in southwestern Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Al-Ghamdi, Khalid M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>From 1991 to 1994 inclusively, a field and laboratory study was undertaken on egg parasitoids of the tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) to determine their potential in controlling their host. Five species were found to parasitize Lygus eggs in southwestern Quebec. They were three mymarids: Anaphes iole Girault, Polynema pratensiphagum (Walley), and Erythmelus miridiphagus Dozier (Mymaridae) and two scelionids: Telenomus nysivorus Huggert and Telenomus n.sp. (a new species near strelzovi Vasiliev) (Scelionidae). The maximum levels of field parasitism by these parasitoids were 20, 70, 35, and 70% (for both species of Telenomus), respectively. The field parasitism was determined on Lygus eggs inserted in Contender green beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L., Irish cobbler potatoes, Solanum tuberosum L., and alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. P. pratensiphagum and Telenomus were the most abundant parasitoid species recorded. In 1991 and 1992 the seasonal occurrences of these parasitoids were investigated in three different habitats: mixed weeds, alfalfa, and crown vetch, Coronilla varia L. In both years Telenomus n.sp. was the most numerous parasitoid in all three habitats throughout the season, and had a strong synchrony with L. lineolaris populations. The laboratory and field monitoring experiments on the overwintering of A. iole, P. pratensiphagum and E. miridiphagus indicated that the presence of an alternative host is essential for the overwintering of these parasitoids. The eggs of the alfalfa plant bug, Adelphocoris lineolatus (Geoze) were the most common overwintering host for all three mymarids and Canada fleabane, Erigeron canadensis L. sustained more Adelphocoris eggs and egg parasitoids than other weed hosts. In the laboratory the parasitoid survival, mortality, fecundity, and adult longevity were determined for P. pratensiphagum, A. iole and Telenomus n.sp. The females of all three species lived longer than males, but males emerged 24 hours before females, and all are solitary parasitoids. Telenomus n.sp. showed a higher rate of survival (93%) and a higher rate of parasitism (87%) than other species under laboratory conditions. For rearing L. lineolaris, potato sprouts, S. tuberosum were found to be the medium preferable to potato slices and Patana artificial diets. This medium is worthy of further investigation for use in augmenting the egg parasitoids of L. lineolaris.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stewart, Robin K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w681.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451k23q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mymaridae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tarnished plant bug -- Biological control -- QuÃ©bec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Asolcus</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247dt73f"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Scale of analysis and the influence of submerged macrophytes on lake processes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rooney, Neil</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this thesis was to examine submerged macrophoe biomass, distribution, and ecosystem effects at scales large enough to incorporate the littoral zone into models of whole lake structure and function. Submerged macrophyte biomass and distribution was shown to be highly variable between growing seasons and primarily dependant upon air temperature and the timing of the onset of the growing season. Within a growing season, a mass balance study showed an undisturbed macrophyte bed to markedly lower phytoplankton biomass: total phosphorus ratios, although the net effect of the bed on the growing season phosphorus budget was minimal. The weedbed preferentially retained phytoplankton biomass while being a source of bacterial production to the open water. These findings were mirrored at the among lake scale, as planktonic respiration and bacterial production were higher in macrophyte dominated lakes than would be expected based on phytoplankton biomass alone. Further, phytoplankton biomass was lower than would be expected based on epilimnetic phosphorus levels, showing that the classical view of pelagic interactions that proposes phosphorus determines phytoplankton abundance, which in turn determines bacterial abundance through the production of organic carbon, becomes less relevant as macrophyte cover increases. Long term phosphorus accumulation in the littoral zone was shown to be linked to macrophyte biomass, and on average almost an order of magnitude higher than calculated from the growing season (June--October) phosphorus budget, suggesting that the bulk of phosphorus accumulation in weedbeds occurs outside of the growing season. Finally, sediment core data showed that while submerged weedbeds accumulate up to four times as much bulk sediment compared to the profundal zone, phosphorus accumulation in weedbeds is much less than observed in the profundal zone.

DNA binding affinity and sequence selectivity is increased by the formation of cooperative complexes with PBX. PBX is a 430 amino acid protein that contains an atypical homeodomain which is a member of the three amino acid loop extension (TALE) class of homeodomains. The three amino acid loop extension of PBX is required for formation of cooperative complexes with HOX proteins, and contacts a conserved YPWM motif in the HOX partner. The amino acids immediately C-terminal to the PBX homeodomain increase the affinity of the homeodomain for its DNA site and HOX proteins. The structure, protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions of the PBX homeodomain and C-terminal extension were studied using NMR spectroscopy. Solution structures for the PBX homeodomain, a PBX homeodomain-DNA complex, and a ternary PBX-DNA-HOXA1-derived peptide complex were solved. The NMR structures explain the requirement of DNA for the PBX-HOX interaction, and the increased affinity of DNA binding in the presence of the C-terminal extension and HOX YPWM motif. The structure of the free PBX homeodomain demonstrates that an atypical homeodomain has the same fold as a typical homeodomain. Upon binding to DNA, the third alpha-helix of the PBX homeodomain lengthens, forming, with the three amino acid loop extension, a hydrophobic pocket. The HOX YPWM motif binds in this pocket. The HOX peptide itself shows some structure in solution. The interaction between PBX and HOX is therefore an example of "lock and key" binding. The lengthening of the third helix induces the formation of a fourth alpha-helix in the C-terminal extension. This stabilizes the structure of the homeodomain, accounting for the increase in affinity for DNA and the HOX YPWM motif. Both the PBX homeodomain and the extended PBX homeodomain make identical contacts with a 5'-TGAT-3 ' DNA site and a YPWM peptide. Variations in DNA sequence selectivity of heterodimeric PBX-HOX complexes depend on the HOX partner. However, a comparison of five different HOX-derived YPWM peptides showed that each bound to PBX in the same way, differing only in the strength of the association.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gehring, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fd436.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225c68f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ans064746t"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the quality control apparatus of glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pelletier, Marc-FranÃ§ois</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As nascent secretory and membrane proteins are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), they are maintained in folding and/or assembly competent states by molecular chaperones including the Hsp70 and Hsp90 homologues, BiP and GRP94, and the lectin-like chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). Folding is catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), its CNX (and CRT) associated homologue, ERp57, and protein prolyl isomerase (PPI). Moreover, N-linked glycoproteins benefit from a lectin-based "quality control apparatus" that ensures their correct folding or oligomeric assembly. Binding to these lectins occurs through oligosaccharide trimming from Glc 3Man9GlcNAc2 to the monoglucosylated form (Glc 1Man9GlcNAc2). Release and subsequent rebinding occurs though the hydrolysis and reglucosylation of the innermost glucose by glucosidase II and UDP-glucose glycoprotein:glucosyltransferase, respectively. This cyclical process, termed the "Calnexin Cycle", continues until their correct conformation is achieved. The cloning and characterization of human glucosidase II is reported here. cDNAs for two splice variants of the catalytic alpha subunit and the beta subunit were isolated. Expression of the beta subunit was shown to be required for enzymatic activity, solubility and/or stability, and ER retention of the enzyme. Detailed kinetic analysis on recombinant alpha1/beta and alpha2/beta isoforms, using p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside as a substrate, reveals that both exhibit kinetic profiles of a two binding site model, and share properties of catalysis and inhibition on this substrate. Moreover, similar rates of hydrolysis of the oligosaccharide substrates rules out the possibility that the two binding site kinetic model, first proposed by Alonso et al. (1999, Biochem J. 278:721--7), is the result of co-purified isoforms of glucosidase II that have different substrate specificities. Also, an ER protein two-hybrid system, based on Ire1p and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was developed to examine and map the interactions between CNX/CRT and ERp57. Ire1p fusions with CNX and CRT were shown to interact specifically with ERp57, and as expected, PDI did not. Through deletion analysis, new roles were assigned to the proline-rich loop domains of CNX and CRT, and the non-catalytic B thioredoxin domain of ERp57 in mediating their heterodimerization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thomas, David Y.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892c48r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns064746t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Endoplasmic reticulum</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protein folding</dc:subject><dc:subject>Glycoproteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Glucosidases</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avx021g89g"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Discrete and continuous models for production-distribution systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dasci, Abdullah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a series of integrated models for simultaneous optimization of location, capacity, product range, and production technology decisions in production-distribution systems. The interactions between these decisions can be significant. This thesis draws its motivation from these interactions. In order to benefit from the capital and/or employment subsidies, preferential tax rates, and free trade zones provided by governments, firms need to take the interdependencies between their location, capacity and technology decisions into account. These decisions could be further complicated due to varying scale and scope economies inherent in different production technologies. The models proposed in this thesis are based on two fundamentally different but equally central approaches. The first approach builds on traditionally popular integer programming formulation in facility location theory, in which two such models presented in this thesis. The first one assumes that there are a number of dedicated production technologies for each product whereas, the second one assumes that a set of flexible technologies is also present. Analytical properties of the models are described, which lead to the development of exact and heuristic solution procedures. Results of several sets of computational experiments are also reported. The second approach is based on continuous approximation (also known as continuum mechanics), which has not been used to its potential in the literature. The third model in this thesis is proposed for a system with single product. It is based on the use of continuous functions in representing spatial distribution of cost parameters and decision variables. In this model, the focus is to compute the service regions leaving the precise plant locations to a subsequent analysis. This model lends itself to closed form solutions and allows derivation of a number of insights on the impact of several cost factors on facility design decisions. Then, it is utilized in an analytical framework to analyze several plant focus decisions of firms in a multi-product environment. The closed form solution is used to analyze several product and market focus strategies, which have provided several insights into more sophisticated plant focus decisions and into the impact of different production technologies on these decisions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Verter, Vedat</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w0324672.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021g89g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physical distribution of goods -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Production management -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vj41n"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular basis for the role of GATA transcription factors in cardiomyocytes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Charron, FrÃ©dÃ©ric, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Members of the GATA family of transcription factors are evolutionary conserved DNA-binding proteins that play critical roles in cell differentiation. They share a highly conserved zinc finger domain responsible for specific binding to a consensus (A/T)GATA(A/G) sequence. Three GATA factors, GATA-4, GATA-5, and GATA-6, are expressed in the heart and two of them, GATA-4 and GATA-6, are coexpressed in cardiomyocytes. Given the early embryonic lethality of GATA-4 and GATA-6 null mice, their exact role in cardiomyocytes was unclear. The objective of my doctoral work was to elucidate the role of GATA-4 and GATA-6 in postnatal cardiomyocytes and the molecular basis for their specificity. Since the identification of GATA-4 and GATA-6 target genes would help to elucidate their functions, we inhibited GATA-4 and GATA-6 protein production in postnatal cardiomyocytes and assessed its effect on cardiac gene expression. The results demonstrated that GATA-4 and GATA-6 are required for the maintenance of cardiac gene expression. Importantly, the work showed that GATA-4 and GATA-6 differentially regulate target genes and that this specificity is due, at least in part, to their differential DNA-binding affinity. In addition to differential DNA-binding affinity, we showed that GATA factors also acquire specificity by differential interaction with cofactors, such as MEF2 and Nkx2-5. Thus, GATA factor specificity is achieved at three levels: differential spatio-temporal expression, differential DNA-binding affinity, and differential interaction with cofactors. The crucial role of GATA-4 and its cofactors in the regulation of contractile actin and myosin protein gene expression suggested that GATA-4 might regulate sarcomere formation. Indeed, we found that, similarly to RhoA GTPase, GATA-4 is essential for sarcomere formation in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we showed that RhoA acts upstream of GATA-4 and potentiates GATA-4 transcriptional activity. These results suggest that RhoA regulates the expression of sarcomeric proteins and sarcomere formation by inducing the transcriptional activity of GATA-4. Collectively, the work described in this thesis provides important information on the role, regulation, and mechanisms of specificity of GATA transcription factors in cardiomyocytes and in other cells where they are expressed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nemer, Mona</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tb08m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vj41n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322f97j"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Transcriptional regulatoin of the myelin basic protein gene in Schwann cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Forghani, Reza</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Myelination of large caliber axons is an essential step in the development of the vertebrate nervous system. In peripheral nerves, axons instruct ensheathing Schwann cells to elaborate and maintain myelin sheaths, and this is achieved in part through the coordinate up-regulation of genes encoding myelin structural proteins. In order to gain insight into the transcriptional regulation of one such gene, Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), I have investigated MBP 5 ' flanking sequence using a combination of sequence analysis, in vitro DNA-protein interaction assays, and functional analysis in transgenic mice including a high-resolution preparation in which a single copy of a reporter construct is inserted into the HPRT locus. These investigations have located a robust 0.6 kb S&amp;barbelow;chwann c&amp;barbelow;ell e&amp;barbelow;nhancer designated SCE1 that corresponds to a highly conserved human regulatory module. A method to prepare transcription factor containing Schwann cell nuclear extracts was developed and using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with such peripheral nerve extracts, multiple candidate regulatory elements were identified. SCE1 contains all the necessary elements for conferring reporter gene expression to myelinating Schwann cells in vivo and is composed of multiple functional sub-domains with independent targeting capabilities and one sub-domain that appears to positively modulate the level of expression. The 3 kb sequence immediately upstream of SCE1 also can target Schwann cell expression and there is indirect evidence for repressor activity in the proximal promoter that serves to limit expression to Schwann cells during embryonic development. In summary, these investigations demonstrate that the expression of MBP in Schwann cells is achieved through the integrated output of multiple interacting regulatory sequences and the techniques established during the course of these investigations will support future higher resolution in vivo studies of myelin gene r</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Peterson, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rj79t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322f97j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q572p"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular genetic studies of patients with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lopes-Cendes, Iscia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by symptoms and signs of degeneration in the cerebellum, spinal cord and brainstem. To date, ten different loci causing autosomal dominant SCA have been mapped. In six types of SCA the disease is caused by the expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat which codes for a polyglutamine tract at the protein level. The overall aim of this research project was to investigate various molecular genetic aspects of the autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias: (1) to assess genetic heterogeneity with linkage studies in suitable families and to study the origin of the MJD/SCA3 mutation by linkage disequilibrium analysis; (2) to determine the relative frequency of the different types of SCA-(CAG)n mutations in a large group of patients from different ethnic origins; (3) to investigate molecular and clinico-pathological correlations in SCA patients in whom mutations were found and; (4) to investigate whether polyglutamine expansions are present in other forms of SCA using a monoclonal antibody. Three large families segregating autosomal dominant SCA were tested for linkage to the SCA1, SCA2 and MJD/SCA3 loci by the maximum likelihood method. Two-point and multipoint linkage analysis showed that two families (SA and GK) were linked to the SCA2 locus. The third family (FC) was significantly excluded from the SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3/MJD loci. Additional markers were typed in the SCA2 candidate region in the two linked families. We were able to narrow down the SCA2 candidate region on ch12q and construct a fine genetic map of the region that provided important information for the positional cloning of the SCA2 gene. Linkage disequilibrium studies, using markers around the MJD/SCA3 gene found evidence of a founder effect in our MJD patients. However, distinct haplotypes were observed in patients originating from each of the two Azorean islands showing the highest disease prevalence; indicating that there are more than one founder mutation in the Azorean MJD population. We studied a large group of unrelated SCA patients in order to determine the frequency of the SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3 and DRPLA mutations.

Mutations in either the alpha (PCCA gene) or beta (PCCB gene) subunit of the enzyme have been shown to cause propionic acidemia. Mutation analysis of the PCCB gene have revealed several mutations. However, few PCCalpha mutations have been described. The first goal of this thesis was to determine the molecular etiology of alpha subunit deficiency at the mRNA as well as at the protein level. I found that most mutations destabilized either the mRNA or the protein. Two other mutations were found to affect the biotinylation of PCCalpha, defining residues important for the folding of the domain or for interaction with HCS. The second part of my thesis was to study in more details the interactions between HCS and the biotinylation domain of PCCalpha, represented by the last 67 amino acids of the subunit (p-67). I expressed and purified p-67 from Pichia pastoris. I compared p-67 with the E. coli biotinylation domain (BCCP87) as substrates for the E. coli orthologous enzyme BirA, using steady-state as well as stopped-flow kinetics. I noticed some differences between these two substrates and how it might relate to the biotinylation reaction. I generated N-terminal and C-terminal deletions of HCS and I tested their activity in vivo and in vitro using purified susbtrates. I was able to map the minimal sequence requirement for HCS activity to the last 348 amino acids of the enzyme. I also found that some longer HCS were either almost or totally inactive or some that were active showed a differential activity towards the different susb</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gravel, Roy</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698913r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k430w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Amino acids -- Metabolism -- Disorders -- Genetic aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ligases</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biotin</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wf47t"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Protein import into mitochondria : a study on hTom20</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Schleiff, Enrico</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Tom20 is a major receptor for protein translocation located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This protein is a member of a multicomponent complex and is found to stimulate import of all classes of preproteins. In here, the biochemical and biophysical characterization of the human homologue will be presented. A new binding method was developed in order to study the properties of the protein. The receptor contains two distinct domains for recognition of different classes of preproteins and both domains show different binding characteristics. The interaction with terminal targeting sequences has an electrostatic character and is initiated by formation of the amphiphilic alpha helix of the signal. The signal is recognized by the protein in a membrane bound state. The dissociation constant found for this process is in the muM range and is increased upon formation of the amphiphilic alpha-helix. Binding to internal targeting signals is mediated by hydrophobic interaction. Neither interaction is mediated by chaperones and they are not ATP or DTT sensitive. In here, it will be demonstrated how these properties can be used to identify targeting signals of preproteins, for example, in the uncoupling protein (UCP). In addition, a low-resolution model is proposed based on biochemical and biophysical characterization and protein modeling. Using these techniques a 4-helix bundle structure is predicted. The protein contains a "Glutamine face" involved in interaction with internal targeting signals and predicted to face the surface of the protein. Furthermore, it was determined that Tom20 can stimulate insertion of outer mitochondrial membrane proteins like VDAC. The insertion process is strongly dependent on Tom20 and the inserted protein is active. This suggest that Tom20 acts as receptor and translocator, a double function not found yet for any other receptor involved in recognition of preproteins to be imported into mitochondria.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shore, G.

Here, we have further defined the minimal sequence elements required to support autonomous DNA replication of a mammalian early replicating DNA sequence, ors8. In addition, we have identified a protein, CBP, which binds specifically to DNA cruciforms, a DNA secondary structure that can form at inverted repents which are commonly found within origins of DNA replication. Cloned fragments from a known mammalian origin from the DHFR locus, oribeta, have been shown to replicate autonomously following transient transfection into mammalian cells and when used as templates in an in vitro DNA replication system. These in vivo and in vitro DNA replication assays have been used to define the sequence elements present within the minimal origin of ors8, a monkey oÌ²rigin enrÌ²iched sÌ²equence activated in early S phase. The minimal origin, consisting of an internal sequence of 186 bp, was shown to contain bent DNA, an imperfect Oct-1 binding site, and an inverted repeat which has been shown previously to extrude into a cruciform structure in vivo . Cruciform structures have been hypothesized to form at or near origins of DNA replication to serve as sites of recognition for initiator proteins. To further investigate this possibility, a previously described cruciform binding protein, CBP, was identified as a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. 14-3-3 proteins are involved in regulating a wide array of cellular processes by acting as adaptor or stabilizing molecules. We have shown that 14-3-3 binding to cruciform structures is required for the in vitro DNA replication of the 186-bp minimal origin of ors8, further suggesting a crucial role for cruciform structures in DNA replication.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zannis-Hadjopoulos, Maria</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w9505217g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f2940</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289k75w"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>DÃ©partement de langue et littÃ©rature franÃ§aises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>De lâhomme historique Ã  lâenfant atemporel dans les romans de Tournier</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vaillant, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>L'enfant, dans l'oeuvre romanesque de Michel Tournier, agit comme principe de rÃ©solution des contraires, qui sont Ã  l'origine de la disharmonie existant chez les protagonistes: Robinson CrusoÃ©, Abel Tiffauges et Paul Surin, les trois personnages principaux de Vendredi ou les limbes du Pacifique, Le Roi des Aulnes et Les MÃ©tÃ©ores respectivement.

The variation in the time dimension is actually the main characteristic of this duality with which the protagonists hÃ¢ve to deal. As a matter of fact, they switch between historic and atemporal states according to regular and specific conditions. A real or symbolic child appears with angelic and solar features when the protagonists fulfill their destiny, reaching a state where neither historicity nor eternity exist.
