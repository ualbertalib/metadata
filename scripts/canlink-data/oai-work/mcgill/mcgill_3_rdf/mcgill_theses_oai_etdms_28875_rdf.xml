Free food was presented during extinction of RI responding in Experiments 1 and 2. Noncontigent food retarded response loss compared to a signaled free food group (Experiments 1 and 2) which declined less rapidly than a control group of no free food (Experiment 1). Free food was presented while the instrumental reinforcement RR and RI probabilities remained unchanged in Experiments and 3 and 4. In contrast to Experiments 1 and 2, added noncontingent food facilitated response loss compared to a signaled condition and to a control group of no added free food which responded most (Experiment 3). Removing all food caused most recovery in the free food group, less in the signaled condition and least in the control group (Experiments 1 and 3). A generalization decrement hypothesis of the free food effect was offered to explain these apparently paradoxical results.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rj21d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537241f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Operant conditioning</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apr76f475w"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The legal relationship between parent unions and their locals : a study of international unionism in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Armstrong, Enid Carolyn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The legal relationship between trade unions and the subordinate units (locals, branches, regions etc) of which they are made up, has received little academic attention despite its importance in Canadian labour relations. Traditionally the link has been viewed as contractual, but the law of contract, developed in the context of individual rights, is ill-equipped to address the competing group interests which are at stake. This paper is a study of "disaffiliation" or the severance of ties between the "parent" and the "local" union, an event which more than any other reveals the subordination inherent in the relationship and the way in which the law functions to preserve the status

Vanessa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The ability of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to replicate in T-cells and macrophages has been shown to be influenced by immunomodulatory cytokines; furthermore, HIV infection of these cells can alter the kinetics of cytokine transcription. We found that chronic HIV IIIB infection of myelomonoblastic PLB 985 cells resulted in an altered pattern of type 1 interferon (IFN) transcription. Paradoxically, despite the antiviral effects of IFN, HIV-induced dysregulation of IFN transcription may actually lead to the establishment of a cellular environment that supports a chronic infection. Since HIV replication is dependent on cellular activation, immunosuppressive cytokines which deactivate T-cells and macrophages may be important modulators of an antiviral effect. We previously demonstrated the anti-HIV effects of IFN$ alpha$2, alone and in a cooperative combination with 3$ sp prime$-azido-2$ sp prime$3$ sp prime$-dideoxythymidine (AZT), in limiting the expression of HIV IIIB in promonocytic U937 cells. We further tested the anti-HIV potential of the immunosuppressive cytokines transforming growth factor beta (TGF-$ beta$1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), alone and in combination with AZT. TGF-$ beta$1 as a single agent had no effect on the multiplication of HIV IIIB in de novo infected PLB 985 cells; however, co-treatment with TGF-$ beta$1 and AZT synergistically slowed virus multiplication within the first week following infection. The synergistic actions of TGF-$ beta$1 and AZT were also observed in PLB 985 cells infected with an AZT-resistant strain of HIV-1. In contrast, IL-10 seemed to enhance HIV IIIB multiplication in PLB 985 cells. These antiviral treatments had no inhibitory effect on HIV IIIB multiplication in the T-cell line Jurkat. Elucidation of the role of cytokines in controlling the degree of HIV multiplication may have an impact on both clinical treatments and understanding the progression to AIDS.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hiscott, John</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f9639.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h306g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz806107k"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Disaccharidase deficiencies in gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) immune to Giardia lamblia</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mohammed, Shawn Rasheed</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Studies using Mongolian gerbils found that during a primary infection with Giardia lamblia trophozoites, disaccharidase activities were decreased from day 10 post-infection (p.i.) until well past elimination of the parasite. However, during a challenge infection, enzyme deficiencies were short-lived. A challenge with a soluble extract of G. lamblia trophozoites also resulted in reductions in disaccharidase activity. The degree of these reductions in enzyme activity was dependent on the extract dose. Gel filtration of the trophozoite crude extract resulted in fractions F1, F2, and F3. However, only a challenge with F1 led to disaccharidase deficiencies. Further separation of F1 resulted in fractions F1a and F1b. Impairments of enzyme activity were obtained only in gerbils challenged with F1b. Protein analysis of F1b revealed several high and low molecular weight bands. When gerbils previously exposed to G. lamblia were challenged with an extract of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites, disaccharidase activities remained comparable to controls. Moreover, enzyme levels in gerbils challenged with excretory/secretory G. lumblia products were affected in a manner which was inconsistent with the live parasitic challenge. Results suggest that the disaccharidase deficiencies in giardiasis are parasite-specific and are induced by a heat-stable constituent(s) of fraction F1b, possibly through an immune response to an antigenic component of this parasite fraction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Faubert, Gaetan M.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096823m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806107k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Giardia lamblia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Disaccharides</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gerbils -- Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Giardiasis -- Immunological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Parasite antigens</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gerbils -- Parasites</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahx11xg27k"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Histological analysis of bovine bone grafting using the rat tibia model</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Monaghan, Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Experimental investigations were carried out concerning the use of bovine bone (Unilab Surgibone) grafted in the tibiae of rats. The first experiment evaluated tissue response of bovine bone as an inlay graft and the second experiment as an onlay graft. Histological and morphometric analyses were performed in order to obtain baseline data on tissue response for future experiments using titanium implants with bovine bone grafts in this model. Light microscopy demonstrated rapid incorporation of the inlay graft by new bone, whereas, the onlay graft was mainly encapsulated by fibrous tissue. However, a residual increase in the thickness of the outer cortex of the tibiae was observed with onlay graft. From the results of this study it appeared that Unilab Surgibone was biocompatible and did not induce a foreign body reaction. Future investigations using titanium implants in combination with the bovine bone grafts appears to be possible especially if an inlay/onlay design is attempted.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clokie, C.
