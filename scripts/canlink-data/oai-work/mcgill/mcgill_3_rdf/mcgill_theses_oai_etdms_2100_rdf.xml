The objective of this study is to identify in 'world dances' their unifying principle, to suggest implications of this for an at-one-ness in dance education. Drawing from early critical theory, specifically, I argue that a cross-cultural definition of dance is essential for inclusion of African dance, and other non-Western dances, in contemporary education. To do so, this thesis first raises the question what is dance , and examines four commonly accepted definitions of dance. From the framework of critical multiculturalism, the politics of nonrecognition and misrepresentation are discussed. The 'primitive' trope attached to contemporary non-Western art, the regard of cultures as 'objects', and the 'tokenism' practices in multicultural education are examined in direct relation to art museums, educational institutions, and media images in particular. From the notion of self, the thesis uses philosophical foundations, primarily Eastern, to challenge the Eurocentrism present in contemporary dance education in Canada. This addresses the question of who is the dancer. Throughout the thesis, the shifting dialogue between theory and philosophy, past and present, movement and voice, is employed to argue for change in dance education in Canada. In response to the questions raised, the final conclusion of this thesis is developed in a six minute video presentation which accompanies this thesis, entitled: I am the two in One.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wood, Elizabeth</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sc43v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612q80x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dance -- Study and teaching</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322g450"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Jong Islamieten Bond : a study of a Muslim youth movement in Indonesia during the Dutch Colonial era, 1924-1942</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Husni, Dardiri</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with an influential young Muslim intellectual movement, Jong Islamieten Bond (JIB), which had active towards the end of the Dutch Colonial era in Indonesia.

The major purposes of this thesis are threefold; (1) to give a brief account of the historical backdrop of the encounter between Islam and the Javanese tradition; (2) to discuss the ongoing dispute among scholars over whether the slametan is animistic, syncretistic or Islamic; and (3) to provide a new perspective on the slametan ritual based upon textual (religious) and contextual (socio-cultural) analysis. The hypothesis underlying this work is that the slametan is a prototype of syncretistic ritual, the representative of Islamic elements---as its core---on the one hand, and local traditions---as its periphery---on the other. This work will argue against the theory of the slametan developed both by Geertz and Woodward. The first scholar sees the slametan from a socio-cultural perspective only, while the latter views it on an Islamic theological basis. The current writer argues that one should employ a holistic perspective to see the slametan comprehensively; both from "inside" (religious perspective) and "outside" (cultural perspective).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Federspiel, Howard M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752j93s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gg14r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Java (Indonesia) -- Religious life and customs</dc:subject><dc:subject>Javanese (Indonesian people) -- Rites and ceremonies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sacred meals -- Indonesia -- Java</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- Indonesia -- Java</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x348q"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The socialization of children's gambling behavior</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hardoon, Karen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The role of social influences concerning gambling behavior was empirically examined. Children (N = 130) in grades 4 and 6 completed several questionnaires concerning their gambling behavior, risk taking, and locus of control and played a computer-simulated roulette game individually and in groups (same and mixed gender dyads or triads). Results reveal that during individual and group play, males consistently exhibit riskier behavior (higher average wagers) than females and mixed gender groups. However, average wagers of females and mixed gender groupings appear to be most affected by the group condition. All changes resulting from the group condition were generally maintained over a relatively short period of time in the post-test condition. No major developmental changes were noted nor was locus of control found to be a significant mediating factor. The results are interpreted with respect to the importance of the influence of the peer group on children's gambling behavior. Future directions for research are suggested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Derevensky, Jeffrey</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333446w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x348q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Child psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Interpersonal relations in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gamblers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43p035g"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The acquisition of deictic feminine third-person pronouns</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guerriero, A.

The child began producing feminine third-person pronouns at 24 months of age and made few production errors. In contrast, she made systematic comprehension errors between 24 and 36 months of age and did not master the correct comprehension until 40 months of age. Analysis of the child's person errors indicated that she held the proper name interpretation that the feminine third-person pronoun her referred to herself. In production, however, the child rarely called herself with feminine third-person pronouns because she had already mastered the correct use of first-person pronouns in self-reference. The issues of why the child made systematic person errors for such a long period of time and how she corrected the errors are discussed with regard to Oshima-Takane's (1985, 1998) pronoun-learning model.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Oshima-Takane, Yuriko</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225d16w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43p035g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Acquisition -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Pronoun</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hh74q"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Muscovite embassy of 1599 to Emperor Rudolf II of Habsburg</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gruber, Isaiah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present thesis represents a contribution to the history of diplomatic relations between Muscovy and the House of Habsburg. It includes an overall survey of those relations during the reign of Tsar Fyodor (1584--1598), as well as a more detailed study of the Muscovite embassy of 1599. It also provides original translations of important Russian documents related to the subject of the thesis. The narrative of the embassy of 1599 is divided into three sections. It opens with the travels of the Muscovite delegation through several German cities, during which time the Tsar's representative engaged in discussions with the leading merchants of Hamburg and Lubeck. It then relates the arrival of this delegation at the court of Emperor Rudolf II, where the chief Muscovite representative raised the prospect of an alliance against Poland-Lithuania. Finally, it closes with the embassy's visit to Archduke Maximilian of Austria, whose pretensions to the throne of Poland-Lithuania had formed part of Russo-Imperial relations since 1587. Analysis of the embassy of 1599 reveals that previous historiography on the subject was quite cursory and often based on misinterpretation or misuse of sources. The thesis points out these errors and seeks to provide a more accurate evaluation of the relations between Muscovy and the Empire in the late sixteenth century. It closes with a suggestion for further research into their dealings of the early seventeenth century.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Longworth, Philip</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397b37z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hh74q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Austria -- Relations -- Russia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Russia -- Relations -- Austria</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag732dc083"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of social organization on children's desire to compete</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gordon, Alana J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study was designed to examine whether social organization influences children's desire to compete and to achieve valued outcomes in important areas of life. One hundred and fifty-eight participants (71 males and 87 females) from three classes of grade 4 and four classes of grade 6 children participated in this study. Children completed a two-part questionnaire. The first part assessed their desire to play competitive and cooperative versions of an actual game in two types of social organizations, with their one closest friend and with their group of three closest friends. The second part measured children's beliefs about the effect of social organization on the children's achievements in four life domains. For part one, results indicated that children preferred to compete in a group versus a dyad, but the social organization had no effort on the desire to play a cooperative game. For part two, children believed their groups of friends would be happier for them if they were successful in a social situation; however, they believed their one closest friend would be happier for them if they were successful in either an academic or athletic situation. Results are discussed in terms of the educational and therapeutic implications of differing social organizations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Benenson, Joyce</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161834g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732dc083</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Interpersonal relations in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition (Psychology) in children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30pv830"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dérapages, suivi de, Vers une définition du roman de la route</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Godin, Marc Antoine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present thesis gathers seven original short stories joined, with one exception, by their shared subscription to the road motif and the cultural references linked to it.

In accordance with the impact of new historicism on contemporary Wordsworth studies, considerable attention is given to new historicist readings. It is argued that new history's methodological approach generally undervalues the complex texture of subjectivity in "The Prelude." New historical critiques tend to interpret the Wordsworthian imagination merely as a narrative strategy that enables the poet to displace or elide socio-historical realities. However, "The Prelude" does not entirely support such a reading. On the basis of Wordsworth's autobiography and related prose works, it is asserted that the poet's consciousness of creative decline and mortality potently informs his sense of imagination, and eventuates in a mode of self-perception that precludes subjective autonomy and socio-historical displacement.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Moser, Walter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246v11d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zg631</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wordsworth, William, 1770-1850 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1n79h660k"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Equipo Crónica : a case study on the art work as an "object of criticism"</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gabriel, Clara Gonzalez de Miranda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This paper will look back on the work of Equipo Cronica, who worked between 1964--1980, to reveal a production of art that centered on issues of originality and value that were grounded in attempts at social activism and a redefinition of the role of art vis-a-vis society. To achieve their goals, I will argue and describe how the two man team of artists used serialism, objectivity, hybridity, appropriation of mass media iconography and techniques, and parody to produce something that was neither an art object nor an ordinary object, but an object of criticism. The historical relevancy of such an art lies in its claims of participating in a political critique of the culture industry controlled by the oppressive Franco regime, and its wary outlook on the rapid modernization of Spain into the neo-capitalist state it is today within the multinational world order. The relevance of such an examination lies in how their intentions to create a new relationship between art and society is still pertinent today in modern Spain. Since the death of Franco in 1975 there has been a feeling in Spain that the eyes of the world have been on its new democracy, leading to a campaign, led until recently by the Socialist government, to prove Spain is a modern state that has recuperated from 40 years of isolation. It has tried to demonstrate that it is progressive, not only economically and technologically, but culturally. Over the last twenty years a veritable culture industry has boomed in Spain which has been generously backed by its federal and regional governments. As Spain zealously and rapidly finds its place in the globalized multinational world order, I will demonstrate that the issues of identity pertinent to Equipo Cronica, and the tactics they used to address it, can still contribute a critical position to present-day discussions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ross, Christine</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zj813.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h660k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Art, Spanish -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pop art -- Spain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Equipo Crónica</dc:subject><dc:subject>Modernism (Art) -- Spain</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axk81jn66v"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Modernism and the contextualization of Islamic doctrines : the reform of Indonesian Islam proposed by Nurcholish Madjid</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fathimah, Siti</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates the Islamic response to modernization and its common dilemma as seen through the eyes of Nurcholish Madjid, one of the most influential and prominent Muslim thinkers in Indonesia today. He and his followers represent the most radical development in Indonesian Islamic religio-political discourse in recent decades. This study will survey the growth of his thought from his first involvement with the Islamic renewal movement in the early 1970s, or more precisely after the inception of the New Order era, until the mid-1990s. The movement that he has founded seeks to reformulate the positive nature of modernity and its essential affinity with the purpose and spirit of Islam. The general thrust of Madjid's contribution in the discourse on Islamic modernism in Indonesia is to call Indonesian Muslims to change their attitude and way of thinking in order to play a proper and realistic role in national development and in reinterpreting universal Islamic values to fit the specific socio-economic, political, and cultural values of the nation. In so doing, Madjid proposes his concept of reactualization of Islamic teachings through ijtihad and reinterpretation of the Qur'an using what is called a contextual or substantial approach in that he is associated with the legacy of the neo-modernist approach proposed by Fazlur Rahman, Madjid's chief mentor. According to him, this concept is essential to the survival of the universalism of Islam. Therefore, the basic principle of neo-modernism consists in reinterpreting Islam according to its historical context while making its universal and substantial principles as well as its basic goal and spirit the primary consideration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boullata, Issa J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fz86c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jn66v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islamic renewal -- Indonesia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Majid, Nurcholish, 1939-2005</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55z990q"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Saving Cruiskeen lawn : satirical parody in the novels and journalism of Flann O'Brien (Myles na gCopaleen)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Epp, Michael Henry</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Until recently, criticism has dismissed Flann O'Brien's journalism (written under the pseudonym "Myles na gCopaleen") as not worthy of study, and has tended to focus on the elements of satire in his novels.

When the filmmakers the brothers Taviani decide to undertake their adaptation of Luigi Pirandello's four short stories for the screen, they choose Kaos for the title of their film. Through the study of two of the four adapted short stories, this thesis tries to demonstrate that the adaptation of a literary work or a written text to a filmic text necessarily passes through a chaos that separates the two very different languages.

In theologies that perceive class struggle and oppression of the poor as issues distinctly within the purview of religion to address, the role of Abraham is remarkably significant. In re-telling the story of Abraham from the perspective of the oppressed, Abraham becomes an archetypal monotheist within a new reading of history, one which sees God on the side of the exploited masses. This thesis examines and compares the socio-theological themes connected to the interpretation and application of the life story of Abraham in these two faith traditions. it does so by comparing the position of the Iranian religious ideologue known to many as one who had a major role in inspiring the Iranian youth to revolution in 1978--79, Dr. 'Ali Shari'ati, with Latin American liberation theology. It suggests that the affinity of their goals leads them to use similar methodologies---symbolism and constant interplay between text, context and reader---and ultimately, to create images of Abraham that are as much related to each other as they are to their own faith tradition.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levy, Dean Barry</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zw65p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k019b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sharīʻatī, ʻAlī</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liberation theology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Abraham (Biblical patriarch)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajh343v15r"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Renaissance desire and disobedience : eroticizing human curiosity and learning in Doctor Faustus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Da Silva Maia, Alexandre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Focusing on the A-text (1604) version of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus , this study further assesses biographical information on the poet and intellectual currents of the Counter Reformation, so as to investigate the play's relation to emergent trends of individualism in the Renaissance, recovery of the pagan past, and intellectual aspirations that could readily collide with orthodoxy. Clearly reflecting anxieties of the period about individual deviance from social norms through intellectual overreaching, Doctor Faustus powerfully testifies to the potential dangers of human aspiration and the scholarly spirit of unbounded learning. While thus exploring the exotic temptations of forbidden knowledge, the play resurrects and interrogates traditional taboos which related intellectual appetite to wrongful lust. Marlowe stages an explosive conflict between the conservative tradition of intellectual inquiry, which distrusted the unorthodox scholarship and Neoplatonic magic that some widely influential thinkers promoted in the Italian Renaissance, and Faustus's own creative desires, ambitions, and imagination. The tension between proscribed and prescribed knowledge climaxes in the invocation of Helen of Troy. While Helen's significance is complex, we find that, in relation to the play's concern with dissent from orthodoxy, she focuses the power of intellectual longing to seduce and ravish the mind. Apart from being a superior play, Doctor Faustus encapsulates Marlowe's awareness of his period's uneasy perception of unconventional thinking, and urges the importance of challenging restrictions on how much one is permitted to know.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Borris, Kenneth</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301348b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jh343v15r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Marlowe, Christopher, 1564-1593.

However, despite the recent publication of Shelly Karen Perlove and Giovanni Careri's studies on this subject, its unique manner of signification continues to be elusive. In the former case, the author's dependence on a melange of seventeenth-century religious notions reduces Bernini's choice of imagery to mere theological illustration. On the other hand, Careri affirms the originality of the chapel, but his over reliance on a heuristic comparison with film montage limits his appreciation of the viewer's role in this aesthetically charged space. The present study strikes a balance between its own contemporary subjectivity and Bernini's historicity, locating the chapel's meaning making capacity in a hermeneutic oscillation between both its constituent elements and the participatory beholder. The result is the recognition of a unique artistic statement, which avers the fundamental commonality between several post-Tridentine liturgical practices. The salvific efficacy of these tenets is asserted by an aesthetic signification of the divine presence which lies behind them. The spectator is drawn into a mimetic world, suffused with Baroque Catholic ideology, and shown that Church doctrine is backlit with the radiance of ultimate truth. Of course, seventeenth-century viewing practices cannot be recreated, just as the feeling engendered by this artistic experience is beyond the descriptive powers of this or any other text. Nevertheless, it is possible to provide a guide to the spiritual references in Bernini's microcosm, for, while secular, modern viewers may no longer see with Baroque eyes, perhaps they can appreciate what those eyes saw.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glen, Thomas L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q364w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cz75n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ineffable, The, in art</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bernini, Gian Lorenzo, 1598-1680 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Christian art and symbolism -- Italy -- Rome -- Modern period, 1500-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Altieri Chapel</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar494vn08z"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Engaging the moral imagination through metaphor : implications for moral education</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Courte, Lisa J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The first contemporary approaches to moral education emphasize, moral reasoning skills and value analysis. The possible role of imagination in moral understanding is, by and large, neglected. More recent approaches suggest engaging the imagination can benefit moral education. The concept of imagination, however, remains elusive. As the capacity to consider the possible beyond the actual, imagination is a valued educational tool. It is offered that morality and the opportunity for meaningful interpretation of human experience may best be conveyed in symbolic terms. Metaphor, once viewed as an ornamental product of language, has been rediscovered; claiming a position in our comprehension of human understanding. This thesis proposes that engaging the imagination through metaphor is critical for moral education on the basis that our moral understanding is fundamentally imaginative and metaphoric in nature.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morris, Ronald</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870z12h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vn08z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Moral education</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metaphor</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tx29p"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mi suete leuedi, her mi béne : the power and patronage of the heroine in Middle English romance</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Clout, Karen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the heroines in Middle English romances and argues that, like the noblewomen who lived in England during the Plantagenet period, they are not helpless princesses simply waiting to be rescued by the brave, strong hero. In fact, these heroines show an enormous amount of intelligence, ingenuity, perseverance, and strength of character. Many play a pivotal role in the hero's success in his quest by giving him a token, providing knowledge, or teaching him a lesson. Also, it is the heroines who provide the heroes with rewards after the quests are completed. The present thesis offers a contribution to the study of Medieval English Romances in providing a revision of standard feminist analyses. In many of these studies there seems to be a lack of appreciation for the role of female characters and their relation to the outcome of the hero's quest. Even studies written from a feminist perspective tend to overlook the strength of the heroine's character, the attainment of her goals, and the fact that she is often a powerful figure who is of much higher status than her suitor. In these romances the female characters wield a substantial amount of both private and public power, an aspect of the genre which has often been ignored.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Conway, C.

It demonstrates that previous criticism of the poem has generally misunderstood its key elements, such as magic, as well as the poet's use of certain self-reflexive techniques to convey meaning. By tracing the poet's treatment of the magical and pseudo-magical events in the poem, and the alterations that the English translator makes to the original French version, the thesis reveals the sophistication involved in the poet's examination of human nature and of order in society. Furthermore, the thesis illustrates that through the repeated models of perception in the romance, the poet actually provides his audience with models for reading the text, and stresses the importance of interpretation by exploring the ability of outer appearance to represent inner Truth.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams, David</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nn628.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289m133</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Literature, Medieval</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35tb58t"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Crimes of reason : the Berlin inquiries of Siegfried Kracauer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chahine, Joumane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Siegfried Kracauer is mostly known for the work on film theory he wrote during his post-war exile to North America. This thesis proposes to examine a lesser known and far more complex portion of his oeuvre, namely the vast body of essays and monographs he produced throughout the 20s and 30s as editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung, which offer not only a cultural diary of the Weimar republic but also a critique of modernity and the many upheavals it engendered. Using both a detailed analysis of his own work as well as an examination of the various critical responses it elicited, this study aims at exposing the paradoxical complexity of Kracauer's stance towards modernity and its various mass cultural manifestations, a complexity which has unfortunately often been misjudged and reduced to a mere middling position. Indeed, because of his refusal to opt for a definite position, to either fully embrace or reject modernity, Kracauer has often been miscast as a mere seeker of compromise, a thinker who tried to make edges rounder and ease tensions. This thesis is an attempt to prove that far from trying to annihilate the tensions of the modern era, Kracauer in fact sought to cultivate them. He may have refused to opt for a definite stance---be it a "yes" or a "no"---towards modernity, yet his position is not to be reduced to a tepid "maybe", but ought to be seen, rather, as a truly Janusian simultaneous "yes" and "no" towards it. In our age of extreme relativism, where tension is to be avoided at all costs, there is some valuable insight to be gained from Kracauer's obstinate fight against comfortable compromises of any kind.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Szanto, George</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th599.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tb58t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kracauer, Siegfried, 1889-1966 -- Views on modernism (Aesthetics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Modernism (Aesthetics)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b8183"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Claiming space : exile and homecoming in Roughing it in the bush and Obasan</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Caylor, Jennifer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The narrators of Roughing It in the Bush and Obasan struggle with the notion of home and how to reinvent it in situations of exile.
