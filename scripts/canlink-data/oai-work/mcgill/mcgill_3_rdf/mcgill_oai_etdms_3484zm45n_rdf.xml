T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers a Code for the Design of Transmission Shafting was issued by the American Standards Association in 1929. In this Code all commonly used theories are discussed and rational procedure for the design of the shafts under all conditions of loading is developed with recommendations as to the values of allowable stresses and factors to be used in the design formula. Apart from this code, formulae for design of transmission shaftings have been established by the classification societies like Lloyd's Register of shipping and Westinghouse Co. Ltd.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Edis, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rp88c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zm45n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mechanical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
