The first study (J.Appl.Physiol. 75 (2):696-703, 1993) examined lung volume (V scL) during stutterers' relatively fluent speech. We showed that stutterers used the V scL extremes. This suggested that stutterers recruited their respiratory muscles in a different manner than normals to maintain subglottic pressure (Psg). We therefore investigated respiratory muscle recruitment patterns in normals and stutterers. In the second study, (submitted to J.A.P.), we modified the Campbell pressure volume diagram by the addition of abdominal pressure (Pab) and by the use of a surrogate relaxation curve. The addition of Pab allowed us to differentiate between diaphragmatic and non diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles and to quantify expiratory muscle recruitment. The surrogate curve provided a good approximation of the true relaxation curve (non significant difference between surrogate and true relaxation curves: P $&gt;$.10). The third study (submitted to J.A.P.) used the modified diagram to examine respiratory muscle recruitment patterns, instantaneous Psg, voluntary hyperinflation and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEPi) during normal and stuttering speech. Stutterers used consistent muscle recruitment patterns and consistent V scL but Psg was not as well controlled as in normals. Because a lack of control of Psg could have an immediate effect on the glottis, particularly at high or low V scL, we measured instantaneous Psg and flow in the final study (to be submitted to J.A.P.) to give us instantaneous glottal resistance. In this study we were able to plot a 'family' of glottal resistances that covered normal speech. This provided a normal envelope of resistances. When stutterers were fluent they remained within both the flow and Psg limits set by the normals' envelope. When they were fluent both Psg and flow extended beyond the normals' envelope.

It analyses the impact of 'new vocational' policy initiatives on English education from the 1970s, using an approach termed 'historical ethnography.' Using this methodology, it draws on ethnographic studies of the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative (TVEI) between 1985 and 1992. My argument is that TVEI represents the most recent manifestation of a long history of educational policies that have systematically produced and ordered the social relations of class in an educational form. In this vein, I argue that the technical and vocational curriculum can be seen as an integral site within the English educational State for the production and formation of class relations within schooling. TVEI, I assert, was central to such a process through its capacity to concert and co-ordinate the social relations and practices of secondary schooling around the concept of enterprise, which acted as an organising device for management/administration, teaching, learning, and most crucially, the formation of individual subjectivities. Understood this way, we can see how TVEI effected reforms that contributed to the formation of clusters of social relations that produced class in new ways. I show how this process emerged under TVEI through my ethnographic studies of enterprise, school-based management, business studies, and assessment. What each study reveals is how TVEI worked to effect a generalised shift in the culture of schooling away from the post-war social democratic politics of education, to that of a 'managed market' and enterprise culture. In this respect, I argue, TVEI prefigured many of the reforms that were to flow from the Education Reform Act (1988).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jackson, Nancy S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333386n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r469r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vocational education -- Great Britain -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Technical education -- Great Britain -- Social aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602239r"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Two investigations in quantum gravity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lafrance, Ren√©</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes are discussed. First, the limits for applicability of the equivalence principle in the context of low energy effective field theories is considered. In particular, we find three classes of higher-derivative interactions for the gravitational and electromagnetic fields which produce dispersive photon propagation. One of these classes of interactions also produces birefringent propagation. This result is illustrated by calculating the energy-dependent contribution to the bending of light. In the second part, the divergences appearing in statistical black hole entropy are analysed. Using a Pauli-Villars regulator, it is shown that 't Hooft's approach to evaluating black hole entropy through a statistical-mechanical counting of states for a scalar field propagating outside the event horizon yields precisely the one-loop renormalization of the standard Bekenstein-Hawking formula, $S = { cal A}/(4G),$ where $ cal A$ is the black hole area. The calculation also yields a constant contribution to the black hole entropy, which may be associated with the one-loop renormalization of certain higher curvature terms in the gravitational action. The calculation of black hole entropy is done for a Schwarzschild black hole as well as for a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h6161.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602239r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rq36h"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Torsion textures produced by deformation and by dynamic recrystallization in a-iron and two IF steels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Baczynski, Jerzy, 1958-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The textures of two IF steels and a high purity $ alpha$-iron were determined after deformation in torsion over the temperature range 20-840$ sp circ$C. The three characteristic bcc torsion fibres are described in detail and the locations of some important ideal orientations are identified on the $ {110 }$ pole figure. At room temperature, these are the F(110)(001), J1 (011) (211), J2 (110) (112), D1 (112) (111), D2 (112) (111), E1 (011) (111) and E2 (011) (111). At elevated temperatures, the conditions were chosen so that dynamic recrystallization (DRX) took place in the ferrite and that static recrystallization was avoided during cooling after deformation. The DRX textures differ from those observed at room temperature and are dominated by the D2 (112) (111), D1 (112) (111) and E2 (011) (111) components. The D2 becomes increasingly important as the strain is increased, which leads to weakening of the D1 and disappearance of the E2 at large strains. Deformation textures were simulated using the rate sensitive theory of crystal plasticity. These called for lengthening to take place, in agreement with the measured length changes. The simulated and experimentally observed 'tilt' phenomena are similar to those commonly reported in the literature for fcc materials. The explanation of this phenomenon developed for the latter materials is extended to bcc metals. The development of torsion textures is discussed in terms of the rotation rate vector R, the divergence-convergence properties of orientation flow, and the stability parameter S. DRX textures were simulated using a model based on sequential deformation, nucleation and growth steps. The types of oriented nucleation and selective growth required to reproduce the experimentally observed textures are discussed. The simulations indicate that the low energy nucleation mechanism plays a dominant role in the formation of bcc DRX textures. The results are also interpreted in terms of the continuous (in situ) and discontinuous mechanisms of dynamic recrystallization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jones, J.

The majority of SERS-active metal substrates, such as roughened electrodes and colloidal sols, are fabricated from coinage metals, Au, Ag and Cu. The principal subject of this thesis is the surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic study of the adsorbates; pyrazinamide, 2- and 4-mercaptopyridine. A range of SERS-active Ag substrates was used, viz., Ag colloids, metal liquid-like films (MELLFs), and roughened Ag electrodes. In addition, an original technique that encompasses both SERS and waveguide Raman spectroscopy (WRS), known as integrated optics, evanescent wave, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (IOEW-SERS) was developed. For this technique, a waveguide heterostructure was fabricated on nano-scale dimensions by self-assembly of silver colloidal particles on thin glass slides. The unique optical behaviors of both SERS and WRS systems are combined such that optically guided light propagates in the thin film, with an evanescent wave and couples with surface plasmon modes of metal particles. A comparative SERS study of 2- and 4-mercaptopyridine (MPy) was undertaken using all of the above methods. The purpose of this comparison was to determine the similarities between IOEW-SERS and other Ag SERS-active systems. These studies were extended by using a 4-MPy modified SERS-active optical waveguide as a thin film chemical sensor. Intermolecular interactions between probe ions, Cu$ sp{2+}$ and H$ sp+,$ with 4-MPy were observed by vibrational perturbations to the IOEW-SERS spectrum.

These could be related to the austenite-to-ferrite phase transformation and grain boundary precipitation behavior. When no precipitation took place at the austenite grain boundaries, the trough occurred by intergranular failure. Fracture surfaces revealed microvoid coalescence, with voids associated with MnS inclusions. Increasing the Mn in the steels lowers the $ gamma to alpha$ transformation temperature, causing the trough to be moved to lower temperatures. It also decreases the volume fraction of MnS inclusions within the ferrite film. Increasing the Al level caused AlN to be precipitated at the austenite grain boundaries, extending the trough to higher temperatures into the single phase austenite region. The addition of Ti results in a fine austenite grain size after the solution treatment and impedes AlN precipitation. This leads to improved ductility in the austenite region. When austenite recrystallization occurs during deformation, any voids which have initiated at the boundaries are trapped within the newly recrystallized grains. Intergranular failure cannot progress and the ductility is high.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f9575.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558f44r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj38608134"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Definition of monoclonal antibodies specific for natural suppressor cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abedian, Azadeh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This investigation was carried out in order to determine the specificity of a panel of monoclonal antibodies previously generated against murine pregnancy-associated splenic natural suppressor cells and to characterize the cell surface target molecule(s) on cells that are recognized by these antibodies.

Further differences within the fundamentalist "camp" are demonstrated through Taliqani 's progressive all-inclusive "Liberation Theology" and Khumayni 's equally all-encompassing "religion of militant individuals".</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh86s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fs54k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Shƒ´ ªah -- Political aspects -- Iran</dc:subject><dc:subject>Khomeini, Ruhollah -- Political and social views</dc:subject><dc:subject>·π¨ƒÅliqƒÅnƒ´, Ma·∏•m≈´d -- Political and social views</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam and politics -- Iran</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sharƒ´ ªatmadƒÅrƒ´,  ªAlƒ´ -- Political and social views</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278v26x"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The dialectical adversary : the satanic character and imagery in Anglo-Saxon poetry</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abdalla, Laila</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the positive role of evil in select Old English Poetry, namely The Junius Book, "Guthlac", "Vainglory", "The Whale", "Juliana", "Judith" and "Beowulf". Using a background of Augustan and Boethian thought, each adversarial character is discussed with regard to role and imagery, but specifically in relationship to the protagonist. Evil plays a surprisingly positive role when it offers the protagonist the opportunity to defeat it. The protagonists' honour at the poem's conclusion is necessarily defined by the extent of resisting the antagonists. The hero must fight evil on two levels: the temporal in humans and the metaphysical in Satan. The thesis examines the various levels of victory and indeed failure they achieve, and concludes that of all the heroes only Juliana is completely successful. Although evil itself cannot be defined as "good", this thesis discovers that in its relationship with the human hero, it can indeed give rise to goodness.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n2040344.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278v26x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English poetry -- Old English, ca. 450-1100 -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Evil in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj67315123"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Architecture and the art museum in search of a significance</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abou, Robert-Habib</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Because it is chiefly a "place of meeting" of architecture with the other forms of art, the museum participates necessarily in the elaboration of an architecture that goes beyond the usual concern for "habitable" space--a functionalism derived from western civilization's pragmatism. The concept of the museum has provoked profound changes in the cultural significance of what it represents. The museum reflects a culture of "pluralism," of different world views as well as an intention to represent the world through a categorization of the "fragment." Hence it brings forth the contradictions inherent in our anthropocentric society which is, itself, the product of the complexity and contradictions specific to man. Thus the present thesis investigates the potential for significance of the main architectural themes pertaining to the art museum.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q5195.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j67315123</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Art museum architecture</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445cf462"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Adaptability of commercial flexible partition systems to residential applications in North America</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yamin, Syed Muhiuddin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The flexible partition, one of the main components of the flexible housing schemes in West European countries exhibited a comparative technological lack. This research investigated the adaptability of selected commercial flexible partitions available in the North American market to residences since the most realistic way to influence the technological process was to start from the known products and developing them in an innovative direction. The consequences of the proposed sectoral transfer were seen as immediate and long term effects and categorized into three groups of constraints: legal, technological and marketing constraints. The context of evaluation was drawn, and the performance concept was used to form a set of evaluation criteria. Fifty partition systems were reviewed, characterized and mismatched portions were screened out. The analysis with thirteen selected partition systems suggested that the performances of most of them were above the level required for dwelling. The study showed that most of them were economically more feasible as compared to fixed gyproc partitions if life-cycle costs were considered. Since the study showed that the partitions were sound in technical terms, it recommended further studies to look into the matter of modifying them by introducing new materials which would cut down the unnecessary performances and might reduce the initial cost as well.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m530d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cf462</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Industrialized building -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Partitions (Building)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Industrialized building -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fq19w"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A class of greedy algorithms for solving the travelling salesman problem</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Almulla, Mohammed Ali</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The travelling salesman problem is one of the NP-complete problems. It has been under consideration in computer science for at least forty years. Solving this hard problem using search methods can be accomplished by choosing: a starting point, a solution generation scheme and a termination rule. When the termination rule is such that search stops if and only if the tour is optimal, we call the method "exact". When the termination rule is such that the search stops but not necessarily with an optimal tour, we call the method "approximate". This thesis looks closely at one of the approximate methods, namely sub-optimal tour building. In particular, it focuses on the nearest neighbour algorithm (a greedy algorithm). By being greedy at every step of the procedure, this algorithm returns an approximate solution that is near optimal in terms of solution cost. Next, this greedy algorithm is used in implementing a new algorithm that is called the "Multi-Degree Greedy Algorithm". By being greedy at half of the procedure steps, this algorithm returns optimal solutions to travelling salesman problems 99% of the time. Thus, this algorithm is an approximate algorithm, designed to run on small-scale travelling salesman problems (n $&lt;$ 20).</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sh42j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq19w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Statistics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fm84t"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structured covariance autoregressive parameter estimation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Armour, Bernard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, the problem of estimating the autoregressive (AR) parameters of a wide sense stationary process is studied for the application of spectrum estimation of short data records. The approach taken is to first estimate a structured covariance matrix satisfying an optimality criterion and then map the estimate into the AR parameter estimates. Most covariance estimators are based on a least squares prediction error criterion. The new approach taken in this thesis is the use of a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion to obtain better covariance estimates. Both approximate and exact ML algorithms are developed based on an iterative Newton-Raphson technique to maximize the loglikelihood functions. Testing reveals the symmetric centro-symmetric structured covariance provides superior estimates in comparison to the Toeplitz structure and that the exact ML AR parameter estimates are among the lowest variance. Full comparison of the ML and popular AR spectrum estimation techniques is included.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w95051691.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm84t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580n769"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Harmonic maps</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Anand, Christopher Kumar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>After a brief introduction, we consider three main results in the existence theory of harmonic maps between manifolds.

Analysis revealed that homeless persons have two distinct conceptions of health: the characteristics that describe health, and a comprehensive view of the totality of health expressed in different combinations of health dimensions. A total of ten characteristics that described the essence of health were identified. These characteristics included satisfying basic human needs, having no illness related complaints, doing the work of health, fulfilling a functional role, having a positive self-image and outlook, and being fit. The four distinct perceptions of health that were revealed are: physical dimensions of health exclusively, physical and mental/emotional dimensions of health considered separately, physical and mental/emotional dimensions of health coexistent, and health as a multidimensional process of well being. Respondents also indicated that acute life events associated with feelings of loss preceded their state of homelessness. Generally, the respondents in this study considered themselves healthy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dd62s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429b43q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, General</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, General</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k627r"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Growth factor regulation of a 69kDa phosphoprotein secreted by NRK- -49F cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Laverdure, Guy R.

Antibody raised against pp69 recognizes, in addition to pp69, another major phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 62kDa (pp62) secreted by RR1022 and spontaneously transformed NRK-49F cells (spt-NRK-49F). Immunoprecipitation of total cell lysates from both NRK-49F and RR1022 cells with anti-pp69 antibody detected only pp69. Treatments with: epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-$ beta$ (TGF-$ beta$) retinoic acid (RA), and TPA modulate the levels of pp69 present in the conditioned media. Furthermore, TPA and EGF induce the synthesis of 3 internal peptides with molecular weights of 58, 54, and 44 kDa which appear to be pre-processed forms of pp69. Treatment of NRK-49F cells with insulin, EGF, TGF-$ beta$, PPA, levamisole and spermine clearly demonstrate alterations in the phosphorylation of pp69, concomitant with changes in extracellular phosphatase activity.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752h87f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k627r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Growth factors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fibroblasts</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phosphoproteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cell proliferation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At148fj24j"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pacemaking in embryonic chick heart</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brochu, Richard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Experiments were conducted to determine the currents involved in the pacemaker activity of aggregates and single cells from the embryonic chick heart.

Barium (Ba, 5 mM) blocked the more negatively activated time-dependent component unmasking a component which remained inwardly directed for hyperpolarizing steps beyond the potassium equilibrium potential (E$ sb{ rm K}$). This component, which was blocked by cesium (Cs, 2 mM), is consistent with an inward current which activates upon hyperpolarization (the I, model) as proposed by DiFrancesco (1981a,b), for Purkinje fibers.

There was little difference in the overall proximate composition between the micronized and processed soybeans. Yield, protein content and textural properties of tofu made from micronized beans using standard procedures (70$ sp circ$C and CaSO$ sb4$.2H$ sb2$O as coagulating agent) were lower than those of tofu from unprocessed beans; tofu prepared from micronized beans and coagulated at 90$ sp circ$C using a mixture of citric acid (0.01M) and calcium sulphate (0.03M) showed improved characteristics. The microstructure of tofu prepared from micronized beans lacked the regularity of honeycomb-like structure as shown by tofu from unprocessed beans. Functional, biochemical and nutritional properties of the micronized soybeans, soy isolate, soymilk and tofu were studied. The results indicate the following: the digestibility of micronized soybean (84.3%) was higher compared to the unprocessed soybean (76.5%); the available lysine content of soy isolate, soymilk and tofu from micronized soybeans were higher than the corresponding products derived from unprocessed beans; the unprocessed soybean flour displayed maximum foam capacity at pH 9.0 while the micronized soybean flour showed no foam capacity at pH 3.0 and 5.0; polyacrylamide-disc gel electrophoresis showed that heat treatment by micronization had little effect on the protein constitution of the soybean and on the protein-carbohydrate interaction but induced some interactions of protein and lipid components in the soybeans.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vm219.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm818</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Soyfoods</dc:subject><dc:subject>Infrared heating</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soybean</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sd858"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Plasma spout-fluid bed calcination of lac dore vanadium ore concentrate</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mersereau, Oliver S. (Oliver Smith)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A laboratory scale plasma spout-fluid bed has been developed to calcine concentrated vanadium ore to extract vanadium in the form of sodium metavanadate. A 20-kW d.c. plasma torch was used with argon and nitrogen as the plasma gases. Air, the main fluidizing gas, permitted the fluidization of the vanadium concentrate within the bed and provided the oxygen for the roasting reaction. In addition, air injected tangentially into the spout region lowered the plasma gas temperatures to within the required roasting temperatures. The bed stability and degree of vanadium recovery were analyzed as a function of bed temperature, time, and concentrate-to-salt ratio. It was shown that heating and reaction in the reactor occur primarily as the particles pass through the plasma spout. If spout temperatures are too high, melting and agglomeration of the particles occurs, leading to defluidization of the bed. Conversion during batch operation, with sodium carbonate as the salt, was rather unsuccessful due to elutriation of the salt during heat-up. The highest conversions were observed in the fused and agglomerated particles of the bed. Simulated continuous operation of the bed however resulted in significantly higher conversion rates.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Munz, R.
