The decrease in esterification of labeled palmitate could also be detected in free adipocyte preparations and adipose tissue homogenates, incubated under optimal conditions, although to a lesser extent than in intact tissue. The following enzymes involved in esterification of fatty acids by adipose tissue were characterized and optimal conditions for the determination of their activity established: coenzyme A ligase (AMP), acyl-CoA: L-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, acyl-CoA deacylase, L-a-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and acyl-CoA: diglyceride acyltransferase. The activities of these enzymes tested under optimal conditions were not altered by 48 hour fasting. Fatty acyl-CoA deacylase activity on the other hand was significantly decreased in the adipose tissue of the 48-hour fasted rat.

The activity of fructose-6-p-D-glutamine amidotransferase was decreased in supernatants from the liver homogenates of rats treated with cortisone for three days or longer.

Phage yields were variable but, in general, quite low. Plaques produced on solid medium were small and possessed turbid centers. Lysogenization of the indicator strain occurred. The phage had a polyhedral head 80 x 70 mu and a striated tail 200 mu long as determined by electron microscopy. Experiments involving temperature, ultraviolet light and pH stability of the phage as well as adsorption experiments were performed. The phage nucleic acid, as determined by the diphenylamine reaction, acridine orange staining and sensitivity of phage multiplication to mitomycin C, was deoxyribonucleic acid.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reed, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182p13d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gp099</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Microbiology and Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akp78gk52g"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation by a variational method</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McInnis, B.

Under the same conditions, 3H-pregnenolone sulfate was not converted to any detectable metabolites and 63 per cent of the substrate was recovered.

It has been suggested that acetyl-I-camitylcholine could play an important role in nerve metabolism. In order to verify the hypothesis, this compound was chemically synthesized and its pharmacodynamic properties were compared with acetylcholine. Acetyl-I-carnitylcholine was labile to alkali treatment, hydrolyzed by true cholinesterase, and had an equipotent molar ratio of two when compared to acetylcholine on five different pharmacological test preparations. Its acetylcholine-like activity was potentiated by eserine and blocked by d-Tubocurarine and atropine. I-Carnitylcholine, a possible hydrolysis product of acetyl-I-carnitylcholine was found to be a potent neuromuscular blocker on the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation when compared to succinylcholine, acetyl-I-camitylcholine and acetylcholine. Paper and thin-layer chromatographic techniques were used to identify acetylcholine and acetyl-I-carnitylcholine in rat brain extracts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hosein, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n2042249.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v1520</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax059cb47j"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Heterologous anti-lymphocyte serum and plasma</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jeejeebhoy, Homi F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Heterologous anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) and plasma (ALP) are potent immuno-suppressive agents. The findings recorded in this thesis relate to their use and mode of action in thymectomized, sham-thymectomized and non-thymectomized rats and mice. No method is at present available for the in vitro standardization of ALP in terms of immuno-suppressive potency. Potency cannot be related to either, agglutinating and cytotoxic antibody titres directed against lymphocytes or to the ability of ALP to depress lymphocyte counts. The latter property of ALP has been found to be largely dependent on normal adrenal function in the recipient. The ability of ALS to prolong allograft survival times can be significantly improved if the recipient is thymectomized prior to the administration of serum and grafting performed after the completion of the course of ALS. An additional finding is that rats thymectomized in adult life show a progressive decline in immunological competence with the passage of time.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Irvine, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wg713.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059cb47j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956j98g"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Further characterization of a streptococcal nephritogenic agent</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fardy, Paul W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Additional studies were undertaken on the nature of a nephritogenic agent found in the culture filtrates of certain group A streptococci. A commercially available dehydrated medium proved satisfactory for the production of the active material. Gel filtration was used to divide crude extracts, prepared from the diffusible portion of culture filtrates, into two major fractions. One of these, representing the higher molecular weight components, contained most of the nephritogenic activity as evidenced by the development of hypertension and acute glomerulonephritis in rabbits injected with the fraction. Physical and chemicals studies indicated that the active fraction consisted of at least four peptide components separable by high-voltage electrophoresis on paper. Automatic amino acid analysis of an acid hydrolysate of this fraction revealed 17 different amino acids. Carbohydrate was not detected by anthrone and orcinol tests. No relationship between this streptococcal nephritogenic agent and other streptococcal constituents which have been implicated in nephritis was established.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reed, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f910v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956j98g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Microbiology and Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0c483n25k"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Growth hormone and protein synthesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dawson, Keith G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The diaphragm of the hypophysectomized rat was utilized in studies designed to further clarify the mode of action of growth hormone.
