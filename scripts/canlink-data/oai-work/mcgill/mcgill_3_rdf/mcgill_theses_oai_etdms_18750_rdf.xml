This, it is felt, is due primarily to the lack of known differentiating characteristics of the smooth, A. bovis, Harz 1877 form of the etiological agent. A method which facilitates the isolation of the anaerobic organisms from heavily contaminated specimens is discussed. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Murray, E. G.

His calculations of the quantum yields of several photochemical reactions demonstrated unequivocally that the Einstein Law of Photochemical Equivalence could not be applied to the overall processes. Nernst was one of the first to suggest that atoms were the chain carriers in these reactions, and for this reason the "Nernst Chain" - proposed for the photochemical synthesis of hydrogen chloride - still bears his name.
