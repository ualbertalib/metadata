One-dimensional non-linear soil dynamic analyses were performed over a large database of boreholes in Montreal using the computer program SHAKE. The resulting predominant frequencies of vibration were used as the main parameter to define the seismic microzonation of the island of Montreal. The frequencies are mapped and used to identify twelve zones with potential seismic amplification problems. The largest ratio was obtained in the zone located at the eastern tip of the island of Montreal where long-period motions are predominant in the deep clay deposits. The Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) technique was used to study the seismic vulnerability of two typical lifeline highway overpass bridges in Montreal. The moment resisting frame components of the two bridges were studied and evaluated for different cases reflecting the condition of the concrete columns and their reinforcement, in accordance with the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC). The frames were subjected to a wide range of earthquakes as part of the IDA study. The insufficient shear reinforcement of some frame elements of both bridges predicted a premature shear failure, which controlled the seismic behaviour of the frames. The predicted failures occurred at a lower spectral acceleration level than the acceleration specified by the CHBDC for both lifeline bridges. A minimum-intervention retrofitting approach was devised for each one of the overpass bridges. In both cases, provisions were made to ensure that flexural yielding would occur before shear failures of the critical elements. The retrofitted frames are predicted to sustain higher levels of spectral acceleration in excess of 0.8 g.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278z593.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19fb21k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avx021k39w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Generalized Jacobians in cryptography</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Déchène, Isabelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Groups where the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) is believed to be intractable have proved to be inestimable building blocks for cryptographic applications. They are at the heart of numerous protocols such as key agreements, public-key cryptosystems, digital signatures, identification schemes, publicly verifiable secret sharings, hash functions and bit commitments. The search for new groups with intractable DLP is therefore of great importance. The study of such a candidate, the so-called generalized Jacobians, is the object of this dissertation. The motivation for this work came from the observation that several practical discrete logarithm-based cryptosystems, such as ElGamal, the Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptosystems, XTR, the Lucas-based cryptosystem LUC as well as the torus-based cryptosystem CEILIDH can all naturally be reinterpreted in terms of generalized Jacobians. We next provide, from a cryptographic point of view, a global description of this family of algebraic groups that highlights their potential for applications. Our main contribution is then to introduce a new public-key cryptosystem based on the simplest non-trivial generalized Jacobian of an elliptic curve. This work thus provides the first concrete example of a semi-abelian variety suitable for DL-based cryptography.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526h430.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021k39w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qp104"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>I am a teacher : reflections from female teachers, their stories and passion for education</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Demarse, Joy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines why excellent working class rural female teachers remain in teaching. Although the teachers of this study admit to having experienced disillusionment during their teaching careers, they have remained passionate and enthusiastic educators, and are the teachers most often cited when colleagues, students and parents are discussing "good" teachers. Thus, this study seeks to determine the factors that influence these women educators to remain in education and to remain passionate about education. The original supposition that an administrator was a determinative variable in influencing the rural female educators proved to be erroneous. For the women of this study, their working class backgrounds, their beliefs that teaching is a calling and an art form, and their belief that teaching is a socially constructed form of public service are important determinative factors in their continuing belief in their educational career. Additionally, the women of this study, through their stories and interactions, disproved the stereotypical image of the female teacher who works alone. The teachers of this study actively seek out collegial relationships and pursue professional development.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w889v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qp104</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education, Rural</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women teachers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fs954"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Forbidden fruit : identity, power and investment issues in learning a second language through computer mediated communication</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Charbonneau-Gowdy, Paula</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this inquiry, I use ethnographic research methods to uncover the tensions that a selected group of military officers and students from Central and Eastern Europe and Asia experienced learning English in Canada and in Europe. In both settings, I use a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach to the inquiry to critically explore with the participants their experiences using computers for second language learning. We negotiate changes to their current perceptions of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) through the use of computer-mediated communication (CMC). This communication involved writing-based exchanges at the Canadian site and using state-of-the-art audio video transferring technology, in a multi-site videoconferencing setting with Europe. The study took place between 2001 and 2004. During the four phases of the study, I collected data through observations of online interchanges, collaborative dialogic interviews and participants' written texts in the form of journals and e-mails. Other important data sources included videotapes and field notes taken at the Canadian site and during three field trips to the European sites. I draw on Vygotsky's socio-cultural approach to language, Bakhtin's concept of learning as dialogic and Weedon's notion of identity as dynamic, constructed and contested through Discourses. The work of these three theorists helps to frame my understanding of the historical, political, cultural, pedagogical and personal influences on this multicultural group of English language learners as they negotiated their learning in a unique setting. The participants' stories suggest that video-based computer technology not only supported some of their investment in using their second language orally but also enabled them to construct more powerful subjectivities. The identity construction that took place in English online is an important consideration for these individuals from evolving democracies that are struggling for international connection and recognition. I argue that more stories need to be told so that SL researchers can re-examine their understanding and theories of language learning and communicative practices to include computer technology. I suggest that stories such as these also have important implications for learners, educators and policy makers as they consider their teaching and learning practices with computers in their second language learning contexts.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720j07t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fs954</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer conferencing</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language and languages -- Computer-assisted instruction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Communication -- Data processing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language and languages -- Study and teaching -- Data processing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644w92n"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The design of innovative epicyclic mechanical transmissions : application to the drives of wheeled mobile robots</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chen, Chao, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Epicyclic mechanisms have found wide applications in industry, especially in automobiles and robotics. Low efficiency due to the high gearing power occurring in an epicyclic train is an important problem. This thesis develops a novel family of epicyclic transmissions, based on cams and rollers. This kind of cam-based mechanical transmissions, Speed-o-Cam (SoC), offers features such as high stiffness, low backlash, and high efficiency. We develop multi-lobbed cam profiles, the sun cam and the ring cam, which comprise an epicyclic cam train (ECT) with the roller follower. New design criteria are established: the generalized transmission index (GTI) and the contact ratio in cam transmissions. The GTI is an index that quantifies the force transmission quality in a mechanism, thereby generalizing the pressure angle, the transmission angle, and the transmission index (TI) proposed by Sutherland and Roth in 1973. The contact ratio is an index of the quantity of overlap occurring between two conjugate cams during transmission. A contact ratio greater than unity guarantees smooth motion during operation. In order to avoid "poor" transmission, we apply an undercutting technique on the cam profile to achieve a smooth motion. We introduce two new concepts, virtual power and virtual power ratio, and derive an original algorithm to compute the efficiency in an epicyclic train upon the assumption that power loss is due only to friction upon meshing. The results show that friction has a larger effect on the total efficiency of an epicyclic train than on a simple train. Examples are given to validate this algorithm, by comparison of our results with previous works. The dual-wheel transmission (DWT), proposed elsewhere using epicyclic gear trains (EGTs), is designed here with epicyclic trains of cams and rollers. We optimize the DWT to achieve a compact design and a high transmission performance. Furthermore, we define the total transmission index (TTI), which allow us to evaluate the final DWT design. Two virtual prototypes of the DWT, the central and the offset versions, are generated: the former is capable of quasi-omnidirectional mobility, the latter of full omnidirectional mobility. Finally, we include a general kinematic analysis of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) with single-wheel drives and apply this method to WMRs with DWT units; then, we obtain symbolic solutions to the direct kinematics (DK) and inverse kinematics (IK) problems, for both central and offset types of units.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583z028r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644w92n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Robotics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rq594"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Bismuth based nanoelectronic devices</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chiu, Pit Ho Patrio, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bismuth (Bi) is a unique electronic material with small effective mass (~0.001me) and long carrier mean free path (100 nm at 300K). It is particularly suitable for studying nano scale related phenomena such as size effect and energy level spacing. In this thesis work, bismuth based nanoelectronic devices were studied. Devices were fabricated using a combination of electron beam (e-beam) writing and thermal evaporation techniques. Dimensions of the fabricated devices were in the order of 100 rim. All structures were optimized for individual electrical characterization. Three types of devices were studied: Bi nanowires, Bi nanowires with dual side-gate structures and Bi nanodot structures. In the study of Bi nanowires, metal-to-semiconductor transition phenomenon and size effect were observed. The conduction behavior of Bi nanowires changed from metallic to semiconductor when the device's critical dimension was reduced to below 50 nm. It is a solid experimental evidence of the quantum confinement-induced bandgap theory. Additionally, it has been found in the present work that resistivity of individual Bi nanowire increased as linewidth decreased indicating size effect occurred in the Bi nanowires. Dual side-gate structures were formed adjacent to the Bi nanowires in an attempt to modulate the current. Measurements showed a 7% of current modulation. The small current modulation suggested the high carrier density in the nanowire which has prevented the full depletion of free carriers. 100 nm-diameter Bi nanodot structures were fabricated utilizing proximity effect of e-beam writing. Precise control of electron doses and process conditions led to the successful fabrication of sub-nanometer tunneling junctions to the nanodots. Significant non-linear current-voltage (I-V) characteristic was observed at low temperatures. The step like I-V characteristic was a strong indication of energy level spacing in the zero-dimensional nanodot structure. The successful observation of energy level spacing in a relatively large nanodot is due to the small effective mass of bismuth material which leads to a measurable energy level spacing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pv632.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rq594</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax346d834x"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Case-study of a creative teacher</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chennabathni, Revathi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Alice, a secondary teacher from Quebec, Canada is the focal point of this qualitative case-study research. She is a Caucasian, 37 year-old, married woman with three children. Alice is selected for the following reasons: primarily, she is a science teacher, who has received a provincial award Prix de merite de la conservation de la faune for a project, that is a demonstration of creativity in her field. Secondarily, I share many attributes with her including being married with children, and being a science teacher. Data were gathered from July, 1998 to July, 2001. Data sources included five one-to-one interviews with Alice. Additional data sources included one interview with June (mentor-colleague) and Jane (Departmental Head); two classroom observations; 1996 retrieved interview; and artifacts of students' work. All interviews were audio-taped verbatim and then transcribed, and observations videotaped. The overarching themes represented constructs involving community, values, and interpersonal skills. Alice's values, her bent towards community, and her way of life in constructing interpersonal relationships contribute to her creative teaching. Alice's philosophy of grounding education in the community determines who she is, and encompasses her creative process which begins with recycling of community resources and giving back to the community through the creative products developed by her students. Her values guide her practice and teaching decisions. This case study of creative teaching highlights the domain of teaching as different from those addressed by studies on creative giants and presents an inspirational model for individuals in the teaching profession.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687n51j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d834x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Science -- Study and teaching (Secondary) -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education, Secondary -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Teachers -- Attitudes</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wh787"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pride and prejudice : Canadian intellectuals confront the United States, 1891-1945</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bélanger, Damien-Claude, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study compares how English and French Canadian intellectuals viewed American society from 1891 to 1945. During the period under study, the Dominion experienced accelerated industrialization and urbanization, massive immigration, technological change, and the rise of mass culture. To the nation's intellectuals, many of these changes found their source and their very embodiment in the United States. America, it was argued, was the quintessence of modernity, having embraced, among other things, secularism, democracy, mass culture, and industrial capitalism. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Canadian hostility to the United States and continental integration was expressed in two conservative discourses: that of English Canadian imperialism and French Canadian nationalism. Despite their fundamental divergence on the national question; both imperialists and nationalistes shared an essentially antimodern outlook, and anti-Americanism was their logical point of convergence. By contrast, the most passionate Canadian defenders of American society could be found among liberal and socialist intellectuals like F. R. Scott and Jean-Charles Harvey. They saw continental integration and Canadian-American convergence as both inevitable and desirable. Intellectual continentalism reached its summit of influence during the 1930s and 1940s. The present study is based on the analysis of some 520 texts found essentially in the era's periodical literature. Each, at least in part, explores some aspect of American life or of the relationship between Canada and the United States. Unlike most previous scholarship, which has tended to view anti-American sentiment merely as an expression of Canadian nationalism, this study is more concerned with Canadian intellectuals as thinkers on the left, the right, and the centre. The comparative, pan-Canadian nature of this study reveals that English and French Canadian intellectuals shared common preoccupations with respect to the United States. However, the tone and emphasis of their commentary often differed. In English Canada, where political institutions and the imperial bond were viewed as the mainstays of Canadian distinctiveness, writing on the United States tended to deal primarily with political and diplomatic issues, in Quebec, where political institutions were not generally viewed as vital elements of national distinctiveness, social and cultural affairs dominated writing on the United States.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42nd20n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wh787</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>United States -- Foreign public opinion, Canadian</dc:subject><dc:subject>United States -- Relations -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- Relations -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public opinion -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- Intellectual life</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892g316"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Understanding reflection in teaching : a framework for analyzing the literature</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Beauchamp, Catherine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the literature on reflection in teaching, authors frequently lament the lack of clarity in understandings of this concept, despite its wide acceptance as a phenomenon beneficial to teaching and learning. This dissertation reports a study of this literature that attempts to clarify the meaning of reflection and to establish a methodology for examining such a complex concept. Three analyses, each intended to explore the literature on reflection from a different perspective, comprise the study. The first is an analysis of the literature on reflection in three professional communities---continuing professional development, higher education and teacher education---to establish general themes in this literature. The second analysis examines definitions of reflection from the three communities, focusing in particular on processes and rationales of reflection. The third analysis explores a variety of critiques of reflection to determine predominant epistemologies and recurring themes in the literature. The merging of the results of the three analyses leads to a framework for understanding reflection. This integrative framework highlights the importance of underlying epistemologies as the bases for different understandings of reflection and shows the intricate interrelationships among four major themes in the literature: the processes involved in reflection, the rationales behind it, the context in which it occurs, and its connection to action. The framework also points to the link between the self and the reflective context, the possibilities of reflection in-, on-, for-, and as-action, the unclear connection between the cognitive and affective processes and the movement from internal to external rationales. The study contributes both conceptually and methodologically by making sense of the range of ways reflection has been understood and by providing a possible model for exploring a complex concept. It provides a consistent language for discussing reflection, demonstrates the complexities of the concept and the interrelationships of the themes contained in the literature, allows for the situating of individual works within the literature, increases understanding of the connection of reflection and action, and helps to position the concept of reflection within broader theories of cognition and social practice.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r751x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892g316</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teaching -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thought and thinking</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self-knowledge, Theory of</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722hf134"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hierarchical changepoint modeling of post-radiotherapy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) series in men with prostate cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bellera, Carine A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Prostate-specific antigens (PSA) help monitor the post-therapy course of prostate cancer. If radiotherapy is successful, levels reach a nadir, and remain low or possibly rise very slowly. A sustained steep increase indicates biochemical failure. Serial PSA measurements are rarely perfectly monotonic. The American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) consensus panel defines biochemical failure as three consecutive PSA increases. I examined the sensitivity and specificity of the ASTRO criterion using simulations of realistic, sophisticated data sets, that accurately reflect the systematic and random variations observed in PSA series. In a preliminary analysis, I estimated the underlying PSA trajectories in a cohort of 470 men treated with radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. I exploited the flexibility of Bayesian hierarchical regression models to describe the individual PSA series, each with its own changepoint, and non-constant variance. The estimates provided by the hierarchical model allowed me to simulate a large set of true PSA series. From these, I generated observed PSA series: each underlying PSA value was distorted by adding a realistic amount of 'noise'. To evaluate the performance of rules for biochemical failure, including the ASTRO criterion, I then compared the generated observed PSA series to the underlying true PSA series. My results suggest that another rule might outperform ASTRO. This simulation-based approach can be applied to evaluate other rules that purport to rapidly and accurately detect up (down) turns in noisy series, such as in other medical data, and in data series used to monitor economic trends. Finally, I present a practical charting paper for physicians to record post-treatment PSA values of individual patients. The plotted serial values provide rapid and accurate estimates of the PSA doubling time, without any difficult computations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cj64m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hf134</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418s415"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Alcohol use in a polysubstance context : implications for understanding the mechanisms of alcohol reinforcement</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Barrett, Sean Patrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Alcohol is frequently co-administered with other psychotropic substances, yet little is known about patterns of alcohol use in a simultaneous polysubstance context. In the present dissertation concomitant alcohol-drug administration is examined with an emphasis on delineating patterns of alcohol use when it is co-administered with psychostimulant drugs known to interact with neural mechanisms believed to be involved in mediating alcohol's ascending limb reinforcing effects: midbrain dopamine transmission. In two retrospective self-report studies polysubstance users reported on their simultaneous use of drugs and alcohol. Results revealed that alcohol was commonly co-administered with various abused substances, particularly with psychostimulant drugs that are known to increase dopamine neurotransmission, and there was an identifiable pattern of administration that was characterized by initial alcohol consumption preceding repeated intermingled alcohol-psychostimulant administrations which resulted in alcohol dose escalation. In a third study, the effects of administering the psychostimulant drug nicotine on alcohol intake was directly examined using a double-blind placebo controlled self-administration procedure. Nicotine was found to significantly increase alcohol ingestion. In a final study we examined the effect of decreasing dopamine neurotransmission on alcohol self-administration by using a dietary manipulation that depletes the nutritional precursors to dopamine. This procedure was found to decrease alcohol consumption, an effect that was especially evident in a subset of drinkers thought to be hypersensitive alcohol's ascending limb dopamine effects. Overall findings suggest that alcohol co-administration with psychostimulant drugs affects patterns of alcohol intake and that this may be the result of an interaction involving dopamine neurotransmission.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816r774.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418s415</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Substance abuse</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alcoholism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A47429f71h"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Load flow feasibility under extreme contingencies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khosravi-Dehkordi, Iman</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the problem of load flow feasibility, in other words, the conditions under which a power network characterized by the load flow equations has a steady-state solution. In this thesis, we are particularly interested in load flow feasibility in the presence of extreme contingencies such as the outage of several transmission lines. Denoting the load flow equations by z = f(x) where z is the vector of specified injections (the real and reactive bus demands, the specified real power bus generations and the specified bus voltage levels), the question addressed is whether there exists a real solution x to z = f( x) where x is the vector of unknown bus voltage magnitudes at load buses and unknown bus voltage phase angles at all buses but the reference bus. Attacking this problem via conventional load flow algorithms has a major drawback, principally the fact that such algorithms do not converge when the load flow injections z define or are close to defining an infeasible load flow. In such cases, lack of convergence may be due to load flow infeasibility or simply to the ill-conditioning of the load flow Jacobian matrix. This thesis therefore makes use of the method of supporting hyperplanes to characterize the load flow feasibility region, defined as the set the injections z for which there exists a real solution x to the load flow equations. Supporting hyperplanes allow us to calculate the so-called load flow feasibility margin, which determines whether a given injection is feasible or not as well as measuring how close the injection is to the feasibility boundary. This requires solving a generalized eigenvalue problem and a corresponding optimization for the closest feasible boundary point to the given injection. The effect of extreme network contingencies on the feasibility of a given injection is examined for two main cases: those contingencies that affect the feasibility region such as line outages and those that change the given injection itself such as an increase in VAR demand or the loss of a generator. The results show that the hyperplane method is a powerful tool for analyzing the effect of extreme contingencies on the feasibility of a power network.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68km39w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429f71h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electric power systems -- Reliability -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr1722402"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>FE analysis of plastic buckling of plates with initial imperfections and simulation of experiments</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liu, Bing, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The general problem of plastic buckling of flat metal plates is a fundamental area of investigation in mechanics not only because of its intrinsic importance in the design of engineering structures, but also because it still has not been settled in a satisfying manner. Which theory of plasticity is the correct one to predict the buckling loads in the plastic range is a long-argued problem. This thesis presents finite element analyses of plastic buckling and postbuckling behaviour of columns and plates, taking into account the presence of initial out-of-plane imperfections. The FE programs constructed by the author for this purpose are used to analyze the imperfection growth of such columns and plates under axial loading and simply supported edge conditions. The material behaviour is modeled according to both the incremental and the deformation theories of strain-hardening plasticity. The programs combine both the geometric and material nonlinearities to trace the load-deflection behaviours of these structures in prebuckling (up to the maximum load) as well as postbuckling ranges. The results of the analyses for plates show the extreme sensitivity of the incremental theory, and the relative insensitivity of the deformation theory, to the initial imperfections. The programs are used to simulate the plastic buckling experiments on Aluminum tubes, taking into account their measured imperfections. The imperfection growth analyses demonstrate that the maximum load predictions of the incremental theory are quite close to those recorded in the experiments.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j949t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr1722402</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Buckling (Mechanics) -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Finite element method</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plates, Aluminum -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plates (Engineering) -- Plastic properties -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247dx72s"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Silicon carbide RF-MEM resonators</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dusatko, Tomas A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A low-temperature (&lt;300°C) method to fabricate electrostatically actuated microelectromechanical (MEM) clamped-clamped beam resonators has been developed.

The resonator beam is constructed by DC sputtering a tri-layer composite of low-stress SiC and aluminum over the thin polyimide sacrificial layer, and is then released using a microwave O 2 plasma etch. Deposition parameters have been optimized to yield low-stress films (&lt;50MPa), in order to minimize the chance of stress-induced buckling or fracture in both the SiC and aluminum. Characterization of the deposited SiC was performed using several different techniques including scanning electron microscopy, EDX and XRD. Several different clamped-clamped beam resonator designs were successfully fabricated and tested using a custom built vacuum system, with measured frequencies ranging from 5MHz to 25MHz. A novel thermal tuning method is also demonstrated, using integrated heaters directly on the resonant structure to exploit the temperature dependence of the Young's modulus and thermally induced stresses.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mp072.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247dx72s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Silicon-carbide thin films</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dielectric resonators -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Radio frequency microelectromechanical systems -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asf2689530"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Strategies for justifying violence in societal self-defense in Indian lay Jainism : a textual and ethnographic study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pokinko, Tomasz</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines Jaina strategies for justifying violence (himsa) in societal self-defense in contradistinction to the religion's overwhelming emphasis on nonviolence (ahimsa). The thesis' main focus is an ethnographic study of the views on societal self-defense of some contemporary lay Jainas in Delhi and Jaipur, India. I compare these views with the textual-historical Jaina position on ksatriya-dharma (the duty of kings) and "Just War," as advanced through ancient and medieval Jaina texts. Recent ethnographies omit the issue of Jaina attitudes to self-defense almost entirely. However, since India's nuclear tests in 1998, India has become a major Asian political, social and economic power. Indian Jainas have changed along with other Indians in the way that they see themselves in relation to the world and to other Indians. My findings suggest that major changes might have occurred since the latest ethnographic studies of Jainism in the nineties.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82kc64b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf2689530</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ahiṃsā</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jainism -- Doctrines</dc:subject><dc:subject>Violence -- Religious aspects -- Jainism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bq75r"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Simulation of antenna properties and behaviour in lossy dispersive media of the human tissues</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Yi, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The work reported in this thesis is motivated by the need for wireless powering of a miniaturized implantable device for neurophysiological research and possible clinical applications. The antenna used in such applications must be studied in the context of biological tissue media. In this thesis, we perform a preliminary study of antenna behaviour in the complex tissue environment. Our test cases are the wire dipole antenna chosen for its structural simplicity and the spiral antenna, selected for its wide bandwidth. The simulation tool SEMCAD-X, is based on the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method and is used throughout this work. To have an in-depth understanding of the characteristics of different solvers implemented in SEMCAD-X and relevant for our applications, we first simulate the antenna structures in the free-space region using both SEMCAD-X and HFSS (a Finite-Element Method (FEM) simulation software). The cross-platform comparison between these two simulation tools helps us identify the advantages of using conformal FDTD solver over the conventional staircase FDTD solver in SEMCAD-X. We then embed the antennas in tissue-like non-homogeneous lossy media to observe the terminal voltages induced by an impinging plane-wave. These numerical experiments will help us with the assessment of the following: variations of antenna properties with the in-tissue locations, and more importantly the dependence of the induced voltage on the depth of the implant.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sz16h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bq75r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Antennas (Electronics) -- Computer simulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Implants, Artificial</dc:subject><dc:subject>Telemeter (Physiological apparatus)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biosensors -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akw52jd04h"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Shockwave consolidation of nano silver powder into bulk nano structured silver</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Li, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bulk nanostructured silver components were fabricated from nano-sized powder using a shockwave consolidation technique. The grain size evolution during compaction, the mechanical properties of the bulk components, and the effect of surface finish on the mechanical behavior were studied. X-Ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), microhardness, compression testing and shear punch testing at room temperature were used to characterize the materials. Upon consolidation, the average grain size calculated from image analysis of the TEM micrographs was 49+/-22 nm, showing the feasibility of maintaining a nanostructure upon dynamic consolidation. The hardness of the bulk nanostructured components was constant across the diameter with an average of 83+/-1 HV. Compression results showed strength about 390+/-10 MPa and ductility of 23+/-2%, which is well above strength level obtainable from strain hardened Ag components. The AFM results show that samples possessing a surface roughness of 267 nm exhibited a brittle behavior and a reduction in strength of 35% when compared to the smoother surfaces. Dimples were observed for the samples exhibiting plasticity, while an intergranular pattern was identified for the brittle materials. Fracture toughness of 0.2 MPa m was calculated, which confirms the strong relationship between fracture toughness and defects observed in nanomaterials.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94ht78t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52jd04h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nanostructured materials</dc:subject><dc:subject>Silver -- Milling</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metal powders</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zz386"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Elastic-plastic buckling of infinitely long plates resting on tensionless foundations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yang, Yongchang, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is a class of plate buckling problems in which buckling occurs in the presence of a constraining medium. This type of buckling has been investigated by many researchers, mainly as buckling of elastic columns and plates on elastic foundations. Analytical solutions have been obtained by assuming the foundation to provide tensile as well as compressive reaction forces. The present work differs from the previous ones in two respects. One, the foundation is assumed to be one-sided, thus providing only the compressive resistance. Two, the plates are allowed to be stressed in the plastic, strain-hardening range. Equations for determining the buckling stresses and wavelengths are obtained by solving the differential equations for simply supported and clamped long rectangular plates stressed uniformly in the longitudinal direction. The relevance and the usefulness of the obtained formulas is demonstrated by comparing the predicted results with the experimental results of other researchers on buckling of concrete filled steel box-section and HSS columns. It is shown that the theoretical buckling loads match quite closely with the experimental ones, and hence, should prove useful in formulating rules for the design of such columns.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602510d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zz386</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Buckling (Mechanics)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arv042z39c"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>&amp;quot;There is no gravity ... &amp;quot; proposal for a new legal paradigm for air law and space law : orbit law</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Halstead, C.

The test specimens had the following dimensions: 4400 mm long, 300 mm wide and 500 mm long. The beams had 4-25M bottom reinforcing bars and 2-20M top reinforcing bars. Two series were designed with different reinforcing details: the "BA" series contained transverse reinforcement spaced at 275 mm center to center while the "BB" series had no transverse reinforcement. The specimens were cast in three batches of two specimens from each series, with each batch containing concrete with respectively 0%, 0.5% and 1% fibres content by volume. The beams were simply supported and were tested with two equal point loads located at 500 mm from the centre of the beam. This research project demonstrated a clear improvement of the shear capacity resulting from the use of steel fibres for the beams without transverse reinforcement. For the beams with transverse reinforcement, displacement ductility was highly increased. This suggests that fibres have the potential to reduce the congestion of the reinforcement if fibres are designed to replace partially closely spaced transverse reinforcement. Also, it was noted that a redistribution of stresses occurred resulting in the formation of more well-controlled cracks. Finally, the strength predictions using the method developed by Aoude (Aoude, 2007) agree very well with the experimental results.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f550j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053m59g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Metal fibers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fiber-reinforced concrete -- Testing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Concrete beams -- Testing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reinforcing bars</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88cm85g"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Survey of techniques for improving performance of organic transistors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chien, Yu-Mo, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with region-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) as active semiconductor were fabricated and characterized.

Through experimental results, it is clear that thermal annealing increases charge carrier mobility of P3HT OFETs. On average an increase of four times in charge mobility was observed after thermal annealing was performed. Dip coated samples also resulted in higher mobility values than spin coated samples. Highest charge mobility value achieved were was ~0.02 cm2/Vs for dip coated samples, where as the highest value for spin coated devices was around 6e-3 cm2/Vs. "Dry" stamping of a PDMS devices yielded devices with higher mobility values by around 100% compared to unstamped counterparts. These devices also exhibited lower parasitic leakage currents. Devices doped with FeCl3 did not perform very well.

In order to gain a better perspective, the main objective of current research is to identify additional components of the signaling pathways that are crucial for normal Drosophila development. One such developmental process is germ band retraction, which occurs in mid-embryogenesis and consists of the movement of the tail end of the germ band, or embryo proper, to its final posterior position. One of our primary objectives is to identify the signaling pathways behind this process. To this end, we investigated the 7T2 mutant, which fails to retract. This zygotic lethal mutant was originally uncovered in a screen for maternal-effect U-shaped embryonic phenotypes. Using a combination of meiotic recombination with molecularly mapped P-element insertions and complementation tests with deficiencies, we mapped the 7T2 mutant to the chromosomal region containing the gene pellino. Here, we show that both pellino mRNA and Pellino protein are missing in the 7T2 mutant tissue, indicating that 7T2 is a loss of function allele of pellino. Further characterization of the 7T2 mutant revealed three distinct phenotypes: germ band retraction defects, twisted germ bands and head defects. Based on these observations, we propose that pellino is involved in several biological processes during early Drosophila development. Here we show that pellino is involved in the JNK pathway through genetic interaction with hemipterous, an upstream member of the JNK pathway. In addition, we provide preliminary evidence suggesting that the expression of Twist, a protein induced by the Toll pathway, is affected in the absence of pellino, suggesting a role for pellino in dorsal-ventral pattern formation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p896b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059cc588</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Carrier proteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Embryology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gx93q"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cryptorhynchus melastomae (Coleoptera:Curculionidae) as a potential biocontrol agent for Miconia calvescens (Melastomataceae) in Hawaii</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Reichert, Elisabeth, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The distribution, biology and host preferences of Cryptorhynchus melastomae Champion (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) were studied in Costa Rica from May to July 2005 and January to May 2006 to determine its suitability as a biocontrol agent for Miconia calvescens DC (Melastomataceae) in Hawaii.
