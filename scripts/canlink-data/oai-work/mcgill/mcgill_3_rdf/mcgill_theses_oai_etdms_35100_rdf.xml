In Study 1, 85 heterosexual males rated the interpersonal attractiveness and perceived attitude similarity of heterosexual and homosexual targets who were either attitudinally similar, ambiguous (i.e., no-attitude-information controls), or dissimilar to the participant. The relative effect of attitude similarity and attitude dissimilarity information on attraction judgments was moderated by the perceiver's prejudice level, but not by the target's group membership. Supplementary analyses revealed that target attraction ratings were only partially mediated by participants' perceptions of attitude similarity. Study 3 expanded on these findings by investigating the combined influence of a perceiver's prejudice level and his personal need for structure (PNS) on attraction judgments for ingroup and outgroup targets. One hundred and sixteen heterosexual males participated in an identical impression formation experiment. As predicted, the relative effect of attitude similarity and attitude dissimilarity information on heterosexual and homosexual target attraction judgments was moderated jointly by the perceiver's prejudice level and by his level of PNS: Individuals who were high in PNS and prejudice assigned lower attraction ratings to dissimilar targets than to control or similar targets, who were rated equivalently (i.e., S = C &gt; D). Precisely the opposite was true of participants who were high in PNS but concurrently low in prejudice: These individuals assigned higher attraction ratings to similar targets than to control or dissimilar targets, who were rated equivalently (i.e., S &gt; C = D). This interaction between the perceivers prejudice level and the attitude similarity/dissimilarity of the target was perfectly inverted for individuals who were low, rather than high, in PNS.

Clinically, cytokine therapy has the potential of influencing disease outcome by altering the balance between proinflammatory versus immunosuppressive cytokine profiles. Somatic cytokine gene therapy is an attractive alternative to cytokine immunotherapy, because it eliminates the need for frequent protein injections, and generates more constant cytokine levels in vivo which may reduce toxicity and increase therapeutic efficacy. To study the immunoregulatory effects of TGF-beta1 and IL-4 in vivo, we used a novel method of i.m. cytokine gene therapy in 2 experimental models of Th1 cell-mediated autoimmune diseases: murine diabetes and EAE. In our first model, i.m. TGF-beta1 gene administration is effective at suppressing a DTH response, and at protecting NOD mice from autoimmune insulitis and diabetes. In this model, disease protection was associated with a decreased intrapancreatic IL-12 and IFNgamma mRNA expression. In our second model, TGF-beta1 and IL-4-IgG1 gene therapy resulted in anti-encephalitogenic effects in mice with MBP-induced EAE. TGF-beta1 gene delivery had pronounced downregulatory effects on MBP-stimulated T cell proliferation and production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. IL-4-IgG1 gene delivery also suppressed these responses and enhanced endogenous secretion of IL-4. Cytokine gene therapy resulted in a decrease in the severity of CNS inflammatory lesions. With either treatment, CNS IL-12 and IFNgamma mRNA expression was significantly diminished, while IL-4 and TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were increased compared to control mice. In summary, i.m. delivery of cytokine plasmid vectors suppressed pathogenic Th1 responses, while enhancing the production of protective, regulatory cytokines in peripheral lymphoid and/or target tissues.

The Theory of poroelasticity has been successfully applied to examine time-dependent transient phenomena in a variety of natural and synthetic materials, including geomaterials and biomaterials. The assumption of elastic behaviour of the porous skeleton in these developments is a significant limitation in the application of this theory to brittle geomaterials; which could exhibit non-elastic phenomena either in the form of initiation and extension of discrete fractures, or in the form of initiation and evolution of continuum damage in the porous skeleton. The computational methodology developed in this study examines the effect of development of such defects (fracture or damage) on the fluid transport characteristics and the poroelastic behaviour of saturated geomaterials. The finite element based computational models for fracture and damage phenomena examine two-dimensional plane strain and axisymmetric problems. The classical theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics is extended to examine the timedependent behaviour of local effects at the crack tip in poroelastic media. The numerical procedure accounts for the stress singularity of the effective stress field at the crack tip. The damage model based on the concept of continuum damage mechanics, takes into account the alteration of the stiffness and permeability characteristics of porous material due to development of micromechanical damage in the porous skeleton. The isotropic damage criteria governing the evolution of stiffness and permeability parameters are characterized by the dependency of damage parameters on the distortional strain invariant. As the applications of the theory of poroelasticity diversify, attention needs to be focused on other aspects of importance. The class of transient and steady crack extension in poroelastic media is recognized as an area of interest in geomechanics applications and in energy resources recovery from geological formations. A computational algorithm is developed to examine the transient quasi-static crack extension in poroelastic media where the temporal and spatial variations of boundary conditions governing the displacement, traction and pore pressure fields are taken into account in the incremental analysis. The path of crack extension is established by a mixed-mode crack extension criterion applicable to the porous fabric. The computational modelling of steady state crack extension in poroelastic media at constant velocity is also examined for the plane strain problems. The finite element formulations of the governing equations, which are velocity-dependent, are developed by employing the Galerkin technique. The poroelastic behaviour of material depends on the propagation velocity at the crack tip. The computational schemes developed in this study followed an extensive procedure of verification via known analytical solutions to poroelasticity problems and for limiting cases of initial undrained (t → 0+) and final drained (t → +infinity) elastic responses recovered through analogous problems in classical elasticity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Selvadurai, A.

The production of the repellent appears to be mediated by the degree of environmentally induced stress experienced by the larvae. Whereas waters from fully fed larvae were highly attractive as an oviposition site, these were rendered progressively less attractive, and eventually strongly repellent as the larvae were deprived of food over a period of 7 days. Crowding of the larvae elicited similar repellent effects as did close contact between larvae and the walls of the container in which they were reared. The site of infection in the tissues of the mosquito larvae also influenced the intensity of repellency. Thus, infections of the head and thorax induced the highest degree of repellency, and infections of the abdomen the lowest. The repellent effect overrode attraction and remained stable for more than one week at 27°C, and even longer at lower temperatures. Stressors which induced repellency all precipitated similar physical and physiological changes in mosquito larvae. They reduced wet and dry weights and the concentration of serum carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins and lipids. Both infection and crowding rendered larvae anorexic. As well, infected larvae appeared to be unable to convert trehalose to glucose, thereby exacerbating the energy deficit. Incubating infected larvae in a dilute glucose solution significantly reduced the repellent effect of their waters. Addition of glucose to already repellent waters had little effect. Larvae of another species, Aedes atropalpus Coquillett, were equally capable of producing repellent effects when infected with P. elegans, and gravid females of Ae. aegypti were equally sensitive to these as to conspecific waters.

The sensitive air-volume of the extrapolation chamber is controlled through the movement of the chamber piston by means of a micrometer mounted to the phantom body. The relative displacement of the piston is monitored by a mechanical distance travel indicator with a precision on the order of 0.002 mm. Irradiations were carried out with cobalt-60 gamma. rays, x-ray beams ranging from 4 to 18 MV, and electron beams between 6 and 22 MeV. The absorbed dose at a given depth in Solid-WaterTM is proportional to the ionization gradient measured in the Bragg-Gray cavity region with a Solid-WaterTM embedded extrapolation chamber. Measured charge is corrected for ion recombination and ion diffusion in the chamber air volume according to a comprehensive model for charge loss in an ionization chamber. The discrepancies between doses determined with our uncalibrated phantom-embedded extrapolation chamber and doses obtained with calibrated Farmer-type cylindrical ionization chambers following the AAPM-TG21 and AAPM-TG25 dosimetry protocols are less than 1% for photon and electron beams at all clinical megavoltage energies. Uncalibrated extrapolation chambers thus offer a simple and practical alternative to other techniques used in output measurements of megavoltage photon and electron beams.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Podgorsak, E.

The primary interest was to find out whether outliers observed on time series charts of literatures are due to information epidemics, whether these epidemics are widespread occurrences in physics, whether literatures showing such rapid growth arise mainly due to the influence of an important work and, if so, what characterizes these literatures. Information epidemics were defined as spurts of growth in the literature of a field that reflect a sudden excitement and increase in activity. It was hypothesized that information epidemics are common occurrences in the growth of the physics literature and that outliers observed during the growth of a field are caused by influential works that attract new workers into it and cause them to publish extensively. Growth spurts where information epidemics lead to a permanent change and the emergence of a new subspecialty are termed knowledge epidemics. The monthly number of abstracts indexed by each chapter of Physics Abstracts between 1977 and 1987 was plotted on a time series chart and an envelope of +/-3 standard deviations was fitted around the regression line. All spikes that crossed the envelope were considered to be outliers and thus potential information epidemics. The abstracts contained in each outlier were identified in the Science Citation Index and analyzed for spread (corporate sources of authors) and impact (citations). Results show that information epidemics exist, but they are not widespread. Only four information epidemics were identified in the data. They are in chapters 2 (mathematical methods), 36 (clusters), 73 (heterostructures) and 74 (superconductivity). Only the growth in superconductivity can be considered to be a knowledge epidemic. All four arose due to new instrumentation and/or cheaper materials and are examples of puzzle-generating and enabling science. A second major result was that information epidemics are caused by as well as carried forward by groups of influential works. Third, increased activity in a given field is accompanied by an increase in conference papers. On the other hand, the journal literature of a given field is sufficient to represent the direction of literature, growth accurately. This work confirms and extends the epidemic model for the growth of literatures by demonstrating that not only does the contagion effect exist in physics but that there is also a catalyst effect present. It provides a statistical description for the growth and decline of fields of research.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rees-Potter, Lorna K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333408g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pf682</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Science publishing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Scientific literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qk49q"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The colloidal and liquid crystal properties of surface modified chitin crystallites</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Jinjiang, 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Chitin crystallites were prepared from crab chitin using HCl hydrolysis. On avenge, the surface charge density of the chitin crystallites was calculated to be 0.5 e/nm2 based on conductimetric titration data. The formation of a chiral nematic phase in aqueous suspensions of chitin crystallites and the in situ texture of the crystallite suspensions were investigated using polarised optical microscopy and freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy. The effect of the interparticle electrostatic interaction on phase separation has been explored through phase diagrams and the interaction energy was calculated based on experimental zeta potentials. The flow properties of the liquid crystalline phases of chitin crystallites have been studied rheologically. Shear thinning behaviour and a two-regime flow curve were observed for isotropic suspensions and biphasic suspensions respectively. A typical three-regime flow curve for liquid crystalline polymers was found for the anisotropic suspension of chitin crystallites. The maximum in the viscosity-concentration curve was found at the phase transition concentration: isotropic to biphasic. Chitin crystallites were systematically deacetylated using NaOH hydrolysis. It was found dud the reaction was pseudo first order. These modified crystallites are highly charged. Their phase behaviour contradicts the theoretical prediction by Stroobants et al. in addition, crystallites with a different extent of N-sulfonation were obtained in an aqueous medium using triethylamine/sulfur trioxide (TEA/SO3) by controlling the TEA/SO3 concentration used in the reaction.

Previous studies demonstrated that this structure facilitates the unwinding of mRNA 5' secondary structure through the action of eukaryotic initiation factors eIF-4A, eIF-4B and eIF-4F. eIF-4F contains three subunits of which one, eIF-4E, contains the cap binding site. To investigate the possible regulation of eIF-4E, an initiation factor whose limiting nature and activity have been implicated in the regulation of translation and cell growth, several murine cDNAs were isolated and characterized. Multiple mRNAs were shown to exist for eIF-4E, which are generated by differential polyadenylation. In addition, tissue-specific differences in eIF-4E mRNA expression and utilization of polyadenylation sites were demonstrated. To elucidate the mechanism of RNA unwinding, the interaction of eIF-4A, eIF-4B and eIF-4F with RNA was studied by examining RNA-complex formation in relation to unwinding activity. eIF-4F and eIF-4B form stable complexes with duplex RNA. These complexes dissociate in the presence of ATP, concomitant with the RNA unwinding, suggesting that they represent intermediates in the unwinding process of mRNA. An RNA unwinding assay was used to compare the RNA helicase activities of initiation factors from different species. Yeast eIF-4A was able to effectively substitute for mammalian eIF-4A in combination with mammalian eIF-4B in RNA unwinding, whereas wheat germ eIF-4A was able to partially substitute. Mammalian eIF-4A was able to substitute in the wheat germ RNA unwinding system. These results suggest that initiation factor requirements for RNA unwinding are largely similar in mammals, plants and yeast.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sonenberg, Nahum</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zj49b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj2363854</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602254v"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of al-Risālah al-bāhirah</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hirji, Boustan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A study of al-Risalah al-Bahirah presents a departure in the interpretation of Abu Y`acqub al-Sijistani's (d. approximately between 386/996 and 393/1002--3) writings.

It identifies the sources of student's pressure and discusses the cultural, social, and economic conditions that influence a fiercely competitive educational system. The focus of this study is the impact of academic pressures on Japanese students. Japanese education is a single-minded drive for achievement that results in what many refer to as examination hell. The university entrance examination is at the root of the pressures that are placed on students and is the primary mechanism responsible for driving competition. The life-long ramifications of students performance on this examination are far reaching. As a result, the pressures that are exerted upon students to achieve are overwhelming. Mothers, teachers, peers, and society contribute to the pressures that are placed on students to achieve, while many children continue to fall victim to emotional, psychological, and physical harm. The study provides richly descriptive narrative accounts of student's experiences, thoughts and feelings seen from a student's perspective.

Gastrointestinal side effects were more common in chloroquine users (68%) than in mefloquine users (56%) (p = 0.04). No difference was observed in proportions of psychological side effects between groups; however, they were more commonly reported in the mefloquine group.

The exercising group were defined as individuals participating in at least five weekly 45 minute exercise sessions of an aerobic nature (60-85% estimated maximal oxygen uptake). The sedentary subjects were only irregularly engaged in bouts of physical activity, not more than 45 minutes per week. Seasonal data were collected: one data collection in the fall and one in the spring. A 20 day food and exercise journal was maintained during each season's data collection period. Blood lipids were measured on two and anthropometric and aerobic capacity testing were performed on 1 occasion during each season. Statistical analyses consisted of a two way ANOVA (exercise and season) to control for seasonal effects on blood lipids and lipoprotein levels. Pearson product moment correlations were calculated between those variables that showed significant seasonal or level of activity changes. Exercising males consumed significantly greater amounts of energy (p $&lt;$ 0.001), carbohydrates (p $&lt;$ 0.0001), protein (p $&lt;$ 0.0001), and dietary fibre (p $&lt;$ 0.0001) than sedentary males; sedentary males however, consumed significantly greater amounts of alcohol than exercising males. Exercising males had significantly higher aerobic capacities and degrees of mesomorphy than sedentary subjects and exhibited significantly lower apo AI values. No differences were noted between the 2 groups in BMI, % body fat, other plasma lipids or CETP mass. In summary, regular physical activity in young, healthy male subjects was associated with increased energy and carbohydrate intake and improved aerobic capacity as compared to sedentary subjects. Moderate differences in physical activity were not however associated with alterations in plasma lipoprotein composition or CETP concentration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Koski, Kristine</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827d403.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r486d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lipoproteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lipids in human nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exercise -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jw36h"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Promoting the acquisition of active knowledge with the use of computer multimedia : establishing a theoretical basis for guidelines in instructional software design</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Auclair, Christian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The multimedia computer is a relatively new product that is capable of presenting information through a variety of media such as text, animation, video &amp; sound. Commercial developers, researchers and other multimedia advocates have been making claims about the potential for multimedia in promoting learning and, consequently, its beneficial uses as a learning tool within the classroom. This study investigates the conditions under which the organization and coordination of multimedia sources promotes the acquisition of knowledge. Based upon a review of the literature, five hypotheses are generated with respect to the development of instructional software as an effective learning tool. These hypotheses are then tested in a study that looks at the effects of various multimedia designs. One hundred students, half of high-ability (i.e., high-stream) and the other half of average ability (i.e., regular stream), were assigned to one of five multimedia conditions (e.g., text only (T); text with animation (TA); text with animations and captions (TAC); animations and captions (AC); refined animation and captions (RAC)). The instructional material presented information on how to find South using two sticks, some string and the Sun. The TAC and RAC groups outperformed the other three groups on scores of verbal recall, visual recall, and enactment of the main procedures. These two groups also obtained higher scores on detailed analyses of written recalls. Finally, interaction effects for stream level and computer presentation group were also obtained. The results from this study are contrasted to those of an earlier study by Breuleux et al. (1993). The implications of these results are discussed in terms of statistical support for theoretically based guidelines for the development and design of effective instructional multimedia.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Breuleux, Alain</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f5265.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jw36h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer-assisted instruction -- Computer programs</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb3979908"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The oxygen cost of horizontal and grade running on the treadmill with female runners</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tzavellas, Georgia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the vertical component of the American College of Sports Medicine (A.C.S.M.)

Twenty-three female runners (20 to 33 years) participated in (1) a VO$ sb2$max test, (2) five 6 min running economy (RE) tests at 133 m/min, (3) five 6 min RE tests at 160 m/min, and (4) three 6 min RE tests at 186 m/min. The RE tests at 133 and 160 m/min were performed at the following grades: 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0%. The RE tests at 186 m/min were performed at 0, 2.5, and 5.0% grade. The RE tests were administered in random order. There was a linear relationship between VO$ sb2$ and horizontal running velocity with a slope of 0.20 ml/kg.m (r = 0.996; p $&lt;$.01). There was a linear relationship between VO$ sb2$ and percent grade when running on a treadmill. The correlations for the regression equations at speeds of 133, 160, and 186 m/min were 0.90 (p $&lt;$.01), 0.86 (p $&lt;$.01), and 0.73 (p $&lt;$.01), respectively. Inclusion of a grade component in the regression analysis equation increased the accuracy for predicting the VO$ sb2$ of grade running. VO$ sb2$ consumption for grade running can be predicted using the following equation: VO$ sb2$ (ml/kg.min) = 3.5 + 0.198(speed in m/min + 0.932 grade(%)) + 0.006(speed(m/min) * grade(%)).

Finally, the subjects completed a written questionnaire which helped determine their personal preferences with respect to learning with background music. A Group (2) by Trial (2) by Dribbling Variables (5) ANOVA with repeated measures on Trial was conducted on the dribbling performance scores. Results showed that there was no significant difference between the nonmusic and the music groups on these dribbling performances for four out of the five dribble variables. However, scores of the music group increased more than those of the nonmusic group for three of the five variables. Subjects in the music group demonstrated a more desirable social behaviour than the subjects in the nonmusic group. In addition, the subjects' responses to the questionnaire showed that an overwhelming number of subjects in both groups preferred to have background music played during activity. Therefore, background music may have an important place in the learning environment in terms of behaviour and attitude, which might ultimately enhance learning.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Downey, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vj479.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q08z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Basketball</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music -- Physiological effect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motor ability in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Perceptual-motor learning</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gv36p"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Isolation and molecular characterisation of a multigene family of peroxidases in flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Omann, Franz</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) peroxidase cDNAs (FLXPER1--4) were isolated from a lambdagt10 shoot library using probes encoding the amino termini of class III plant peroxidases. These probes were obtained by PCR amplification of the library with lambda primers flanking the EcoRI cloning site, and a mixed oligonucleotide corresponding to the catalytic domain (HFHDCFV) found in secretory plant peroxidases. The transcriptional expressions of FLXPER1 and FLXPER2 appear to be specific to stem based on northern blot analyses. FLXPER1 and FLXPER2 encode acidic peroxidases of calculated isoelectric points (pIc) 4.6 and 4.7, respectively. However, FLXPER1 differs from FLXPER2 in amino acid sequence and in the possession of additional amino acids at its carboxy terminus containing motifs found in membrane-anchored proteins. The FLXPER1 anchoring motifs show striking similarity to those found in a blue copper-type protein (LP18) whose expression in pea (Pisum sativum) has been correlated with lignin deposition. FLXPER3 is expressed in leaf, root, and stein. Partial genomic sequences of FLXPER3 and a highly homologous FLXPER5 were also obtained. FLXPER3 and FLXPER5 do not have the typical class HI plant peroxidase third intron, located within the highly conserved VALSGAHT haem-binding motif. FLXPER3 and FLXPER5 do have, however, an intron downstream of this motif at a location not found in any other class III plant peroxidase gene. FLXPER4 encodes a basic (pIc 8.5) extracellular peroxidase. A modified version of the restriction fragment length polymorphism-coupled domain-directed differential display (RC4D) technique was used to evaluate class III peroxidase transcriptional expression in flax organs. The method revealed the expression of 20 to 30 peroxidase genes in each plant organ examined. It also confirmed the stem-specific nature of FLXPER2 and the ubiquitous character of FLXPER3.

Two teachers and their students were observed during all the 1992--1993 school year, as they taught social studies lessons. The contexts for the study are one grade 3--4 French classroom and one grade 3 French immersion classroom. We used ethnographic tools of inquiry such as participant observation, fieldnotes, audiotaped lessons, official documents, formal and informal interviews during our data collection phases. A qualitative analysis of the teaching strategies and the literacy events relates to the role and importance of writing in French in social studies within the context French as L1 and French as L2. Findings show that in their practice, both teachers are generally more preoccupied with the content of teaching than aspects related to the language of instruction. The analysis also reveals that writing in the social studies consists of simulated tasks in which students are asked to regularly fill out worksheets. Implications of this study could be used to increase teachers' awareness of the language of instruction, the role of the writing process in learning a L2 through the social studies. This study allowed us: (1) to describe the characteristics of teaching French in L1 and L2 social studies; (2) to identify and explain the similarities and the differences related to integration of the language and content within two learning contexts; to determine the importance and the role of writing in the teaching-learning of social studies content within two learning contexts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maguire, Mary H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tb151.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z264g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Elementary school teaching -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social sciences -- Study and teaching (Elementary) -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Case studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514nn08g"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The emergence of a nationalizing Canadian state in a geopolitical context : 1896-1911</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Osborne, Geraint B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is concerned with the relationship between geopolitics and the emergence of a "nationalizing Canadian state" at the beginning of the twentieth century. Previous constitutional approaches and economic accounts are not sufficient to explain the emergence of a nationalizing Canadian state. All of these have been insightful, but like economic accounts of nationalism they ignore the larger realm of geopolitics. The literature on state formation has demonstrated that many factors stimulate state formation, but perhaps no other is as important as geopolitics. Geopolitics is concerned with diplomacy, arms, and territory. Such things are seldom discussed when writing about Canada. Canadians dislike being perceived as a military people. Yet geopolitical events have been central to the development of a distinct nationalizing Canadian state. During this period Canadian state elites took steps to gain further control of diplomacy, develop the military arm of the state so as to protect its sovereignty, and consolidate its territory. Additionally, all of these developments increased the scope of the state's functions. Moreover, under the leadership of Prime minister Wilfrid Laurier, the liberal nature of its regime meant that the national identity that began to develop had strong leanings towards civic nationalism. This thesis will attempt to integrate a sociological theory of nation-state building with the already established literature on the geopolitical relations between Canada, Great Britain, and the United States. Through the application of historical sociology, it illustrates the validity of exploring Canadian nation and state building in a geopolitical context and adds to the literature on state formation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hall, John A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128c643.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nn08g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada -- Politics and government -- 1896-1911</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Canada -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geopolitics -- Canada -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At148fj840"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Breast feeding and growth in western Kenyan toddlers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Onyango, Adelheid Werimo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The value of post-infancy breast feeding for growth and nutrition has been the subject of debate and controversy.

I argue that these authors are reworking the metafictional form by using visual strategies (such as reflection, distortion and point of view) to explore the complex relationship that us created when the woman narrator when she is both subject and object of her own fictional autobiography. I use the artistic form of anamorphosis as the overriding metaphor for discussing this relation and its manifestation in these texts. Paintings and drawings in which the anamorphic form is used depend upon strategic distortion, indirect viewing and perspective for their effect. Anamorphoses present exploded, fragmented images which, through the strategic positioning of the viewer, are reconfigured into recognizable forms. The emphasis in these works of visual art is upon the moment at which these images are reconfigured. In literary works, I argue, the emphasis is on the process of creating a distorted image and on that which is contained in the spaces that are revealed through the process of exploding that image. This metaphor allows me to explore the interdependence of the visual and written elements of self-representation in these novels and the simultaneous, shifting, mutually informing relation between a narrating, subjective "I" and a narrative "eye" (with its emphasis on the visual, on perspective, and on point of view). The resistant, reinscriptive and interrogative strategy of "literary anamorphosis" moves these novels beyond the confines of linear, literary forms to create a distinct, feminist, narrative space in which women writing in Canada can articulate the complex politics of their positions in but not of the masculinist Master Narratives that have historically defined and controlled them.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooke, Nathalie</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r951h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483k95v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Marlatt, Daphne -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anamorphosis (Visual perception)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atwood, Margaret, 1939- -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Laurence, Margaret -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rq471"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A method for identifying geometrically simple surfaces from three dimensional images</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacDonald, J.

One major area of research in this field involves automatically creating computerized representations of the brain which are in a form suitable for neuroanatomic analysis. The principle drawback of contemporary methods of generating these digital models is the incompleteness and ambiguity of the input data, which is typically under-sampled relative to the features of interest. A method is presented here for creating surface-based models of neuroanatomy that address the data incompleteness issue with an integrated combination of two model-based approaches. The first approach involves applying proximity and self-intersection restrictions on surfaces in order to create a plausible neuroanatomical model in the face of data with topologies inconsistent with medical knowledge. The second approach involves identifying multiple surfaces simultaneously, with inter-surface constraints, in order to use general neuroanatomical information to correct areas where the data is incomplete or ambiguous. The overall method is one of deforming a set of polyhedral meshes, with the above constraints and others incorporated into an objective function, which is minimized to find the best fit of a model to the data. Validation of this method on simple phantoms as well as in the task of segmentation of human cortical surfaces is demonstrated.

Its idyllic setting on the mountainside, overlooking the city and the St Lawrence River, was a natural magnet for wealthy nineteenth-century families, just as it had been in the days of fur traders such as James McGill. As an urban environment, however, the Golden Square Mile was far more complicated than the sum of its mansions. Despite a long history of habitation by gentlemen farmers, the "GSM" took shape only as of mid-century, accompanying the rise of capitalist institutions and the middle classes. Furthermore, it was the result of a considerable amount of planning and salesmanship, which made fortunes for some landowners and speculators even before the first mansions appeared. The anglophone, Protestant character of the area also had to be encouraged, reflecting a growing cultural dichotomy within Montreal society. This thesis considers the Golden Square Mile within the context of urban history: it is a study of town planning, land ownership, architecture, and social geography. It also considers the built environment as a venue for broader social and cultural change.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Young, Brian</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t087b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988m79k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Montréal (Québec) -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Landowners -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Land tenure -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
