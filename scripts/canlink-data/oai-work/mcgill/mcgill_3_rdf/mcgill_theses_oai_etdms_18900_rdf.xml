Most investigations are concerned with single valued continuous mappings and the trend has been to search for ever larger classes of spaces for which fixed point conditions can be derived. Studies have, however, been made notably by M. H. A. Newman (15) and P. A. Smith (17) of the question of periodic transformations i.e. transformations some power of which is the identity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zassenhaus, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278z36s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b279d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p096b97t"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Induced representations of lie algebras</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Noonan, Bernard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The representations of Lie algebras have been considered extensively, in the bibliography are listed references most pertinent to this paper. In its treatment of the representation of Lie algebras, this paper differs from previous investigations in the particular stress it places upon the interrelation of the representation of the Lie algebra and the corresponding representation it induces on an ideal. This point of view leads to quite explicit forms for certain representations of Lie algebras which the author believes to be original.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zassenhaus, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924g764.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096b97t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j3336362"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The nationality of aircraft</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nemeth, John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>“Tout aérostat doit avoir une nationalité“. This phrase, a prophesy at the beginning of aviation, is now the law. Nationality is also symbolic of the role of aircraft in the modern world, in which they are heralds of international goodwill or forerunners of the evil intentions of an aggressor. The preamble of the Chicago Convention states : " International civil aviation can greatly help to create and preserve friendship and understanding among the nations and people of the world, yet its abuse can become a threat to the general security. " Is it then absurd that positive law has invested aircraft with nationality like ships in the past?</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooper, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v9690.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j3336362</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tt220"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of adrenocorticotrophin on plasma protein regeneration in the rat following depletion by massive hemorrhage</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Neiman, Gregory. M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There have been many attempts to elucidate the dynamics of the repeatedly observed increased urinary nitrogen exertion following the administration of adrenocorticotrophin and adrenal steroids. Dr. J. S. L. Browne postulated that these hormones might exert their effect by mobilizing, or "loosening", the body tissue proteins from the internal body sources for the purpose of supplying protein building materials to loci where they might be needed (1). It was suggested that this hypothesis might be tested in the plasma protein depleted rat by studying the effects of these hormones on the regeneration of plasma protein.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mackenzie, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd376166b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tt220</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881r11p"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The physical nature of the critical opalescence</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Murray, Francis.

Both these agents had been previously studied by other investigators, but it was thought of interest to investigate them further because some of the results reported were contradictory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Heard, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930c225p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945v90f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
