The experience of these Society participants is divided between aspects of continuity and change before and after the First World War. During this time-frame, London Society, as the community of a ruling class culture, may be seen to have undergone the transition from having been an aristocratic entity dominated by the political and social prestige of the landed classes, to that of an expanded body, more reflective of democratic evolution and innovation. The memoir testimony treated in this inquiry affords a means of reflecting not only Society's passage of experience but also more pointedly, its evaluation, shedding light on the values and vulnerability of a hitherto assured, discreet and otherwise adaptive class character at a time of accelerated change and challenge.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vs07p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75r896n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>London (England) -- Social life and customs -- History -- 19th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>London (England) -- Social life and customs -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aristocracy (Social class) -- England -- London -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aristocracy (Social class) -- England -- London -- History -- 19th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g6288"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sources of cubist architecture in Bohemia : the theories of Pavel Janak</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Žantovská Murray, Irena, 1946-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The sources of the theories underlying Czech Cubist architecture before World War I have been only sketchily studied to date. To analyze these theories and identify their sources, I focus on the work of architect and theorist Pavel Janak (1882-1956), an early proponent of Cubist architecture in Bohemia. The thesis incorporates my translation of Janak's unpublished journal for 1911-1914, the dominant years of Czech Cubism. Through this journal and Janak's published writings, together with an examination of his own readings, I trace the development of his theories, and situate his sources, within their historical context. Janak was no mere imitator of French Cubism but was concerned to develop innovative architecture that yet possessed both historical continuity and universal validity, thanks to its space-creating qualities. The thesis includes a facsimile of Janak's journal with its numerous sketches, a translation en face, and a complete bibliography of his sources.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sr24h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g6288</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Janák, Pavel, 1882-1956 -- Diaries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- Czechoslovakia -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cubism -- Czechoslovakia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Janák, Pavel, 1882-1956</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bg16z"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hamiltonian systems and loop groups applied to equations of KdV type</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>New, Stephen J.

Segal and Wilson have explained how a differential operator L and an eigenfunction called the Baker function $ psi sb{W}$ can be associated to each point $W in Gr$. In this thesis, we give a vector version of the construction described by Segal and Wilson. Then spaces $W in Gr$ correspond to sections of $E sb0$ over $ tilde S { lambda = infty }$, the r-dimensional space of Baker functions corresponds to the space of holomorphic sections of $E sb{t}$, and the differential operator L corresponds to the matricial polynomial $L sb{t}( lambda).$</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b7330.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bg16z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz8060968"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Some integral equations connected with statistical distribution theory</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Munsaka, Melvin Slaighter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis looks at certain integral equations which are used to obtain statistical distributions, particularly in the multivariate case.

These difficulties include large impact forces and long task completion times. A design goal is to present trajectory generation and control strategies to overcome these problems. A cost function based on the magnitude of the largest possible impact force and the longest possible time to complete the task is minimized with respect to the trajectory parameters to yield an optimal trajectory. The cost function is determined by bounds given to the unknown parameters. These parameters are estimated in order to improve performance. The one dimensional problem of manipulating a load along a horizontal surface including contact with a vertical surface is simulated. The mass of the load and the force of Coulombic friction are estimated. The simulations show that the optimal trajectory presented in this thesis provides a good tradeoff between impact force reduction and reduction in task completion times. Moreover, the simulations show that the use of parameter estimation significantly improves performance as measured by the aforementioned cost function.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g133m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354g465</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj139310t"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An exploration of the career goals of undergraduate physical science students : where are the women in science?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Harris, Eileen Ophelia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explored variables affecting and factors related to the career choices of female and male undergraduate physical science students.

Results indicated that there was a decline in the enrollment rate for women in all science programmes (except for geology) and an increase in enrollment for males in all programmes (except for geology and physics). Contrary to previous findings, the results suggested that women in science programmes wish to remain in science or science-related occupations.

A new composite material, TaC infiltrated with Al proved to be successful. Stable plasmas were produced containing up to 30% titanium tetrachloride in argon at a current of 100 amperes, an interelectrode gap of 4 mm, and a magnetic field strength of 1000 Gauss.

In June of 1940 when France succumbed to the onslaught of the Nazis, the territory, like all other French holdings in the New World, fell under the control of the Vichy French government. But on December 24th, 1941, the Islands were seized by a Free French Naval task force acting under the direction of Charles de Gaulle, who had ordered this action not only in direct contradiction to the expressed wishes of the Allies, but also after having specifically assured them that he would not attempt to undertake such a move. The result was a serious diplomatic crisis, the ramifications of which far outweighed any importance the Islands themselves may have had. For by seizing this territory de Gaulle had brought himself into direct conflict with U.S. policy regarding the Western Hemisphere and, in addition, created great difficulties between the Allies over the issue of U.S. recognition of Vichy, versus British support for de Gaulle. This thesis, then, will examine the events which led up to this crisis, and will attempt to ascertain what significance, if any, it had on the conduct of the war as a whole.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p834r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257g18r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- France</dc:subject><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- Saint Pierre and Miquelon</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saint Pierre and Miquelon -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab8515p465"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Zinc oxide thin film fabrication, characterization and application to acoustic fibers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tang, Zhirong</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>High quality, well oriented Zinc Oxide polycrystal thin films on oriented Si crystal surfaces and amorphous SiO$ sb2$/Si, Corning Glass and Al/SiO$ sb2$/Si substrates have been produced by a DC conical reactive S-GUN magnetron sputtering technique.

(Robert David)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The majority of commentators have taken Luke 12:5 as a reference to God, while a few well-known New Testament scholars have taken it to be a reference to Satan. Yet neither position has adequately substantiated its interpretation with reference to the setting in Luke's gospel. We argue that taking it as a reference to Satan makes better sense of the passage within its context. The literature is reviewed to show which commentators, namely Conzelmann, Wink and Lampe, have understood this verse as a reference to Satan. A comparison with the parallel text in Matthew reveals the differences in text and context between Matthew and Luke. These are significant enough to allow for different interpretations of the reference in Matthew and Luke. Focussing on $ varepsilon chi o upsilon sigma grave iota alpha$ and Satan shows that Luke uses these concepts in a more developed way, and ascribes authority to Satan in his writings. This interpretation of Luke 12:5 fits in well with the theme of conflict developed in Luke's gospel. The cumulative weight of these arguments points in the direction of Luke 12:5 being a reference to Satan.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fj220.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gf15t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Devil -- Biblical teaching</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97kr66h"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La poésie dissipée dans Notre-Dame de Paris, 1482</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Trottier, André</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Notre-Dame de Paris 1482, by Victor Hugo, is a work which collects many genres.

Rubens' experience was personal, for a close examination of a select number of his works demonstrates that he fully assimilated this humanistic tradition. He participated in the intellectual currents of his time, the source of ars hortulorum. In his pictures, Rubens took over forms found in gardens of antiquity, the Renaissance or the Baroque and, in certain instances, recreated the mood, function and sense found in these gardens and as described by literary works. Most important, Rubens' own life of villeggiatura is clearly made evident in several of these paintings. His preference for the humanistic hortus over the garden traditions of other countries reveals Rubens' admiration, shared with other humanists for the ancients and their culture which provided personal models for poise and enlightenment.

Through the use of Greimas' model, the study underlines the importance in the choice of the songs and in the strategic place they occupy within each play.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n2040301.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk99v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Laberge, Marie, 1950- -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67js311"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Artificial space debris and international law</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fortin, Pierre, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In just three decades of human exploration and utilization of outer space, an unwanted legacy of thousands of artificial space debris has been left behind. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the appropriate technical aspects of the artificial space debris issue and to explore the legal ramifications of the question. The first chapter is devoted to the technical aspects and covers topics such as the origins and location of artificial space debris, the hazards they constitute, the anticipated damage that might be caused by such debris and the likelihood of its occurrence. In the second chapter, the legal aspects are explored by first looking at space law generally. A brief historical perspective of space law as well as the role of the United Nations in the making of space law is offered. Space law as it relates to the space debris issue is then analysed by first trying to define terms such as "space object", "component parts" and "space debris". Particular emphasis is then placed on issues like jurisdiction and control over space debris, international responsibility for space debris, their identification and, finally, liability for damage caused by space debris.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t040f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67js311</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akp78gh476"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The regulation of non-scheduled air services under bilateral air transport agreements</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thaker, Jitendra S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Many nations, except the United States, have long regulated non-scheduled air services under their bilateral air transport agreements. Though inconstant and largely superficial, this regulation has served to alleviate the constrictive effects of multifarious laws and regulations, enacted to keep charter expansion in check. The (mainly) unilateral, diverse legal regimes charters have had to face have not stopped their growth. The late 1960s saw their worth: inter alia, their low fares facilitated tourism, filled empty aircraft seats, and injected some competition into a highly regulated industry. The Americans then realised that, absent the legal uncertainty that continuously plagued charters, and fueled by free-enterprise concepts, non-scheduled US carriers, to their benefit, could move substantial national traffic. Legal certainty and competition, assured by bilateral treaties, led the United States to begin substantial bilateral regulation of charter services. This evolution of non-scheduled air services, through bilateralism, is traced in this thesis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fc88b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gh476</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Transportation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fm83j"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The measles virus V protein</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wardrop, Elizabeth Ann</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The measles virus (MV) V protein has been predicted to arise from an edited phosphoprotein (P) mRNA, in which an additional nontemplated G residue has been inserted, thereby permitting access to another reading frame. The P and V proteins have identical amino-termini but differ in their carboxy-terminal residues. Although an edited P mRNA has been detected in MV-infected cells, no corresponding protein has yet been identified in vivo (Cattaneo et al., 1989). The present research characterizes the V protein in vivo. Antisera directed against synthetic peptides corresponding to five different regions of the MV V protein were prepared. Three of these regions were located in the amino-coterminal region, while two were located in the unique V carboxyl terminus region. The resulting peptide antisera were used to immunoprecipitate in vitro and in vivo synthesized P and V proteins. V protein (M$ sb{ rm r}$ 40,000) was detected in MV-infected Vero cells by immunoprecipitation, and found to be phosphorylated. Immunofluorescence techniques revealed that the V protein was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of infected Vero cells.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bq51w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm83j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mn35r"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Forum non conveniens : foreign plaintiffs and U.S. aviation litigation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sasamori, Norman Cousins</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the doctrine of forum non conveniens as follows.

A detailed sampling program was conducted on the grinding and gravity circuits. Samples were screened and each size class was processed on a Mozley Laboratory Separator to determine free gold content. The performance of pinched sluices, Knelson concentrators, and a riffleless table is characterized on the basis of particle size, shape and liberation of gold. The amount of total gold and free gold in each size class of grinding circuit streams was also determined. The pinched sluices recover from 8 to 17% gold in 4.8 to 7.3% of the mass. The double sluice recovers slightly more gold at a higher yield than the single sluice. In addition, the double sluice performed better at a higher feed density. The 76 cm (30") Knelson recovers 62 to 71% of the feed gold, at very high upgrading ratios (326 to 480). Free gold recovery is high, generally above 90% for all size classes. Gold recovery decreases when wash water pressure is lowered from 100 to 40 kPa; a 90 minute cycle time does not cause concentrate overload, i.e. decreased gold recovery. The 19 cm (7.5") Knelson used in the gold room yielded 90% recovery. Reprocessing the tails in the same unit give only a marginal gold recovery, suggesting that a single pass is adequate. Fine gold losses on the riffleless table are significant, especially in $-$38 $ mu$m (400 mesh).</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322f39n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tw332</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612p810"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Constraints and their satisfaction in the recovery of local surface structure</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lagarde, Jean W. (Jean Wilfrid)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the problem of recovering the local structure of surfaces from discrete range data. It is assumed that this recovery is done mostly in a bottom-up fashion, that is, without the help of a priori knowledge about the viewed surface. Because the problem is ill-posed, we nevertheless need to place constraints on the recovered structure to get a unique solution. In a bottom-up approach, these constraints must come from generic assumptions that apply to all surfaces. Many methods of bottom-up surface reconstruction have been proposed up to now, some of them dealing with intensity surfaces, some with range surfaces. Each of these methods either explicitly or implicitly applies a set of constraints on the data. The way in which the constraints are applied also varies from method to method. The main contribution of this thesis is some success at unifying a number of those methods under a common formalism of energy minimization, which will permit to better compare the choice of constraints between methods. We also show that the most successful surface reconstruction methods form idempotent operators, which we argue is to be expected. One method, Sander's curvature consistency, is studied in more detail than the others because it has not been studied much elsewhere yet.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pr46s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p810</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz806097j"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Poiesis : an Eriugenian interpretation of Chaucer's Troilus and and Criseyde</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Logan, Frank Daniel Hermitage</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the interpretation of art, set against the background of the medieval Christian Neoplatonism of John Scotus Eriugena. For him, art and philosophy are regarded as the handmaidens of meaning. Therefore, although this thesis begins with a consideration of Eriugena's Periphyseon, it develops into a discussion on aesthetic theory, and ultimately into one on poetic theory. The object of this discussion is to account for meaning in Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde according to Eriugenian poetics. The essence of art will thus be pursued within the parameters of the Neoplatonic scala natura. In this way, the whole poetic interpretation of Chaucer's poem is grasped as a mirror of the ontological exitus-reditus pattern. In understanding the poem this way, this thesis comes to immediate terms with the medieval concept of the imago Dei, and understands the likeness of mankind to God to be primarily one made by virtue of language.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vc64h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806097j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Erigena, Johannes Scotus, ca. 810-ca. 877.

In his fictional works, Fitzgerald becomes a kind of social and cultural historian, reflecting the fundamental changes that began to occur in the 1920s. There were many factors that contributed to this Jazz-Age revolution in "manners and morals": the emancipation of women, giving rise to the American New Woman; the influence of Freud and his psychoanalytic theories on the already blossoming sexual revolution; and the mechanization and commercialization of all aspects of life in the machine age, drastically altering the way men and women had traditionally thought, behaved, and, communicated with one another.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nz28p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h561n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fitzgerald, F.

They occur on a platform, 10 to 15 m thick. Basin sediments, 10 m thick, surround the complexes. Six facies are identified: (1) platform (lower and upper platform subfacies); (2) buildup interior; (3) buildup flank (laminated, bioturbated, cemented subfacies); (4) organic rim; (5) stromatolite cap; (6) basin (Brightholme, Ratner Members). Diagenesis occurred in four diagenetic environments: (1) open marine; (2) subaerial/meteoric; (3) restricted marine/shallow subsurface; (4) deeper subsurface. Fibrous cements occur in the cemented subfacies. Calcrete horizons with pendant cements formed in the stromatolite cap facies. All sediments are dolomitized. Isotopic data suggest that dolomitization occurred in the restricted marine and shallow burial environments in fluids derived from normal to slightly hypersaline Middle Devonian marine waters. Dolomitizing fluids derived from either the mechanical compaction of encasing evaporites or deeper formation waters were probably funnelled into the buildups. Minor fracturing and calcite cementation occurred in the deeper subsurface. Dedolomitization and calcitization of evaporites probably occurred at greater depths.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q517m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vm198</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
