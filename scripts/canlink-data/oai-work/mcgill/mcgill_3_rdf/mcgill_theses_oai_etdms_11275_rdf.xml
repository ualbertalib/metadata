It was not only the inquisitive interest in discovery, the lust for adventure, and the sudden patriotic fervour that sent the little wooden ships across the Atlantic to Canada, from France and later from England, to poke tentatively around the Maritime coast and sail up the St. Lawrence; it was trade. In the same way that the famous East India and French East India Companies with their strong mercantile backing opened India and the treasures of the East to Europe, so French businessmen (such as DeChastes, Delients, and LaSalle) and the Hudson’s Bay and North West Trading Companies were responsible for the opening and early development of Canada. At every step we find a trading interest responsible for Canadian growth. Indeed, on many an occasion, such as the dispute between Frontenac and Bishop Laval over the liquor trade with the Indians, and Governor Murray’s trouble with the merchants, the domestic interest of the colony came into conflict with the trading interest, controlled from abroad; and the latter usually won out.

Myocardial damage was usually induced by coronary artery ligature. Significant protection was achieved by ligature of either the left or right coronary artery one week prior to the isoproterenol injection (P &lt;0.01 for the left ventricle). Previous isoproterenol administration also provided significant grade of protection (P &lt;0.05) in the one group tested. Necrosis of another organ in the body (kidney infarct) afforded no protection. Adrenal regeneration hypertension markedly increased the animals’ sensitivity to isoproterenol. In a subsequent study, the time relationship of protection produced by ventricular infarct was followed. It was found that protection appears as early as 24 hours after coronary artery ligature, but recedes later in the course of healing, there being almost no signs of a protective effect after one month. In the third experiment, the possible role of endogenous catecholamines in protection was sought in animals treated with reserpine, iproniazid (Marsilid R) and by a combination of both. No significant differences from the control group were found.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Klassen, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qg41f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tj61j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322h766"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Foetal distress equals foetal acidosis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Desjardins, Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Our main concern as obstetricians has always been to decrease material and perinatal mortality. Foetal distress is an obscure term requiring further research towards establishment of a precise definition. The progress in physiology and pathophysiology favours a biochemical definition of foetal distress as being a metabolic or respiratory acidosis. Acidosis in the foetus may be determined by scalp sampling and measurement of blood gases. By routine use of this technique in obstetrical units, it is hoped that the stillbirth rate will be decreased, the apgar score at birth will.be increased, and mental retardation with or without neurological deficit will also be decreased.

In most of the free transplants, the articular cartilage ultimately was completely destroyed, whereas in those with a preserved blood supply normal structure was retained. S35incorporation studies in free whole joint transplants in rabbits demonstrated normal uptake in the grafted articular cartilage up to four to five weeks. Beyond twelve weeks, there was marked decrease to eventual complete absence of uptake. Free hemi-joint transplants in dogs showed a somewhat slower pattern of deterioration but similar to that of the whole joint transplants. Analysis of the above results suggests that post transplantation ischemia is the principle factor in the ultimate articular degeneration and that this is mediated through its effect on the subchondral circulation.

Evidence indicates gastrointestinal hormones mediate the response. Mostly on the basis of in vivo studies, it is thought that secretin and enteric glucagon mediate the effect during glucose absorption and pancreozymin and pancreatic glucagon probably are involved during amino acid absorption. Gastrin may produce secretin release and act indirectly. The present studies were performed using isolated islets of Langerhans of the rat obtained according to the method of Lacy and Kostianovsky. Secret in and glucagon have been demonstrated to produce insulin release at both 50 and 300 mg% glucose. Gastrin was without effect. Pancreozymin produced insulin release at 300 but not 50 mg% glucose. Arginine produced insulin release at both 50 and 300 mg% glucose but leucine was without significant effect. The significance of these findings in relation to in vivo findings is discussed and the need for further work is stressed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dupre, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cx28n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t953h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8w32r858h"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Human growth hormone and d2-macroglobulin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Collu, Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>By radioimmunoelectrophoresis and chromatography on Sephadex G-200, we have confirmed the existence of an "in vitro" binding of HGH by human α2-M.

Indeed, the precipitation of α2-M by a specific G-globulin resulted in the appearance of a greater quantity of HGH in the supernatants than in the initial sera. Furthermore, by incubating fluorescein-tagged HGH with normal, acromegalic and hypopituitary sera, we demonstrated with chromatographic studies on Sephadex G-200 an inverse relationship between the endogenous HGH plasma concentration and the percentage of binding of FITC-tagged HGH to α2-M "in vitro". We have also shown the existence of an influence of HGH on the metabolism of α2-M allowing us to propose a role for α2-M in the growth promoting effect of HGH. The variations of α2-M levels observed after administration of HGH to 3 normal subjects and 8 hypopituitary patients, could represent the overall result of an equilibrium between synthesis of α2-M and its utilization as a "building block" of connective tissue, both synthesis and peripheral utilization being influenced by HGH.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leboeuf, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cp03w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r858h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Investigative Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j333554s"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Purification of an antihistamine-like principle(s) of the Hungarian oak gall and its efficacy compared to tomatine and gomatine</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chu, David C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this work was to purify and, it possible, to isolate an antihistamine-like principle(s) from the Hungarian oak gall.

A partial explanation of these results was thought to reside in the effect of phenelzine on the rate of ethanol degradation. Determinations of ethanol concentrations in whole mice over a 4 hour period indicated that phenelzine caused a 43% increase in the time required to eliminate one half the amount of ethanol initially injected. Acetaldehyde concentrations after ethanol were found to be lower in phenelzine pretreated mice. In vitro, phenelzine inhibited the oxidative activity of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase by a competitive interaction with both DPN+ and ethanol at enzymic receptor sites.

When cortisone induced hyperglycemia was abolished by the injection of insulin, no rise in the level of plasma histamine occurred. The increase in plasma histamine level following a single cortisone injection could be duplicated by the administration of glucose. These results suggest that the increase in plasma histamine concentration induced by cortisone was mediated by the hyperglycemic effect of cortisone.

Unilateral vagotomy reduced the spontaneous secretion of gastric juice in the pylorus-ligated rat. The mean acid output after unilateral vagotomy was significantly smaller than the acid output in control rats, and significantly greater than the mean acid output after bilateral vagotomy. Similar differences were observed whether unilateral vagotomy was performed in the abdomen at the time of pyloric ligation, or in the neck one week prior to pyloric ligation. Part two of Section l is concerned with the effect of unilateral vagotomy on dogs with a gastric fistula, following sham-feeding and gastrin infusions. Difference between pre- and post-unilateral vagotomy results only became apparent at the upper levels of stimulation. Explanations have been advanced for the results but the gross reduction may represent the sum of a number of different effects. It is suggested that only ‘maximal stimuli’ may be useful experimentally and clinically for differentiating varying degrees of partial denervation of the stomach. In Section II the effect of immunosympathectomy on gastric secretion is considered in the rat. The immunologically suppressed sympathetic nervous system gives rise to an increased incidence of gastric glandular ulceration in pylorus ligated rats. This is accompanied by a decreased mucus content in the gastric juice with no appreciable change in acid or pepsin output. Adrenaline treatment of these animals seems to reverse the ulcerogenic effects of sympathetic ablation and restores mucus production to normal and above normal levels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wlodek, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hv73d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207ts275</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524js00b"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Study of electric potential on the human renal pelvis and the ureter</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Parvin, Mohamad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The function of the renal pelvis and ureter was studied in both Paraplegics and non-Paraplegic patients, by recording the electrical potential and pressure simultaneously, by using a modified double platinum electrode cardiac catheter, and a skin electrode of silver-silver chloride with saline diffusion barrier. An outline has been given to the previous methods of studies, It is concluded that: There is pelvic perestalsis. The frequency of contraction of the renal pelvis is greater than that of its corresponding ureter .The average intrapelvic contraction pressure is lower than ureter. The amplitude of contraction wave is higher in the upper and middle third of the ureter than in the lower third. The pelvic "Pacemaker" exists. The ureteric contraction wave in lower third is higher in Paraplegics than in non-Paraplegics. The electrical impulse in the pelvis and ureter precedes the contraction wave. The actual electrical impulse giving rise to the contraction wave in the ureter is preceded by several smaller impulses. Recommendation has been made for improvement of material and technique for future experiments.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacLean, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cx30p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js00b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085p36g"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effort of shock on body fluid distribution</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lopez, Gilberto A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent reports have stressed the importance of maintaining the extracellular water (ECW) volume in the patient in shock by administering large volumes of balanced salt solution. The present study was undertaken to determine whether a significant decrease in the extracellular water volume occurs in experimental hemorrhagic shock or in a series of patients with septic shock. Multiple isotope dilution techniques were employed for simultaneous measurement of the total body water (TBW), ECW and plasma volume. In addition, red cell mass vas measured in many of the human studies. In hemorrhagic shock multiple tracers of varying function and molecular size were used. Deficits observed were not statistically significant and could be accounted for byvascular compartment loss due to the withdrawal of blood samples. In 11 patients in septic shock the observation of an increased ECW and increased total exchangeable Sodium not associated with an increase in TBW has been recorded. In addition, no correlation was found between this observation and the more usually performed tests of hemodynamic and metabolic functions in the shock patient. These studies do not support the concept of selective extracellular fluid deficits in hemorrhagic shock or septic shock. Unwarranted infusion of large amounts of salt-containing solutions should be avoided unless further scientific support for their use can be obtained.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gutelius, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859j74n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085p36g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw6634682r"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The in situ metabolism of progesterone in the human feto-placental unit</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ling, William Y.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the study of the in situ metabolism of progesterone- 4-14C in the midterm human fetoplacental unit, the labeled hormone was injected into the umbilical vein at the time of hysterotomy and the circulation was left intact for 15 minutes.

A total of eight unconjugated metabolites of progesterone were isolated and identified. The reduced metabolites were 20α-dihydroprogesterone, pregnanolone, 3β-hydroxy-pregnan-20-one and pregnanediol; the hydroxylated metabolites identified were 6β-hydroxyprogesterone, 16α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and hydrocortisone. These results demonstrated that the human fetus at midterm pregnancy can actively transfom progesterone reaching it from the placenta into a number of reduced and hydroxylated metabolites and that the fetal adrenal and the liver were the most active sites of this metabolism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Solomon, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m2599.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634682r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967681x"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Metabolism of progesterone in the feto-placental unit of the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Leung, Kiu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Progesterone-4-14C was injected into the umbilical vein of the Rhesus monkey with the fetus in utero.

Patients with typical duodenal ulcer symptoms without radiological evidence of ulcer had normal maximum histamine tests but their duodenal biopsies showed inflammatory changes comparable to those of patients with proven duodenal ulcers. The ulcer group had, in addition, elevated maximum histamine test results. Normal controls and patients with “functional dyspepsia" had normal maximum histamine tests and normal biopsies.
