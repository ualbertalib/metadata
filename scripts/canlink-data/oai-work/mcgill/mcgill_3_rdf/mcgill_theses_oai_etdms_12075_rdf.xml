The Protestant Foster Home Centre 1 in Montreal has, during the past ten years, been placing and supervising children in foster homes. At this time the agency is interested to learn what types of boarding homes come to their attention. The reason for this interest is that children with various social, economic and cultural characteristics become dependent on the agency for foster home care. They require placement with people who have characteristics similar to their own. Thus there is a need to know the capacities and backgrounds of the people who offer their services as foster parents. As no similar survey has been made the agency is also interested to have a generalized picture of their foster parents and resources.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Younge, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644v958.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k129s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p791r"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A comparison of the effects of reciprocal dumping with those of F.O.B. mill pricing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Morrow, James William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Reciprocal dumping is a common business practice both in the United States and in Canada. It has been alleged that it is undesirable mainly on the grounds that it increases costs of distribution, that it leads to a lessening of competition with consequent enhancement of prices, and that it induces mal-location of the firms of industries practicing it. On the other hand, reciprocal dumping has been stoutly defended; it has been contended that the additional costs of distribution are not very large, that more firms are enabled to compete for the same business and thereby to exert a greater downward competitive pressure on prices, and that the imposition of f.o.b. pricing upon an industry practicing reciprocal dumping might lead to an even less desirable pattern of industrial location.

Geraldton is the principal supply point for the mines in the district and a paved highway provides easy access to the MacLeod-Cockshutt and other mines from this point. The MacLeod-Cockshutt mine has been producing since 1938. Its gold and silver production to September 30, 1949 was valued at $19,598,445. It has been only partially developed to the 2000 feet level and prospects for expansion appear to be very good. This thesis is based on 5 years of work at the property as geologist, 2 years prior to world war II and 3 years after it. Additional studies have been carried out in the laboratories of McGill University during the past two years. All the maps and other illustrations included in the thesis have been prepared by the author, with the exception of figure 4, which was copied from a map prepared by the late Dr. H. C.

A diet which is considered normal in our North American civilization appears to provide an adequate supply of protein. There are, of course, circumstances in which an adequate supply of protein is not, or cannot be obtained through the diet. Poverty, ignorance and social custom are the most common causes of protein deficiency in the diet. Miranda (1) refers to this protein deficiency as hypoproteinosis and states that it is the most common disease in the world, and yet has not even a name in the accepted medical nomenclature. The apparent manifestations of a protein deficiency are low rates of growth, high mortality and lowered resistance to disease.

Psychologists too, concerned as they are in studying the human organism, are interested in individual differences. The amount of information one possesses with respect to any object, person, or event may be thought to be a function of the number of statements of difference one is able to make about it and the things around it. The lack of adequate methods for measuring psychological properties has long been one of the major difficulties confronting research workers in this field. The problem of measurement is threefold. It involves: (a) a hunch or clue based on empirical observation or a priori intuition that a certain psychological property is present capable of measurement. This demands implicitly that its quantity, quality, or existence vary to some degree in the population. (b) the construction of some means of testing or measuring this property according to the requirements of a logical rationale. (c) the quantification of such a measure in order that it be amenable to reliable comparison from subject to subject, and its subsequent validification and standardization.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferguson, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f926r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000325g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>PSYCHOLOGY -- MENTAL TESTS</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af4752m10f"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le personnage de Vautrin dans l’oeuvre de Balzac</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>O’Quinn, James Patrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>De tous les personnages saisissants dont est remplie la “Comédie Humaine” de Balzac, celui de Jacques Collin, dit Trompe-la-Mort, dit Vautrin, dit l’abbé Carlos-Herrera, est un des plus intéressants et des plus remarquables.

L’oeuvre de Balzac aurait été manquée s’il avait omis de son tableau cette société en dehors et au-dessous de la société, le monde criminel.

Néanmoins, Vautrin n’est pas quelque chose d’abstrait; il est vivant et il a son originalité. C’est un individu aussi bien qu’un type et un symbole. Il représente le bagne, mais Balzac ne l’a pas formé en combinant les traits les plus caractéristiques des criminels. Il n’est pas un criminel médiocre; il appartient à la “haute pègre.” Mais il a des qualités qui le mettent à part même dans la “haute pègre”; il a de l’intelligence et de l’instruction et l’habitude de réfléchir et de philosophiser.

For over two decades, many a contemporary theorist has conceded Lashley’s argument and, consequently, has assumed that some form of configuration theory constitutes the only adequate attack upon behavioral problems.

It appeared to the present author that, if one could find more fluent readers of both English and Jewish, one might obtain more conclusive evidence one way or the other.

The results are of the same general form as those given by H. Prohlich for the case of a single polar molecule. The results contain two terms, one depending on the dipole interaction forces, and a second which is present in Prohlich’s result depending on non-dipole forces. If the first term is absent the regular lattices of dipoles become effectively random distributions, and only the term corresponding to the Prohlich formula is present.

This orientation owes much to the pioneer experimentation and thinking of Muzafer Sherif. Sherif’s thesis, outlined in 1935 along with supporting anthropological data ,( 21 ), is that the way in which the individual perceives his world can serve as a fertile and reliable index of his behavior and its study would yield valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms which conditioning, or any response theory, probably never could. As a suitable laboratory situation in which to study social perception experimentally, Sherif adopted the autokinetic effect. [...] Sherif himself admits that “..there is, indeed, the danger of the artificiality of the laboratory atmosphere. The processes which we study..may have little to do with the concrete way the norms work in actual social life.”(22,p.68) That, in brief, is the basis of our objection and our attempt to alter the experimental method in order to render more valid the generalizations to the ‘market place’.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tyhurst, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524js08j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117s20t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>PERCEPTION</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab2773z85s"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies of current-noise from small resistors in the frequency range from 20 kc/s. to 500 kc/s.</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pavich, Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Equipment is described for measuring current-noise from resistors of large resistance values, with shot noise calibration, and for recording this noise simultaneously at two frequencies.

Current-noise (in r.m.s. volts/volt/unit bandwidth) is found to be independent of the applied voltage. For one type of resistor it is independent of resistance, while for another the variation is with the half-power of the resistance. Variation with frequency is found to be at a constant inverse power of the frequency from 0.48 to 0.56 over the entire measured frequency range.

Public health measures and the discovery of effective chemotherapeutic and antibiotic agents have greatly reduced the morbidity and mortality of the acute infectious diseases, while the more chronic diseases, such as syphilis and tuberculosis, are slowly beginning to yield to the newer methods of attack. Advances in other fields as well have been great, so that even cancer cowers before the onslaught. The result of all this progress has been to bring into sharper focus the diseases of the cardiovascular system, which, for many years now, have constituted the greatest cause of death in the civilized world. Among these diseases, arteriosclerosis is prominent. Because of its relatively slow development and the fact that it usually gives no indication of its presence until the lesions are well advanced, arteriosclerosis is a difficult disease to study in the human patient. However, experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis is similar in many respects to the human disease, so that an understanding of its mechanism of production may be expected to throw light on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in man.

The formulation of these tests in 1905 revolutionized the psychological field and paved the way to a fuller understanding of the mental powers of people. His concept of intelligence emphasizes three characteristics of the thought process; “Its tendency to take and maintain a definite direction; the capacity to make adaptations for the purpose of attaining a desired end; and the power of auto-criticism.”’  In the early part of this century Lewis Terman, an American Psychologist revised the Binet scale, reducing it to a workable unit which he termed the Intelligence Quotient, setting the basal figure at 100. On this revised Stanford Binet Scale 68 per cent of the population have I.Q.’s ranging from 90-110, which is regarded as normal intelligence. People with an I.Q,. scoring above 110 are exceptional by reason of their superior ability, and have been divided into three groups according to the I.Q. range: superior being between 110 and 120; very superior between (3) 120 and 130; and genius over 130 [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Waddington, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h4842.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58ph209</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qt05k"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The literary technique of Aldous Huxley</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pitts, Mary Alexa Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Few writers have interpreted the consciousness of their times as accurately as Aldous Huxley. With brilliant satire he conveys the deep sense of disillusion which marked the post-war period of the nineteen-twenties. The advance from scepticism to knowledge of God found in his novels reflects the groping spirit of an uneasy age. He speaks for a generation which began in the conviction that there was no need for faith, and came to hope that it was still not too late to find it. The conclusions which he draws from his analysis of man’s relationship to his changing world are significant, as he views the organic pattern of current thought and events from many angles. He combines in his work an intense curiosity about all knowledge, literature, art and science; a concern with the incredibleness of everyday appearances; a profound capacity for assimilating experience. To qualities which would already make a full and exact man, Huxley adds that touch of creative genius which transforms an intellectual into a literary artist. A “moderate extrovert” as he calls himself, Huxley prefers the part of thoughtful spectator to that of active participator. The mental plane of existence is his natural habitat. He knows that his talent is not one of the heart, feelings, and sympathies, and he attempts to overcome the limitation. But this emotional remoteness has been a source of strength to him in other ways.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Files, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h278r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qt05k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Huxley, Aldous, 1894-1963 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g581v"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Commerce</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The growth of the life insurance industry in Canada, 1909-1947</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poapst, James V.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The depression of the ‘thirties provided a great impetus to economic thinking. Since 1933 many discussions have centred upon cycle theory and full employment as the “Keynesian Revolution” took place. Now, a multitude of economists no longer assiduously believe in the ability of automatic forces in the market to maintain an adequate level of employment. To use economic terminology, there is a feeling that the ex ante propensity to save at full employment is greater than the corresponding ex ante propensity to invest. This inequality of these two variables is incompatible with the maintenance of full employment. A fall in the level of income (and hence employment) tends to restore the equality between the two propensities. Full employment is thus a condition of macro-economic disequilibrium. A large portion of the personal savings of Canadians is realized through the purchase of insurance. In the light of the industry’s activities in the savings and investment fields, the institution of life insurance is of great significance to modern economic problems. In this thesis I had hoped to treat briefly the causes of the increased demand for insurance. The work was to deal mainly with the insurance segments of the propensities to save and invest. The international aspect of the business was to have been taken into account. The limitation of the statistics prohibited this approach.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Byrd, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580q88h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g581v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m509g"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Commerce</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The economic significance of Canadian accountancy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Potter, Calvin C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is my intention to trace the origins and development of accounting procedures and methods from their original environments, through the process of institutionalization and into their final stages of acceptance as traditional forms of accounting technique. For this purpose a historical perspective is required and will necessitate a very cursory review of some other aspects of economic development, just adequate enough to identify the changes in other social forces that were concurrent with the developments in accounting techniques. History moves in stages which are distinguished by certain basic characteristics. However, the stages are not clear cut, for the early changes in any new period are overshadowed by the institutions of the past, and a significant interval may elapse before the young institutions are strong enough to be not unduly influenced by tradition. The continuity of social institutions makes indeterminate, except within extreme limits, the restriction of any particular practice or policy to a specified time period, or the selection of the relevant period for any particular change. We shall, therefore, select those institutions which emerge with the minimum degree of complexity and the highest degree of clarity during a specified period as being basic to that particular stage of economic development.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Byrd, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059cb61c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m509g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720h01z"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Measurements of input admittance of triodes in the frequency range 300 Mc/s to 900 Mc/s.</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poznanski, Zdzislaw</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Measurements of input admittance, over the frequency range 300Mcs/s. to 900Mcs/s., were made on four different types of triodes represented by the HY75, 826, 388, 957. A coaxial resonant line was used as the measuring device. It was found that the cold tube input admittance increases rapidly with increasing frequency over the normally used range, passing through alternant poles and zeros. This indicates that another usefull range of tube operation may be obtained at frequencies higher than the first series resonant frequency. Also the inductive input susceptance observed in that range may be found usefull. An indication of transit time effects was also obtained though it would appear that in most high frequency triodes the top frequency limit is mainly determined by the cold tube circuit effects.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Woonton, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f686t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720h01z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electrical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apv63g3285"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of the nutritive value of pasture herbage with particular reference to the effects of stage of maturity at time of harvest</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Proverbs, Ivor Hugh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The influence of maturity on the nutritive value of the leaf, stem and head of timothy hay harvested at two stages of maturity has been investigated. Average digestibility coefficients by four Cheviot wethers were used as the criterion for measuring nutritive value. The decreased nutritive value of the hay with maturity was caused by a serious decrease in availability of the stem nutrients. The leaf and head of the plant largely maintained their high nutritive value with maturity, except in the case of protein whose availability was in all cases very much lowered. The head of the plant assumed greater importance with maturity as a source of available nutrients, especially protein, tending to offset the serious losses in digestibility incurred by the stem.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Raymond, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913t06t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g3285</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Grasses -- Harvesting</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pastures -- Research</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322h86f"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Bank for International Settlements</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pugsley, William H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As to originality and contribution to knowledge, the candidate knows of no other work covering the same ground. He has been informed by the Bank for International Settlement that apart from the Bank's own Annual Reports the only published reference to the Bank since the middle Nineteen Thirties has been newspaper notices and occasional magazine articles on various topical aspects. The treatment in this thesis of the Bank's history has been based principally on the Bank's Annual Reports, on books cited in the text, on newspaper and other published references of the period, and numerous questions, arising out of a reading of these sources, which officials of the Bank very obligingly undertook to answer. Phraseology shown within inverted commas, if no reference is given, has been drawn from these source materials. Particulars of the working of the intra-European multilateral clearings have come from the Bank's Annual Reports, and from discussions with officials of the Bank. The candidate believes the viewpoints expressed to be his own, but he does not doubt that he has been much influenced by the spoken and written opinions of others. A reading of Economics warns the candidate that anyone nowadays should hesitate to claim originality of thought, so the candidate only claims originality of presentation. Mathematically this claim must be unassailable.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marsh, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655k68d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322h86f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r188x"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of adrenocorticotrophic hormone on respiratory function</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pump, Karl Kandaules</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this study an attempt has been made to evaluate the effect adrenocorticotrophic hormone has on respiratory function.
