They concern only fcc metals which undergo isotropic hardening, and which glide on the 24 {111} slip systems. The tables list all five dimensional vertices, and edges of the fourth, third and second order limiting the yield surface as well as the slip systems with which they are associated. A direct method for calculating the yield vectors for any orientation, in five dimensional stress space is established, which enables the user to obtain the yield surface without need of knowing the six deviator stress components. The relaxed constraint theory, which, by contrast to the classical theory, prescribes only part of the strain increment tensor, is applied to the case of the fixed end torsion test. By taking account of the deformed shape of the grains, three strain components are prescribed; axisymmetry of the sample, which is assumed for every grain, leads to the prescription of another strain component. A further equilibrium condition on the stress associated with the absence of surface tractions leads to an additional constraint. The Yield Subsurface Analysis, which consists of cutting the five dimensional yield surface by the planes of the prescribed stresses, and selecting the p dimensional vertices (p being the number of prescribed strains) that provide maximum work, is carried out. The results are compared with the ones of the classical theory where all the strain components are known. The simulations are carried out to shear strains of 10, and the orientation changes are calculated incrementally assuming the shear plane and shear direction to be fixed in space. The texture results are similar up to shear strains of about 3, but differ significantly at larger strains. The relaxed constraint theory predicts the strengthening of the {100} texture component and the development of an equally strong {hk1} fiber component at the expense of the {111} fiber component, whereas the classical theory predicts a very strong {111} fiber component. At large strains, the experimental results agree better with the relaxed constraint predictions. The average Taylor factors do not exhibit the same trends, since the Bishop and Hill theory predicts a continuous decrease and the RC theory a slight decrease followed by a continuous increase. It is felt, however, that the real behavior is a combination of that obtained from the two theories: BH at strains up to 3, RC at larger strains.The combined behavior explains the changes in slope and curvature observed in experimental torsion curves. Using and experimental shear stress-shear strain curve, the microscopic laws of work hardening are deduced using both variations of the average Taylor factor. The RC curve seems to be the most physically meaningful.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nx90z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wr09m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Copper</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dislocations in crystals</dc:subject><dc:subject>Texture (Crystallography)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8p58pd79c"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The evaluation of extrapolation schemes for the growth or decay of rain area and applications</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tsonis, Anastosios A. (Anastasios Antonios)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Radar cells from the GATE experiment, from Spain and from the Montreal area were followed and measurements of their total rain flux and area were extracted. The values of the flux and area, for each one of the cells, for initial time increments T(,0) were used to evaluate various extrapolation schemes for forecasting purposes. The extrapolation procedure that gave the smallest error in forecasting the changes in flux and area, was found to be the linear one and the optimum increment T(,0) was about 30 min. However, even though these techniques have the advantage of establishing a trend in the behavior of the flux and area with time, a comparison of the forecast errors from the linear extrapolation scheme with those from the assumption of no change in cell area and rain flux shows insignificant improvements. A technique including both cell motion and internal changes in flux and area of the rain cells was developed to evaluate the accuracy of rain accumulation forecasts. Again, it was found that the errors were similar with those generated by the assumption of no change in rain flux and area from the moving cell. The preceding results were used as a possible input into the design and evaluation of cloud seeding experiments. Based on this, a method is developed which gives the necessary number of experiments (i.e., seeded cases) in order for a seeding factor to be statistically significant at specified confidence levels. As a conclusion, it can be stated that the use of short term rain predictions (which are translated as differences of the rain flux in time) is very promising. In comparison to other techniques described in the literature this method appears to be superior, in the sense that fewer experiments are needed to detect seeding factors at specified confidence levels.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mj832.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pd79c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Radar meteorology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rain and rainfall</dc:subject><dc:subject>Precipitation forecasting</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nc08w"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The holonomy group and the differential geometry of fibred Riemannian spaces</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cheng, Koun-Ping</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The holonomy group arising from a linear connection and differential homotopy is a classical subject in geometry. The notion was generalized first by Y. Muto ({10}) by considering horizontal subspaces in a fibred space which by construction is a differential manifold over a base space with another manifold as the fibre. He called this generalized group the restricted holonomy group Hl('o)((')M). Unlike the case of frame bundles the horizontal subspaces in a fibred space do not in general obey the right invariant rule. Hence it is not hard to imagine that Hl('o)((')M) is larger than linear holonomy groups. It may not even form a Lie group and for years the structure of this group was left unknown simply because the number of elements concerned is too large to handle. One of the intentions here is to clarify and determine the structure of Hl('o)((')M) by setting certain conditions. Then by use of Palais' theorem about transformation groups, Nijenhuis' method for dealing with linear holonomy groups, and the standard technique of computing line integrals, the structure of Hl('o)((')M) is determined in Chapter One under certain conditions. Some properties concerning the isometric immersion from one fibred Riemannian space into another are also discussed in Chapter Two. As far as I know, the work in this thesis is original, except where the text indicates the contrary: In particular, Chapter One is purely expository.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qm847.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nc08w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Riemannian manifolds</dc:subject><dc:subject>Holonomy groups</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geometry, Differential</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afn106z957"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Influence of input characteristics on hemispheric cognitive processing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sergent, Justine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Considering that the nature of the input is one of the most important variables in determining how the brain will process information, findings from tachistoscopic studies aimed at assessing hemispheric specializations are examined in terms of the characteristics of the incoming information either available or required for processing.

Cells showing a delayed kinetics of development to plasma cells as compared to small B-lymphocytes were also found immature with respect to age-related markers. The appearance of characteristic markers (nylon wood adherence, membrane IgM) and functional properties (LPS-responsiveness) was traced within distinguishable populations of cells. On the basis of functional properties (AE-dependence, LPS-responsiveness and time of peak response) these 10 populations were grouped into 3 distinct subsets. From the major discontinuities in the kinetics of individual parameters and from changes in the quantitative expression of age-related markers, these subsets were sequentially related into the following scheme: pre-B cells (---&gt;) early B cells (---&gt;) B-lymphocytes Finally, a proliferative pathway was found within the early B cell compartment which parallels the post-mitotic maturation of the pre-B cell progeny.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc63c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pb25z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795857v"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The two solitudes reexamined : pluralism and inequality in Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Laczko, Leslie Stephen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study presents a series of empirical tests of two influential theoretical perspectives on the industrialization and modernization of polyethnic societies. On the one hand, the functionalist perspective predicts that cultural diversity and pluralism will decline, that group inequalities will decrease, and that communal conflict should become less likely over time. The communal competition perspective, on the other hand, predicts that cultural diversity and pluralism will not necessarily wither away, that group inequalities will not inevitably be reduced, and that communal conflict is a possibility at any point in time. Hypotheses derived from these two perspectives are tested using survey data on French-English relations drawn from the 1970-71 Quebec Social Movements Study. Part of the thesis is an update and replication of the benchmark study of Roseborough and Breton (1971). The study provides an examination of the structure of the belief system of a segmented society, and contributes to a systematic assessment of the relative utility of the two theoretical perspectives for an understanding of social change in plural societies.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967455w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795857v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Equality</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cultural pluralism -- Quebec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Culture conflict</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social interaction -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At148fh941"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Russian and Slavic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The image of the city in the novels of Gogol, Dostoevsky and Bely</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Spitzer, Catherine Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Gogol, Dostoevsky and Bely are three Russian novelists, most of whose writings are set in the city of St. Petersburg, and whose feelings for their city were a bizarre mixture of love and hatred.

The model explains, simultaneously, the known behaviour of individual neural groups within the system (in central pathways) and of eye movements at its output. It does not require a long time constant "neural integrator" (NI) nor separate pathways for the generation of slow and fast phases of nystagmus, as in previous models. A single "neural filter" (NF, time constant &lt; 1s) on each side of the brainstem is sufficient to provide integration in the slow phase mode, with the help of a positive feedback loop due to commissural innervation. Fast/slow phase alternation of eye movements is achieved through simple modulation of commissural inhibition by reticular burst cells. Analytic and computer simulation studies show that the model can account, for the first time, for published response characteristics in the vestibular nuclei, and for their dependence on commissural and cerebellar pathways.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bq169.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sb11c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vestibular apparatus -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Eye -- Movements -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bc494"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The leaching of lignin macromolecules from pulp fibres during washing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Favis, Basil D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A method was developed for measuring the rate of leaching of lignin macromolecules from the fibre walls of unbleached kraft pulp fibres suspended in water. From a comparison of a theoretical analysis with experimental results, it was concluded that the leaching process was governed by a diffusion mechanism. Very low and widely polydisperse diffusion coefficients were observed for this system. The molecular weights of the leached lignins were found to increase with wash time. A comparison of the molecular dimensions with pore size indicated that a flat disk-like conformation, rather than a spherical conformation was appropriate for the lignin macromolecule. From 20(DEGREES) C to 70(DEGREES)C the change in the intrafibre diffusion coefficient with temperature varied directly as the ratio of the absolute temperature to the viscosity of water. Above 70(DEGREES)C there was a much larger dependence of the diffusion coefficient on temperature. The rate of leaching was also affected by the presence of electrolytes in the wash liquid; leaching was found to decrease with an increase in the ionic strength of the electrolyte. A conceptual model for this leaching effect is presented. The model offers a qualitative explanation for the experimental results noted above.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q237s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc494</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lignin</dc:subject><dc:subject>Leaching</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wood-pulp</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab2773w55n"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The gene A and A* proteins of bacteriophage X174</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dubeau, Louis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A simple method for purifying the gene A plus A* proteins of bacteriophage (PHI)X174 is presented.

Previous work by the groups of Ozols and Strittmatter has determined the primary sequence and the orientation of the molecule. It is embedded on the cytoplasmic face of microsomal membranes via a hydrophobic 40 amino acid long "tail" at the carboxy terminus. The synthesis of this protein is assigned to the free polyribosome population of rat hepatocytes, and the experimental documentation of this assignment is reported. Free and membrane-bound polyribosomes were separated by a modification of the method of Ramsey and Steele (1976) and characterized by electron microscopy. Poly A('+) RNA isolated from the total free (poly A('+) RNA(,f)) or total membrane-bound polyribosomes (poly A('+) RNA(,mb)) was translated using the heterologous wheat germ system. Fluorographic SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the translation products of poly A('+) RNA(,f) had electrophoretic mobilities similar to those of liver cytosol proteins. In contrast, poly A('+) RNA(,mb) was translated into polypeptides with mobilities similar to serum proteins (the major secretory product of the hepatocyte). Antiserum to the complete cytochrome b(,5) molecule immunoprecipitated from the translation products of poly A('+) RNA(,f) a single polypeptide with electrophoretic mobility identical to that of native cytochrome b(,5) (17,500 daltons). Quantitative analysis indicated 85% synthesized from poly A('+) RNA(,f) compared to only 15% from poly A('+) RNA(,mb). Control experiments with antiserum to serum albumin demonstrated that following immunoprecipitation, a single polypeptide of M(,r) 68,000 was synthesized by poly A('+) RNA(,mb). This M(,r) was shown to be larger by 3000 daltons than that of native serum albumin; the difference being accounted by the known "signal sequence". Quantitation indicated 90% synthesized from poly A('+) RNA(,mb) and 10% from poly A('+) RNA(,f). In conclusion, an exclusive location of the site of synthesis of microsomal cytochrome b(,5) is assigned to the free polyribosome population. This conclusion provides a ready explanation (i) for the ubiquitous distribution of the protein to most intracellular organelles; (ii) for the topographic orientation on the cytoplasmic face of membranes and (iii) for the hyrophobic tail (membrane insertion sequence) of amino acids at the carboxy terminal end of the molecule.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tg258.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v629d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35t9405"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Designing subsurface drainage systems to avoid excessive drainage of sands</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rashid-Noah, Augustine Bundu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Water balance calculations were conducted for data obtained from a soil moisture characteristic to demonstrate the effect of different subsurface drain depths on the extent of droughtiness of a sandy soil.

Inherited, strain-dependent influences on taurine reabsorption were investigated in the C3H/HeJ strain, a low excretor of taurine in urine and the C57Bl/6J strain, a high excretor. Although both strains transport taurine similarly at the luminal membrane, impaired exit at the baso-lateral membrane of renal epithelium in the hypertaurinuric strain results in increased intracellular levels of taurine and subsequent backflux into the urine. The kidney is an important arbiter of taurine homeostasis. When animals are deprived of taurine, the kidney adapts by increasing taurine uptake at the renal brush-border membrane and in renal cortex slices; fractional excretion drops sharply. A change in plasma taurine may be the critical signal for adaptation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t014t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333311k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kidneys</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rodents -- Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Taurine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580n46k"><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Melville's aesthetic strategies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Raff, Heather Ann</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The exploration and discontinuity of Melville's early life are reflected in his writing career. Before settling into silent conventionality, he wrote remarkably diverse prose. His aesthetics were individualistic: the page was an arena in which to deploy experimental strategies. The novels from Typee to Moby-Dick can be regarded as action of mind as it explores ways of seeing and describing reality. But these experiments proved that vision is inevitably guided by the well-stocked mind and that Nature is an everchanging subjective construct. In Pierre, The Piazza Tales, and The Confidence-Man--the fiction that immediately followed these discoveries--the action is externalized. Melville now explores the artist's use of definite forms rather than his mental positings. Paradoxically, this new aesthetic came to serve his final purpose: of disengagement that was subsequently fully manifested in the silence that followed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d505v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580n46k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Melville, Herman, 1819-1891 -- Aesthetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Melville, Herman, 1819-1891 -- Technique</dc:subject><dc:subject>Melville, Herman, 1819-1891 -- Style</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hd03c"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on follicular development and ovulation in cattle and swine</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Downey, Bruce R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Factors affecting bovine ovarian responsiveness to stimulation by pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG) were studied. Initially, the effects of plasma progesterone concentration on the response were considered using a progesterone-releasing intravaginal device (PRID) to provide an artificial source of the hormone. Due to inherent biological variation in vivo, in vitro methods were developed in which cAMP and progesterone production by granulosa cells were measured. Regardless of the size of the follicles from which the cells originated, PMSG stimulated significant cAMP accumulation. Cyclic AMP production was similar between aspirated granulosa cells and those scraped from the follicle wall, between ovaries with and without a corpus luteum from the same animal, and between follicles from animals early ( 10 days) in their estrous cycles. The PMSG failed to stimulate bovine granulosa cells to synthesize significantly more progesterone than untreated cells. Unlike porcine granulosa cells, bovine cells from antral follicles of any size appeared to luteinize spontaneously in culture. Hormonal changes in the preovulatory follicle were measured using the PMSG/hCG-treated prepubertal gilt as a model. After hCG administration, follicular fluid levels of cAMP peaked at 4 hr followed 24 hr later by a rise in prostaglandins F and E (PGF, PGE) concentrations which peaked near the expected time of ovulation. Indomethacin injection blocked ovulation and the prostaglandin rise, although the inhibition could be reversed by the administration of PGF(,2)(alpha). Temporal changes in estrone, estradiol-17(beta), progesterone, androstenedione, testosterone and 5 (alpha)-dihydrotestosterone were also measured. In an effort to decrease endogenous levels of inhibin, thereby increasing endogenous FSH and thence follicular development, heifers, ewes and does were actively immunized against porcine follicular fluid or proteinaceous fractions of bovine seminal plasma. In some animals, plasma FSH concentrations were elevated although ovulation rates and estrous cycle lengths were not altered. A culdoscopy technique was developed for repeated monitoring of ovarian morphological changes in cows.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dw39z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hd03c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Swine -- Reproduction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gonadotropin</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ovulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cattle -- Reproduction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Follicle-stimulating hormone</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w8226"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The gap metric for unstable systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>El-Sakkary, Ahmed Kamal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis we consider linear multivariable frequency response systems with finite numbers of unstable poles but with no poles on the j(omega) - axis. We represent unstable systems by input-output mappings with restricted domains in (DIAGRAM, TABLE OR GRAPHIC OMITTED...PLEASE SEE DAI) The effects of unstable perturbations in an open loop system K on the closed loop system (I + K)('-1) are studied. For this purpose the gap metric is introduced for measuring approximations to unstable systems. This metric is used to determine the sets of "allowable" uncertainties, i.e., those which do not destroy the stability of a feedback system, and which preserve a specified tolerance on the closed loop input-output behavior. It is shown that the allowable sets of uncertainties consist of closed operators which are contained in spheres sufficiently small in the gap metric. Also, all metrics which separate allowable uncertainties from the others are shown to generate the same topology as the gap. It is shown that all admissible approximations to a nominal frequency response system have domains with the same codimension, and therefore the same number of r.h.p. poles as the nominal system. Various estimates of the gap between two unstable systems are obtained, and applied to examples.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g358n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w8226</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Feedback control systems</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55z8701"><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Theory of the diode surface-wave storage correlator</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>El Nokali, Mahmoud Ahmed</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A detailed theoretical study for the operation of the surface-acoustic-wave diode storage correlator is presented. A circuit model describing the device is developed which is used to analyze the signal storage characteristics and the different read-out modes of operation for both p-n and Schottky diode structures. The calculated predictions of the proposed theory are in excellent agreement with experimental data published by independent researchers. The theory presented is self consistent and takes into account, for the first time, the minority carrier lifetime in the dynamics of charging the p-n diode structures which was neglected in previous theories. A straightforward transmission line theory approach is developed for finding the surface-wave amplitude excited by the diode potential during the read-out process. The frequency response characteristics predicted for these structures is a fairly slowly varying function of frequency; hence such correlators are essentially bandlimited by the input and output surface-wave transducers.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tm883.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z8701</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Correlators</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diodes, Semiconductor</dc:subject><dc:subject>Acoustic surface wave devices</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac821gk694"><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Insulin and insulin-like peptide receptors of the human placenta : ontogeny and regulation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Deal, Cheri, 1953-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Insulin, insulin-like peptides, and EGF have all been implicated as regulators of placental growth and function.

A structural model has been set up for the St. Louis Model, showing some missing links and variables. The reduced-form approach should not be applied recklessly, i.e. without constructing its theoretical structural equations. Furthermore, in empirical studies, the concepts of stock and flow, and time references and time dimensions should be properly specified; failure to do so can lead to difficulties in interpretation. The Netherlands Bank Model and the St. Louis Model have been applied to the Canadian economy from 1957 to 1974. The findings from this empirical study are, in general, favourable to the Monetarist hypothesis. The application of the Netherlands Bank Model to the Canadian economy demonstrates that the monetary impulses induce greater changes in nominal income and price level than in real income. The empirical results derived from the application of the St. Louis Model on a short-term basis support a middle ground position between Monetarists and Fiscalists: the monetary and fiscal impulses exert about the same magnitude effect (about 1.5) on economic activity in a year. On a medium-term basis, however, monetary impulses have a more lasting effect on nominal income, while the effects from the fiscal impulses disappear mainly because of the crowding-out effects.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tc965.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hk04v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fiscal policy -- Canada -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- Economic conditions -- 1945-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Monetary policy -- Canada -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac821gk70w"><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The use of large transient deformations to elucidate structural phenomena and evaluate network models for molten polymers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tsang, William Kuen Wai</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>That some kind of network plays a central role in the rheology of high molecular weight, amorphous polymers is inferred from such phenomena as a change in the slope of the curve of viscosity versus molecular weight and the plateau in the stress relaxation curve.

A new method which involves the reduction in shear rate in transient shearing flow was used to obtain such network kinetics information for three polyethylene melts at 170(DEGREES)C. Other methods of characterization have also been used. These include steady simple shear, small amplitude oscillatory shear, large amplitude oscillatory shear and transient uniaxial extensional flow. All of the above methods involve different types of deformation in both linear and nonlinear viscoelastic regions.

The similarity of these rates strongly supports a mechanism by which isomerization occurs through the oxidative addition and reductive elimination of molecular hydrogen. The results of deuterium labelling experiments were consistent with the isomerization mechanism, and further suggest that either trans-oxidative addition of hydrogen or intramolecular hydride interchange in the mer isomer may occur. Various partially deuterated analogues of the fac and mer isomer were formed by further reaction in solution and identified in the ('1)H n.m.r. spectrum.

The present study was carried out in order to determine the mechanisms which underlie this increase in serum cholesterol levels and to test the feasibility of using lovastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in its treatment. A mouse model of surgically-induced CRF was employed in the experiments. Five weeks after the onset of renal failure, the mice were characterized with regard to various biochemical and hematological parameters. At this time, treatment with lovastatin was initiated. The drug (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg BW/day) was incorporated in powdered diet and was given fresh daily for four weeks. Upon sacrifice, blood was collected for the estimation of blood urea nitrogen and serum lipids and livers were excised for the measurement of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity. The mice exhibited the major manifestations of CRF--retention of nitrogenous wastes, elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, suggesting the presence of bone disease, and severe anemia. CRF mice also had elevated serum total cholesterol levels with a concomitant, but not significantly correlated, increase in hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity. Furthermore, their serum lipoprotein profiles were abnormal. Treatment with lovastatin resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in serum total cholesterol levels and correction of the serum lipoprotein profile. However, hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity was unchanged. These results indicate that the hypercholesterolemia observed in CRF mice is probably due to an increase in de novo synthesis of cholesterol in both the liver and extranepatic tissues. Lovastatin may decrease serum total cholesterol levels in CRF mice by inhibiting peripheral, rather than hepatic, HMG-CoA reductase activity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stewart-Phillips, Jean L.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Gagnon, Raymonde F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j8954.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074v98t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
