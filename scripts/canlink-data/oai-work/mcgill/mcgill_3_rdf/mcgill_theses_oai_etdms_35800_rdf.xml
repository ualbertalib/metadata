B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis considers the figure of the metrosexual, a  contemporary archetype of stylish masculinity that has received considerable  attention in the global media. It traces the development of a style-conscious and  consuming masculinity in the West since the eighteenth century, through the figures  of the dandy, the playboy and the new man. It also traces the discourse that has  emerged in relation to metrosexuality in the Western media, from its first mention  to the present. The metrosexual represents a significant departure from the norms of  Western masculinity, most notably in his relationship to the homosexual and  homoerotic. This thesis considers the implications of such a version of masculinity  as they relate to women, gay men and theories of masculine  subjectivity.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816n104.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m227s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Masculinity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Men's clothing -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fashion -- Social aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jv21p"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Religion and the state in Ibn Khaldūn's Muqaddimah</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Esteban, Damian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is an attempt to gain a better understanding of Ibn  Khaldun's political theory contained in The Muqaddimah from the stance that religion  and his faith in Islam are at the core of his political theory. Though there is a  great deal of scholarship that has been dedicated to the interpretation of Ibn  Khaldun's political theory contained in The Muqaddimah, there are a limited number  of works that deal exclusively with the role of religion in his conception of the  State. Those that do tend to either exaggerate Ibn Khaldun's secular thought in the  realm of politics or understate his originality as a political scientist. Thus, this  study will attempt to prove that his political theory is indeed theocentric by way  of examining the true nature of 'aṣabiya, which to Ibn Khaldun was the  basis for all forms of human social and political organization, and its relationship  with religion in terms of its function in the establishment and propagation of the  State. In addition, we will also attempt to dispel the notion that the overall tone  of The Muqaddimah is pessimistic and fatalistic; indeed when one examines the  political theory contained in The Muqaddimah from a theocentric viewpoint it is made  apparent that it was Ibn Khaldun's strong religious convictions that ultimately  present a sense of optimism in his work.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tm573.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jv21p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Religion and state</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ibn Khaldūn, 1332-1406.

Bouvier develops a poetics that  defines the practical rules of his travels as well as the aesthetic rules of his  writing. These rules form a whole that can be named poetics of  transparency and divided into two complementary poles, each linked to themes and  images of disappearance or apparition. Both are oriented towards one single goal: to  make the world visible for the reader. Seemingly contradictory, the two movements of  Bouvier's project are connected by a polyphonic worldview, mirrored in narratives by  the interweaving of multiple voices. Bouvier's work is a model of the travel narrative's evolution in  the XXth century. Compared to travel writings of the classical and romantic periods,  it appears as a reversed interpretation of the genre's codes, leading it to explore  the possibilities of grasping a world poetic rather than objective.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p0933.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz115</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bouvier, Nicolas -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Travel in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36tz12f"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The evolving concept of sovereignty in air law</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sarigül, Gül</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>State sovereignty is the basic underlying principle of  international law. Like all branches of international law, air law has developed  under this principle of sovereignty, leaving the final decision to the consents and  political wills of the governments for both their internal and external affairs. In  the same vein, the international system is based on the juridical equality of all  nations, which are free to participate in all forms of regional and international  organizations. However, due to economic and political globalization and the demand  for a more efficient international cooperation as well as the market forces and  technical and economical constraints, the traditional concept of sovereignty has  undergone transformation. Resulting from their inherently technical, economic and  international characteristics, civil aviation and air transport are the leading  fields of international affairs affected by these developments. This thesis first analyses the evolution of the principle of  sovereignty in general international law and then traces the transformation of  sovereignty in air law by examining the issue through the approach found in the  Chicago Convention as well as the recent concepts and technologies in civil aviation  from the sovereignty point of view.* *The opinions expressed in this thesis are strictly those of the  author.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qj24n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz12f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aeronautics -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sovereignty</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655h20t"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The survival of the Warsaw system and the new Montreal convention governing certain rules for international carriage by air : are the conflicts solved?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>González, Jeanny Romero</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The year 2003 marks the entering into force of the new Montreal  Convention governing certain rules for international carriage by air.

This  work is based on previous work which integrated replication into PostgreSQL 6.4  using strict 2-phase-locking for concurrency control. In this thesis, we migrated  the approach to PostgreSQL 7.2 which uses a multi-version concurrency control  mechanism providing the isolation level Snapshot Isolation. This required a complete  redesign of the replica control component. With our approach, transactions can be  submitted to any replica. This replica executes the transaction locally and  multicasts the updates to the other replicas. The combined concurrency and replica  control components guarantee that concurrent updates are serialized in the same  order at all replicas, providing the same isolation level as a non-replicated  system. The thesis also presents a performance evaluation showing that our approach  has little overhead and provides scalability up to 20 replicas.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831ck526.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f407r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rt99v"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A three dimensional comparison of elite and recreational ice hockey slap shots</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Woo, Timothy Keith</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this thesis was to examine the three dimensional  kinematic differences between elite and recreational ice hockey players while  performing a stationary slap shot.

Kinematics of the torso, arms and hockey stick were  examined using a multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA). The results indicated that:  (1) the elite subjects shot significantly (p &lt; 0.05) faster due to the  translational movement aspect of the stick; (2) the proximal to distal kinematic  chain sequence of the elite subjects was better than the recreational subjects; and  (3) the elite subjects showed less variability in stick movement within groups, than  the recreational subjects. Further studies are needed to address kinematics of the  lower limbs and of different ice hockey stick skills.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z5884.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rt99v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hockey -- Equipment and supplies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hockey</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qq12c"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>High order autocorrelation analysis in image correlation spectroscopy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sergeev, Mikhail</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis studies optical microscopy based high order  autocorrelation approaches for measuring molecular aggregation of fluorescently  labeled particles in fluid systems. As the particles randomly diffuse into and out  of the volume defined by the focus of a confocal laser beam illumination, the  collected fluorescence intensity fluctuates. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy  (FCS) and Image Correlation Spectroscopy (ICS) have been used as methods which  analyse temporal and spatial intensity fluctuations, and provide quantitative  information of the molecular transport processes. Theoretical expressions for the  high order autocorrelation function magnitudes for a non-interactive model are  derived as well as their fitting equations for single- and multicomponent  diffusion. We present an experimental verification of the model applied to  simple systems. Solutions of fluorescent microspheres of well-defined size have been  imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy. It has been shown that  translational diffusion coefficients were not very sensitive to molecular size  dispersion, which made a first order autocorrelation approach to be somewhat  ineffective for dealing with multicomponent systems. We demonstrate that the number  densities of a mixture of two fluorescent particles can be determined analyzing the  higher order autocorrelation function magnitudes. Numerical simulations have been  analyzed for testing the experimental tools we use. The technique outlined may be  developed to detect and characterize aggregates of fluorescently labeled biological  molecules such as membrane proteins and cell surface receptors. Such quantitative  aggregation measurements, therefore, can provide information about the mechanism of  intercellular signaling which is believed to depend on the oligomerization of cell  membrane protein receptors.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gg976.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qq12c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abr86b4070"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Maternal anthropometric factors and the risk of cesarean delivery</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sherrard, Adam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The cesarean delivery rate in Canada has never been higher than  it is now.

Pregravid adiposity and high net rate of  gestational weight gain were associated with primary intrapartum cesarean delivery,  and overweight and obese women with a previous cesarean were at higher risk for  failing a trial of labour. Overall, women who were obese or overweight were more  likely to fail a trial of labour, regardless of whether they had previously  delivered by cesarean, but temporal trends in primary cesarean delivery could not be  attributed to changes in maternal anthropometric factors.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kg919.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b4070</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kg92k"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Vitamin A intake and antiviral properties of dietary traditional medicines among Kenyan Maasai children</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Parker, Megan Elizabeth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Maasai of East Africa traditionally consume a diet of milk,  meat, and blood. Previous studies have found the Maasai to suffer from vitamin A  deficiency (VAD). This micronutrient deficiency compromises systemic immunity and  increases morbidity and mortality. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire  (FFQ) was used to investigate the vitamin A intake of small Maasai children in  Loita, Kenya. On average, children consumed 596mug/dayRAE from retinoid sources and  956mug/dayRAE when coupled with beta-carotene sources. The measles virus (MV) has  yet to be eradicated from East Africa and remains a threat to young children. The  Maasai have developed methods to deal with this disease and improve systemic  immunity by introducing medicinal plants into the diet. Plant species added to the  milk and soups of small children were determined using the FFQ. Antiviral properties  of the seven most common dietary plants were then investigated, measuring MV  neutralization and MV production, and compared to 7 arbitrarily selected  non-medicinal plants. Significant differences (X2 p &lt; 0.05) were found  between the antiviral actions of medicinal and non-medicinal  species.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472x03h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kg92k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plant antiviral agents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children -- Nutrition -- Kenya</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vitamin A deficiency in children -- Kenya</dc:subject><dc:subject>Masai (African people) -- Medicine -- Kenya</dc:subject><dc:subject>Masai (African people) -- Nutrition -- Kenya</dc:subject><dc:subject>Masai (African people) -- Food -- Kenya</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bc12g"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Validation of the GEANT4 Monte Carlo code for radiotherapy applications</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poon, Emily S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>GEANT4 is a Monte Carlo code developed in an object-oriented  environment. It provides three models of electromagnetic physics, namely Standard,  Low-energy, and Penelope. In this work, we examined the accuracy of the photon and  electron interactions, and developed a user code for external beam radiotherapy  simulations. The code has the capabilities to collect phase space data, perform  variance reduction schemes, and calculate dose distributions in a phantom. For all  three models, the dose distributions of monoenergetic and clinical photon beams in  water are in good agreement with the EGSnrc simulations. For electron beams, the  results depend on the maximum electron step size. Significant step size artifacts  are also found in the transport of electrons through a thin aluminum slab. Our  studies of interface perturbation effects and Fano cavity response illustrated  potential problems with the condensed history algorithm. Overall, GEANT4 can be used  in applications where electron transport is not critical.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w288x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc12g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah702q695p"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Respiratory sinus arrhythmia : interaction of breathing frequency and heart rate changes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lesiuk, Veronika</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Heart rate variability is commonly interpreted as a measure of  vagal tone. Changes in heart rate variability and more specifically respiratory  sinus arrhythmia (RSA) are however also commonly observed when breathing is altered  without changes in heart. This study examined how decreasing vagal tone through a  low level (6%MVC) handgrip (HG) contraction and changing breathing frequency, alone  or in combination, affected heart rate variability and respiratory sinus arrhythmia.  ECG and respiratory recordings were obtained in 16 university students. Results show  that decreasing breathing rate did not affect mean heart rate but resulted in a  significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) from baseline values in RSA amplitude (%)  (SP: 0.11+/-0.07; SP-4: 0.14+/-0.07). On the other hand, under spontaneous breathing  conditions sustained handgrip contraction resulted in a small yet significant  increase in mean heart rate (SP: 62+/-6 bpm; SP-4: 69+/-11 bpm; p &lt; 0.05) but  was not associated with significant changes in RSA amplitude. The slope of the  relationship between RSA amplitude and respiratory cycle duration was taken to  reflect the vagal responsiveness to respiratory stimulation. A slight downward  parallel shift from baseline was observed under sustained HG but significant  differences in slope or y-intercept were not observed. These results suggest that  indices of heart rate variability and respiratory sinus arrhythmia may be more  appropriate indices of cardiac vagal efferent activity modulations by respiration  than tonic activity.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fp51f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q695p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Respiration</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arrhythmia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bh816"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Genetics of avermectin resistance in the nematode parasite Haemonchus contortus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Levitt, Nancy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objectives of this study are to estimate the degree to which  a glutamate-gated chloride channel gene (HcGluCla) contributes to survival of  moxidectin treatment and to study the relative dominance of those alleles. The  phenotype of individual adult H. contortus with respect to feeding was determined  using an inulin uptake assay. Genotype was determined using a diagnostic PCR assay.  In the absence of moxidectin, homozygous susceptible genotypes fed significantly  more than homozygous resistant genotypes. The effect of the susceptible allele was  dominant. In the presence of moxidectin, feeding in the susceptible homozygotes was  reduced to the level found in the resistant homozygotes, which were unaffected by  the drug. These results suggest that the function of the two alleles is different  and that they also respond differently to the drug, the resistant allele being  unaffected by the drug. The selection coefficient, s, is the selective difference  between the resistant and susceptible genotypes with regard to feeding. Parasites  with the resistant allele were seen to feed less in the absence of the drug, i.e.,  the effect is recessive. In the presence of the drug, there was no difference  between resistant and susceptible parasite feeding. These results suggest that  resistance may have hidden complexities.

Similar to TNFR members, p75NTR has  been reported to mediate programmed cell death (PCD) in a variety of systems,  including during development and in response to central nervous system (CNS) injury.  However, in contrast to TNFR members, which typically signal via Caspase 8 to elicit  cell death, studies conducted in our laboratory have demonstrated that p75NTR  induces cell death via an intrinsic mitochondrial death cascade involving c-Jun  N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and  activation of Caspases 9, 3 and 6. In an effort to determine the mechanism by which JNK  communicates with the mitochondria, we examined downstream targets of JNK including  the BH3-domain-only proteins. BH3-domain-only proteins are members of the Bcl-2  family of proteins, which have been dubbed mitochondrial gate-keepers, referring to  their ability to regulate release of mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c in  response to apoptotic stimuli. Our studies revealed that p75NTR overexpression does  not transcriptionally upregulate BH3-domain-only proteins, rather, it results in  phosphorylation of BH3 proteins, Bad and BimEL at Serines 128 and 65, respectively,  in a JNK-dependent manner. Furthermore, through loss of function studies employing  RNA interference constructs targeting either Bad or Bim, as well as Bad S 128A- or  BimEL S65A dominant negative constructs, we demonstrated that Bad is critical for  p75NTR-mediated apoptosis, while BimEL may contribute but is less critical.  Together, these studies reveal key roles for BH3-domain-only proteins in  p75NTR-mediated apoptosis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752h29j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53ww37b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qj25x"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation of the effect of dental status on nutritional status in patients with oral cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jia, Haiou</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objective. To investigate the effect of dental status on  nutritional status in oral cancer patients. Method. A prospective study design was  initially conducted on a group of post-therapeutic oral cancer patients. However,  the level of compliance was low, so to ensure fullest use of the data, analyses were  performed assuming a cross-sectional study design. Nutritional, dental and clinical  information were analyzed at two time periods: evaluation one was at 1-6 months, and  evaluation two was at 7-12 months post-therapy. Multiple linear regression analyses  were used to evaluate the relationship between dental and nutritional status.  Results. 44 subjects participated in evaluation one and 40 participated in  evaluation two. Analyses showed that edentulism was a significant predictor for most  nutritional indicators adjusting for age, gender, and C-reactive protein.  Conclusion. Edentulous oral cancer patients demonstrated significantly poorer  nutritional status than fully and partially dentate patients.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149q47q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qj25x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Dentistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sd30p"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cheat controlled synchronization schemes for online multiplayer games</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chen, Bei Di, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the key issues with online multiplayer games is game play  fairness. In both centralized and decentralized architectures the ordering of  command messages from clients for execution is an important issue that impacts  fairness and response time of game play. Recently, a fair-ordered message exchange  protocol (FMEP), based on "reaction" times was proposed to order command  messages for a client-server model. This thesis presents a cheat controlled protocol  (CCP) that can be used to control cheating in the FMEP. We examined the performance  of the CCP by emulating wide-area game play scenarios on the Planet-Lab. The results  from the experiments indicate that the CCP is able to dramatically reduce the  cheating opportunities that exist for clients. On the other hand, for the  decentralized (distributed) model, one approach is to follow a "lock step"  scheme that prevents any client from acting upon a message until that message is  received by all clients. In this thesis, we present a fair synchronization protocol  (FSP) that enforces fairness and is more efficient than the lock-step scheme. The  basic FSP is susceptible to cheating. Therefore, we added a cheat prevention  mechanism as an enhancement. We implemented the enhanced protocol, the Cheat Proof  Protocol (CPP), on the Planet-Lab and studied the performance under the same game  play scenarios used for the CCP. The results indicate that the CPP is effective in  enforcing fairness and cheat prevention.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nr555.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sd30p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agt54kn729"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of fluorescence-based high-throughput assays for diels-alder reactions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Caputo, Christine A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Diels-Alder reaction is one of the most powerful reactions  available to synthetic chemists. Novel catalysts for this reaction are constantly  being evaluated, thus creating a need for high-throughput assays. In this thesis,  three strategies were tested in the design of novel fluorescence-based assays to  monitor Diels-Alder reactions. The first strategy relied on intermolecular FRET  pairing using fluorescence donors as dienes and fluorescence acceptors as dienophile  (or vice versa). The second strategy utilized the dienophile naphthalene fumarate  ethyl ester which contains a quenched fluorescent moiety. This dienophile was  expected to regain its fluorescence upon Diels-Alder reaction with a diene. The  third strategy involved a masked 7-hydroxycoumarin fluorophore linked to a  dienophile. The fluorophore was positioned so that after Diels-Alder reaction it  could be easily eliminated. The third strategy was the most promising even though  several problems had to be overcome.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tf98k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kn729</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn009z348"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The nature and degree of stress experienced by child protection social workers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Robson, Clint Hyatt</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This quantitative study was conducted using a population of  Child Protection Social Workers (CPSWs) and other staff at a relatively small Child  Welfare agency in Eastern Ontario (Northumberland County).

The goal of the research was to add to the scant empirical data regarding stress and  post-traumatic stress in CPSWs and Child Welfare organizations as a whole. The  results indicated that 9 out of 11 front-line CPSWs were considered to be  experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder based on their IES scores at the time of  the testing.

It is endorsed because it is perceived that  cultural competency of social work practitioners results in encounters with their  clients that are more appropriate in manner, and more helpful in outcome. Originally  a critique of failures of conventional practice, cultural competency has become so  widespread that its meaning has become obscured. This study examines the literature on Cultural Competency. It  includes the preceding work on cross-cultural, multi-cultural and diversity  literature. It examines definitions of culture in the context of competency and what  is included and excluded; historical and regional development and its relationship  to concepts such as ethnicity, race, class, identity and cultural indices. It also  reviews what is considered best Social Work practice at this time and what problems  can develop from this perspective.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35t9163.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xs25s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social work with minorities</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cross-cultural counseling</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73pw668"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Competition policy in countries of Central and Eastern Europe : competition in Europe or competition for Europe</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Batagelj, Leon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Competition policy is an important tool for assurance of the  efficient allocation of resources in functioning market economies. Applicability of  modern competition policy to situations in former planned economies, however, raises  doubts because of fundamentally different states of competition in such markets.  This study analyses development of competition policy in Poland, Hungary and the  Czech Republic. Particular attention is given to the influence of the EU competition  policy in the framework of negotiations for final membership in the  EU. This study proposes reassessment of the competition policy of  the three countries in order to better tackle the economic complexities of  transition to fully functioning market economies. Harmonization of competition  policy of the three candidate countries for EU membership with competition policy of  the EU assumes appropriateness of EU competition policy for transition situations.  Contrary to this assumption, the thesis argues that competition policy in transition  should be tailored closely to the needs of transition. Since harmonization of  competition law is only an instrument to evaluate whether a candidate country has a  functioning market economy that can be integrated in the EU Internal Market,  competition policy aimed at better promoting competition should be  welcomed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Janda, Richard</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j6232.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73pw668</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hungary -- Commercial policy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition -- Government policy -- Hungary</dc:subject><dc:subject>Czech Republic -- Commercial policy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition -- Government policy -- Poland</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poland -- Commercial policy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition -- Government policy -- Czech Republic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f1774"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>He who votes decides nothing --</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Warman, Richard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>What is the meaning of the right to vote, and the concurrent  right to play a meaningful role in the electoral process as guaranteed by s. 3 and  informed by the equality provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms?

The English Jenkins Commission is examined, as are the lessons  to be learned from the experiences of Germany, South Africa, Italy, and New Zealand  with proportional representation voting. At home, the tentative steps toward voting  reform in Quebec, British Columbia, PEI, and the work of the Law Commission of  Canada are discussed. Finally, basic goals for voting reform are suggested and  measured against model recommendations. The prospects for reform ultimately depend  on a rebalancing of the values of democracy and power.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sheppard, Colleen</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k473.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f1774</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Proportional representation -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Elections -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Voting -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akw52j866p"><ual:graduationDate>1978</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Political fragmentation, municipal expenditures, and public service provision in the Montreal metropolitan area : a study in urban political geography</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Barlow, I.
