This thesis explores the role of tachyonic instabilities in cosmology considering tachyons which arise in string theory and also more conventional, field theoretic instabilities. Our study of such instabilities is, in part, motivated by attempts to embed inflation into string theory. We will argue that the study of string theory models of inflation is well-motivated and may provide a rare potential observational window into string physics. After reviewing the necessary background material concerning inflation, cosmological perturbation theory and tachyonic instabilities we study in detail the dynamics of the tachyonic instability which marks the end of a particular string theory model of inflation, focusing on the processes of reheating and cosmic string production. We show that the peculiar dynamics of the open string tachyon leads to various novelties in these processes and consider also potential observational consequences. We consider tachyonic preheating at the end of hybrid inflation in a conventional field theory setting and show that the preheating process can leave an observable imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background, either through n = 4 contamination of the power spectrum or else through large nongaussian signatures. The possibility of large nongaussianity is particularly interesting since it demonstrates that hybrid inflation provides one of the few well-motivated models which can generate an observable nongaussian signature. Finally, we study a novel string theoretic model of inflation, p-adic inflation. This model is nonlocal, however, it is free of the usual problems (such as ghosts) which plague nonlocal theories. Furthermore, the nonlocal structure of the theory leads to a variety of unexpected dynamics including the possiblity of a slowly rolling inflaton, despite an extremely steep potential.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290f74m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3015598</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Inflationary universe</dc:subject><dc:subject>String models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tachyons</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494d530"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Distributed diffractive structures for micro-optical systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bisaillon, Eric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In modern communications systems, the components supporting wavelength division for increased density are rapidly becoming small compared with the wavelength of light being manipulated. As the size of these devices shrinks there comes a point when the features of interest become smaller than the wavelength and thereby the fundamental properties of light interaction with such structures change dramatically. In these structures and materials, resonances, effective properties, and band-gaps arise and offer designers a new realm of possibilities for the design of high quality factor resonators, filters and switches. The study of structures comprising two different scales compared with the wavelength of light promises interesting optical possibilities for future devices. In these structures a subwavelength size feature is used in conjunction with a super-wavelength size feature. This thesis will show how the resulting optical behavior for such structures arises from the combination of the sub- and super-wavelength diffractive effects. Two application examples of these two-scale devices will be studied: the distributed echelle grating and the subwavelength based Fabry-Perot cavity. Both of these applications can be thought, of as distributed diffractive structures, a structure in which diffraction and subwavelength scale interference combine to produce high efficiency and versatile new devices.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193f067.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494d530</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Diffraction gratings</dc:subject><dc:subject>Echelle gratings</dc:subject><dc:subject>Optoelectronic devices -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687n419"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the dynamics and predictability of moist turbulence</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Spyksma, Kyle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis I present a simple, computationally-inexpensive moist turbulence model in order to study the differences between moist and dry turbulence. The model is validated by comparing a moist-bubble simulation with ones presented in Grabowski and Clark (1993) using a more-sophisticated model. We show that the outputs compare well and that our model can easily be extended to higher resolutions due to its simplified equations and uncomplicated implementation. Measurements of liquid water content spectra from the 3843 validation run are shown having shallow slopes, implying that moist processes require high resolution. Consideration is also given to the issue of Gibb's oscillations near sharp gradients, such as at a cloud boundary. It is shown that, due to our high resolutions, the dynamics of our model are not seriously affected if corrections are not made to address them. The model is used to study the small-scale predictability and dynamics of moist and dry shallow convective turbulence. Although moist flows are less predictable than their associated dry flows, we can account for the differences via a simple scaling. Using large-scale (the root-mean-squared vorticity) and small-scale (the dissipation wavenumber, kd) measures, we can reconcile classical predictability statistics from both wet and dry runs, with different lapse rates and relative humidities. Finally, I present a more thorough investigation of the dynamical differences between wet and dry convective turbulence, and then consider the very small-scale (ℓ ≲ 10 m) variability of liquid water content and compare our high-resolution simulation results to existing in situ cumulus-cloud observations. We find that there is a small decrease in the spatial intermittency of vorticity in wet runs relative to dry ones. This is consistent with the idea that evaporation of the liquid water in the clouds reduces the instabilities that would lead to the most intense vortices. At the same time, the liquid water content spectra show that in these areas of intense mixing and cloud decay, the characteristic scale of variability is shifted to smaller scales compared to a passive scalar. Further integrations in which the convective forcing is removed show that as the amount of liquid water decreases through evaporation, there is delayed decay of the smallest scales of the cloud. These findings may explain the small-scale shallow liquid water content spectra from cumulus-cloud fly-through measurements reported in Davis et al. (1999).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qv10n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687n419</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Atmospheric turbulence -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wr96h"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dialect speakers, academic achievement, and power : First Nations and Métis children in standard English classrooms in Saskatchewan</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sterzuk, Andrea</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This doctoral dissertation focuses on the negotiation of power in schools and the social and academic experiences of First Nations and Metis children who speak a non-standard variety of English called Indigenous English. Indigenous English is a dialect of English spoken by many Indigenous peoples in Canada; it is especially discernable in the Prairie Provinces, yet it is not widely recognized by the majority of the population. This thesis explores the experience of dialect speakers of Indigenous English in the standard English School and educator perceptions of their literacy and language abilities. This classroom study was conducted in an urban community in Saskatchewan. The focus of the research was a Grade 3/4 classroom with 25 students, six of whom were interviewed for this study. Additionally, interviews were conducted with eleven educators. The results of this study indicate that the First Nations children of this study speak a dialect of English that differs phonologically, morphologically, syntactically, and lexically from the Standard English spoken in Saskatchewan. The results of this PhD research indicate that Indigenous English-speaking students use discourse behaviour that differs from that of their White settler classmates. In examining the children's speech and classroom behaviour, it becomes apparent that silence, teasing, and story telling are important discourse characteristics of Indigenous English. The findings indicate that White settler educators demonstrate little awareness of the systematic linguistic and discourse characteristics of Indigenous English and that this lack of awareness is apparent in White settler educators' descriptions of their approaches to teaching, literacy development, classroom management, evaluation, and referral of First Nations and Metis students for speech and language assessment. Other findings include denial of difference, and a race/class divide in the school and community. Possible resolutions to the problems faced by these students may include teacher training and dialect awareness classes. This field has not been adequately explored and further research is needed to discover viable solutions to the issues experienced by dialect speakers of Indigenous English in the Standard English classroom.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rj68w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wr96h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Academic achievement -- Saskatchewan</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching (Elementary) -- Saskatchewan</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Dialects -- Saskatchewan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indigenous peoples -- Saskatchewan -- Education (Elementary)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahx11xj954"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>&amp;quot;Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also&amp;quot; : narrative, ethics, and possessions in Luke-Acts</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Spaulding, David Alan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a project in narrative New Testament ethics. It offers a fresh reading of the material in Luke-Acts that concerns wealth and possessions, beginning with two primary premises, which are developed in Part 1: (1) The descriptive and synthetic activities traditionally accorded to New Testament ethics are not fully separable from the hermeneutical and pragmatic concerns usually considered the domain of theological ethics. (2) The conceptualizations of the moral life readers bring with them to the biblical text will influence the reading strategies they employ and thus the critical readings that result. Based on these premises, this thesis reads Luke-Acts with a contemporary, pragmatic ethical question in view, "What attitudes, dispositions, and practices should members of Christian communities in North America at the beginning of the third Christian millennium adopt in an environment of personal and societal affluence, capitalist consumerism, and economic globalization?" Furthermore, it approaches Luke-Acts in terms of a narratively-based ethics of character, based on the work of Alasdair Maclntyre and Stanley Hauerwas. A concluding chapter in Part 1 locates Luke's narrative moral discourse within the moral discourse of narrative literature in New Testament literary environment. Part 2 begins by surveying recent readings of the possessions theme in Luke-Acts, highlighting the problem of presenting a consistent reading of the diverse material related to this theme in Luke's narrative. Employing a narrative-critical methodology that presents a sequential reading of the material related to this theme in the form of close readings of important episodes, it demonstrates that by reading this material in terms of the premises established in Part 1 a coherent reading is possible. Reading Luke-Acts as narrative discourse yields a coherent yet complex view of material possessions which understands them as a spiritual and moral peril to those who fall under their sway, while simultaneously showing them to be a divine gift that may be used in diverse ways to sustain human well-being. A concluding chapter summarizes these findings and makes suggestions concerning the usefulness of this reading in the moral formation of the contemporary community of faith.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k6644.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xj954</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Property -- Biblical teaching</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ethics in the Bible</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440x84t"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Adjudication in religious family laws : cultural accommodation, legal pluralism, and women's rights in India</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Solanki, Gopika</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Multi-religious and multi-ethnic democracies face the challenge of constructing accommodative arrangements that can both facilitate cultural diversity and ensure women's rights within religio-cultural groups. This thesis is an investigation of the Indian state's policy of legal pluralism in recognition of religious family laws in India. The Indian state has adopted a model of what I have termed "shared adjudication" in which the state shares its adjudicative authority with internally heterogeneous religious groups and civil society in the regulation of marriage among Hindus and Muslims. Combining theoretical frameworks of state-society relations, feminist theory, and legal pluralism, and drawing from ethnographic research conducted in state courts, caste and sect councils, and "doorstep law courts," I pay analytical attention to state-society interactions at the interface of religious family laws. State and non-state sources of legal authority construct internally contested and heterogeneous notions of the conjugal family, gender relations, and religious membership, and they transmit them across legal spheres. These dynamic processes of communication reconstitute the interiors of religious, state, and civic legal orders, and they fracture the homogenised religious identities grounded in hierarchical gender relations within the conjugal family. Within the interstices of state and society---which are used imaginatively by state and societal actors---the Indian model points towards an open-ended and process-oriented conception of state-society relations that encompasses not only the binary of conflict and cooperation, but also communication between state and society. The "shared adjudication" model facilitates diversity as it allows the construction of hybrid religious identities, creates fissures in ossified group boundaries, and provides institutional spaces for ongoing inter-societal dialogue between religious groups, civil society, and the state. This pluralized legal sphere, governed by ideologically diverse legal actors, can thus increase women's rights in law, and despite its limitations, the transformative potential of women's collective agency effects institutional change.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zj74z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440x84t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Domestic relations -- India</dc:subject><dc:subject>Legal polycentricity -- India</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion and law -- India</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women's rights -- India</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women and religion -- India</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s4426"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Desautels Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Three essays on volatility specification in option valuation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mimouni, Karim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most recent empirical option valuation studies build on the affine square root (SQR) stochastic volatility model. The SQR model is a convenient choice, because it yields closed-form solutions for option prices. However, relatively little is known about the empirical shortcomings of this model. In the first essay, we investigate alternatives to the SQR model, by comparing its empirical performance with that of five different but equally parsimonious stochastic volatility models. We provide empirical evidence from three different sources. We first use realized volatilities to assess the properties of the SQR model and to guide us in the search for alternative specifications. We then estimate the models using maximum likelihood on a long sample of S&amp; P500 returns. Finally, we employ nonlinear least squares on a time series of cross sections of option data. In the estimations on returns and options data, we use the particle filtering technique to retrieve the spot volatility path. The three sources of data we employ all point to the same conclusion: the SQR model is misspecified. Overall, the best of alternative volatility specifications is a model we refer to as the VAR model, which is of the GARCH diffusion type. In the second essay, we estimate the Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) model in order to study the level of nonlinearity in the volatility dynamic. We also estimate a CEV process combined with a jump process (CEVJ) and analyze the effects of the jump component on the nonlinearity coefficient. Estimation is performed using the particle filtering technique on a long series of S&amp;P500 returns and on options data. We find that both returns data and returns-and-options data favor nonlinear specifications for the volatility dynamic, suggesting that the extensive use of linear models is not supported empirically. We also find that the inclusion of jumps does not affect the level of nonlinearity and does not improve the CEV model fit. The third essay provides an empirical comparison of two classes of option valuation models: continuous-time models and discrete-time models. The literature provides some theoretical limit results for these types of dynamics, and researchers have used these limit results to argue that the performance of certain discrete-time and continuous-time models ought to be very similar. This interpretation is somewhat contentious, because a given discrete-time model can have several continuous-time limits, and a given continuous-time model can be the limit for more than one discrete-time model. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate whether there exist similarities between these specifications from an empirical perspective. Using data on S&amp;P500 returns and call options, we find that the discrete-time models investigated in this paper have the same performance in fitting the data as selected continuous-time models both in and out-of-sample.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430890h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s4426</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Options (Finance) -- Valuation -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Options (Finance) -- Prices -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494d548"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Gender and property among sedentarized pastoralists of Northern Kenya</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mitchell, Judith Dale</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the context of growing poverty and sedentarization, the socio-economic status of pastoral women is an important indicator of how pastoralists in northern Kenya respond to social change. Accordingly, this study examines women's position in three communities in distinct settings of sedentarization. One is located in a semi-arid region dedicated to pastoralism and conservation, while the other two are in a moister mountain area where rain-fed and irrigation agriculture is combined with animal production. Analyses of quantitative and qualitative data, gathered from women and men during 2002--2003, indicate that women have largely responded to social change by using two strategies to secure the well-being of themselves and their children. First, despite the cultural assumption that married women are supported by their husbands, they have strengthened their relationships with natal kin, solidifying a support network to carry them through times of difficulty. Secondly, given decline in returns from subsistence pastoralism, women have seized numerous opportunities to diversify their economic pursuits in order to generate steady income. Essentially, findings illustrate that, in addition to gaining access to various resources through their marital homes and their own efforts, the majority of women receive socio-economic support from their natal kin, especially brothers. In two communities where land is being privatized, most women have been excluded from the land registration process because of traditional and national policies. However, many fathers are awarding their daughters permanent usufruct rights to family land to ensure they do not become landless because of the death of a spouse or negligence on the part of husbands. Although this does not eliminate the discrimination many women face from being excluded from the registration process, it is a move towards the betterment of women's long-term food and financial security. Besides contributing to domestic activities, women engage in very different forms of income-generating activities; in Archer's Post, they obtain earnings from craft sales or tourist-related services, in Parkishon/Karare they gain income from milk-marketing, while in Songa, women pursue cultivation for subsistence and market sale. It is a positive finding that most women generate steady income over which they have managed to maintain control.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128g21x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494d548</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- Kenya -- Social conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nomads -- Sedentarization -- Kenya</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nomads -- Kenya -- Economic conditions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45qd92s"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification, isolation and characterization of proinsulin producing thymic cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Palumbo, Michael O.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The finding that more than 152 tissue-restricted antigens are expressed by thymic medullary epithelial cells is redefining the importance of thymic central tolerance induction in the prevention of autoimmune diseases. One of the tissue-restricted antigens in the thymus is proinsulin, and in both mice and humans, reduced thymic proinsulin levels have been shown to predispose to Type 1 diabetes. Using transgenic mice expressing a functional beta-Galactosidase gene under the regulation of the Ins2 promoter we have determined that between 1-3% of all medullary thymic epithelial cells express proinsulin and that these cells are frequently part of the Hassall's Corpuscles like structures in mice. Using a cross between the beta-Galactosidase expressing mice and Immortomice (expressing SV40 large T Antigen under the regulation of the MHC I promoter), we have isolated and cultured two proinsulin and two non-proinsulin producing medullary epithelial cell lines. Microarray analysis and RT-PCR analysis of the cell lines revealed the over-expression of approximately 50 genes (&gt;4 fold or more) in the proinsulin producing lineage, versus the non proinsulin producing lineage, and approximately half the over-expressed genes can be considered tissue-restricted antigens. We do not find any evidence for chromosomal clustering of the over-expressed genes nor do we report the expression of any other pancreatic n-cell antigens or specific pancreatic proinsulin regulatory proteins (Pdx-1, Glut-2 or GCK) within the proinsulin producing cell lines but we do detect their expression in whole thymus. Our results suggest that chromosomal clustering is not a phenomenon associated with thymic tissue-restricted antigen expression and that the mechanisms allowing for thymic tissue-restricted antigen expression are not related to the expression mechanisms of such antigens in peripheral tissues.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634769d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qd92s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Thymus Gland -- cytology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proinsulin -- biosynthesis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epithelial Cells -- cytology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053m52j"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Reprogrammable optical phase array</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mony, Madeleine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The evolving needs of network carriers are changing the design of optical networks.

The device is a Reprogrammable Optical Phase Array (ROPA), and the design consists of applying multiple electric fields of different magnitudes across an electro-optic material in order to create a diffractive optical element. The configuration of the electric fields can change to modify the properties of the diffractive device. Such a device has a wide range of potential applications, and two different ROPA designs are presented. Both designs are optimized to function as 1xN optical switches. The switches are wavelength tunable and have switching times on the order of microseconds.

The design, simulation, fabrication and testing of both the electrical and optical components of the devices are presented.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397d495.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053m52j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Metal oxide semiconductors, Complementary -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Optical communications -- Equipment and supplies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Optoelectronic devices -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289p17m"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Towards developing strong early therapeutic relationships : client attachment and therapist responsiveness in relationship building incidents</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Janzen, Jennifer, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of the present research was to provide a structure for understanding the combinations of client attachment concerns, therapist interventions, and therapist interpersonal qualities that facilitate the development of strong therapeutic relationships by drawing upon the propositions of attachment theory and interpersonal theory. The first study supported the hypothesis that relationship incidents provide the relational information required for the client to feel secure enough with their therapist to explore in session. Following their third session, thirty volunteer clients seen by therapist trainees nominated an incident they felt was important to the development of their therapeutic relationship. General attachment was associated with the developing relationship with therapist, and this relationship was associated with exploration in-session. As expected, following a relationship building event, the client experienced the therapist as a safe haven from which to explore. The client's ability to attach to the therapist in the relationship building incident was related to avoidant attachment. Client in-session exploration, conceptualized as cognitive openness, was associated with the attachment-related relationship with the therapist, but not general attachment orientation. Within a framework that explicitly bridges attachment and interpersonal theory; the results of the second study offer differential support for the suggestions of interpersonal theory and attachment theory depending upon the attachment dimension in question. The predictions of interpersonal theory were generally supported in regards to clients with attachment anxiety; in relationship building incidents, therapists allowed themselves to be hooked by client interpersonal schemas however, they also refrained from eliciting emotions with these clients in early sessions. For clients high on avoidance, the results support suggestions from the attachment literature. Therapists met client distancing with proximity---seeking interventions unhooking from client interpersonal expectations; however while doing so, therapists provided the client with a containing framework. Together these studies highlight the importance of client attachment in the development of the therapeutic relationship and extend the findings from attachment research in social psychology to the therapeutic situation. This work adds to the growing literature that supports the clinical utility of Bowlby's attachment framework in assessment and intervention with adults, particularly in regards to the therapeutic relationship.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xj96d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289p17m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Therapist and patient</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abz60d179b"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Desautels Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Three essays on fixed income markets</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Karoui, Lotfi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis comprises three essays that explore several theoretical and empirical features of affine term structure models. In the first essay, we focus on the ability of continuous-time affine term structure models to capture time variability in the second conditional moment. Using data on US Treasury yields, we conclude that affine term structure models are much better at extracting time-series volatility from the cross-section of yields than argued in the literature. These models have nonetheless difficulty capturing volatility dynamics at the short end of the maturity spectrum, perhaps indicating some form of segmentation between long-maturity and short-maturity bonds. These results are robust to the choice of sample period, interpolation method and estimation method. In the second essay, we propose the use of the unscented Kalman filter technique for the estimation of affine term structure models using non-linear instruments. We focus on swap rates and show that the unscented Kalman filter leads to important reductions in bias and gains in precision. The use of the unscented Kalman filter results in substantial improvements in out-of-sample forecasts. Our findings suggest that the unscented Kalman filter may prove to be a good approach for a number of problems in fixed income pricing in which the relationship between the state vector and the observations is nonlinear, such as the estimation of term structure models using interest rate derivatives or coupon bonds, and the estimation of quadratic term structure models. The third essay provides a tractable framework for pricing defaultable securities with recovery risk. Pricing solutions are explored for a large family of discrete-time affine processes and a five-factor Gaussian model is estimated on BBB and B Standard and Poor's yield indices. This rich econometric setup allows the model to simultaneously capture two important stylized facts of defaultable securities: The positive correlation between the loss given default and the intensity of default, and the negative correlation between the intensity of default and the risk-free interest rate.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h1572.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60d179b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fixed-income securities -- Prices -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fixed-income securities -- Valuation -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hp57h"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Functional studies of MEIS1, a HOX co-factor</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Goh, Siew-Lee</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>HOX proteins are evolutionarily conserved homeodomain-containing transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis and patterning during embryogenesis. Their tasks as master regulators of embryonic development are achieved in large part through their ability to interact with co-factors of the PBX and MEIS/PREP families, which constitute the broader three amino-acid loop extension (TALE) class of homeodomain proteins. HOX, MEIS, and PBX have been implicated in leukemic hematopoiesis due to their association with hematological malignancies. The oncogenic function of MEIS1 in accelerating the onset of acute myeloid leukemia induced by HOX was mapped to its C-terminal transactivation domain, which is responsive to PKA signaling. This thesis extends our understanding regarding the mechanism by which MEIS1A executes its C-terminal transactivation function in vivo. We describe the involvement of CREB and its co-activators CBP and TORC in conferring the PKA-responsiveness of the ME1S1A C terminus. CREB mutants that fail to bind CBP or TORC also fail to promote PKA induction mediated by the C terminus of ME1S1A. TORC was further shown to be capable of bypassing the need for PKA to activate transcription by MEIS1, an ability endowed by its physical interaction with MEIS1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated a concerted recruitment of endogenous MEIS1, TORC2, and CREB proteins on ME1S1 target genes. In addition, this thesis also characterizes the promoter of the murine Meis1 gene. Meis1 possesses multiple transcription start sites upstream of its translation initiation site. We identified a ME1S·PBX consensus recognition site within the Meis1 promoter and showed that PBX1 binds to this sequence in vitro. Our ChIP assay results further suggest an autoregulatory mode for the Meis1 gene as revealed by a co-occupancy of endogenous CREB, TORC2, PBX1, and MEIS1 itself on the Meis1 promoter. Collectively, this thesis proposes a mechanistic action conferred by CREB, CBP and TORC in the PKA-inducible transactivation of ME1S1A, and provides new information on the Meis1 promoter.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h5830.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hp57h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Homeodomain Proteins -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neoplasm Proteins -- genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494d55j"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The properties of collinear facilitation in human vision</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Huang, Pi-Chun, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The detection threshold of a luminance-defined Gabor is improved by two high contrast, aligned flanking Gabors, an effect termed collinear facilitation. However, the neural basis of collinear facilitation is not well understood. This thesis focuses on a number of issues in collinear facilitation to better our understanding of its neural basis. (1) Cortical sites: the cortical site of collinear facilitation was investigated, and results showed that collinear facilitation is a purely monocular phenomenon. (2) Temporal properties: Collinear facilitation has fast dynamics for initiation and once collinear facilitation occurs it either decays slowly or is associated with a sustained detection. (3) Selectivity to other types of stimuli: chromatic stimuli (which isolated the S-cone opponent and the L/M cone opponent mechanisms) and 2nd order stimuli (a 2D white noise or ID noise multiplied with a Gabor envelope) were used and the results showed that collinear facilitation occurs in chromatic processing, and that some 2nd order stimuli also exhibit collinear facilitation. However, there was no interaction between luminance and chromatic systems nor between 1st and 2nd order mechanisms, suggesting independent processing streams for collinear facilitation. All of these results supported the conclusion that collinear facilitation is not a general property of cortical neurons in V1 since most V1 neurons are binocular, sensitive to both chromatic and achromatic stimuli and sensitive to both 1 st and 2nd order stimuli. Furthermore, the temporal properties of collinear facilitation suggest complex dynamic interactions, not simply explained by the passive propagation of long-range recurrent intra-cortical connections between flanks and target.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sz01w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494d55j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Visual Perception -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Visual Cortex -- physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abc386p72x"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The handling of iron by erythroid and erythrophagocytic cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sheftel, Alexander D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Iron is not a trace element in mammalian physiology. Using textbook values for blood volume (5.5 L), red blood cell (RBC) count (5 million/muL), and a lifespan of 120 days for red blood cells, the equilibrium value for the erythrocyte generation/death rate in the average adult male human is over 2 million/sec. It follows that the amount of iron required for hemoglobin synthesis in one day amounts to about 25 mg. Virtually every atom of that 25 mg is recycled by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) that provide iron to the plasma for its subsequent delivery back to the erythron (with a small fraction going to other tissues). In light of the certain toxicity of unprotected iron, both erythroid precursors and RES macrophages perform remarkable tasks in handling such copious amounts of the catalytic metal. In my studies, I have examined specific aspects of iron metabolism in these two tissues. Iron is taken up by nearly every cell through a mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis, whereby the plasma iron binding protein transferrin (Tf) binds to its cognate receptor (TfR) on the cell surface, followed by internalization of the complex into a membrane bound organelle. Subsequent to endocytosis, the endosome is acidified by a v-ATPase proton pump, facilitating the release of iron from Tf. Through an unknown mechanism, iron is targeted to the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where the enzyme that inserts Fe2+ into protoporphyrin IX, ferrochelatase, resides. Although it has been demonstrated that the divalent metal transporter, DMT1, is responsible for the egress of reduced Fe from the vesicle, the immediate fate of the iron atoms after their transport across the vesicular membrane remains unknown. Therefore, we have investigated the uptake of iron in reticulocytes, cells that are taking up large amounts of iron for the synthesis of hemoglobin. Through both biochemical and imaging techniques, we have demonstrated that iron is transferred via a direct interorganellar relation between the endosome and mitochondria. The "haemoglobin-deficit" (hbd) mouse has an erythroid-specific mutation which is responsible for its microcytic, hypochromic phenotype. Previous studies have shown that these mice have normal dietary iron acquisition and normal to elevated serum iron levels. We therefore investigated the handling of iron in reticulocytes from these animals to determine whether the mutated gene possibly plays a role in the trafficking of transferrin-iron-containing organelles. A systematic examination of the steps in the transferrin pathway revealed that the intracellular trafficking of the protein is compromised in the hbd mice. The rapid turnover of iron by macrophages of the RES requires heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in heme degradation. This highly inducible enzyme, besides its major role in erythrocyte iron recycling, has been demonstrated to confer astonishing cytoprotectivity to cells and tissues in which its expression is elevated (either through chemical induction or genetic manipulation). In addition to, reportedly protective, carbon monoxide and biliverdin, the HO-1 catalyzed reaction releases ferrous iron, which itself is a potent pro-oxidant. Also, it is unlikely that there exists a significant amount of free heme in most tissues (i.e., non-erythroid, non-erythrophagocytic), to provide significant amounts of substrate to this enzyme. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the mechanism of heme oxygenase cytoprotection is removed from its function of heme catabolism. Therefore, we investigated whether increased expression of heme oxygenase will, in and of itself, alter iron metabolism in cultured cells. My experiments show that in the absence of exogenous hemin, elevation of HO-1 protein levels does not have any effect on cellular iron metabolism in cultured cells.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj139628w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386p72x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505472z"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Negative regulators of chromosome replication in the dimorphic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Spencer, William John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Caulobacter crescentus provides an accessible system for investigating the regulation of chromosome replication and cellular development. The Caulobacter cell cycle produces a free-swimming swarmer cell and a sessile stalk cell. In swarmer cells, chromosome replication is selectively repressed while stalk cells are committed to chromosome replication. In Caulobacter, chromosome replication is repressed, in part, by the binding of the response regulator CtrA to five binding sites (a-e) within the Caulobacter origin of replication (Cori ). Periodic phosphorylation of CtrA stimulates binding to the consensus sequence TTAA-N7-TTAA (N= any nucleotide) found in Cori and many cell-cycle regulated genes. This thesis presents an alternate mode of CtrA binding, namely, that phosphorylation does not stimulate binding to a specific class of CtrA-regulated promoters. This work shows that CtrA and CtrA-phosphate bind to two ctrA promoters with equal and weak affinity. As well, in vivo binding assays reveal that a non-proteolyzable CtrA allele (CtrADelta3) can occupy the ctrA promoters continuously without altering the temporal regulation of these promoters. The data suggest phosphorylation, while not increasing affinity for weak CtrA binding sites, provides allosteric signals that permit the recruitment of components required for transcription. The proposed allosteric mechanism of CtrA-regulated transcription may also be important for CtrA-mediated repression of chromosome replication. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) allow for the sensitive detection of specific protein/DNA complexes in vivo. ChIP reveals that CtrA binds to Cori in swarmers but not in stalk cells when chromosome replication commences. The protein chaperone, ClpX, was recruited to Cori prior to the start of S-phase and correlates with the loss of CtrA binding to Cori. Expression of a non-proteolyzable CtrADelta3 allele showed increased affinity for Cori DNA. The increase in CtrADelta3 binding stimulated a corresponding increase in C1pX binding to Cori. This evidence suggests that C1pX recruitment to Cori is likely CtrA-dependant. The absence of CtrA binding in stalk cells suggests other mechanisms may be required to prevent re-replication in stalk cells. An analysis of the Caulobacter genome identifies two DnaA-like genes. The first, cdl-1, is a homolog of the E. coli hda gene, a protein essential for regulated inactivation of DnaA (RIDA). The second, cdl-2, is a novel gene restricted to the alpha-proteobacteria group and whose function is unknown. Overexpression of either gene in Caulobacter produced filamentous cells that could not divide. DNA synthesis in these cells is also impaired and suggests the intracellular concentrations of these two proteins are important for coordinating proper cell cycle progression.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397d50x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505472z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wr97s"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nef pathogenesis in transgenic mice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Simard, Marie-Chantal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In order to study the functions of SIV Nef in vivo, in a small animal model, transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the SIVmac239 nef gene, under the control of the human CD4 gene promoter (CD4C) were generated. The transgene was found to be expressed in the same cells targeted by the virus, in vivo. These CD4C/SHIV-nef SIV Tg mice develop a severe AIDS-like disease, including premature death, failure to thrive/weight loss, wasting, thymic atrophy, exhibit an especially low number of peripheral CD8+ T cells as well as low number of peripheral CD4+ T cells, diarrhea, splenomegaly, kidney (interstitial nephritis, segmental glomerulosclerosis), lung (lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis) and heart disease. In addition, these Tg mice fail to mount a class-switched antibody response after immunization with ovalbumin, produce anti-DNA autoantibodies and some of them develop P. Carinii lung infection. These CD4C/SHIV-nefSIV Tg mice develop an AIDS-like disease very similar to that of CD4C/HIV Tg mice, except that the kidney and cardiac diseases were more severe, and that a thymic developmental defect was observed. Heart enlargement was very severe in CD4C/SIV Tg mice during early breeding on the C3H background. Histopathological lesions in the heart of these mice were also multifocal and were similar to those found in CD4C/HIV Tg mice. Data from echocardiography analysis are not yet available for these Tg mice. The low number of peripheral CD8+ and CD4 + T cells likely reflects a thymic defect and may be similar to the DiGeorge-like "thymic defect" immunophenotype described in a subgroup of HIV-1 infected children. Ontogeny studies show that the Tg mice were born with a smaller thymus and that this phenotype is not progressive in nature. As young as embryonic day 17, the thymic absolute cell numbers are lower in the Tg mice when compared to their non-Tg controls and there is a defect in thymocyte maturation in the transition between DN3 and DN4, with a failure to generate normal numbers of DP cells. Fetal liver transplantation studies have ruled out a significant impairment of the thymic epithelium and have suggested that this defect is likely a direct consequence of abnormal T cell progenitors in the thymus. Therefore, it appears that SIV Nef alone expressed in mice, in appropriate cell types and at sufficient levels, can elicit many of the phenotypes of simian and human AIDS. These Tg mice should be instrumental in studying the pathogenesis of SIV Nef-induced phenotypes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741w91m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wr97s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qh35h"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of steroid 5 [alpha]-reductase type 2 and androgen action in epididymal principal cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Seenundun, Shayesta</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Androgens, in particular dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are crucial for maintaining the structure and functions (sperm maturation and storage) of the epididymis. DHT is synthesized from testosterone by steroid 5alpha-reductase (Srd5aR) type 1 and type 2. Srd5aR1 and srd5aR2 have different tissue-specific distribution patterns and distinct genetic and biochemical properties. Srd5aR2 mRNA is more abundant than that of srd5aR1 in several sex accessory tissues, most dramatically in the epididymis, where it is predominantly expressed in the caput region. The two main objectives of this thesis are to elucidate the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of srd5aR2 in the rat epididymis and to identify androgen-dependent genes in epididymal principal cells. In the first objective, the 5'upstream region of srd5aR2 was cloned and analyzed. The gene's transcriptional start site was localized, regulatory elements and the core promoter were mapped, and the transcription factors SP1, and to a lesser extent SP3, were found to interact with srd5aR2 in the rat caput epididymidis and mouse proximal caput epididymidis (PC-1) cell line. The epigenetic regulation of srd5aR2 by DNA methylation was subsequently examined and contrasted to that of srd5aRl in tissues where the isozymes are differentially expressed. DNA methylation levels fluctuated along the 5'upstream region of both genes. Tissue-specific variations in adenine and cytosine methylation were also identified for srd5aR1 and srd5aR2, respectively. These studies constitute the first analysis of the 5'upstream region of srd5aR2, at both the transcriptional and epigenetic levels. In the second objective, the direct effects of androgens on principal cell gene expression were examined in PC-1 cells. The majority of androgen-regulated genes displayed an early or late transient increase in expression levels following androgen withdrawal. When DHT was added back to the media, a differential ability of rescue was seen among androgen-regulated genes depending on time of supplementation. This rescue ability was severely compromised after 4 days of androgen deprivation. These results provide novel insights into the response of principal cells to androgens. Together, the two objectives of this thesis impart greater understanding into the mechanisms of androgen action in the epididymis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593v058q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qh35h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bk141"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Justice in genetics : intellectual property and human rights from a cosmopolitan liberal perspective</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bernier, Louise, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Genetics is one sector in which there has been tremendous evolution and progress over the last few decades. While it is believed that genetics could offer tremendous opportunities for global health improvement, there is also a fear that existing global health inequalities will be amplified by the evolution of genetics. It thus appears necessary to analyse the way current assumptions define what is just and acceptable with regard to global access and distribution of resources in this field. Indeed, given the importance of genetics to human health globally, this thesis will evaluate two principal legal regimes---intellectual property and international human rights---to determine to which extent they further the goal of distributing the benefits of these technologies equitably and globally. This evaluation is vital to ensure that legal regimes assist in ensuring that this promising field develops in a way that improves global health without leaving the most vulnerable outside of the process. This dissertation will undertake this complex task by employing and building upon cosmopolitan liberal theories developed over the few last decades as an extension of the work of Rawls and Daniels. A theoretical framework to justify engaging in a global and more equitable redistribution of benefits produced by genetics is required. Ultimately, our analysis will produce strong normative benchmarks based on justice considerations for engaging in a global and more equitable redistribution of the benefits likely to emerge from genetic science. Universal consideration of all human beings, importance of health needs, normal functioning and equality of opportunities are some of the notions that will be analysed to construct this framework. We will then attempt to determine how and if this theory of distribution translates into positive law and to identify and analyse the main obstacles to legal compliance with global distributive justice. We will assess two main international normative systems: intellectual property law and human rights law to determine if their underlying philosophy, structure, and functioning take account of the principles highlighted in our theoretical framework and how underlying politics and economics matter. This will set out a basis for further discussion on how we could work around some of the major obstacles identified throughout our analysis. It will also help us move from the vague and often symbolic ideal of benefit sharing actually prevailing toward the establishment of a real, enforceable concept of global benefit sharing in health that would position genetics at the rank of essential tool for achieving global health.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w66347705.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bk141</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human rights</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Intellectual property</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33s1612"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Judicial review of unlawful combatant detentions under the United States Constitution</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jenkins, David, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines how United States federal courts can review the President's exercise of the war powers to detain American citizens, or non-citizens having similar rights, as unlawful combatants. It argues that the separation of powers doctrine, based on Lockean principles, permits probing judicial review of such an executive detention, where the President exercises the war powers in a way that effectively adjudicates individual rights or impacts upon domestic affairs. The constitutional controversy over unlawful combatant detentions is fundamentally a separation of powers problem. Existing functionalist and formalist theories about the separation doctrine, as well as dichotomous debates about individual rights versus national security, fail to reconcile judicial deference to executive decisions in some war powers cases with closer scrutiny in others. This thesis therefore proposes a new separation of powers theory that explains the existing war powers jurisprudence, while establishing principles upon which courts can vigorously review future executive war powers decisions that interfere with individual rights or impact upon domestic matters, such as with the detention of a citizen as an alleged unlawful combatant. The thesis first sets out a separation of powers theory based on the political thought of John Locke, placing upon each branch a fiduciary duty to make decisions only in ways best calculated to serve the public good. The "deliberative processes" approach to the separation doctrine, growing out of this fiduciary duty, functionally distributes constitutional power among the branches depending upon which one is most institutionally suited to resolve the matter at hand. Judicial application of the political question doctrine in past war powers cases demonstrates such a Lockean deliberative processes analysis, in the ways that courts have questioned judicial competency to scrutinize the executive's strategic military decisions. Cases dealing specifically with unlawful combatant detentions, in turn, show that judicial competence to review executive military decisions increases when the President functionally adjudicates individual rights of the citizen, a deliberative process for which the courts are more institutionally competent. Accordingly, this thesis concludes that courts can review executive unlawful combatant detentions under adjudicative standards of legality, procedural fairness, and reasonableness.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85ng387.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33s1612</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Separation of powers -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Judicial review -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>War and emergency powers -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dk93k"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Diyah as a third dimension to air carrier liability conventions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Naji, Alaa A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This abstract is written on the 11th of September 2006---the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon by Al-Qaeda. These attacks are taken to be a turning point in the relationship between Islam and the West. For the author, these attacks, the overwhelming counter-attacks by some of the western states on some Islamic states, as well as the endless Palestinian-Israeli disputes, are the result of misunderstanding and misconceptions that Islam and the West have of each other. While politics and politicians are destroying means of communication amongst these nations by the creation of such a state of war, scholars should exert their best efforts to build bridges of understanding and tolerance. This thesis is but a single brick in the much needed bridge of communication and understanding between the great civilisations of west and east. It seeks to show how the world's various legal traditions can benefit from each other. It attempts to do so by introducing the Islamic system of diyah and showing how it can interplay with and impact on the interpretation of international law. The example chosen is the existing set of air carrier liability conventions. 9/11 reminds us that attacks on air transport have been a chosen means of sowing conflict. Yet peaceful use of air transport is among the most practical ties that bind the world together. Air carrier liability conventions render international air transport possible. The thesis shows how Islamic diyah can productively interact with these conventions. It can act as a median point at which the two extremes of the Warsaw System prescribing limited liability and the Montreal Convention prescribing unlimited liability can meet. The thesis shows as well how diyah can provide a useful methodology for integrating air carrier contractual and extra-contractual liability regimes. To assist the reader unfamiliar with Islamic-fiqh, the thesis it is divided into two parts. The first is devoted to an introduction to Islamic-fiqh, and the second treats the interaction of diyah with the air carrier liability conventions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dr311.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dk93k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Liability for aircraft accidents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Compensation (Islamic law)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islamic law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avx021k32z"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Documentation in an elementary classroom : a teacher-researcher study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mesher, Pauline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to research the role of documentation in a cycle-two, year one classroom (Grade 3) in a suburban community in Quebec. As the teacher-researcher, my overarching question is to come to a better understanding of how documentation is carried out in the classroom. There are several questions that guide this research: (1) What kinds of documentation are used and what purposes do they serve? (2) What role(s) does the teacher play in the documentation process? (3) What role(s) do the children play in documentation? For the purpose of this study documentation is any recording of or about classroom activities, students, or events influencing learning (Dahlberg, Moss, &amp; Pence, 1999). Data forms included fieldnotes, video tapes, and classroom artifacts. I used complementary categorizing (Maykut &amp; Morehouse, 1994) and contextualizing (Erickson, 1986, 1992; Merryfield, 1990) approaches for analysis, aided by the computer software program Atlas.ti (Muhr, 1997). Three main categories of documentation were uncovered in the data. These are interactive documentation, reflective documentation, and process-oriented documentation. The activities that supported and sustained the creation of this documentation are explored in detail. The consequences of the documentation process resulted in what is described as an interactive classroom. The major conclusions concern the importance of communication cycles, flexible teacher roles, and the space provided for student participation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719r37x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021k32z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education -- Documentation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Portfolios in education</dc:subject><dc:subject>School reports</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qh36s"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A novel small molecule-based multi-targeting approach for the selective therapy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)- or Her2-expressing carcinomas</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Banerjee, Ranjita</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The chemotherapy of solid tumours is hampered by two major obstacles: (1) the lack of selectivity of the current drugs and (2) the reduced sensitivity to tumour drugs. Recent advances in cancer biology have led to the identification of novel molecular targets responsible for aggressive proliferation, drug resistance and invasiveness. Targeting one such factor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has proven an effective strategy to block the progression of solid tumours. However, the potency of the current clinical drugs directed at EGFR is mitigated by their reversible cytostatic activity and reduced cytotoxicity. Here we describe the design and synthesis of a new class of agents termed "cascade release combi-molecule" (I-TZ), "programmed" to hammer the receptor by releasing multiple bioactive metabolites (I-TZ', I-TZ") in a step-wise fashion and a reactive DNA damaging species (TZ), with the purpose of promoting sustained inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) and drug-induced cytotoxicity. This thesis describes the synthesis of one such molecule, RB24 (I-TZ), and demonstrates that it was capable of being hydrolyzed to its various sub-components with an overall half-life of 42 min under physiological conditions. The I-TZ induced sustained inhibition of the EGFR TK and strong antiproliferative activity in human solid tumour cells. It also inflicted higher levels of DNA damage to cancer cells transfected with the EGFR or HER2 gene. This selectivity was based on a novel mechanism of targeting described as a bystander effect, whereby following distribution of the I-TZ in the perinuclear region, the alkylating species (TZ) was subsequently released towards the nucleus. The I-TZ was significantly more potent than its clinical counterpart, TemodaI(TM). Further investigation of the mechanism underlying its superior potency show that blockade of EGFR-mediated signaling led to down-regulation of: (1) MAPK mitogenic signaling, (2) the BER protein, XRCC1 and (3) anti-apoptotic signaling mediated by Bad. Further down-regulation of XRCCI, with a MEK1 inhibitor, led to the discovery of a significant synergistic antiproliferative effect and a novel formula to further enhance the potency of the I-TZ in refractory tumours. Furthermore, the in vivo activity of the cascade release principle was proven in a prostate cancer xenograft study using a more water-soluble analogue of RB24. Thus, we have developed a novel model for the therapy of growth factor receptor-expressing tumours from the design and synthesis of the probe drugs, to the elucidation of their mechanism of action and the demonstration of the in vivo efficacy of the proposed strategy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pj11j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qh36s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r518r"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of elF2alpha kinases in the resistance to VSV infection and regulation of the stability of the tumor suppressor protein p53</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Baltzis, Dionissios</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>PKR has been shown to play an essential role against VSV infection by phosphorylating eIF2alpha leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis. Through this capacity PKR is thought to be a mediator of the anti-viral and anti-proliferative actions of IFNs. In addition to translational control, PKR has been shown to modulate the transcriptional activities of NF-kappaB, Stats and p53. However, experiments with two different PKR-/- mouse models have failed to verify many of the biological functions attributed to PKR. Here, we show that the two PKR-/- MEFs express different PKR truncated proteins suggesting that both PKR-/- models are incomplete knockouts. The expression of the PKR variants may account for the significant signaling differences between cells from the two PKR-/- mice. We also demonstrate that another eIF2alpha kinase, PERK contributes to cellular resistance towards VSV infection. We demonstrate that PERK -/- MEFs are more susceptible to VSV-mediated apoptosis than PERK +/+ MEFs. The higher replication capacity of VSV in PERK-/- MEFs results from their inability to attenuate viral protein synthesis due to an impaired eIF2alpha phosphorylation. We also show that VSV-infected PERK-/- MEFs are unable to fully activate PKR suggesting a cross-talk between the two eIF2alpha kinases in virus infected cells. These findings further implicate PERK in virus infection, and provide evidence that the anti-viral and anti-apoptosic roles of PERK are mediated, at least in part, via the activation of PKR. Despite the translational control function of eIF2alpha kinases, we demonstrate their implications in p53 inactivation. Specifically, we show that PERK activation is responsible for the proteasomal degradation of p53 in a manner that is independent of translational control. This role is not specific for PERK, since the PKR also promotes p53 degradation in response to dsRNA transfection. We established that activation of eIF2alpha kinases leads to the activation of GSK3beta thus promoting the Mdm2-dependent degradation of p53. That is, induction of eIF2alpha kinases leads to the nuclear localization of GSK3beta, and the nuclear export and proteasomal degradation of p53. Our findings establish a novel cross-talk between the eIF2alpha kinases and p53 with significant implications in stress responses that control cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010v158.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r518r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
