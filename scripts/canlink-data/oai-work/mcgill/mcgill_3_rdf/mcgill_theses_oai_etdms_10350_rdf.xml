Of the substrates tested, normetanephrine, metanephrine, 3-0-methyldopamine, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenethanol, harmalol and harmol are glucuronidated. The conjugative reaction with the last two compounds forms the basis of a simple spectrophotofluorometric method for the measurement of transglucuronidating activity as weIl as of endogenous UDPGA in various tissues. Incorporation of the oxidative step, catalyzed by UDPG dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD allows the measurement of UDPG also. In addition, some hormonal effects on the hepatic concentration of UDPGA in the rat have been investigated: starvation and alloxan decrease the hepatic UDPGA while glucose, hydrocortisone and epinephrine have the opposite effect.

The series consists of first, a basal conglomerate composed of angular fragments, second, a succession of "red" siltstone, sandstone, and arkose, all of which contain pebbles and conglomerate bands and, third, coarse loosely consolidated conglomerates composed of well-rounded fragments. Because of its similarity to the Athabaska Sandstone of Keweenawan Age, south of Lake Athabaska, the series is called the Athabaska Series. Interbedded with sandstone in a zone about halfway up the series are several bodies of highly amygdaloidal basic lava flows. Cutting the structure are narrow basic dykes. The Athabaska Series is believed to have been deposited rapidly under shallow water conditions in a semi-arid temperate climate.

Techniques of calculation have evolved which produce answers which are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. However, the logical consistency of the procedures is open to question. Debate has continued for some years on the consistency of the formalism, and almost any shade of opinion may be found somewhere in the literature.

With both techniques, nearly all cells investigated were outlined by a thin band of stained material. In epithelia, the stained layer was usually interrupted where two adjacent plasma membranes fused to form tight junctions. This finding indicated that the layer was not part of the plasma membrane itself but rather a "cell coat" located on its outer surface.

The earliest records of surgical operations in prehistoric periods are found in the bones of the mummified remains. From these it has been found that one of the oldest operations attempted by man, 10,000 years ago, was that of trephine openings in the skull. That some survived this operation is shown by the evidence of repair of bone in the margin of the trephined openings. The earliest records of surgical practice are discovered in the ruins of the temples and monuments.

If administered in excess amounts, it modifies carbohydrate and fat metabolism and the activities of some enzymes. A dietary deficiency of this essential amino acid results in attenuated growth, and alterations in the metabolism of certain substances. Within the protein molecule, tryptophan is believed to play a role as an intermediate in some enzymic reactions.

The careful observations of more recent workers have corrected this misconception. It is now known that a transplant from one non-inbred individual to another of the same species (an allograft), or to one of a different species (a xenograft), enjoys only a brief period of survival.
