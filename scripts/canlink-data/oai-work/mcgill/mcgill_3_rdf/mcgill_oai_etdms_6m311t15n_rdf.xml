W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is everyone's experience, whether engaged in the ordinary business of daily life or in more abstruse intellectual pursuits, that resounding principles are often closely associated with very sordid practice. One might say that there seems to be an inverse relation between the two, that the louder the protestations of the one, the more infamous is the other. And yet, surprisingly, this relation is not mutually exclusive; in fact, evil practice sanctioned by sententious morality is a fairly common theme both in medieval and in renaissance literature.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Munroe, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930c197q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311t15n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
