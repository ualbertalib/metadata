Some of the relationships have been discussed in the reviews published by Lapage, (1937), von Brand, (1952), Hunter, (1953) and Smith, (1955). In the association as seen and described by field workers, there is likely to be some confusion of cause and effect because, in the human field, areas where parasitism is most serious - in the backward tropical and sub-tropical countries where overcrowding, lack of sanitation, poverty and illiteracy are the rule, both under-nutrition and malnutrition are almost universal.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cameron, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zx98f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010t67t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Parasitology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abr86b713r"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cross sections studies in carbon, oxygen, and fluorine</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Whitehead, Andrew.

F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Amongst the chief causes bringing about the economic illnesses that have repeatedly plagued the Island of Newfoundland the widespread dispersal of population has always been recognized as being predominant. The history of the Island shows that for centuries, political, economic and cultural factors have combined to perpetuate this situation. In the earliest stages of development after the discovery of the Island, settlement was discouraged and in fact at times forbidden by laws which were initiated at the instigation of certain West Country merchants in England, who sought monopolistic rights to these prolific fishing grounds.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hare, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816r23t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jv81n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494d03s"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A biological study of the white pine weevil, Pissodes strobe peck, with special reference to the effect of physical factors on its activity and behaviour</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sullivan, Calvin. R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The white pine weevil, Pissodes strobi Peck has been the object of numerous investigations since the early nineteenth century, from which an extensive literature has developed. Despite these efforts, the weevil continues to be a serious pest and one of the most important factors limiting successful reforestation with white pine, Pinus strobus L. It has, therefore, become increasingly apparent that detailed studies of the physical and biological requirements of the weevil are necessary before further efforts can be made to protect white pine stands, both natural and planted, from attack by this insect.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DuPorte, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xz75r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494d03s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Entomology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w836t"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sodium and potassium concentrations in tissues of rabbits in relation to arterial blood pressures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stuart, James.

In spite of much study of possible disturbances of electrolyte metabolism, relatively little work has been done on the electrolyte composition of tissues in hypertension, and it was therefore considered desirable to investigate the relationship of blood pressure to tissue electrolyte levels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Waugh, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75rc66j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w836t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A47429f14w"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ethnic parties, material politics and the ethnic poor : the Bahujan Samaj Party in North India</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guha, Sohini</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>De nombreuses etudes se penchent sur les facteurs expliquant l’appui citoyen aux parris ethniques ainsi que les consequences d’un tel appui en ce qui a trait a la democratie.

This dissertation addresses these questions through a study of the Bahujan Samaj Party (B.S.P.) in India's largest state, Uttar Pradesh (U.P.). The BSP is India's only successful lower caste party, and gained greatest support over the last two decades in U.P., which it now rules. The dissertation argues that material benefits, delivered on a programmatic basis, account for the success of the B.S.P., and perhaps other ethnic parties too, among poorer groups.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Subramanian, Narendra</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418r96j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429f14w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ethnic relations -- Political aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>India -- Politics and government</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bahujan Samaj Party</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053k94v"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The relation between thyroid function and human temperament</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stern, Muriel. H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In recent years there has been a growing interest among endocrinologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists in the relation between endocrine disorders and human behavior. Clinical observations by endocrinologists have shown that both endocrine deficits and excesses may be associated with changes in "personality." Cushing's syndrome in adults is frequently associated with characteristic depressive states, and in Addison's disease apathy and lack of initiative are apparent. Other syndromes such as hypopanpituitarism, male and female climacteric, and thyroid imbalance are also characterized by personality changes. With appropriate endocrine therapy, these behavioral symptoms usually lessen or disappear.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bindra, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/028710755.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053k94v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290f26z"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Syntheses and Reactions of the Piperidine Spiranes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stachiw, Dennis Leon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The first objective of this work was to synthesize certain substituted cyclohexanespiropiperidines (3-azaspiro(5.5)hendecanes).
