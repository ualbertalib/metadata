They involve the exchange system (Protocols A/B) &amp; carbohydrate counting (Protocol C) dietary strategies. The goal of this cross-over study was to determine differences among the approaches in terms of metabolic control (primarily glycated hemoglobin-GHb) and psycho-social adaptation (quality of life (QofL), self-efficacy (SE), stress &amp; perceived complexity) in 15 adults with insulin-dependent diabetes. There were no significant differences in terms of metabolic control, self-efficacy and quality of life. Perceived complexity increased (p $&lt;$ 0.0001) as subjects progressed from protocols A to C (least to most flexible). However, the subjects continued with Protocol B (n = 12) or Protocol C (n = 3) at the end of the study. Subjects who were very accurate in their self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) reporting were also accurate in counting carbohydrate (p $&lt;$ 0.001), more confident (SE) in their ability to adjust their insulin (p $&lt;$ 0.05) and more satisfied (QofL) with their diabetes (p $&lt;$ 0.01). This study indicated that patients who are not ready to undertake carbohydrate counting need not be excluded from intensive management programs. Accuracy in SMBG reporting can be used to direct educational efforts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yale, Jean-Francois</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k4714.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vm98x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Diabetes -- Treatment</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hm238"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A neural network-based system for tracking sea-ice floes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>James, Zachary D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Climate modelling and high-latitude marine navigation require improved information on sea-ice floe extents and dynamics. New satellite sensors provide raw data of this nature but the volume of information makes human analysis impractical. To address this problem, a software system for automatic tracking of sea-ice floes in satellite imagery has been designed and evaluated. Using a recurrent neural network model, experiments were conducted to discover suitable design parameters. Simulated imagery time-sequences of increasing complexity were produced to train successive models. The networks produced were evaluated based on performance and reliability. A small-scale working system, able to map multiple input features in image sequences to Cartesian coordinates, was produced. Results show that a recurrent neural network is suitable for the tracking task and has advantages in robustness and speed over other approaches.

However, other studies have shown that p53-independent apoptotic pathways also exist. This requirement for p53 is attributed to the different cell lines and inducers of apoptosis employed in those studies. The present study uses primary diploid mouse fibroblasts to examine the influence of p53 on apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The MTT viability assay showed that cells without p53 are more resistant to cell death than those with wild type p53. Although lactate dehydrogenase assay indicated the presence of necrosis, DNA fragmentation and propidium iodide staining of the nuclei in each p53 cell line revealed that the majority of the cell death is through apoptosis. The MTT viability assay also revealed that there is a portion of cells that die via a p53-independent pathway, producing a biphasic response to serum withdrawal.

The kaolinite mineral is present in many Quebec soils and is a primary constituent of tropical soils. Since kaolinite is also a well defined mineral, experiments were performed to examine the effect kaolinite might play on the degradation of naphthalene, 2-methyl naphthalene, and 2-naphthol in the presence and absence of cadmium. Furthermore, the results from these analyses were used to interpret the behaviour in the mineralization experiments of each PAH, using the Gram-negative species Pseudomonas putida (ATCC #17484). The results of this study indicate that the presence of cadmium did not significantly alter the mineralization capacity of P. putida for naphthalene, 2-methyl naphthalene, and 2-naphthol. The presence of kaolinite however, did affect microbial activity by significantly reducing the rates of PAH mineralization. These results illustrate the need to identify the general mechanisms of interactions to develop effective bioremediation programs for contaminated sites.

The Almon lag structure of the foreign aid (Official Development Assistance) variable was specified to account for the effect of foreign aid over time. The results support the hypothesis that the aggregate effect of aid on agricultural production in SSA is positive. The marginal effect of foreign aid in SSA is calculated to be $0.14 which can be interpreted to mean that a one dollar increase in aid in each of the past six years would be expected to increase the value of agricultural output by 14 cents in the current year. There is a great variation in the effect of foreign aid on agricultural production when countries are classified according to agro-climatic region, income level and policy environment. Excluding Eastern and Southern Africa where the effect of aid is negative, the marginal effect of foreign aid ranges from $0.40 in Sudano-Sahel to $1.32 in Central Africa. The marginal effect of foreign aid is larger in middle income countries as compared to high income countries; it is negative in low income countries. The effect of aid is positive and significant in countries classified under a favourable policy environment but negative and insignificant in countries classified under an unfavourable policy environment. The structural adjustment dummy variable is positive and significant in most regressions indicating that structural adjustment programs have been beneficial to agriculture in most Sub-Saharan African countries.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gunjal, Kisan</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m879z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vq49b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural assistance -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agriculture -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economic assistance -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agricultural productivity -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m388q"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characteristics of isolated and synthetic a-amylase inhibitors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gibbs, Bernard F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Effective inhibition of starch digestion in vivo may diminish glucose formation and absorption by the small intestine and increase the amount of undigested starch reaching the colon.

The objective of this project is (a) to isolate and characterize alpha-amylase inhibitors from Phaseolus species (b) to synthesize and characterize known inhibitors in an effort to understand their mechanism of action. The supernatant from ground beans was subjected to reverse phase chromatography. The separated peaks were lyophilized and assayed for alpha-amylase inhibitory activity. The inhibitor with the highest activity (peak 6) was repurified and fully characterized. It was exposed to physiological amounts of endoproteases to check its stability. A known inhibitor of alpha-amylase was synthesized and studied. Its binding constant has not been previously reported.

Enucleation resulted in elevated proliferation values as compared to animals with an optic nerve crush, at least one early timepoint in each part of the visual system, but overall, there is little to suggest that axons are exerting a major effect on the cellular response. Finally, a seasonal effect on the proliferative response of non-neuronal cells and axonal regrowth has been demonstrated. Fish acclimatized under autumn-like conditions showed a faster initiation of the non-neuronal cell response and an enhanced rate of axonal regrowth when compared to fish acclimatized under spring-like conditions. It is believed that photoperiod plays a major role in the seasonal effects observed with temperature playing only a minor one.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levine, R.

(James Mac)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ferromagnetic/ferromagnetic Ni/Co multilayers with component layer thicknesses ranging from 40 A down to 5 A were prepared by DC-magnetron sputtering. Due to the fact that Ni and Co alloys share a common d band, it is expected that the total resistance of the multilayers, including the elemental resistance of the layers and the resistance of the interdiffused alloyed region at the interfaces, will be lower than for other 3d transition metal combinations. Consequently, the magnetoresistance ratio $ Delta rho/ rho$ is expected to be enhanced. Structural characterization by grazing-angle X-ray reflectivity reveals high-quality layered structures with a well-defined composition modulation along the film growth direction. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction scans display the polycrystalline nature of the Ni/Co multilayers which grow in an FCC phase with a preferred (111) orientation and a fraction of (200) structural domains. Measurements of the magnetotransport properties of these multilayers indicate that the magnetoresistance (MR) effect, $ Delta rho sim0.35 mu Omega cdot$cm, is roughly constant over the entire compositional range. The MR ratio $ Delta rho/ rho,$ which is as high as 3.0% in a Si/(Ni40A/Co5A) $ times$ 6 multilayer, is therefore more strongly dependent on the zero-field resistivity $ rho.$ By fitting a semi-classical model to the resistivity compositional variation, we determined the interface contribution to the resistivity. The MR measurements as well as the magnetic anisotropy of the films, studied by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) magnetometry, are consistent with the origin of the observed MR effect being anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). The highest magnetic sensitivity measured at zero-field and constant in the range from ${ sim}{-}10$ Oe to +10 Oe was 0.1%/Oe. This value compares well with other alloys being developed as magnetic sensors.

We study the monads defined by the power locales, their algebras and the points of the power locales.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bunge, Marta</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qk831.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21th492</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g7055"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evidence of speed gradient sensitive neurons in the monkey extrastriate area MSTd</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Entekhabi, Fatemeh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Optic flow is the changing array of light that is reflected from objects in the environment and is projected on the retinae during motion. Speed gradients are a natural component or optic flow and they are the result of the relative ordering of objects in depth. It has been proposed that speed gradient information may signal the direction and speed of self-motion as well as the three-dimensional structure of the environment. The dorsal region of the medial superior temporal area of the visual cortex, or MSTd, is believed to be the neuronal basis for the analysis of optic flow and therefore it could convey information about the direction and speed of self-motion and the three-dimensional structure of the environment. In our study, cells in MSTd were tested with random dot stimuli moving at different speeds (speed gradients). We found that cells in MSTd are sensitive to stimuli containing speed gradients. This supports a role for MSTd in determining the speed of self motion or the three-dimensional structure of the environment or both.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roy, J.

Forty-one healthy, primiparous mothers who participated in a MCCP and forty-three healthy, primiparous mothers who received traditional maternity care were asked to complete the Perceived Competence Questionnaire, the Personal Resource Questionnaire, "The Help I Get" Questionnaire (spousal support), and three numerical rating scales relating to stress in general, as well as self- and infant-care stress 24-48 hours postpartum while in hospital and over the telephone at two weeks postpartum. Ten randomly selected mothers from each group also answered twelve open-ended questions during a home visit at 2-3 weeks postpartum. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for any of the outcome variables assessed. For both groups, competence with self- and infant-care increased over the two weeks postpartum, while support and stress remained stable. Interviews with the mothers revealed that the number of stressors increased once at home, while support continued to be of value in relieving stress and helping maternal adjustment and confidence. Results of a qualitative comparison between the groups suggests that the MCCP mothers felt more prepared to be discharged home, and identified their partner more often as an active participant during hospitalization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hanrahan, Caroline</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hb84g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w9435</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mh54z"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Seasonal structure of the Gulf of St. Lawrence upper-layer thermohaline fields during the ice-free months</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Doyon, Patrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans play a critical role in determining our climate. These generally consist of various exchanges of heat, mass and momentum between the two media through the air-sea interface. Therefore, the physical state of the upper few meters of the oceans influences the rate at which these exchanges take place. Furthermore, these surface waters are of importance in affecting the primary biological production of the seas. In this context, knowledge of the upper-layer monthly averaged thermohaline state, i.e. temperature (T) and salinity (S) as a function of latitude-longitude and depth, is necessary for further climatological/oceanographic studies in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL). The primary goal of this research is to produce, using basic statistical analyses, monthly mean fields of T and S related quantities at various depths throughout the GSL. The historical hydrographic dataset covers the last 75 years. Objective fields of sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) were also computed and compared with other similar climatologies (when available).

Karst) were studied at the Morgan Arboretum, near Montreal, in southern Quebec, Canada (45$ sp circ$ 25$ sp prime$ N, 73$ sp circ$ 57$ sp prime$ W; 15.2 m above sea level). The relationships between climatic variables and basal area growth were examined using linear and quadratic models. Current and previous year's climatic variables were tested separately and in combination using multiple regression models. The best models explained 82% and 85% of the total variance of the growth of Norway spruce and red pine, respectively. The growth of both species was more associated with evapotranspiration than precipitation. The growth of Norway spruce was best explained by the current year's annual evapotranspiration (43%), while the growth of red pine was more related to previous year's August evapotranspiration (33%) at our site. The JABOWA model was used to predict tree growth in hypothetical climates which could result from global climate changes. Based on literature, five treatments were applied: normal, and increases of 1, 3, 5, and 10$ sp circ$C. Comparison between the last (1983-1992) and next (1993-2002) ten years growth showed no significant differences between species when temperature was normal or increased by 1 and 3$ sp circ$C, but significant differences between species were observed when the temperature was increased by 5$ sp circ$C. Both species declined when the temperature was increased by 10$ sp circ$C. We concluded that Norway spruce is more sensitive to increases in atmospheric temperatures than red pine at our site.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cote, Benoit</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pc51s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881p054</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Trees -- Climatic factors -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trees -- Growth -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Norway spruce -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trees -- Effect of temperature on -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trees -- Effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide on -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Red pine -- Growth</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f333g"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Organic matter mineralization in lake sediments : a within and among lake study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Den Heyer, Cornelia E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Organic matter mineralization by sediment bacteria was measured by the accumulation of DIC + CH$ sb4$ in the water overlying intact cores taken from littoral and profundal sediments of 9 lakes. The variability in areal carbon mineralization was much greater within lakes than among lakes, with the rate of organic matter mineralization in littoral sediments, on average, 3-fold higher than in the deeper sediments. Sixty percent of the variation in summer carbon mineralization rates is explained by site depth, a surrogate variable which incorporates the effect of temperature and may also be reflecting organic matter quality and/or supply. Lake-specific variables become useful predictors of carbon mineralization only after the site depth is considered. A comparison of the mineralization in sediments overlain by epilimnetic water to the whole lake sediment mineralization demonstrates the overwhelming importance of the littoral sediments in organic matter mineralization, with more than half (54-100%) of the mineralization in the sediments occurring in the littoral zone. However, the littoral sediments account for less than 20% of the gross respiration in the epilimnion.

Conditions Affecting Records (CAR) codes, collected monthly by QDHAS's supervisors, are possible explanation for a reduced production in the day of test. For the purpose of this study, CAR codes were used to analyze the incidence of health problems under generalized linear models methodology. Poisson and logistic regression model analyses were able to model the number of cases of abnormal test-days and health problems per lactation. Herd, testing program, parity number, and stage of lactation were important systematic effects included in the analysis. However, calving year, season of calving, and herd production level were not statistically significant in most analysis. Sires significantly differed in the incidence of some health problems of their daughters. Low heritability values, between 0.02 and 0.05, were found showing that most variability was explained by non-genetic factors. Regardless of the low heritability, the genetic variability has been shown to be considerable, suggesting that a significant genetic improvement of the disease resistance is achievable if proper procedures are adopted.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Monardes, H.

Strong growth is frequent in coastal regions near Japan and in the East China Sea. In contrast to the conventional deepening rate intensification parameter, frequency distributions of maximum 24-h growth are found to be more Gaussian in character. To investigate possible physical processes acting to enhance growth, composite sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are computed for groups of cyclones which deepen maximally in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Currents. Comparison between groups of similar deepening revels stronger growth is generally associated with warm SST anomalies and with weaker upper-level support for intensification. Composite latent and sensible heat flux fields computed from observations support this finding.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gyazum, John R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bw578.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440v72m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fq86r"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An implementation of the ICRP66 respiratory tract model in internal dosimetry</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Corns, Robert Allan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This treatise examines the ICRP's new respiratory tract model and its implementation into G scENMOD, a program that facilitates internal dosimetric calculation for the body.
