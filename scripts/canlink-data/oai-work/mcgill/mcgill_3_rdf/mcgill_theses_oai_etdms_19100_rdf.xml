The conductivities along and perpendicular to the layers of carbon atoms in the graphite crystal are recalculated using a more refined value for a certain exchange integral. It is found that the ratio of these two quantities is of the order of 104, in agreement with experiment. The change of the conductivity parallel to the layers due to the presence of a magnetic field is also computed. The agreement with experiment can be considered as satisfactory considering the approximations made in the process of calculation: the calculated values show a more rapid variation with temperature than the experimental ones. Finally a theoretical computation of the Hall coefficient is attempted.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c652v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816r56c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580r598"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Wall-rock alteration of the bridge river gold vein deposits</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Godard, J.

Horkheimer and Adorno' s theories of the "dialectic of enlightenment" and  “negative dialectics" provide a self-critical social analysis that interconnects the domination of humanity by humanity and the domination of nature in a way that strengthens the critique of Christian ethics. Further, Horkheimer and Adorno's "longing for the wholly other" resonates profoundly with Christians who believe in a God of Justice.  By the same token, Christian reflection on critical Theory leads to a critique ofHorkheimer and Adorno's excessive distance from political practice and their narrow understanding of radical praxis. In this “new dialogue" the project of Christian ethics develops a more substantial critique of domination, while the Critical Theory of Horkheimer and Adorno is critiqued and renewed.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Cette thèse examine les différentes manieres avec lesquelles la Théorie Critique et l'éthique de la théologie de la libération chrétienne s'entrecroisent et s'informent mutuellement.

De plus, le concept du "désir pour le tout Autre" qui ont Horkeimer et Adorno résonne profondément chez les chrétiens qui fondent leurs foi dans un Dieu de Justice.

It had been accepted practice to concentrate on the diseased organ which was treated as an entity existing independently of the patient. Gradually, however, came the recognition that the emotional and social together with the physical features of illness enter into the disease process and should be considered together in order to restore the individual to full health.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kowell, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692tb337.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92gc265</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zg034"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Res Ipsa Loquitur</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fenston, John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An article by captain J.A.

When conditions are such that the atmosphere can no longer hold all the water it contains as water vapour, clouds appear first, and precipitation may or may not fall out of these clouds. Clouds can remain relatively unchanged for several hours, they may then evaporate without precipitating at all, or precipitation, in small or large quantities, may form after a shorter or longer time.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cf81x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999b72p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jg25d"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Separation of the direct effects of thyroxine from those mediated through other endocrine glands</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Eartly, Heidi.
