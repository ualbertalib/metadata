We present a phase-coherent timing ephemeris for 4U 0142+61, and show that it has rotated with high stability over 4.4 yr, with RMS phase deviation of 7% of the pulse period from a simple fit including only n and n&amp;d2; . We show that 1E 1048.1-5937 shows significant deviations from simple spin-down such that phase-coherent timing has not been possible over time spans longer than a few months. We find that the deviations from simple spin down are not consistent with single "glitch" type events, nor are they consistent with radiative precession. We suggest that 1E 1048.1-5937 may be a transition object between the soft gamma-ray repeater and AXP populations, and the AXP most likely to one day undergo an outburst. We also report on the continued timing stability of 1E 2259.1+586, for which phase coherence has now been maintained over 4.5 yr, as well as on the detection of a significant n&amp;d3; in RXS J170849.0-400910, consistent with recovery following a glitch. We note a possible correlation in which timing stability decreases with increasing n&amp;d2; . We find no large variability in pulse morphology as a function of time. We present high signal-to-noise ratio average pulse profiles for each AXP, and consider them as a function of energy. We find a variety of different behaviors, and consider possible trends in the data. We also find no large variations in pulsed flux, and set la upper limits of ~20--30% of the mean.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kaspi, Victoria M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311r14z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sm22d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57ns68f"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the mechanism of function of retinoblastoma binding protein-1 (RBP1)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guay, Patrick-Jean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Proteins from the pRb family have all been demonstrated to actively repress transcription of E2F target genes. Previous studies have shown that they recruit both HDAC-dependent and -independent repression functions. RBP1 has been found to participate in the recruitment of HDAC to pRb through interaction via its R2 domain with the Sin3 HDAC complex. RBP1 also bring HDAC-independent repression to pRb via its R1 domain. However, the repression mechanism of R1 remains elusive. Preliminary studies suggested that HAT activity might be associated with the ARID domain portion of R1. The present study demonstrates that there is no HAT activity associated with RBP1. Attempts were made to isolate proteins binding to RBP1 by their ability to associate with different RBP1 domains fused to GST or by their association with RBP1 in co-immunoprecipitations using the LY11 antibody. Analysis of interacting proteins in both systems was complicated by the presence of many non-specific interactors that may prevent identification of specific binding proteins by peptide mapping or protein sequencing. An inducible stable cell line expressing C-terminally HA-tagged RBP1 was established to allow both analysis of proteins binding to RBP1 and the effects of RBP1 overexpression on the cell cycle. Finally, gel filtration studies demonstrated that all of RBP1 co-fractionates with SAP30, but not with hypophosphorylated pRb, and suggests that there is no stable complex formed at the R1 domain of RBP1.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Branton, Philip E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569621p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57ns68f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r074x014"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Functional characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Zeo1p, a Mid2p interacting protein</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Green, Robin G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have previously demonstrated that Mid2p is required for the activation of the PKC1-MPK1 cell integrity pathway during cell exposure to mating pheromone, calcofluor white (CFW), and heat. Accumulating evidence indicates that Mid2p might regulate this pathway via the small GTPase, Rho1p. To understand the mechanism by which Mid2p signals, we initiated a two hybrid screen using the essential cytoplasmic tail of Mid2p as bait. ZEO1 (YOL109w), a previously uncharacterized open reading frame, was identified. ZEO1 encodes a 12kDa protein that co-localizes to the plasma membrane and interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of Mtl1p, a Mid2p functional homologue. Like mid2Delta mutants, cells deleted for ZEO1 are resistant to calcofluor white. In addition, ZEO1 null strains are no longer hypersensitive to calcofluor white caused by high copy expression of MID2. A role for Zeo1p in the cell integrity pathway is supported by the finding that disruption of ZEO1 leads to a Mid2p-dependent constitutive phosphorylation of Mpk1p.

I found that the food environment did not affect the fecundity ratio between the two wing morphs. Consequently, while long wing (LW) females partially histolyse their dorso-longitudinal wing muscles (DLM) it is not enough to compensate for the low food treatment. Genetic parameters were estimated using a half-sib analysis on the LW females. The genetic correlation between the two traits was not different from -1 in both environments. According to the mixed-model ANOVA, the genetic correlation across environments for both traits did not differ from +1. Therefore, the heritability estimates of the pooled ovary weight and the pooled DLM weight were calculated and were significant.

One of the primary roles of UQ is its involvement in respiratory metabolism, where it functions in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotic cells as a transporter of electrons and protons in complexes II and III. The biosynthesis of UQ involves two separate O-methylation steps. Coq3p which is 40% identical to the Escherichia coli O-methyltransferase, UbiG, catalyzes both O-methylation steps. In order to elucidate the function of genes involved in UQ biosynthesis, a coq-3 null mutant in the nematode C. elegans has been isolated by mean of reverse genetics. About 3,000,000 haploid genomes have been screened and a deletion in this gene isolated. Many technical difficulties have been encountered and modification concerning the details of the screening protocol was required to bypass them. The loss of coq-3 function in nematodes leads to developmental arrest and sterility, even when the worms are fed with bacteria that produce UQ. This demonstrates that UQ is required for the development and fertility of the worms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hekimi, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193b69w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059c931f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ubiquinones</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q589v"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Impact of irrigated rice culture on the production of Anopheles mosquitos (Diptera:Culicidae) in the Niono region, Mali</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fortier, Sophie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The study assessed the impact of rice paddy water management practices and related environmental conditions that prevail in Niono, Mali, on the size of larval populations of Anopheles gambiae s.l., a major malaria vector. The longer the period of uninterrupted flooding, the greater was the larval population size. As the density of aquatic weeds increased, the size of the mosquito larval population declined, whereas the presence of rice plants enhanced the size of mosquito larval populations. Numbers of mosquito larvae initially increased as rice plant density rose, but then decreased marginally as densities reached their peak. These results confirm that water management plays a major role in the production of mosquito larvae. Nevertheless, comparison with studies conducted in other areas suggest that the impact of water management on mosquitoes varies regionally. In the Niono region, controlled irrigation and drainage should favour the reduction of Anopheles mosquito larval populations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lewis, D.

A homology model of HE revealed that the mutation was far away from the enzyme active site and may contribute to increased enzyme flexibility.

The form of K(q) shows that the statistics of topography are close to those predicted by universal multifractals.

Salmonellosis is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in humans and is frequently caused by the ingestion of Salmonella-contaminated poultry products. Identification of QTL responsible for Salmonella-susceptibility may lead to more efficient control strategies, and selection against genes that may lead to increased risk of transmission. The genome scan was performed on a selection of 425 backcross progeny, (W1 x C) F1 x C, derived from C Salmonella-susceptible and W1 Salmonella-resistant chickens. The 425 backcross birds were phenotyped for their susceptibility to infection with Salmonella Typhimurium. A collection of 160 fluorolabelled microsatellite markers (FAM, TET, and HEX) was used to scan the chicken genome, which is 3800cM in size (1.2 x 109 bp) and consists of 39 linkage groups, 9 chromosomes and 30 microchromosomes. We first tested the available microsatellite markers for informativeness in C and W1 chicken lines. In addition, we also determined the allele lengths and PCR product intensity (qualitatively) to facilitate pooling of markers during electrophoresis. PCR reaction mixtures were prepared using a Packard MultiProbe II Robotic System and Minitrak to pipette DNA-PCR Master mix and primer mix into microtiter plates. PCR products were then pooled and analyzed on Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzers. Analysis of informative microsatellite markers on the backcross panel resulted in the detection of two loci, one on Chromosome 7 carrying NRAMP1, and the other on microchromosome E41W17 carrying TLR4, linked to resistance to Salmonella infection in chickens.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Malo, Danielle</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634561s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kc43b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55z954v"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Surrogate decision-making : speaking on behalf of another</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Evans, Jane, 1954-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The adult, competent patient has the ability to be involved in decisions regarding care and treatment.

This thesis examines the many facets and factors that define the complex role of surrogacy. The role is described by reviewing literature on the current legal standards of decision-making, by analysing the data describing patient-surrogate preferences and the relevancy of such factors as culture and religion as facilitators or inhibitors in the decision-making process.

Since the 1980's the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in Montreal has remained at 11 cases per 100,000. In order to improve TB prevention and control programs, we sought to identify predictors of tuberculosis drug-resistance and to describe the epidemiology of TB drug resistance on the island of Montreal. Study design. Retrospective descriptive analysis Study population. All culture proven TB patients reported to the Montreal Regional Health Board aged 0--49 for 1992--1994 and 0--18 years for 1995. Results. Drug resistant TB was found in 18.3% of culture-proven TB cases. The rate of INH resistance in our study cohort was 10.6%. Two percent of TB cases were found to have MDR-TB. Only 3 TB cases (0.9%) in our study cohort developed acquired drug resistance over the study period. Previous history of TB was associated with a 3.9 times greater risk of drug resistant TB. Conclusions. Drug resistance is a significant problem in Montreal that continues to hinder TB treatment and control. Previous history of tuberculosis is a strong predictor of drug resistance. In addition, immigration from individual countries was not associated with an increase in the rate of drug resistance. Nonetheless, country-specific drug resistance rates may serve to predict the likelihood of drug resistant TB among the foreign-born in Canada.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brassard, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h132x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21th22n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612q417"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An appearance-based method for the segmentation of medial temporal lobe structures from MR images</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Duchesne, Simon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A new paradigm for the characterization of structure appearance is proposed, based on a combination of grey-level intensity data and a shape descriptor derived from a priori Principal Components Analysis of 3D deformation vector fields.

Sympathetic neurons express five of the 12 known neuronal nAChRs genes: alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, alpha2 and alpha4 and therefore several potential receptor subtypes could exist. The purpose of my study is to investigate the function of alpha3. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that alpha3 is essential for the receptor ACh sensitivity. For that purpose, I use sympathetic neurons from alpha3 knock-out mice together with gene transfer technique with an adenovirus to express alpha3 genes in cultured sympathetic neurons from alpha3 null animals. In order to investigate the behavior of some mutated alpha3 constructs previously tested in Xenopus oocytes, I have built three new adenoviruses. In the first two the alpha3 ACh binding site has been modified to increase the affinity of the muscle blocker alpha-bungarotoxin for the receptor. In the third adenovirus, alpha3 bears a single amino acid mutation that modifies the calcium permeability of the channel.

S. (Mary Sandra)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Context. Exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) that result in acute respiratory failure are a significant health care problem with high morbidity and mortality. Recent reports have shown that preventing intubation with the use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation significantly decreases the morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory failure in this population. Objective. To evaluate whether patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure treated with non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) have improved clinical outcomes after adjusting for potentially confounding covariates when compared to similar patients who were intubated or treated with medical therapy. Design and setting. Comparison of three retrospective cohorts, one in which CPAP was routinely available and two in which CPAP were not available for the management of this type of patient. Data were collected on all patients admitted to two ICU's in tertiary care teaching hospitals during the time periods defined by the cohorts. Population. Two hundred and thirty-eight patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and acute respiratory failure admitted to two intensive care units between January 15th 1985 to December 31st 1995.

DMD patients have a mutation in the gene encoding dystrophin, a large membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein on the cytoplasmic side of the sarcolemma. Gene therapy using fully deleted adenoviral vectors shows great potential for the eventual treatment of DMD and other genetic diseases. These vectors are less immunogenic than their predecessors and have the capacity to carry large DNA inserts such as the full-length dystrophin (12 kb). However, the lack of viral genes results in a weakened and subsiding (short) transgene expression in muscle. Findings in the lung and liver have shown the adenoviral E4 region, in particular E4 open reading frame 3 (ORF3) to contribute to the maintenance of transgene expression. We constructed an adenovirus in which E4 ORF3 was reintroduced into a fully-deleted adenovirus along with full-length dystrophin (AdCBDysORF3). Dystrophin levels produced by AdCBDysORF3 were found to be not sustained in mdx mice, dropping significantly by day 90. However, expression levels did increase when AdCBDysORF3 was complemented with other viral proteins such as EIB. Likewise, increasing the expression of the primary adenovirus receptor (CAR) in muscle also resulted in a higher initial dystrophin expression in myofibers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Holland, Paul</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Nalbantoglu, Josephine</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956h678.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mx25b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dystrophin</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adenoviruses</dc:subject><dc:subject>Duchenne muscular dystrophy -- Gene therapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50gx888"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Geomorphic controls on the distribution of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) habitat in two contrasting fifth-order streams in the Gaspe Peninsula, Quebec : the Petite Cascapedia and Bonaventure rivers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Coulombe Pontbriand, Moise</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although the watersheds of the Petite Cascapedia and Bonaventure Rivers, Gaspe Peninsula, have broadly similar geology and land use, their segment-scale river geomorphology is contrasted by subtle differences in valley characteristics that are a legacy of their individual geomorphic histories. These differences have consequences on the distribution of Atlantic salmon habitat such as boulder abundance (for parr rearing and overwintering habitats) and spawning substrate quality. Parr preference for boulder-rich river segments (1--5 km) was observed in the Bonaventure River. In the study systems redd distribution was sensitive to relatively small changes in the fines content of riffle substrate. River segments flowing through moderately narrow semi-alluvial valleys present better overall parr habitat (high boulder abundance) and better spawning substrate quality (percentage of sand) than wider valley sections. These differences are due to additional sources of coarse sediment, higher shear stresses, and lower bank erosion rates in such valleys.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lapointe, Michel</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mx27w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gx888</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Atlantic salmon -- Québec (Province) -- Gaspé Peninsula -- Geographical distribution</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atlantic salmon -- Habitat -- Québec (Province) -- Gaspé Peninsula</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720f63j"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Drowning and near drowning among infants and toddlers in Canada, 1991-1998 : trends, incidence, and risk factors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dandavino, Mylene</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Trends in incidence and risk factors for drowning among infants aged less than 1 and toddlers aged 1 to 4 in Canada from 1991--98 were compared to other injury deaths.

Drowning rates decreased by 79% among infants, from 1.4 per 100,000 person-years during 1991--94 to 0.3 during 1995--98 (0.001 &lt; p &lt; 0.0025 by chi2) and by 38% among toddlers, from 3.2 to 2.0 (p &lt; 0.0005 by chi2). The rate of near drowning hospitalization among children aged 0--4 decreased by 30% from 1991--92 to 1997--98 (0.01 &lt; p &lt; 0.02 by chi2 for trends). Near drowning was the source of 5% of infant and 28% of toddler in-hospital injury deaths in 1994--98. The case-fatality ratio of near drowning hospitalizations was the highest of all injuries with 7% mortality among infants and 12% among toddlers. The decrease in incidence of drowning among infants and toddlers was not paralleled by a similar dramatic decrease in the incidence of other injury deaths in the same period in Canada, nor of near drowning hospitalization, and could be linked to prevention interventions from the Canadian Red Cross Society.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barss, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mx26m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720f63j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r280m"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Comparison of quality change kinetics in ham emulsions cooked under conventional and ohmic heating conditions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chiu, Lawrende, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ohmic heating is an electrical resistance heating resulting from the passage of electrical current through an electrically conductive material offering some resistance. Most food products possess sufficient electrical conductivity to be able to take advantage of ohmic heating. This research was undertaken to evaluate the quality changes associated with fine ham emulsions prepared under ohmic heating conditions as compared to those produced by conventional heating. In the first part of the study, kinetics of quality changes (color, texture, water holding capacity, cooking loss and water activity) associated with fine ham emulsion subjected to conventional heating conditions were evaluated. The second part of the study was to standardize ohmic heating conditions for achieving target time-temperature combinations. It was desired to achieve cooking conditions (temperature come-up and hold times) both similar to and faster than conventional heating so that meaningful quality comparisons could be made between the two. The final part of the study was to compare the quality changes of fine ham emulsion subjected to ohmic heating under different rates, and to compare them with conventional heating.

These tasks examined discourse comprehension and inference generation associated with three types of communicative contexts (disambiguating ambiguous linguistic information, joke appreciation, and pragmatic inferences related to sarcasm). Contrary to expectations, RHD patients' performance was qualitatively different from controls' only for the task requiring pragmatic inferences; for the remaining linguistic inference tasks, RHD subjects were only quantitatively different. The results suggest that the RHD subjects were specifically impaired in their ability to make inferences regarding communicative intention (CI) and are consistent with a model attributing RHD communication impairments to CI comprehension deficits (Sabbagh, 1999).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pell, M.

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured while subjects detected changes in thermal intensity or auditory frequency. Subjects rated pain on a visual analogue scale. Using statistical brain maps of the pain-related activity, directed searches were conducted in contralateral insular (IC), anterior cingulate (ACC), primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices---regions consistently found to be activated by painful stimuli. Pain intensity was rated higher in the thermal than in the auditory task. Likewise, whereas in the thermal task there were significant pain-related rCBF increases in S1 and S2, none of these regions had significant pain-evoked rCBF increases when subjects performed the auditory task. Only rCBF in S1 was significantly correlated with the pain intensity ratings generated during the thermal and auditory tasks. These results suggest that changes in S1 cortical activity may be involved in attentional modulation of pain.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bushnell, M.

Chapter II focuses on the possibility of using marrow stromal cells as a cell source for cellular cardiomyoplasty. This proof-of-principle study was conducted in association with Dr. Jih-Shiuan Wang. The results are convincing that marrow stromal cells can differentiate into myocardial-like cells. For implanted cells to contribute to myocardial function they must be integrated with the host myocardium. Chapter III focuses on this topic. Using satellite cells and stromal cells, morphological and histochemical analyses show that implanted cells do, in fact, incorporate into the host myocardial structure.

First generation homozygous clk-1 mutants descended from a heterozygous mother are fully rescued for these mutant phenotypes. It has been shown that CLK-1 protein is a hydroxylase that acts in the conversion of demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ) to 5-hydroxyubiquinone, in the ubiquinone (Q) biosynthesis pathway. Consequently, clk-1 mutants accumulate the Q9 precursor, DMQ9 (the subscript refers to the length of the isoprenoid side chain). Here, I show that the profound maternal rescue observed in clk-1 maternally rescued animals is due to presence of the CLK-1 protein throughout larval development, in sufficient amounts to catalyze the production of Q9. clk-1 mutants have been shown to have a dietary requirement for Q8 due to their inability to synthesize Q9. I demonstrate that clk-1 maternally rescued animals have sufficient amounts of Q 9 to complete larval development and produce an almost full brood when raised on a Q8 deficient E. coli strain. I also show that prolonged arrest at the first larval stage, which is likely to result in degradation of any maternally contributed mRNA or protein, brings about a Clk mutant phenotype in maternally rescued animals. Finally, I reveal that the Clk mutant phenotype can be rescued at any larval stage by ectopic expression of CLK-1, suggesting that there is no developmental window for the rescue of clk-1 mutants by CLK-1. These results identify perdurance of maternally contributed product throughout development as the mechanism that accounts for the maternal effect observed in clk-1 mutants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hekimi, Siegfried</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r493t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732db74g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ubiquinones</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
