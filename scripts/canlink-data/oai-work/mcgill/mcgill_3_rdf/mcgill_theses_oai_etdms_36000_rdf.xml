ethnographic film to indigenous media : communications and the evolution of the ethnographic subject</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cohen, Hart K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An important connection exists between ethnographic film and indigenous media though they are rarely linked in film theory. The link is not just hypothetical. Cast in the form of historiography, ethnographic film and indigenous media practices may be read as a continuist discourse with a number of critical turns. One such turn is the transformation of the ethnographic subject into a critical public. What is described as indigenous media allows us to categorize this transformation as a significant difference for the practice of ethnography, but the question remains as to whether this difference is retreivable in the terms set by ethnography. The emergence of the indigenous ethnographer has consequences for understanding the problems in the relations between Western and non-Western cultural formations. As a means through which a culture or nation may represent its own historical evolution, indigenous media is also, however, a discourse in formation--characterized by heterogenous claims and practices.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf42c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p29r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Motion pictures in ethnology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Structural anthropology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Communication and culture</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rouch, Jean</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak643b196k"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Abstract relational semantics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Desharnais, Jules</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Abstract relational algebra is used to define the semantics of a simple imperative language. In order to carry out this task, various domains are specified by relational axioms. Some specifications define relations on the basic types of the language (Booleans and natural numbers); their presentation stresses the importance of the concept of point. Other specifications construct the relational domains whose relations are used to denote programs. The programming constructs that are defined include expressions, variable declarations, assignment statements, while-program statements and procedures. A particularity of the semantic definitions is that the relations denoting a program fragment depend only on the fragment, and not on its environment (procedure calls excepted). Finally, it is shown how the semantics of a program fragment can be used to prove its correctness relative to a specification. The result is a uniform abstract relational setting for specification, semantics and program derivation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375x04j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b196k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88ch17q"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Role of cap function during eukaryotic protein synthesis and precursor messenger RNA splicing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Edery, Isaac</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The cap structure, m$ sp7$GpppX (where X = any nucleotide), is present at the 5$ sp prime$ end of all eukaryotic cellular messenger RNAs (except organellar). Previous studies have demonstrated that during protein synthesis the cap structure is recognized by a $ sim$24 kDa cap binding protein (CBP), termed eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E). With the use of a newly developed cap-analogy affinity matrix a high molecular weight complex that contains eIF-4E was purified, termed eIF-4F. In addition to eIF-4E this CBP complex consists of eIF-4A and a 220 kDa polypeptide (p220). Using an RNA unwinding assay direct evidence was obtained indicating that eIF-4F, eIF-4A and eIF-4B functionally interrelate resulting in helicase activity. Secondary structure in the 5$ sp prime$ untranslated region of eukaryotic mRNAs inhibits translation, therefore this unwinding activity is most likely required for efficient 40S ribosomal subunit attachment to mRNA. To fascilitate the purification and biophysical characterization of eIF-4E, the yeast homolog was overexpressed in E. coli. mRNA secondary structure can also inhibit translation in trans by another mechanism. This was shown for the unique structure (TAR) at the 5$ sp prime$ end of all mRNAs from the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). The mechanism of translation inhibition involves the activation of the double-stranded RNA dependent kinase (dsI), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of eIF-2. This is the first demonstration of a specific naturally occurring mRNA sequence that can activate dsI. A novel translational regulatory mechanism is proposed. Finally, the cap structure is also required for efficient precursor mRNA splicing in HeLa nuclear extracts. These and other studies indicate that the cap structure plays a multifunctional role during regulation of gene expression.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720d47z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch17q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zv00n"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Humoral immunity in surgical patients</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nohr, Carl William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Humoral immune function was studied in surgical patients.

The clinical phenotype is pleiotropic (affecting skin, brain, etc.) and of variable expressivity (benign to early death). I established skin fibroblast cultures from 6 homozygous probands and 6 obligate heterozygotes, purified prolidase (E.C. 3.4.13.9, a homodimer) from normal human fibroblasts, raised a monospecific rabbit antiserum to the subunit, and studied its biosynthesis. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the subunit is synthesized in the cytosol as a 58 KDa. polypeptide and not processed further. Homozygous prolidase-deficient cell strains expressed 3 classes of mutant alleles which by complementation analysis mapped to one locus. The alleles were designated CRM$-$ (nul), CRM+ activity/size variant, and CRM+ activity variant. Heterozygotes carrying CRM$-$ alleles have heat stable prolidase (50$ sp circ$C, 1hr); heterozygotes carrying CRM+ variant alleles have heat labile enzyme. The finding implies that variant CRM+ allele(s) can confer negative allelic complementation on the dimeric enzyme (dominant relative phenotype). CRM$-$ homozygous cells contain varying amounts of an alternative imidodipeptidase-like activity. The variant prolidase allele (major gene) and amount of alternative "prolidase" activity (modifier gene) are apparently both determinants of the associated clinical phenotype in prolidase deficiency. I obtained and sequenced a tryptic peptide from human kidney prolidase for synthesis of oligonucleotide probes in the future.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rh704.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021f95d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Metabolism, Inborn errors of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prolidase deficiency</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peptidase</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fibroblasts</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agt54kn818"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Among-population variability in fish growth rates : the influence of food consumption, prey type and fish community</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Boisclair, Daniel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I assessed the relationship between growth of fish in situ, food consumption, prey type and fish community descriptors in 12 perch (Perca flavescens) populations exhibiting a 1.8 to 10-fold range in growth rates. Perch growth rates consistently decreased as fish numerical density increased (r$ sp2$ = 0.60) and increased as feeding levels increased (r$ sp2$ = 0.30). I found no significant relationship between the quantity of food consumed by perch and fish numerical density. Prey quality explained from 50 to 95% of the observed variability in growth but was related to fish numerical density in only one of the 3 perch age classes studied. I conclude that non-exploitative interactions (operating through increased activity costs) is a more viable explanation for the among-population variability in fish growth rates than is exploitative competition (yielding decreases in the total quantities of food consumed and/or prey quality).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806045s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kn818</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fishes -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fish populations -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw6634438s"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Interactions entre les thymocytes et les cellules epitheliales de la medulla thymique.

However the precise role of cellular complexes is far from clear. The objective of the present work was to gain an insight into this question. An in vitro model was previously developed in the laboratory, which detects the adherence of thymocytes to a thymic stromal cell line, E-5. Using this model, we describe here a novel lympho-stromal interaction involving L3T4$ sp+$/Ly-2$ sp+$ "cortical type" thymocytes and medullary epithelial cell. These adherent thymocytes appear at day 16 of murine gestation and their number vary during ontogenesis and leukemogenesis. After contact with epithelial cells, thymocytes become totally refractory to form further complexes, are activated and undergo some phenotypic modifications. All these results strongly suggest that this novel lympho-stromal interaction takes place in the transition of "cortical type" thymocytes into "medullary type" thymocytes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zh48v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634438s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
