Far too great a variety of methods have been employed in an endeavour to obtain accurate results for the problem under consideration, perhaps in no other class of experimental work has the complexity of methods in vogue been more conspicuous than in that conducted by the agronomist.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Summerby, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xm41z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816q17g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Grain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agronomy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Forage plants</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bf43w"><ual:graduationDate>1925</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Botany</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies concerning bean anthracnose</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Harrison, Kenneth A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bean anthracnose is of constant seasonal ocurrence in Quebec and the Maritimes and of considerable economic importance. It was therefore thought worth while to study the disease generally. This leads to a consideration of disease-resistant varieties and in view of the importance of physiological specialization as shown by the work of Barrus, Burkholder and Leach it was desirable that work be done to determine what physiological species of C. lindemuthianum, if any, occur in Eastern Canada.

In the development, however, Graham's classification has not been retained. The large number of facts that have been discovered since 1861 indicates that a sharp line can scarcely be drawn between the two domains. Probably the best classification is cde to Freundlich (2). This author used the term lyophobe to represent colloids, which when taken in bulk had no affinity for the dispersion medium, while lyophile was the term used to designate a colloid which when taken in bulk was peptized by the dispersion medium.
