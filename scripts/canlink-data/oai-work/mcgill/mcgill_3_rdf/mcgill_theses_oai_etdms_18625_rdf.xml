C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This paper given a general review of the subject of the self-sustained vibrations excited by the separation of flow. Because of the impossibility of obtaining an exact mathematical formulation, the common procedures of simplifying approximations and assumptions are liberally applied from the start in all of the reviewed investigations on the subject. By a simple approximate nonlinear theory one is able to predict phenomana in nonlinear systems which have no parallel in linear systems, but the results obtained must be considered as oualitative. Major trends are indicated correctly although the field is so broad that the work has only touched some of the high spots.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jackson, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bq540.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n246v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mechanical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9k41zj50c"><ual:graduationDate>1955</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The ultracentrifugal determination of partial specific volumes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Martin, William. G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the computation of the molecular weight of macromolecules from sedimentation velocity data several quantities are required. Of these the partial specific volume of the sedimenting entity is the one which causes the greatest uncertainty. Because of the nature of macromolecules it is not readily determined by direct measurement.

A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>For many years it has been implied by business men in the Press and in trade journals that price competition is "ruinous", "unethical", “cutthroat". The term loss leader is used often as a designation of disapproval rather than as a description of a readily recognizable phenomenon. To control and to develop a defense against this "unfair" competition, through trade associations and the policy of price maintenance has been a major objective of business policy. C. Wright Mills emphasized this point in the following quotation…</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579x322.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257j66t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics and Political Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r505p"><ual:graduationDate>1955</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Literature</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A critical study of ‘All’s Well that Ends Well”.</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Maizel, Norah. L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Allardyce Nicoll’s magnificent tribute to England’s greatest genius and the power of his far-reaching influence provokes in the reader a tantalizing train of thought. Implicit in his statement is the assumption that critics of a certain period will reflect in their writing on Shakespeare the predilections and prejudices of their age. Like many fine-sounding but too sweeping generalizations, this one, although telling the truth, does not tell the whole truth. Shakespearian scholarship has perhaps been too prone to place Shakespearian criticism into rigid categories.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Porter, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698c68r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r505p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
