On the day of treatment was withdrawn, the major plasma corticosteroid was 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and it appeared likely that in addition to cortisol other unidentified adrenal steroids may have been present.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Harpur, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fm257.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161930k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
