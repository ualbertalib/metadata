Various modifications of this method have been suggested but all of them may be criticized on similar grounds. In order to apply the procedure, a sample must contain at least 2 per cent PGA.

Though the benefits resulting from the transfusion of blood were recognized a very long time ago, it has been only within the last two decades that serious attempts have been made to preserve human blood. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the demand for blood both in civilian hospitals and on the battle field was increased tremendously.

It was first observed by Langenbeck in 1839 at autopsy. He found this yeast-like fungus in the intestines of a person who had died from typhoid fever. In 1842, David Gruby, the founder of medical mycology, clearly recognized yeast-like fungi involved in thrush of small children.

Abnormal oscillatory stresses were found to produce an increase in the internal friction and a consequent decrease in the dynamic modulus of the quartz. These effects appear in the crystal units, as a higher effective resistance and a depressed resonant frequency.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Howes, F.
