When a new hydraulic turbine or one of unusual proportions is being developed, the present day practice is to build a model of the turbine for operation in a testing flume, and to use the results from this to design the fullsized unit. It has been noticed that tests performed on large turbines built homologous with existing models generally show higher efficienaies than those obtained with the models.

On casting around for evidence of this fact one still meets, it is true, with much of the older terminology borrowed from philosophy, and a few of the older and more well-tried concepts. The expression 'mind' is still in use, and the mind-body controversy is not settled once and for all, but the difference, to take an example, between Sir William Hamilton's Lectures and the latest copy of the Journal of Experimental Psychology is a striking one.

Comparatively little attention, however, has been paid to the most recent phase of the movement which would extend to evening students, not a supplementary type of elementary education, not an evening vocational or trade course, not a popularized form of cultural training, but a fully balanced secondary education equivalent to that offered in the public day high schools, adapted to the capacities, interests and needs of older students, and leading, if desired, to higher education and the professional school. Owing its origin both to the general adult education movement and to the part-time day continuation school for young workers in Europe and America, the evening secondary school is entirely a twentieth century educational phenomenon.

Slime settling fulfills a very important function in the mining industry. In the cyanide process for the recovery of gold and silver, most of the valuable solution is recovered by settling the leached ore and rock material in thickeners.

Players seeking to “fine-tune” their trombones often were forced to seek expensive and unpredictable custom modifications. Also, trombonists performing in widely different musical styles and performance settings often own a number of different instruments, each suitable for different situations (i.e. classical vs. jazz). Recently, a number of boutique trombone manufacturers have emerged, offering modular trombones as a solution to both problems. These instruments are designed with interchangeable bells, slides, valves, tuning slides, and leadpipes, which can quickly and easily be exchanged with other parts of different designs, materials, or both. This thesis examines a number of traditional (fixed) and modular trombones with two objectives. The first objective is to determine if certain combinations of modular trombones could be used to adequately emulate the sound and feel of the fixed trombones they are based on. The second objective is to examine ways in which the performer might use different modular parts to tailor their sound to their specific musical needs and aesthetic preferences.

Quoique généralement de haute qualité, ces instruments ne correspondaient pas toujours précisément à chaque musicien ou chaque situation. Les trombonistes qui désiraient avoir un trombone adapté à leurs besoins étaient forcé d'effectuer des modifications coûteuses et imprévisibles. Également, les trombonistes qui voulaient jouer dans des styles variés de musique ou dans des circonstances divergentes devaient posséder plusieurs instruments, chacun étant utilisé pour un style en particulier (ex. classique vs. jazz).Récemment, plusieurs fabricants de trombone ont fait leurs apparitions, offrant des trombones modulaires comme solution aux deux problèmes. Ces instruments sont construits avec des parties interchangeables comme la cloche, la coulisse, le barillet, les coulisses d'accords et la branche d'embouchure, qui peuvent être facilement échanger avec d'autres parties soient construits différemment, construit avec un matériel différent ou les deux combinés.Cette thèse examine quelques trombones traditionnels (fixe) et modulaire avec deux objectifs.

It was concluded that the similar educaation of men and women was preferable in all respects to sex-differentiation. In treating the second question, the objections to co-education were first discussed. Most of them were shown to arise from prejudices against women, andto bave been proved groundless by experience in mixed sohools. Finally the advantages claimed for co-education by its advocates were presented. 1) A more satisfactory emotional adjustment of the boys and girls. 2) Improved moral tone of the school. 3 Completer education of personality. 4) Better basis for mutual understanding between the sexes. 5) Training of the sexes in co-operation. 6) Improvement in economic and sooial position of women.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clarke, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074z02m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m2289</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- Education</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coeducation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A794080999"><ual:graduationDate>1932</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Chemical and physiological properties of crystallineoestrogenic hormones</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Browne, John S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A crystalline oestrogenic hormone has been isolated from human placenta.

Credit for the final developments madeat that time must go to Marconi, but his work was the culmination of a long series of investigations carried out by Clerk-Maxwell, Preece, He~.tz, Branly, Lodge, Tesla, Popoff, Righi, and many others, all of whom were responsible for theoretical or experimental advances wh'ich brought one step closer the goal finally reached by Marconi.

Cure rather than prevention has frequently seemed to be the aim of man's research whether in the medical, religious, or social field. Not until comparatively recent years have men concerned themselves with causes. This has been only too true in the attitude of society towards those who oft transgress its rules. The amount of time, thought and money which the State has expended in punishing those who have committed crimes has been enormous throughout the centuries. Only within recent years have there been made any intelligent and organized effort to discover the reasons why the individual became a delinquent, and to ascertain the methods by which he may be brought into a harmonious relationship with society.

This suggestion was incorporated into the research program of the Laboratories, and Dr. H. W. Johnston from 1927 to 1929 made a preliminaryinvestigation of the penetration of liquids into Jack Pine. The results obtained were of sufficient interest to warrant further study, and from 1930 to 1932 the field has been developed by five graduate students in Physical Chemistry at McGill University working under the direction of Dr. 0. Mass. This thesis describes one part of the work, that of thepenetration of aqueous sulphite solutions into spruce wood.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maass, O.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150m92r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dg537</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1z40kw71n"><ual:graduationDate>1932</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Migration between Canada and the United States : with particular reference to professional and intellectual classes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Schwab, Jean Gillespie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the migration between Canada and the United States with particular reference to the professional and intellectual classes, or what might be called by some such popular phrase as the "Export of Brains". As far as I have been able to discover, there has been very little work previously done on this subject. As a resultt the material has been collected bit by bit by going through long lists of names and writing many individual letters. In the time at my disposal I have not been able to make a very complete investigation of the subject which would entail even more elaborate communication and research. It is the idea of the Department, however, that I present what material I have been able to find, not so much as a well rounded and complete thesis but as an introduction to the subject and a fragmentary collection of notes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leacock, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p1092.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kw71n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada -- Emigration and immigration</dc:subject><dc:subject>United States -- Emigration and immigration</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ecomonimcs</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kk18x"><ual:graduationDate>1932</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Franklin and Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Snyder, John K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The following pages deal with Benjamin Franklin's interest and part in the question of Canada as that question enters into the continental history of North America and the relations of North America with the British and French governments between the years 1745-1790.
