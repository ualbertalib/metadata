A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During the period 1946-1956 geochemical prospecting methods were extensively utilized by mining companies in North America, especially in base metal exploration. At this time three types of geochemical prospecting methods were most widely used: water, stream sediment, and soil testing. These techniques were popularized through the studies of H. E. Hawkes and his colleagues. All inorganic materials of extreme fineness are sorptive. The clays additionally have crystal lattice properties which make them highly sorptive. This phenomenon bad been realized by soil scientists from their plant researches.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eakins, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z9033654.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73q077k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
