He postulated that when an electrolyte is dissolved in a solvent, it partially dissociated into charged particles (now called ions). Another postulate of his theory was that the degree of dissociation of the electrolyte depends on the concentration of the solution, increases with dilution, and becomes complete in an infinitely dilute solution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schiff, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kx52n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924g390</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arb68xg56k"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Theoretical and numerical analysis of supersonic inlet starting by mass spillage</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Najafiyazdi, Alireza</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Supersonic inlet starting by mass spillage is studied theoretically and numerically in the present thesis. A quasi-one-dimensional, quasi-steady theory is developed for the analysis of flow inside a perforated inlet. The theory results in closed-form relations applicable to flow starting by the mass spillage technique in supersonic and hypersonic inlets. The theory involves three parameters to incorporate the multi-dimensional nature of mass spillage through a wall perforation. Mass spillage through an individual slot is studied to determine these parameters; analytical expressions for these parameters are derived for both subsonic and supersonic flow conditions. In the case of mass spillage from supersonic flows, the relations are exact. However, due to the complexity of flow field, the theory is an approximation for subsonic flows. Therefore, a correction factor is introduced which is determined from an empirical relation obtained from numerical simulations. A methodology is also proposed to determine perforation size and distribution to achieve flow starting for a given inlet at a desired free-stream Mach number. The problem of shock stability inside a perforated inlet designed with the proposed method is also discussed. The method is demonstrated for some test cases. Time-realistic CFD simulations and experimental results in the literature confirm the accuracy of the theory and the reliability of the proposed design methodology.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b7116.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xg56k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Airplanes -- Scramjet engines</dc:subject><dc:subject>Supersonic planes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Airplanes -- Ramjet engines -- Air intakes</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924g40r"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Continuum design sensitivity analysis based force calculation in EM devices</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Min, 1977 Apr. 2-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The continuum design sensitivity analysis (CDSA) has been applied to the magnetostatic and electrostatic force calculation.

Proliferation, migration and subsequent differentiation of these cells are critical steps in the repair of muscle injury. We document in this study the roles and mechanisms through which the NAPDH oxidase complex regulates skeletal satellite cell proliferation. The NADPH oxidase subunits Nox2, Nox4, p22phox, p47phox and p67 phox were detected in primary human and murine skeletal muscle satellite cells. In human satellite cells, NADPH oxidase-fusion proteins were localized in the cytosolic and membrane compartments of the cell, except for p47 phox, which was detected in the nucleus. In proliferating subconfluent satellite cells, both Nox2 and Nox4 contributed to O2- production. However, Nox4 expression was significantly attenuated in confluent cells and in differentiated myotubes. Proliferation of satellite cells was significantly reduced by antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine and apocynin), inhibition of p22phox expression using siRNA oligonucleotides, and reduction of Nox4 and p47phox activities with dominant-negative vectors resulted in attenuation of activities of the Erk1/2, PI-3 kinase/AKT and NFkappaB pathways and significant reduction in cyclin D1 levels. We conclude that NADPH oxidase is expressed in skeletal satellite cells and that its activity plays an important role in promoting proliferation of these cells.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920g1478.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zx94b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Muscle Fibers -- cytology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reactive Oxygen Species -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>NADPH Oxidase -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Satellite Cells, Skeletal Muscle -- cytology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21tk16x"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Executive functioning in children diagnosed with ADHD : examining DSM-IV subtypes and comorbid disorders</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ter-Stepanian, Mariam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objective.

This study explored Internet gambling in a sample of university students aged 18 to 20 years. Students reported on their involvement in gambling activities both on and off the Internet. In the past 12 months, 6.7% of participants had gambled for money on the Internet, with higher rates among males (11.0%) than females (.8%). As well, 39.4% of students reported that in the past 12 months they had played gambling-type games on Internet 'practice' sites, where no money was required to play.

In the northeastern Peruvian Amazon, a multitude of river transporters and market intermediaries based in the central city of Iquitos provide essential services and market opportunities for remote peasant producers across the region. Using a multi-scalar, multi-method approach involving extensive fieldwork in the Peruvian Amazon, this research (re)assesses the meanings and implications of "remoteness" and "connectedness" for rural peasants. At the regional scale, I examine the functional heterogeneity of river trading networks and marketing agents. Given the high-risk/high-transaction-cost environment, river trading is found to be expensive for producers and traders alike. High costs are exacerbated by the low gross returns of rural production (mainly food and natural building materials). Thin or missing markets for credit, labour, land and insurance increase the hardships associated with limited access to product markets. Regional findings are complemented with a comparative livelihoods analysis in two remote communities of the Alto Tigre River that benefit from differential access to oil-labour. My study reveals that differential access to labour has significant impacts on the livelihood strategies of working households. However, given limited access to external markets, cash-income from oil-labour is found to offer limited opportunities for growth. In sum, the research proposes insights for advancing the debate on livelihoods and poverty in the Peruvian Amazon.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qt64r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z9033700</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Amazon River Region -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indians of South America -- Amazon River Region -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peasants -- Amazon River Region -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Land use, Rural -- Amazon River Region</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278z01p"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of ghrelin on the amygdala response to visual food and non-food stimuli : an fMRI study in humans</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bedrossian, Diane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A complex physiological system, composed of central and peripheral signals, balances energy intake and expenditure. Among these signals, the enteric and orexigenic hormone ghrelin is a regulator of energy balance with several uncharacterized functions. Although much research has accumulated regarding ghrelin's effects on metabolic parameters, little is known about its other behavioural and cognitive effects. Consequently, this study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, showed that ghrelin administered intravenously to healthy volunteers increased the neural response to food pictures, as well as faces of fear and disgust, in brain areas regulating the hedonic and incentive evaluation of visual stimuli, such as the amygdala. Moreover, ghrelin exhibited memory enhancing effects for both food pictures and faces of fear and disgust. These findings suggest that ghrelin's activation of the amygdala may serve as a magnitude signal for value judgments of visually-presented food and non-food stimuli, thus engaging critical feeding, emotional and cognitive responses.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429f13m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278z01p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peptide Hormones</dc:subject><dc:subject>Food</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amygdala -- physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5t34sp00s"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Balbuzard : for solo clarinet, wind symphony and electronics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Adamcyk, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Balbuzard is a musical composition of approximately twelve minutes in length, scored for solo clarinet, wind symphony and electronics.

To this end, tools were developed using a variety of computer applications or programming languages, such as Lisp, OpenMusic and Cubase. These tools made possible a kind of graphic composition where diagrams of different shapes were entered into a computer interface and converted into source material. The generated source material consisted of several rhythmic strata whose pitches, mainly part of diatonic, octatonic or chromatic collections, followed the contour of the entered shape. With this visual process, it was also possible to explore the creation of contrapuntal textures by entering diagrams of lines representing the path of each contrapuntal voice.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

It is shown that due to the correlation of the noise samples after pulse matched filtering and sampling, the complexity of the derived receiver, based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with fractional sampling, is the same as that of the ML receiver, which requires an exhaustive search. It is shown that by using a noise whitening filter to whiten the noise samples, the algorithm can be efficiently implemented using the Viterbi algorithm instead of using an exhaustive search technique. Due to spectral zeros of the autocorrelation function of the noise sequence, noise whitening filter designed by spectral factorization are not practical for the square-root raised cosine pulses and similar shapes. An alternative prediction-error whitening filter is proposed solving the Yule-Walker equations. We analyze the performance of the proposed receiver via numerical simulations. It is observed that when the channel is perfectly known, the performance of the fractional ML receiver, with five-tap whitening filter, is only 0.5 dB worse than that of the optimal ML receiver at a BER of 10-4. When the path delays are fixed and the channel is unknown, the fractional iterative scheme outperforms the symbol rate iterative scheme between 0 and 16 dB, and between BERs of 2 x 10-1 and 2 x 10 -4. With varying path delays, the fractional scheme is better for all simulated SNR values. However, both schemes experience a severe error flooring. Application of the EM algorithm to iteratively estimate frequency selective channels and detect the transmitted information sequence improves the efficiency of pilot symbols. By using additional iterations, the BER is lowered with the same number of pilot symbols. We also compare the performance of the iterative receiver that uses the correct tap covariance matrix with the one that assumes a diagonal covariance matrix. It is observed that with fixed path delays the performance is identical with both models. With varying path delays and fractional sampling the diagonal assumption results in a performance loss of 0.5 dB.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50tw19h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js591</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cv38q"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of virtual laboratory as an educationalresearch tool in food processing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chi, Minli, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Personal computers (PC) and high level programming techniques have been developing so rapidly during last decade leading to new and exciting opportunities in the field of education. The purpose of this research was to develop food processing virtual labs as efficient teaching and study tools for food processing courses using user-friendly computer languages (VC++, MFC and OpenGL). A 3D graphic technique was employed in this study as a specific objective to generate 3D graphics in the visualization mode. According to functionalities, virtual labs were designed for three basic simulations: (1) Calculation simulations, which perform various calculations related to food processing. These simulations help users to remember and understand the formula used in process calculations. Several simple concept calculations were included: conduction heat transfer in steady state through individual and composite slabs; two-component mass balance systems, Pearson rule applications; freezing and thawing time calculations; (2) Animation simulations, which are aimed to visualize processing scenarios for different physical phenomena or working principles. Included in these simulations were: conduction heat transfer through single and multiple walls under steady state; mixing processes involving two and three component systems and Pearson rule concept; freezing and thawing processes through slab, cylinder, and sphere, the three regular shapes, agitation thermal processing modes which include axial agitation and end-over-end agitation in rotational retort; (3) Virtual equipment simulations, which are aimed to dynamically simulate a real operating environment and to demonstrate equipment working principle, internal structure, and operating procedures. The simulated equipment include a horizontal retort used in thermal processing and a high pressure processing equipment used in non-thermal processing. The food processing virtual labs provide a new way in teaching and learning, with no risk, time or place limitations, and are cost effective. The simulated scenarios and equipment can be used as teaching tools in food processing courses, which provide an efficient way to the instructor/assistant. Instructor/assistant can dynamically and repeatedly demonstrate the operating process for the simulated equipment in a vivid and interested manner. Also students can get intuitive understanding by viewing these simulations.

However no matter how many more abnormalities are added to the list this method will add very little to knowledge of the basic causes of developmental defects.

This, in turn, has created a shift in the balance between dependants, i.e., those under 20 and those over 65, to the bread-winners, throwing a heavier burden on the earning population. These trends have had wide ramifications in our economic and social institutions, and have made research and planning imperative in the field of geriatrics.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h813m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cp56x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject/><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418r958"><ual:graduationDate>1958</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>L'Annee 1745 dans la Vie et l'Oeuvre de Voltaire</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Szablowski, Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ce sage conseil de Sainte-Beuve inspirera notre travail d'apprenti-critique.
