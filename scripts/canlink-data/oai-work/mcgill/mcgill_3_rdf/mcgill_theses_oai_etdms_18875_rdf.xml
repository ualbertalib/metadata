H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An attempt is made to interpret the ground state gamma radiation transitions due to thermal neutron capture in terms of the shell model of the nucleus. A new selection rule for magnetic multipole radiation is derived, which depends for its validity on the assumption that the orbital angular momentum of the individual particles is a good quantum number. It is found that the ground-state transitions are in general agreement with the shell models provided that the interaction between unpaired nucleons is taken into consideration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jackson, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977z97w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vp947</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pf541"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Xanthate methyl esters of simple alcohols and of cellulose</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vincent, Donald. L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The ultimate aim of the present research was to clarify the structure of cellulose xanthates, with particular reference to the positions of the xanthate groups within the glucose units. Some attempts have been made in recent years to solve this problem by substituting the unstable xanthate groups by the much more stable methyl groups, using diazomethane, and by studying the structure of the resulting methylcelluloses.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827g87d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pf541</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848v37p"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Literature</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Lucretian imagery</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vallillee, Gerald. R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although many fine editions have appeared, both ancient and modern, of Lucretius' De Rerum Natura", the one aspect of his style, "imagery", which forms the subject of this thesis, has not hitherto been adequately treated. Different editors have different views on Lucretius. Bailey holds that the most important single characteristic of Lucretius is his lofty and noble diction. Smith sees in the archaic tone of the poem the keynote of Lucretius' style. All, however, agree that the poem presents an uninterrupted sucession of varied and colourful pictures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Carruthers, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tt21q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848v37p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Classics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wr850"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mechanical aids for production control</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tweed, William. J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The importance of good production control is increasing with the steady increase in productivity found in Canadian and American industry. (Normally, the United States manages to achieve a yearly gain of 2% in productivity.) In view of this it is insufficient to compare lost time, commonly called waiting time, of say ten years ago, with that of today and assume, because there has not been an increase, that the control system is operating satisfactorily. A much better indication of the effectiveness of the control system is a ratio of waiting time to productive time since the latter will likely have been decreasing steadily for the same unit of product.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>White, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rj39f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wr850</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mechanical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
