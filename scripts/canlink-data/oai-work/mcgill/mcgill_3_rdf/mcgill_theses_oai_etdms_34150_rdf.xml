Patients are characterised by a metabolic phenotype comprising elevated levels of phe and some of its metabolites, notably phenyllactate (PLA), phenylacetate (PAA) and phenylpyruvate (PPA), in both tissue and body fluids. Treatment from birth with low-phe diet largely prevents the severe mental retardation that is its major consequence. Mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of PKU are still not fully understood; to this end, the availability of an orthologous animal model is relevant. A number of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenized mouse strains have become available. I report a new heteorallelic strain, developed by crossing female ENU1 (with mild non-PKU HPA) with a male ENU2/+ carrier of a 'severe' PKU-causing allele. I describe the new hybrid ENU1/2 strain and compare it with control (BTBR/Pas), ENU1, ENU2 and the heterozygous counterparts. The ENU1, ENU1/2 and ENU2 strains display mild, moderate and severe phenotypes, respectively, relative to the control and heterozygous counterparts. I describe a novel method using negative ion chemical ionization gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (NICI-GC/MS) to measure the concentration of PLA, PAA and PPA in the brain of normal and mutant mice. Although elevated moderately in HPA and more so in PKU mice, concentrations of these metabolites are not sufficient to explain impaired brain function; however phe is present in brain at levels associated with harm. Finally, I describe a new modality for treatment of HPA, compatible with better human compliance: it involves enzyme substitution with non-absorbable and protected phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) in the intestinal lumen, to convert L-phenylalanine to the harmless metabolites (trans-cinnamic acid and trace ammonia). PAL, taken orally, substitutes for the deficient PAH enzyme and depletes body pools of excess phe. I describe an efficient recombinant approach to produce PAL enzyme. I also provide proofs of both pharmacologic and physiologic principles by testing PAL in the orthologous mutant mouse strains with HPA. The findings encourage further development of PAL for oral use as an ancillary treatment of human PKU.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scriver, C.

In this thesis, cold signaling events both upstream and downstream of calcium influx were examined. First, it was shown that the studies on calcium mediation of cold acclimation in alfalfa cell suspension cultures could be applied to intact seedlings of Arabidopsis. Calcium chelators and channel blockers caused a strong reduction in the cold-induced accumulation of kin1 and kin2 transcripts, suggesting that calcium influx was an essential event during cold signaling and that the source of calcium for this influx was largely the calcium-rich cell wall. Evidence suggesting the involvement of calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) was also obtained. Second, the nature of events upstream of calcium influx was explored. For this study, transgenic Brassica napus seedlings possessing both the endogenous cold-inducible BN115 gene and the coding part of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene placed under the control of the BN115 promoter were used. Thus cold-activation of the BN115 promoter drove the expression of both BN115 at the transcriptional level and the GUS enzyme activity at the translational level. Cold-activation of BN115 was inhibited by chemicals which cause membrane fluidization, cytoskeletal stabilization and inhibition of Ca2+ influx, and mimicked at 25°C by chemicals causing membrane rigidification, cytoskeletal destabilization and Ca2+ influx. Inhibitors of protein and lipid kinases prevented cold-activation of BN115, but inhibition of protein phosphatases activated BN115 at 25°C. Third, given the increasing importance of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in signal transduction, the nature of molecular mechanisms that lead to cold-activation of a previously reported MAPK, SAMK, was investigated. During this study, the first plant MAPK activated by heat shock was discovered and named HAMK (Heat-shock-activated MAPK). It was shown that cold-activation of SAMK is mediated by cold-induced membrane rigidification, whereas the heat shock-activation of HAMK occurs through heat shock-induced membrane fluidization. Whereas activation of both SAMK and HAMK is blocked by an actin microfilament stabilizer, it is mimicked at 25°C by chemical destabilizers of microtubules or actin microfilaments. All of these events are inhibited by blocking the influx of extracellular Ca 2+. Cold-activation of SAMK and heat-activation of HAMK was prevented by treatment of cells with inhibitors of CDPKs. Thus, cold and heat shock are sensed by structural changes in the plasma membrane, which transduces the signal via cytoskeletal rearrangements to the opening of calcium channels, leading to Ca2+ influx, activation of CDPKs and activation of distinct MAPK cascades.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dhindsa, R.

Developments and applications are presented for two sample introduction arrangements that use interchangeable sample probes in contact-free heating environments: direct sample insertion (DSI), and induction heating-electrothermal vaporization (IH-ETV). For the well-established technique of DSI, studies focused on the development and application of a pyrolytically coated graphite sample support, a feature common to conventional ETV systems. A process for coating sample probes in the ICP discharge was developed, and improvements were seen in both the reproducibility of the volatilization event and the appearance of the transient emission signals with ICP-optical emission spectrometry (OES) when a coated probe was used over an uncoated one. The pyrolytically coated sample probe was successfully used for the direct determination of several metals in wood pulps by ICP-OES, and was found not only to improve the appearance of the temporal signals, but also demonstrated a heightened resistance to chemical attack. For the prototypical IH-ETV system, a general study was first conducted to establish performance attributes and benchmarks such as heating characteristics, transport efficiency, and ICP-OES detection limits using several mixed carrier gases. The IH-ETV arrangement was found to be capable of rapid heating rates and precise, reproducible temperature control suitable for a thermal vaporization sample introduction technique. Of all the gas mixtures studied, the incorporation of 15% (v/v) SF6 into the Ar carrier flow resulted in the best overall conditions for the vaporization, transport and detection of analytes by ICP-OES. These conditions were successfully used for the determination of various metals in soil and sediment samples by ICP-OES using IH-ETV sample introduction.

It will focus on how modernist Muslims have constructed their theological thought throughout the century, which, in turn, reflects their religious understanding in response to the particular demands of their age. The modernist theological thought constructed so far signifies a continuum of progress, developing from one stage to the next. Implicitly, this progress also indicates the improvement of Indonesian Muslims' understanding of their own religion, which may suggest the betterment of their commitment to doctrinal beliefs and religious practices. Therefore, this study will also examine the ways in which Indonesian Islam noticeably grows more orthodox through these forms of religious commitment. Drawing upon an Indonesian term, the growth of orthodox Islam is known as the santri cultural expansion, which, at least since the last two decades of the century, has been characterized by the vertical (and horizontal) mobility of devoted Muslims in political, cultural and economic enterprises. As well, this study will include a discussion of the theological thought underlying that santri cultural expansion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ormsby, Eric</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Federspiel, Howard M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sf32f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289k74m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islamic renewal -- Indonesia -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- Indonesia -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73px656"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Random dynamics of a structurally nonlinear airfoil in turbulent flow</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poirel, Dominique C.M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the effects of turbulent flow on the random dynamics of structurally nonlinear airfoil. A secondary objective is to articulate a more comprehensive picture of the contribution of the longitudinal component of turbulence, as experienced by the airfoil, be it linear or nonlinear. In this regard, a systematic and detailed numerical analysis of the airfoil experiencing random flutter/Hopf bifurcation is presented. Some aspects of the divergence/pitchfork problem are also discussed. The airfoil is modelled as a flexibly mounted rigid flat plate with degrees-of-freedom in pitch and heave. The principal nonlinearity considered is a hardening cubic torsional spring. The aerodynamics is incompressible and linear. Unsteady aerodynamic effects due to arbitrary motion and turbulence are modelled. Both longitudinal and vertical components of the Gaussian turbulence are considered. Longitudinal turbulence acts as a parametric excitation, whereas the latter represents an external forcing. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to solve numerically the system of random differential equations. The time history solutions are then studied in terms of their mean-square, probability density function and power spectral density. The largest Lyapunov exponent is also calculated. The bifurcation, stability and response characteristics of the airfoil are examined. For the linear airfoil, it is found that the coalescence flutter speed is always advanced by the longitudinal component of turbulence, and generally dominated by the very low frequency range of the excitation. Divergence can be either advanced or postponed, but the magnitude of the shift is not significant compared with flutter. Furthermore, it is shown that in general longitudinal turbulence decreases the overall stability of the airfoil, be it linear or nonlinear. For the nonlinear airfoil, it is the vertical component of turbulence that determines the essential features of the stochastic bifurcation and the qualitative characteristics of the response. The interplay between turbulence and nonlinear stiffness has a significant impact on the probability structure of the aeroelastic response. Uni-, bi- and double bi-modal distributions are observed, and found to occur at different airspeeds depending on which state variable is considered. Furthermore, the spectral content displays noise-controlled, and noise-induced, time scales.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Price, S.

Classical models are compared to models involving fractional derivatives, which are derivatives of an order between 0 and 1. Parameters for classical and fractional order models are found for two materials, polymethylmethacrylate and 3M ISD 112, an acrylic based material sold as a viscoelastic layer by 3M. In both cases, only Prony series with several parameters achieve a good representation over a large frequency range. In the case of 3M ISD 112, a fractional model with only two parameters gives a good representation over a frequency range of three decades, which is often sufficient. An algorithm based on an approximated definition of the fractional derivative and a trapezoidal rule is described to solve constitutive equations with fractional derivatives. The algorithm is implemented in C and tested against a numerical Laplace inverse for the case of a material submitted to sinusoidal strains. The algorithm gives accurate results and does not require very small steps, which is usually the case for algorithms based on finite differences or Grunwald series. The algorithm is adapted to the structure of a user subroutine of a commercial finite element package, Samcef, for a six component isotropic tensor. The model assumes a constant bulk modulus and has one fractional derivative of the deviatoric strain. The Jacobian of the constitutive equation with a fractional derivative is derived and implemented. The results from the subroutine are compared satisfactorily to results from the numerical Laplace inverse for a cubic element submitted to sinusoidal strains. Finally, the different models are tested to represent the experimental behaviour of slewing beams made either of polymethylmethacrylate or steel covered by constrained viscoelastic layers. The classical models give generally a poor representation of the experimental behaviour, except for the Prony series. The fractional model give a representation as satisfactory as the ones obtained with the Prony series, but for a much higher CPU times due to the hereditary nature of the fractional derivative. It is therefore recommended to use Prony series models, unless the data to perform the parameter identification is limited. In that case, the fractional order model becomes interesting despite the higher demands on the CPU time.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nemes, James</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dt71w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n4975</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ans0647448"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Interaction of the turnip mosaic potyvirus VPg with the plant translation apparatus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Plante, Daniel, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An interaction was recently detected between the potyviral protein, genome-linked (VPg) and the Arabidopsis thaliana translation initiation factor eIF(iso)4E (Wittmann et al., 1997). Here, experiments were undertaken to address biological aspects of the VPg-eIF4E interaction. First, coimmunoprecipitation experiments performed with purified recombinant proteins have shown that VPg not only associates with eIF4E, as was previously published, but also with the larger eIF4F complex, of which eIF4E is a subunit. These results were confirmed by ELISA-type binding assays. It was also shown that there is no direct interaction between VPg and the other subunit of eIF4F, namely eIF4G. Finally, with the same experimental system, it was shown that the presence of eIF4G does not influence the binding affinity of VPg and eIF4E. The interaction of VPg with the plant translation apparatus suggests that potyviral infection may alter the host protein expression profile. This hypothesis was investigated with the use of a protoplast system. We have shown that the global rates of protein synthesis in protoplasts transfected with an infectious TuMV cDNA clone dropped shortly after transfection, by as much as an estimated 70%. Recovery to normal levels occurred within 48 hours. Evidence was obtained that the interaction between VPg and eIF4E is instrumental in this transient down-regulation of protein expression: protoplasts transfected with a mutant TuMV cDNA clone, the VPg of which has no affinity for eIF4E, failed to exhibit the drop in protein synthesis observed with the wild-type clone.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fortin, Marc G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k829.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns0647448</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arabidopsis thaliana -- Disease and pest resistance</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plant-pathogen relationships -- Genetic aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Turnip mosaic virus</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w6486"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Human brain endothelial cells under inflammatory challenge : relevance to MS and T cell migration</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Prat, Alexandre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered an immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by multifocal areas of inflammation and demyelination. Lesion formation depends on migration of lymphocytes from the systemic compartment into the CNS through the blood-brain barrier. We have defined molecular and functional properties of human brain derived microvascular endothelial cells and of T lymphocytes that regulate the migration process and analysed how changes in these properties, in response to inflammatory conditions, contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Rates of migration of T lymphocytes derived from patients with MS across either a fibronectin and/or endothelial cell barrier in vitro were increased compared to cells obtained from healthy controls. In the MS patients, migration rate correlated with disease activity, defined by clinical and MRI criteria and with IFN gamma production by T cells. Migration was reduced in patients receiving current therapies for MS. Adhesion molecules, chemokines and matrix metalloproteinases were all found to regulate the migration of MS derived lymphocytes through proteins of the basement membrane and human brain endothelial cells. We further demonstrated that the migratory properties of lymphocytes and both permeability and chemokine production by human brain endothelial cells, can be regulated via signalling through the specific kinin B1 receptor that is up-regulated on lymphocytes and human brain endothelial cells during inflammation, providing a potential novel therapeutic approach to modulate lymphocyte-endothelial cell interactions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Antel, Jack P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r4790.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w6486</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30pv296"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Empirical normal mode diagnosis of reanalysis data and dynamical-core experiments</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Moraes, Ayrton Zadra</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Global data and numerical models are used to investigate the climatology and variability in the upper-troposphere and lower-stratosphere where large-scale low-frequency vorticity modes dominate over high-frequency inertia-gravity waves. An algorithm based on the Empirical Normal Mode decomposition technique is proposed as a diagnostic tool. This technique combines dynamics (a wave-activity of linear dynamics defines the orthogonality between modes) with statistics (the wave-activity amplitude of each mode provides a measure of its statistical significance) and has the unbiased ability to capture neutral normal modes as well as singular modes. First, the algorithm is applied to winter data provided by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses and results indicate that most wave-activity is carried by large-scale, eastward-propagating modes centered at mid- and high-latitudes. The phase-speeds of some leading modes are in good agreement with theoretical predictions of linear dynamics. Some mid-latitude modes exhibit properties that can be explained by the theory of quasi-modes---for example, the leading wavenumber-5 mode with a dipolar pressure field near the tropopause, a propagation speed of 12 m s-1 and a decay rate of 3 days. In a model study, we use data from two dynamical-core experiments of the Global Environmental Multiscale model: one with the forcing proposed by Held and Suarez, later modified by Williamson et al. (called HSW experiment); the other with the forcing by Boer and Denis (BD). Modes and spectra are similar to those found in the NCEP data study, although details depend on the forcing. For instance, wave-energy amplitudes are higher with the BD forcing and an approximate energy equipartition is observed in the spectrum of wavenumber-1 modes in the studies of NCEP data and BD experiment, but not in the HSW experiment. The HSW forcing has a relatively strong relaxation acting on the complete temperature field, whereas the BD forcing only acts on the zonal-mean temperature letting the internal dynamics alone drive the wave-activity cascade through the rest of the spectrum. This difference seems to explain why the BD forcing is more successful in reproducing the observed atmospheric wave-activity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Derome, J.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Brunet, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fn40z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv296</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z2547"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Peer relations and self-perceptions of boys with behavioral problems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Morganstein, Tamara</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of three interventions on boys' peer relationships, self-perceptions, and undesirable behavior.

However, he was forced to adapt the ancient and medieval models to the demands of his own thoroughgoing materialism.

This dissertation joins a small number of recent studies which redress this omission. It makes a significant contribution to existing examinations of North American cities and Canadian social history through the use of categories which are rarely employed and questions that are seldom posed in investigations of working-class history during the period of industrialization. A holistic treatment of Marxist philosophy provides the theoretical underpinnings for a sensitive engagement with daily street life in an urban milieu. As a site of intense sociability, Notre-Dame Street, the main street of the industrial suburb of Saint-Henri, offers a unique perspective on the intricate use of public space and its relations to social space. This thesis covers the period between the years of town incorporation in 1875 and annexation to the City of Montreal in 1905. Notre-Dame Street underwent significant transformations in this period. A main street of a small town on the outskirts of Montreal became the principal commercial street of a bustling industrial city. The 1890s was a decade of particularly marked shifts, characterized by significant population growth and dramatic changes in physical form. Class and ethnic tensions intensified as a result. A 1891 labour dispute at Merchants Manufacturing, a textile factory, took to the streets, and the local elite contested George A. Drummond's refusal to pay municipal taxes in 1897. Resistance to monopoly control of utilities was evidenced by the use of petitions and protets or notarized letters. Workers' parties, journalists, and municipal reform leagues increasingly challenged the hegemony of the local elite whose persistent practices of overspending resulted in a substantial debt and annexation. The study of a local street in an industrializing community demonstrates the prevailing social and political distribution of wealth and power. It reveals significant differences between the various class ideologies which were played out in the management of the public space of the street. An economic liberal ideology was instrumental to the development of the modern Western city through the creation of divisions between public and private spaces. Social usage, the visible presence of the working and marginal classes and women on city streets, suggests a different reality. A reconstruction of daily street life from a diversity of written and visual sources indicates that women, men, and children inhabited and frequented homes, shops, and offices, travelling to and from work, and various places of recreation. The rhythm of everyday street life was punctuated by unusual events of a celebratory, criminal, and tragic nature, which emphasize the connections between spatial structures and subjective experience. The local management of public space thus involved class antagonisms, characterized by negotiation, transgression, and resistance. This dissertation argues that the politics of this public space benefited the class interests of a grande bourgeoisie of Montreal and a local petite bourgeoisie, to the detriment of the working classes. These conflicting class interests were played out in a variety of different ways. The exclusion and appropriation of social and symbolic spaces were characterized by distinct property ownership and rental patterns. An anglophone grande bourgeoisie of Montreal owned vacant and subdivided lots. A francophone petite bourgeoisie dominated property ownership, and a majority of renters lived in flats on the main street and on adjoining streets. The shaping of the physical infrastructure was distinguished by the growth of monopolies and minimal local intervention. The civic manifestation of the ordered and ritualistic celebration of the parade emphasized a Catholic identity. Attempts to impose an appropriate and genteel code of behaviour on city streets led to the moral regulation and social control of criminal behaviour.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Young, Brian</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r9675286.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rw14z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>St. Henri (Montréal, Québec) -- Social conditions -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>St. Henri (Montréal, Québec) -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social classes -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- St. Henri -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d153z"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A realistic simulation system for quantitative functional imaging with positron emission tomography</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ma, Yilong, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have developed and implemented an analytic simulation system to evaluate and correct quantitative imaging distortions in positron emission tomography (PET) scans. It is based on measured tomograph characteristics and realistic 3-D brain models generated from regionally segmented brain image data. Each structure is assigned with a regional radiotracer concentration and attenuation coefficient to create 3-D dynamic brain models and tissue attenuation maps. Projection data are then generated by incorporating key physical factors of detector geometry and resolution, attenuation, scatter, randoms, efficiency, deadtime and counting statistics. This has been done for a multi-slice PET scanner and includes temporal sampling and radiotracer decay. Simulated emission and transmission data are reconstructed by a filtered-backprojection algorithm. The simulation methods are validated by scan data from both geometrical and anatomically realistic brain phantoms. Simulated projection components of a uniform phantom and a 3-D Hoffman brain phantom agree accurately with the measured data from our PET scanner. We then summarize current applications of this simulation tool to improve regional radioactivity quantification and optimize imaging protocols. In particular we have implemented a novel methodology to estimate and correct 3-D partial volume effects in dynamic PET studies using correlated magnetic resonance images. Simulations and phantom data in both single and double isotope experiments reveal substantial errors in striatal and cortical structures. Both show spatially variant and nonlinear distortions in time-activity curves which become more significant with degrading image resolution. These errors are removed completely by the partial volume correction algorithm with a reasonable increase in variance. This software package is flexible and extensible. We have added many automatic steps to increase computational efficiency and simplify its usage in a clinical environment. This simulation tool offers a unified framework to evaluate and optimize PET imaging methodology from data acquisition, processing, and reconstruction to image analysis and physiological parameter estimation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Evans, Alan C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763870h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d153z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agb19f761x"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mosaique et memoire : paradigmes identitaires dans le roman feminin tunisien</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lunt, Lora G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mosaique et memoire studies paradigms that contribute to the construction of identity in the writings of thirteen Tunisian women novelists writing in French: Emna Bel Haj Yahia, Aicha Chaibi, Annie Fitoussi, Behija Gaaloul, Annie Goldmann, Souad Guellouz, Jelila Hafsia, Souad Hedri, Turkia Labidi Ben Yahia, Alia Mabrouk, Nine Moati, Katia Rubenstein, and Fawzia Zouari. Drawing upon post-colonial and feminist perspectives, this thesis analyzes texts through their poetics and in linguistic, cultural and literary contexts. Novels by women offer an inside view of women's evolution through a variety of characters representing three generations, just as they explore alternate ways of entering modernity based upon harmonizing traditional values (cultural roots, family, faith, community solidarity, a Mediterranean warmth of spirit, thinking "in Arabesques") with 'modern' values such as sexual equality and individual freedom. Multiple women's voices protest patriarchal and colonial or racist discourse, but also reveal spaces of happiness in women's lives. Jewish voices at times reinforce views by Muslim authors but at others present opposing viewpoints, deconstructing concepts such as 'Arab identity' and questioning nationalist claims to Islamic tolerance and multiculturalism. In these French-language novels, images and metaphors, as well as expressions in dialectical Arabic, recall the rich cultural heritage underlying national consciousness, the memory and the mosaic which form both individual and national identities. The juxtaposition of Arabic and French suggests both the cross-fertilization of cultures and the impossibility of naming the inexpressible, just as it contributes to deconstructing identity through the medium of the novel.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Doiron, Normand</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>McNeece, Lucy</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tw820.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f761x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tunisian literature (French) -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women authors, Arab -- Tunisia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wr977"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the parameterization of slantwise convection in general circulation models</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ma, Liang, 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is concerned with the effect of slantwise convection in general circulation models (GCMs). The approach is through the development of a slantwise convective parameterization scheme (SCPS) and its implementation into version 11 of the third generation GCM of the Canadian Climate Centre for modelling and analysis (CCCma gcm11). We first study the characteristics of conditional symmetric instability (CSI) in an environment which is also unstable for conditional upright instability (CUI). The results indicate features common to both upright and slantwise convection. This so called slantwise buoyant instability (SBI) possesses two relevant time scales and its horizontal scale can ranges from tens of km up to over one thousand km. We then analyze the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA) data to compute the global distributions of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and slantwise convective available energy (SCAPE). We show that the potential for CSI and CUI indeed co-exists over most areas around the globe. Based on the results of the theoretical study and the data analysis, a parameterization for slantwise convection was developed and implemented into gcm11. It was found that the scheme impacts significantly the simulated general circulation by the development of a direct meridional secondary circulation. The results of the 5-year simulations show that the scheme reduces SCAPE and SCAPE residual rs over the mid-latitudes, leading to a weakening of the thermal wind and the strength of the upper-level jets. The largest improvement in the simulated climate however lies in the reduced meridional transient eddy transports of heat and zonal momentum. With the inclusion of the scheme, the eddy transports agree much more favorably with the observational analysis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yau, M.

The study adopted a multi-perspective approach, interviewing and observing more than 140 individuals at all levels of the organization. It followed the evolution of four large units conducting 117 change initiatives. It was found that the success rate of modest-in-scope initiatives was high (around 85%) while the success rate of major initiatives was disappointing (around 20%). This thesis focuses on describing the organizational processes that led to such differential outcomes. The findings suggest that a proposed change initiative is subject to three organizational filters on its way to being adopted by the organization. Each filter represents a set of interrelated conditions that a proposed change initiative must meet as a prerequisite. To pass the emotion filter, a proposed change must be perceived by its potential adopters as congruent with the core values of the organization, that the change is construed not as detrimental to their personal welfare, and that the conduct of the change agents is compatible with the institutional values (legitimacy). To pass the cognition filter, there should be sufficient knowledge development and sharing for the realization of the proposed change. And finally, to pass the action filter, there should be requisite lateral coordination and persistence in action to institutionalize the change as a new organizational routine. It is also suggested that these three filters exhibit an order of saliency, or hierarchy, in their respective influence on the adoption of the change proposal by the organization. Second, fundamental changes in beliefs and values require creation and maintenance of an appropriate emotional context. Organizational behaviors that attend to emotions aroused by radical change are necessary to its realization. Finally, the findings of this research allow to offer prescriptions about the conduct of organizational change, especially changes related to work processes, and to challenge certain conventional beliefs about leadership of change.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mintzberg, Henry</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Westley, Frances</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dt725.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sx578</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Organizational change</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zj414"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>William Warham, patron of Erasmus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lewis, M. Heather (Muriel Heather)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>William Warham, Lord Chancellor of England (1504--1515) and Archbishop of Canterbury (1503--1532), was Desiderius Erasmus's most generous and consistent patron; in Erasmus's words a "sacred anchor" for him. The relationship between the two men connected with and contributed to a complex process of historical change. First of all, Warham and Erasmus were both associated with the paradigm shift which we now call the Northern Renaissance. Warham's academic background and his travels on the continent motivated him to support the study of Greek, new research in theology and the revival of classical learning. His money and political support acted as a force enabling Erasmus to get his New Testament work completed and published. Erasmus's New Testament research in turn facilitated the biblical scholarship of the Reformation and definitely motivated William Tyndale, among others. The reform which the collaboration of Warham and Erasmus helped to unleash was hence more radical than either had ever anticipated. Once religious reform started, neither man could control its pace although each made an effort to do so. The aim of this thesis is to show the significance of their relationship to the two individuals themselves, and also, more importantly, to analyze the dynamics of their collaboration and to demonstrate how and why it acted as a catalyst for religious change in England. Books have been written about More and Erasmus and Colet and Erasmus; the absence of a book about Warham and Erasmus has meant that the nature and significance of their relationship have not, as yet, been fully understood.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McLelland, J.

From the perspectives of mythology, iconography, and ritual, the analysis examines both the diachronic and synchronic dimensions of the images of the deity corresponding to the three-fold division of Hindu texts: (1) pan-Indian "mainstream" (Vedas, Epics, Puraṇas), (2) pan-Indian sectarian (Agamas), and (3) regional sectarian (hymns of the Al̲vars and Sri Vaiṣṇava Acaryas). Firstly, the study questions the structural interpretation of Hindu mythology by showing that there is no single unilinear history of the deity; rather, one can only speak of the various "histories" of Hayagriva. Secondly, the study reconstructs the particular "religious history" of Hayagriva as he appears in Sri Vaiṣṇavism, more specifically as the presiding deity in the Swami Hayagriva Temple at Tiruvahindrapuram. The reconstruction reflects the Sri Vaiṣṇava theological understanding of the five different forms the Supreme takes in five different locales (which I term as topotheism). In the process, the study demonstrates that (1) mythology is not simply an abstract historical process, but may be purposively adapted in the service of theology---as in the case of Sri Vaiṣṇavism, and (2) although the gods change according to sect, emblems and the function of the different images remain the same.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Young, Katherine K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cf993.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xb15s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hayagrīva (Hindu deity) -- Cult -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w649g"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The architecture of news : nineteenth century newspaper buildings in New York</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wallace, Aurora</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an investigation of the relationship between the mass media and urban space, which takes as its object of analysis the concentration of newspaper buildings on Park Row in New York in the second half of the nineteenth century.

This is strengthened by all antidepressants regardless of targeting these monoamines produce specific alterations in one or both of these systems after a prolonged administration. These alterations are congruent to their delayed onset of action in anxiety and affective disorders and may be of relevance. Using in vivo electrophysiological paradigms in the rat, the present research endeavor was undertaken to investigate whether antidepressant drugs inhibiting one monoaminergic reuptake transporter can induce an alteration in the other system. More specifically, impact of 5-HT and adrenergic receptors on the regulation of monoaminergic and hippocampal activity after acute and sustained antidepressant treatments was assessed. Long-term, but not subacute administrations of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) attenuate the spontaneous firing activity of locus coeruleus (LC) NA neurons. On the other hand, subacute and sustained treatment regimens with NA reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) induce a robust and sustained decrease on NA firing without altering that of 5-HT. Interestingly, sustained SSRI and NRI treatments both abolished 5-HT1A receptor augmentations of LC firing, but left inhibitory 5-HT2A receptor responses normal or slightly desensitized. The SSRI induced dampening on LC firing is reversed by 5-HT2A receptors blockade. Thus, an overactivation of 5-HT 2A receptors during chronic SSRI administration results from desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors in the presence of 5-HT transporter reuptake inhibition. Antagonism of 5-HT1A receptors attenuates LC NA firing, but is completely reversed by 5-HT2A receptors blockade. 5,7-DHT experiments indicate that these receptors in the LC are postsynaptic to 5-HT neurons, but the 5-HT1A effects are dependent on intact 5-HT neurons. This served as the impetus to a proposed neuronal circuitry detailing the mechanism by which these 5-HT receptors, and SSRI induce adaptations thereof, alter the NA system. This complex circuitry implicates other neurotransmitters being supported further by iontophoretic data demonstrating 5-HT1A receptor effects involve alterations in glutamate and 5-HT to mediate 5-HT2A receptor activation and regulate GABA release in the LC. Given the abovementioned results, it was striking that a subacute treatment with YM992 (SSRI and 5-HT2A antagonist) attenuated NA firing to a similar extent as reported with NRIs. This was concluded to be due to overactivation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors. In contrast to NRIs, a 21-day treatment with YM992 desensitized this receptor subtype and is responsible for normalization of LC firing. Reboxetine produces similar effects on 5-HT and NA neuron firing and reuptake blockade on CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus as the TCA desipramine. Unlike desipramine, reboxetine is able to alter 5-HT reuptake function and 5-HT2A receptors mediated responses by DOI after a prolonged administration and did not induce a sensitization of hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors. Thus, for the first time, experimental evidence supports that this latter effect is due to TCA structure and not NA reuptake blockade. These results are extrapolated to the beneficial and side effects produced by antidepressants with hopes of expanding upon the former while reducing the latter in the treatment of anxiety and affective disorders.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Blier, Pierre</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tb07b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139365d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axs55md53b"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hf, Sr, Nd and Pb isotope systematics and major and trace element compositions of the Archean subcratonic lithosphere beneath Somerset Island, Arctic Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Schmidberger, Stefanie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hf, Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes, and major, trace and rare earth elements (REE) were determined for a suite of peridotite and pyroxenite xenoliths, constituent garnet and clinopyroxene and the host Nikos kimberlite (100 Ma) from Somerset Island, in order to constrain the chemical and isotopic composition of the lithosphere beneath the northern Canadian craton. The refractory Nikos peridotites are characterized by high olivine forsterite contents (avg. Fo = 92.3) and depletions in incompatible major elements (Fe, Al, Ca), but are enriched in incompatible trace elements, such as large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE), while having approximately chondritic heavy rare earth element (HREE) contents. Mass balance calculations using REE contents of clinopyroxene and garnet indicate that calculated LREE abundances for the Nikos xenoliths are significantly lower (e.g. Nd ~50%) than those of the analyzed whole-rocks. These results suggest the presence of small amounts of a kimberlite-related LREE-rich interstitial component (i.e. ~1% kimberlite liquid and/or ~0.01% apatite) to account for the excess LREE abundances, with little effect on the HREE budgets of the xenoliths. The 143Nd/144Nd(0.1Ga) (0.51249--0.51276) isotopic compositions of the Nikos peridotites are little variable and overlap those of the Nikos kimberlite at the time of sample transport. The low-temperature peridotites (&lt;1100°C) that sample the shallow lithosphere are characterized by more radiogenic 176Hf/177Hf(0.1Ga) (0.28296--0.28419) and Pb (206Pb/204Pb (0.1Ga) = 17.82--19.03), but lower 87Sr/ 86Sr(0.1Ga) (0.7047--0.7066) isotopic ratios than those of the high-temperature peridotites (&gt;1100°C; 0.28265--0.28333; 17.18--18.30; 0.7064--0.7085, respectively). Incompatible trace element compositions of the xenoliths confirm this depth stratification indicating that shallow and deep (&gt;160 km) Somerset lithosphere are characterized by distinct chemical and isotopic characteristics. The Lu-Hf isotope compositions of the low-temperature peridotites plot along a 2.8 Ga reference isochron, which is consistent with an interpretation that the shallow Somerset lithosphere stabilized in the Archean to depth of ~150 km. The deep lithospheric mantle, which is probably younger, does not share the same petrogenetic history and may contain recycled material (altered oceanic crust and sedimentary component?). The Hf isotope compositions for the shallow low-temperature peridotites indicate that part of the lithosphere beneath the Canadian craton is characterized by more radiogenic Hf isotope signatures than estimates for "depleted" mantle.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Francis, Don</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j281c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55md53b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mineralogy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fq58k"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Immobilized enzymes as on-line probes in biochemistry and new drug discovery : biosynthesis of catecholamines</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Markoglou, Nektaria</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The use of immobilized enzymes has steadily increased in recent years. Based upon the advantages that immobilized enzymes possess over soluble enzymes, numerous applications have emerged in medical and analytical fields. This work demonstrates the applicability of a liquid chromatographic system based upon coupled on-line immobilized enzyme reactors (IMERs) to organic synthesis, biochemistry and pharmacology. It is envisioned that the model system will grow into a modular process where synthetic chemists can add or subtract the enzymes necessary for their particular synthetic goal. The system allows for on-line chromatographic purification and structural identification of products and could greatly reduce time required to discover new synthetic pathways. In addition, the construction of a coupled enzyme system provides a number of approaches to basic research into synthetic and metabolic pathways as well as a rapid method for the discovery of new pharmaceutical substances. A coupled system using extremely different enzymes with incompatible cofactors and reaction conditions has been constructed. The significance of the proposed project not only lies in the development of the liquid chromatographic on-line enzyme cascade but also in the biosynthetic pathway chosen for this study. The biosynthetic pathway involving dopamine beta-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase encompass the synthesis of the key transmitters, norepinephrine and epinephrine. The results demonstrate for the first time the immobilization of dopamine beta-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase. The IMERs are active and can be used in a liquid chromatographic format for qualitative and quantitative determinations. Studies with the IMER-HPLC systems have also shown that the activity of the immobilized enzymes reflects the non-immobilized enzymes. Thus, the IMER-HPLC system can be used to carry out standard Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetic studies and to quantitatively determine enzyme kinetic constants, identify specific enzyme inhibitors, provide information regarding the mode of inhibition and the inhibitor constants (Ki). The immobilized enzyme reactors used independently or as a combination will provide a unique opportunity to explore the interrelationships between these enzymes, to investigate the source of catecholamine-related disorders and to design new drug entities for identified clinical syndromes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wainer, Irving W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z0080.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq58k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Analytical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Pharmaceutical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apv63g191h"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Circadian patterns of breathing and thermoregulation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Seifert, Erin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Circadian rhythms, ~24-h oscillations in physiological variables, are pervasive throughout nature. Synchronization of these oscillations to the 24-h day enables organisms to take advantage of environmental cycles. In mammals, a circadian pacemaker located in the hypothalamus coordinates the overt rhythms. The present study investigates aspects of the 24-h organization of breathing, and its chemical control, and of thermoregulation in mammals. Pulmonary ventilation (V˙E), oxygen consumption ( V˙O2 ), body temperature (Tb), and locomotor activity were monitored by non-invasive means, in freely-moving male adult rats. Rats are nocturnal, and it is well known that their Tb, activity and metabolic rate are highest during the dark hours of the day. Hypoxia inhibits thermogenesis, and the Tb and V˙O2 circadian patterns are contributed to by changes in thermogenesis, implying that hypoxia blunts the daily oscillations of these variables. Indeed, the amplitude of both oscillations was smaller, due to a decrease in the dark phase values. Evidence supports an action of hypoxia on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory mechanisms, rather than on the clock itself. Metabolism is well known to be a major determinant of V˙E, and of the V˙E response to changes in inspired gases. Using a custom-designed system to monitor breathing continuously, during air breathing, V˙ E was found to oscillate, with higher values during the dark compared to the light hours of the day; these changes were almost in proportion to those of V˙O2 , and did not depend on those of activity. The depressant effect of hypoxia on the high values of the V˙O2 oscillation predict that the hypoxic V˙E response would be blunted at this time. Indeed, the response was lower during the dark compared to the light hours; however, the daily changes in the V˙E response were in proportion to those of V˙O2 , such that the hyperventilatory response (% increase in V˙ E/ V˙O2 ) was similar throughout the day. The V˙E/ V˙O2 response was also similar throughout the day in hypercapnia, even though the metabolic response to hypercapnia differed from that in hypoxia. Globally taken, these results indicate that (1) breathing and its control mechanisms accompany the daily oscillations of many physiological variables, and (2) the advantages of a biological clock do not compromise the adequacy of the hyperventilatory responses to chemical challenges.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mortola, J.

Prompted by recent findings that implicated the cholecystokinergic system in the pathophysiology of various illnesses, we developed a novel assay system to measure the various forms of cholecystokinin peptides in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The system detects CCK-4, sulfated CCK-8 (CCK-8s) and nonsulfated CCK-8 (CCK-8ns) with equal affinity, with the lower detection limit of 2.7 fmol and an ED50 of 10.6 +/- 2.2 fmol. Using the assay system, we determined that mean CCK-like immunoreactivity (CCK-LI) in the plasma of 12 healthy subjects was 12.9 +/- 2.1 pM CCK-4 equivalents. After developing the cholecystokinin assay system, we were able to combine our unique methodology with other established techniques to investigate the role of CCK in illnesses such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), anxiety, bulimia nervosa, and cardiomyopathy. Briefly, we observed no significant differences in plasma CCK levels between women with PMDD and healthy volunteers. However, we found that, independent of diagnosis, plasma cholecystokinin concentrations were higher in women during their first visit to the clinic to participate in the study, as compared to later visits. In addition, application of our assay system allowed us to determine that oral ingestion of caffeine increased plasma CCK-LI levels 2--4 fold in humans. Moreover, we observed substantial variation in post-caffeine cholecystokinin levels among individuals. In another study of cholecystokinin and anxiety, we used our CCK assay to determine the effects of ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist, on cholecystokinin levels in plasma. We found that multiple oral doses of ondansetron influence the pharmacokinetic parameters of exogenous CCK. We also used the three-step assay system to measure CCK-LI in patients with the eating disorder, bulimia nervosa. Baseline fasted cholecystokinin plasma levels were lower in bulimic women as compared to control subjects. However, at "satiety", or the post-binge stage, CCK levels in bulimic women were similar to those of control women. Finally, our investigation into the role of cholecystokinin in cardiomyopathy revealed that neuronal cholecystokinin receptor density was altered in the cardiomyopathic hamster brain, as compared to age- and sex-matched control animals.
