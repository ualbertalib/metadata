A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Fourteen rectangular reinforced concrete beams with the same dimensions and varying amounts of vertical stirrups were tested for ultimate shear strength. The beams were symmetrically loaded at the third points of a central span with a loaded overhang at each end to simulate the effects of continuity. A study of the cracking pattern, the deflected form of each beam and the stresses in the main and web reinforcements was made. The results were compared to both code requirements and theories presented by other investigators. As a result of this study it is shown that the strength of beams in shear can only be increased by shear reinforcement up to a limiting value. A modified hypothesis, as an explanation for the mechanism of shear failure, is presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Harris, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd376127n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wv08z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451n24d"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sphalerite and pyrrhotite geothermometry of the new calumet sulphide deposit</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Erdosh, George</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pyrrhotite and sphalerite deposition temperatures were determined in the ores of New Calumet Mine, Quebec. Forty-five pyrrhotite and fifty-two sphalerite determinations were made taken from various samples. Out of these, both geothermometers were used in 18 specimens. In most cases both values were reasonably close. Only four specimens showed greater difference for the two geothermometers than 56°C, the mean difference being 17°C. The temperature values for pyrrhotite range from 350° to 484°C, of that of sphalerite from 370° to 538°C. Using these values, isotherms were drawn throughout the orebodies based on the sphalerite data. The pyrrhotite values did not show any apparent systematic variation. The sphalerite isotherms coincide with the down-dip trend of the principal ore zones. No significant change in deposition temperatures is shown with depth. The thermal gradients are steepest laterally. "Hot spots" in the major ore zones may indicate channel-ways through which mineralizing solutions travelled.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clark, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430824x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451n24d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A76537461b"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The unity of Gulliver’s Travels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Embree, Donna.

The election was in many ways unique in that no issue of national interest was convincingly brought before the electorate. The electoral battle hinged therefore, not so much upon the subjects debated in Parliament and in the press but upon local, provincial, and regional considerations. The first four chapters investigate the background of the 1908 campaign, analyzing the position of the two political parties and examining the outstanding political issues of the years which immediately preceded the election.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooper, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386p17v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9677262</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dk245"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Danish - Scottish relations 1513-1542</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cooper, Stephen. D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The year 1513 saw two new monarchs ascend the thrones of their ancient kingdoms. In spite of the five hundred miles of ocean which separated them, the difference of age, and of experience, they were to find much in common between themselves and between their realms. James V, King of Scotland, was an infant of one year in his nursery among the bleak dark walls of a Scottish castle. Faction and jealousy surrounded this infant whose father, James IV, had been killed on the blood-soaked field of Flodden.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reid, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236588c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dk245</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613n211r"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The oceanography of Lancaster Sound</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Collin, Arthur. E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The oceanographic regime of Lancaster Sound displays characteristics of two distinct water masses. The upper layer is physically similar to that encountered in the Arctic Ocean and is typical of conditions recorded in M'Clure Strait and on the Arctic continental shelf. Below the depth of 200 metres, water characteristics are identical to those observed in Baffin Bay. Baffin Bay water intrudes into Lancaster Sound and is defined as far west as Prince Regent Inlet. Analyses, using two T-S techniques, are carried out to show that water of Baffin Bay characteristics occurs at all sampling positions below 250 metres in the eastern end of the Parry Channel and the equivalent thickness of this influx is of the order of 200-400 metres.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bird, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94ht29w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n211r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vm59h"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sorel and French radicalism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cieplak, Tadeusz. N.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The general state of Marxist thought at the turn of the century is examined as historical background against which to relate Sorel's theory of syndicalism. Basic premises of syndicalism are analyzed and compared with contemporary socialist interpretations of class struggle and social revolution. The comparison demonstrates a substantial disparity of approach to these two problems. Theoretical links between Sorel's views and principles of collective anarchism are discussed. Considerable similarity is found between Bakunin’s and Sorel's approaches to political solutions and Proudhon's and Sorel's views on moral issues.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Oliver, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qq78q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vm59h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afn107269d"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Angiotensin blood levels in man</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chretien, Michel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The problem of human arterial hypertension has been one of the most debated subjects in modern medicine. Many groups of investigators and clinicians have been interested in its etiology, its physiopathology and its treatment. The first suggestion that the kidneys might be responsible for this disease entity came from Richard Bright in 1836,and it was the result of a remarkable clinical acumen. In 1898, Tigerstedt and Bergman injected crude saline extract of rabbit kidney into anesthetized rabbits and observed a prolonged rise in blood pressure; they named this unknown pressor principle “rennin”.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Genest, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bs99g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107269d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Investigative Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88cm24r"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agriculture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Intestinal microflora associated with enteritis of early weaned pigs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chopra, Shivdarshan.

The term enteritis applies to any inflammatory condition of the small intestine, but is used frequently to refer to any pathological condition of the digestive tract. The phenomenon, which is the common sequel to different kinds of adverse stimuli is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the gastro-intestinal tract. Diarrhea which is a symptom, rather than a disease by itself, is a consequence of the inflammation of the alimentary tract brought about by any type of irritant of chemical, dietary, or microbial origin. Specific microorganisms are thought to be the cause of infectious types of diarrhea but the relationship is not completely understood.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dale, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d7724.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cm24r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural Bacteriology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
