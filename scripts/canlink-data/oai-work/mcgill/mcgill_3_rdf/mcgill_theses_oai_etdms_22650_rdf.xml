These anisotropies have been associated with differences in morphology (crystallinity) and orientation (shrinkage and birefringences) at various positions in the molding. They are reflected by anisotropies in tensile properties measured at different points or in different directions. However, no work has been reported to quantitatively relate the distributions in tensile properties. The present work represents an attempt to meet this challenge. Microstructure determination is achieved by making the following measurements on microtomed specimens at different positions in the polyethylene moldings: density, sonic speed, birefringence, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, dichroic ratio, and polarized light photomicrography. The above tests yield data relating to crystallinity and orientation functions for both the crystalline and amorphous phases. They also yield sufficient data to check the consistency of results obtained by the different techniques. Tensile properties are measured on microtomed samples obtained from the same regions tested for microstructure. Finally, the distributions of tensile and sonic moduli in the molding are estimated by employing some of the theoretical techniques proposed in the literature. The results show very good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data relating to the distributions of both sonic moduli and tensile moduli.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967457f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903087j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Injection molding of plastics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440t251"><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies toward the synthesis of 3,6-bis-(5-chloro-2-piperidyl)-2, 5-piperazinedione</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Moreland, Margaret</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The naturally occurring compound 3,6-bis-(5-chloro-2-piperidyl)-2,5-piperazinedione (1) is a promising new antitumor drug. The mechanisms of action of antitumor alkylating agents, particularly the nitrogen mustards and sesquiterpene lactones, suggest possible modes of antitumor activity of compound 1. A possible synthetic scheme for compound 1 is developed by consideration of methods of synthesis of piperidines, (alpha)-substituted-(alpha),(beta)-unsaturated esters, and (beta)-amino alcohols. A synthesis of (alpha)-chloro-(alpha),(beta)-unsaturated esters from carbonyl compounds and t-butyl (alpha)-chloro-(alpha)-trimethylsilyl acetate is developed. Oxyamination of the terminal double bond of t-butyl 2-chloro-2,6-heptadienoate occurs by epoxidation and reaction with an amine or azide ion and by osmium tetroxide catalyzed reaction with Chloramine-T. The piperidine ring is formed by an internal Michael raction of t-butyl 2-chloro-6-t-butyldimethylsilyloxy-7-tosylamino-2-heptenoate. The amino acid (1-tosyl-5-hydroxy-2-piperidyl) glycine is synthesized and found to be unstable to acidic esterification conditions. Strategies for overcoming the problems encountered in the synthesis are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741s600.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440t251</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cancer -- Chemotherapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemotherapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246s90n"><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The relationship between choline supply and acetylcholine synthesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>O'Regan, Seana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is concerned with the relationship between choline delivery and acetylcholine synthesis in the cat superior cervical ganglion. Increasing extracellular choline did not change the amount of acetylcholine either contained in or released by ganglia, except when choline levels were increased by 100-fold in plasma. In the latter case, most of the extra ACh formed was not releasable and may have accumulated as a result of decreased acetylcholine degradation rather than increased acetylcholine synthesis. Choline transport activity in stimulated ganglia can be monitored using choline analogues and this process was found to have similar, but not identical, characteristics as the high affinity choline transport described for synaptosomes. Under certain conditions, the uptake and acetylation of choline were dissociated and, therefore, choline transport alone does not determine the rate of acetylcholine synthesis. Choline transport is activated following a conditioning stimulus, and under these conditions choline uptake is closely related to acetylcholine synthesis. It is suggested that the relationship between choline uptake and acetylation changes with the functional state or history of cholinergic neurons.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b67r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246s90n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494939j"><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The contribution of fishes to phosphorus cycling in lakes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nakashima, Brian Shyozo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Several hypotheses concerning the role of fishes in influencing nutrient dynamics in freshwater ecosystems were examined in Lake Memphremagog (Quebec-Vermont). Phosphorus excretion by fishes provides a negligible amount (&lt; 0.33%) in comparison to the quantity taken up by the seston. The phosphorus pools present in the seston and fish community were approximately equal and both were twice the phosphorus content in the zooplankton. Part of this nutrient reservoir is released during the decomposition of fish carcasses. The potential is dependent upon post-spawning mortality rate, the fate of phosphorus in decomposing fish tissue, and the concentrations of allochthonous phosphorus entering the lake. Daily losses of epilimnetic phosphorus from the seston due to fish (up to 40%) and enhancement of nutrient excretion by zooplankton due to size-selective predation are important when open water fish populations are mainly planktivores. When benthic, detrital, or faculative consumers predominate, as in Lake Memphremagog, the effect of fishes on nutrient dynamics through foraging pressure is probably small.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b7038.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494939j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Phosphorus in animal nutrition</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r392b"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of a successful method for quantifying viable oral anaerobic spirochetes from pure culture and periodontal pockets</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Qiu, Yu-Shan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Spirochetes are markedly prevalent in periodontal disease but are not included as predominant cultivable organisms because of the inability to quantify them by viable count. A successful method was developed for enumerating viable oral spirochetes in pure culture as colony-forming units (CFU) in new oral spirochete (NOS) medium with 0.7% agarose and using small tissue-culture flasks. Three species of oral spirochetes in log-phase growth in NOS broth were used for evaluation of the method. Reliable, consistent and reproducible viable counts of pure spirochete cultures were obtained. This method was extended to enumerate viable oral spirochetes from periodontal pockets. The antibiotic rifampin (20 $ mu$g/ml) was found to be an excellent selective agent for such a count when added to NOS-agarose medium. Counts of cultivable oral spirochetes from 10 subgingival plaque samples ranged from 12.5% to 28.2% of the total cultivable anaerobic bacteria. In addition, by the use of this method thirteen new oral spirochetes were isolated. The viable count technique was modified and employed to study the locomotion of spirochetes. Migration of oral spirochetes out of NOS-Bacto agar medium into NOS-agarose medium was observed and two locomotory phenotypes of oral spirochetes were detected.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, Z.

Fish abundance and sizes were higher in the reserve than in surrounding non-reserve areas. Relative differences in abundance and size between reserve and non-reserve of different taxa were positively correlated to vulnerability to traps (the most common fishing method) but not to mobility of fish. Gradients of abundance across the reserve boundaries (decreasing abundance with distance from the reserve center) were apparent for total abundance but not for individual taxa.

(Gary Seymour)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Effects of variation in eutrophication and in Diadema antillarum densities (grazing pressure) on the abundance and life history characteristics of Favia fragum on seven reefs along the west coast of Barbados were investigated. Densities of D. antillarum were negatively correlated with eutrophication levels, and interpretations of their effects have been made simultaneously. Abundance of F. fragum was lower on more eutrophic reefs with lower D. antillarum densities. This may result from effects of eutrophication and of D. antillarum on algal cover on reefs. Macrophytic algae were more abundant, and crustose coralline algae less abundant, on eutrophic reefs with lower D. antillarum densities; and macrophytic algal cover was negatively correlated with crustose coralline algal cover across reefs. F. fragum abundance was positively correlated with crustose coralline algal cover, and F. fragum occurred less frequently on reef areas where macrophytic algae were abundant. High eutrophication and low D. antillarum density (grazing pressure) may therefore reduce F. fragum abundance by increasing the cover of macrophytic algae relative to crustose coralline algae on reefs. Neither planulation periodicity, colony fecundity, nor polyp fecundity in F. fragum differed at different eutrophication levels and D. antillarum densities. Moreover, adult growth and adult mortality did not differ with eutrophication levels and D. antillarum densities on reefs. However, growth of juveniles appeared slower and mortality higher on eutrophic reefs with low D. antillarum densities. Moreover, larvae of F. fragum preferred to settle on crustose coralline algae than on turf algae (macrophytic algae), and the former are comparatively scarce on eutrophic reefs with low D. antillarum densities. The results suggest that the negative correlation between adult abundance of F. fragum and eutrophication levels/grazing pressure (D. antillarum densities) on Barbados reefs are caused primarily by effects</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hunte, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074w00n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qs924</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eutrophication -- Barbados</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corals -- Barbados</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diadematidae -- Barbados</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wd605"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of O,P'-dicofol on two generations of American kestrels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacLellan, Kelly N.

First, a new method was developed that allows for quantification of H$ sp+$ consumption due to weathering and H$ sp+$ consumption due to cation exchange. Initial results yield mineral weathering rates that are well within the range of results obtained by other workers. This technique permits the analysis of multiple soil samples in a relatively short time, allowing for better quantification of spatial variability of mineral weathering within a soil ecosystem. Secondly, it was demonstrated that the acid simulation model generally underestimates soil chemistry values for pH, base cation saturation and soil solution base cations, and overestimates soil solution nitrate concentrations. Problems with obtaining accurate measurements of atmospheric dry deposition, a lack of data on cycling of nutrient elements and the absence of a sub-model to deal with the accumulation and mineralization of organic matter are reasons thought to explain the differences between model and field results.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendershot, W.

Rev mediates its effect, in part, through interaction with a cis-acting RNA target sequence, the Rev responsive element (RRE), located within the env region of the viral structural mRNAs. There exist transdominant Rev mutants that are capable of binding to the RRE yet are unable to carry out wild-type Rev function, strongly suggesting that cellular cofactors are involved in the Rev response. Towards the isolation of such factors and the elucidation of the mechanism of Rev action, we have developed a highly efficient, one-step, non-denaturing purification protocol for a recombinant form of Rev (H6Rev) and a transdominant mutant of Rev (H6AC4). These recombinant proteins contain six histidine residues at the N-terminus which enable their purification using nickel-affinity chromatography and which can also serve as a means to isolate Rev-host factor complexes reconstituted in vitro. Both purified proteins form stable complexes with the RRE in vitro while only H6Rev exhibits wild-type Rev function in vivo when exogenously introduced into mammalian cells, confirming that the purification strategy employed retains the biological activity of the proteins. To complement the in vitro reconstitution experiments, we have generated human lymphoid cell lines that express biologically active H6Rev in a tightly regulated, inducible fashion. These cell lines can serve as a source for the isolation of Rev-host factor complexes formed in the mammalian cell. Controlled expression of H6Rev is achieved using a tetracycline-modulated promoter. By varying the concentration of tetracycline in the medium, the activity of this promoter, and hence the level of H6Rev expression, can be modulated over a wide range of concentration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cochrane, Alan Walter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fm43k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s339f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wn63b"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Copper nutrition in first-litter gilts</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cao, Jiayin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of a low-Cu diet supplied to gilts during pregnancy and early lactation on dams and their offspring was obtained in seven pairs of first littermate gilts.

(1986). The primary advantage of using these models is that they are easily implemented on massively parallel computers and as a result are extremely fast. The first of these studies is of a model of phase separation in binary fluids. The growth laws of the fluid domains are examined and are shown to compare favourably to theoretical predictions of San Miguel et al. (1985). This appears to be a first verification of these results. The second study is of the critical behavior of a system of binary fluids. The model is shown to have a phase transition and the critical temperature is determined with an accuracy of 1%. Several critical exponents are also determined and evidence is provided that the model falls into the 2D Ising model universality class. A new model of fluid convection is also presented though no concrete results are yet available for this model.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Grant, Martin</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fh96k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rv38b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Fluid and Plasma</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wd61f"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nutritional analysis of foodmedicinal plants used by Haitian women to treat the symptoms anemia</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jean-Baptiste, Johanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ethnobotanical and dietary questionnaires were used to assess the utilization of plants to treat the signs and symptoms of anemia by women in La Chapelle, Haiti.

Lipase from Candida rugosa resolved methyl $ alpha$-substituted phenylacetates -5. These substrates were examined to understand the influence of steric and the electronic nature of the substituents at the chiral center on the enantioselectivity. Crude CRL was partially enantioselective towards substrates -3, and highly selective towards and, E $&gt;$ 100. Partial purification of crude CRL by 2-propanol extraction and separation by an ion exchange chromatography, dramatically improved the enantioselectivity towards -3, E $&gt;$ 100. One main lipase fraction, F$ sb{ rm C}$ was obtained with 58 fold purification and 62% yield. This improvement in enantioselectivity was achieved with a simple dialysis against deionized water or 50% 2-propanol extraction. Lauric acid (10 mM), partially reversed the increase in the enantioselectivity. The absolute configuration of the favored enantiomer for crude and partially purified lipase preparations, was S. Other lipases with opposite stereoselectivities were not identified. Based on literature and our results, it is believed that the size of the substituents at the stereogenic carbon center can account for the enantioselectivity of CRL catalyzed hydrolysis. The opposite configuration is not preferred when the electronic nature of the medium size substituent is varied. The rule can predict the selectivity data for partially purified CRL preparations. We believe that the accuracy of the rule can be improved if more examples of partially purified CRL reactions are examined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kazlauskas, R.

This research was aimed at understanding the cause of some of these differences. Survey questionnaires were sent to personnel managers in Norway (N = 195) and Quebec (N = 172). The personnel managers were asked to rate: (1) aspects related to their firms' organizational characteristics (business environment, strategy, and structure), and (2) the importance of different personality traits for applicants to managerial and professional positions. Consistent with earlier research (Rynes &amp; Gerhart, 1990) the results indicate that preferences for different applicant attributes represent shared perceptions due to common organizational membership. These preferences are to some degree related to company strategy, organizational structure and national culture. In general, it was found that personnel managers currently seek candidates who can adapt to change and generate new ideas. The results are discussed in light of theories from industrial/organizational and cross-cultural psychology, and suggestions for further research are offered.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Koestner, Richard</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f6620.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c1408</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corporate culture -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Personnel directors -- Norway -- Attitudes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Personnel directors -- Québec (Province) -- Attitudes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Employee selection -- Norway</dc:subject><dc:subject>Employee selection -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corporate culture -- Norway</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720d665"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of prolonged exercise on running economy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Xu, Fan, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of prolonged exercise on running economy. Fourteen male long distance runners performed two 90 minute runs on an outdoor 400m track at velocities equal to 65 and 80% of VO$ sb2$max. Prior to and following each 90 minute run, running economy (RE) was measured as the steady-state VO$ sb2$ during treadmill runs at speeds of 188 and 228 m/min. During the 90-min run at 65% of VO$ sb2$max, the mean weight loss was 1.3 kg. The HR was 143 bpm between minutes 5-10 and increased to 150 bpm between minutes 85-90. During the 90-min run at 80% of VO$ sb2$max, the mean weight loss was 1.4 kg. The HR was 161 bpm between minutes 5-10 and increased to 165 bpm between minutes 85-90. When the post RE test was conducted following each 90-min run, there was a significant increase in VO$ sb2$ expressed in both l/min and ml/kg$ cdot$min (a decrease in running economy). The increase in oxygen cost of running following the 90-min run at 80% of VO$ sb2$max was greater than that following the run at 65% of VO$ sb2$max.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Montgomery, David L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv451.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720d665</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Running -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oxygen -- Physiological transport</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75dd28g"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Ikhwān of Saudi Arabia : past and present</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zamiska, Donna L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis looks at the Ikhwan movement from an historical point of view and focuses on going back to the roots of the movement which is tied to the religious revivalism initiated by Muhammad al-Wahhab in the late 1700s. The religious doctrine which evolved from this religious revival movement condoned and legitimized both the formation of modern Saudi Arabia under the rule of the al-Saud family and the Ikhwan. Hence, Wahhabism is the underlying theme to three historical events: the first Wahhabi movement of the 1700s, the Ikhwan under Ibn Saud and the Neo-Ikhwan under al-Utaybi. All of these events should be regarded as one movement, where Wahhabism provides the link or key to understanding the Ikhwan not only as a political/military organization but as a religious movement as well.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Adams, Charles J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kr36s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dd28g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ikhwān movement</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zb926"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Transformation movements in Spain and Brazil : the democratization of Spanish and Brazilian civil society</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>O'Connell, Timothy S.

This thesis distinguishes itself from these earlier works by bracketing discussion concerning the elite-level political transitions that occured in order to concentrate on the democratization and socialization of the Spanish and Brazilian societies. The work focuses on a number of collective organizations that emerge during these transitions, and will postulate an argument as to why they should be referred to as "transformation movements". Two important questions that the thesis addresses while examining these cases are: "why do these movements emerge under authoritarian regimes," and "what is it about transformation movements that merits some type of differentiation from other types of collective action?". The significance of these questions to the understanding of "transformation movements", and the role of these movements in the transitions that occured in Spain and Brazil, unfolds in the work that follows.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Meadwell, Hudson</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mw122.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zb926</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Democracy -- Brazil</dc:subject><dc:subject>Democracy -- Spain</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214q005"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ger</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Die Arbeitsweise Ödön von Horváths am Beispiel der &lt;Geschichten aus dem Wiener Wald&gt;</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mueller, Ruediger H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>By taking into account various published fragments, concepts and the final 'Volksstuck' this thesis attempts to show how the playwright Odon von Horvath developed the characters of his commercially successful 'Volksstuck' "Tales From The Vienna Woods".

They did this because they were convinced that the aesthetic dimension of their work resided in the structure of the work. More specifically, the artists of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance believed that the particular aesthetic experience which geometric compositional structure provides corresponded to Christian mystical experience. Thus a work of art that combined geometric structure, naturalistic style, and Christian imagery could provide an experience analogous to that of Christian revelation. This paper traces the development of this idea from its origin in the Old Testament tradition, its formalization in Greek thought and its full flowering in early Christian painting.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McLelland, J.

It is proposed that there are actually two tough constructions, each derived by a different kind of movement. Three kinds of data which support the claim made here are presented: tough constructions with scrambling, tough constructions with reflexives, and nominals derived from tough constructions. It is argued that non-movement analysis is not appropriate and that both tough constructions are derived by movement. It is shown that tough constructions with a 'tend to' reading can also be accommodated by this analysis. The analysis accounts for a wide range of interactions between tough constructions and other phenomena, which have not been previously focused on in the literature.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baker, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67js03v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xg02q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Japanese language -- Syntax</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w824r"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Banking on the edge : towards an open ended interpretation of informal finance in the Third World</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fischer, Andrew Martin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis proposes an original framework for the analysis of third world informal finance. It will be supported by a comprehensive survey of the associated literature. Specifically, most mainstream interpretations of informal finance adhere to a dualist paradigm that revolves around three key assumptions. First that informal firms are less efficient than formal firms in conducting financial transactions, second that their activities are protected from formal competition due to segmented financial markets, and finally that the economic impact of informal finance is inferior to an overall formal system. Yet much of the qualitative evidence of informal finance contradict these assumptions and limit the validity of dualist interpretations. The dualist conclusion that informal finance is a transitory phenomenon can therefore be derailed, leaving room for a more open ended interpretation of contemporary financial informality.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Naylor, R.
