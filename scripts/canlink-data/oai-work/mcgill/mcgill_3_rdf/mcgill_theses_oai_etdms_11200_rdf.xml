In this experiment, an in vitro study was performed to determine if bile from human diseased gall bladders would activate canine trypsinogen. The influence of Calcium, E. coli, Strep. fecalis and trypsin inhibitor substance was also partially studied. The determinations for trypsin were made using the synthetic substrate Benzyol-L-Arginine ethyl ester. From this study, it was concluded that bile from human diseased gall bladders or human bile obtained from T-tubes following common bile duct explorations would not activate canine trypsinogen. Calcium was found to be of great importance in determining the amount of trypsin formed. With the addition of excess calcium to the pancreatic juice, the presence of trypsin inhibitor in canine pancreatic juice did not prevent the measurement of 95% of the total trypsinogen present. The addition of E. coli or Strep. fecalis to bile did not activate canine trypsinogen. A review of the literature with respect to pancreatitis and the "Common Channel Theory" is included.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thompson, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623g66b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xh923</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816q629"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Application of a new micro-method of measurement of plasma renin and angiotensinogen in rats to the study of various physiological conditions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Menard, Joel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Les mesures de la concentration rénale de la rénine et de l'index de granularité des cellules juxta-glomérulaires effectuées chez le rat ont constitué un apport fondamental pour la compréhension du rôle physiologique et physiopathologique du système rénine-angiotensine.

In each, animals acted as their own control. Series I animals had the procedure of autotransplantation performed. Series II and III had operative procedures which duplicated a portion of the trauma inflicted on a bowel undergoing autotransplantation, i.e., interruption of nerves, lymphatics, and ischemia. Thus, attempting to qualitate the changes due to autotransplantation, animals were also divided into groups prefed an elemental diet and others fed standard kennel rations. Animals were studied pre and postoperatively by numerous tests to assess the changes produced. The study suggests that the marked changes seen histologically are due to a combination of denervation with the super-imposed insult of ischemia. The cell’s metabolic functions are not altered significantly by the procedures performed. Elemental diet does not appear to provide protection to the bowel against this mechanical type of insult.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hinchey, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128f19p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75rc127</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hg28n"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Lung mechanics and blood gases during anaesthesia</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Louzada, Ney</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous studies have shown that lung mechanics and blood gas exchange may be impaired during anaesthesia.

Lung mechanics and blood Bases were studied throughout the course of anaesthesia in 30 patients undergoing cerebral angiography, starting before premedication and continuing into the recovery period, each subject acting as his mm control. Pre-medication (0.015 mg/kg atropine) did not affect Cdyn (1), Qs/Qt and A-aDO2. Induction of anaesthesia resulted in a significant fall in Cdyn (1), but no alteration in Qs/Qt or A-aDO2 at comparable FIO2 levels. There were no further changes up to 96 minutes after induction. Cdyn (1) returned ta preoperative values during the recovery period, and Qs/Qt and A-aDO2 remained unaffected. The fall in Cdyn (1) was believed to be due to closure of some units with a shift of blood away from these regions and/or to an alteration of surface forces without closure of units.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Becklake, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fm33x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hg28n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bf86p"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Breath sounds and distribution of pulmonary ventilation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Leblanc, Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A phonocardiograph and microphone fixed on the chest wall, have been used to record normal breath sounds at controlled lung volumes and flow rates in different lung zones and body positions.

Under these conditions, both preparations displayed similar capacities to metabolize cholesterol-4-14C. Prefreezing the tissues increased the cleavage activity in both PIM and bisects. Under these conditions the hydroxylation of progesterone-4-14C at C-11 decreased markedly in PIM. Collection of PIM in absence of oxygen decreased its capacity to utilize both substrates.

The effects of the following factors were studied: 1) Injection of Paraffin Oil (0.1 cc). 2) Blood transfusion from convalescent rats of A.P. 3) Splenectomy performed three weeks prior to induction of Adjuvant Polyarthritis. Experimental Polyarthritis was produced in female rats of Sprague- Dawley strain in the control group, by a single intradermal injection (0.1 cc) of Freund's Adjuvant into the tail; all animals developed the typical lesion of peripheral joints of the extremities, beginning from the second week and persisting to more than three months in 30%. Injection paraffin oil produced a 75-80% decrease in the incidence of A.P. when injected three weeks or three months prior to induction of A.P. Paraffin injection ID into the back was less effective. Transfusion of convalescent blood from animals suffering from A.P. produced a 70% decrease in the incidence. The most effective means of influencing A.P. was splenectomy (90% decrease in incidence). The severity of lesions (graded from 1-20) was also markedly effected, being 2.5 and 0.6 respectively, in the paraffin group: 1.2 in the convalescent blood transfusion group and 0.6 in the splenectomy group. It was concluded that various immunological mechanisms are capable of modifying the course and scoring of Adjuvant Polyarthritis in rats; the various theoretical considerations are given.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Laurin, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580q84d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d5700838</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s161937h"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Some aspects of carbohydrate metabolism following metal ions liver perfusion</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kalinowski, Janusz</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of strontium and calcium perfusion on liver glycogenesis and blood glucose levels was studied.

Glycogen was estimated by anthrone method, blood glucose by autoanalyser, and urine glucose by Tes-Tape. Elevation of liver glycogen content was found in 250 uM Sr group (Anthrone method), larger amount of PA-Shiff positive granules in 500 uM Sr. group when compared with controls. Statistically significant increase of incorporation of radioglucose into liver glycogen was detected in radioassay. Blood glucose was significantly elevated and urine contained 0.1 % or more of glucose in the 500uM Sr group. Decrease in the glycogen level was found in the 500uM Ca group, detectable by all methods, while 250uM Ca group was comparable with control in all aspects investigated. It is concluded that strontium perfusion at the dosage stated increases significantly blood glucose level.

In the present work the midbrain reticular projection to CM was studied in the cat by means of unit and evoked pot entail analysis using a computer of average transients. Most CM units which responded to stimulation of the midbrain RF exhibited a pattern of early activation-inhibition and sometimes later activation. Units which were also tested with peripheral stimulation showed a similar response. The convergence of impulses from peripheral and midbrain stimulation is demonstrated by facilitation and occlusion of the slow wave response evoked in CM.

The writer has shown that this" formation is composite, and has separated.on.the map gr.anitized sedimentary rocks from granites.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jolliffe, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wt643.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/000003203</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xm762"><ual:graduationDate>1947</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the chick assay for vitamin D and some observations on chemical methods for its determination</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Campbell, James Alexander</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Knowledge o£ the importance or a nutritional factor in the etiology of rickets may be said to date from the pioneer work of Mellanby in 1919. The therapeutic value of fish oils tor rickets. although recognized for centuries~ was shown to be due to a factor quite distinct from vitamin A. The exact identity of the factor. however~ was obscured for some time when it was found that sunlight and ultraviolet irradiation also had curative effects. In 1926 accidental discovery of the role of cholesterol and related sterols made it possible to conclude that sunlight and cod liver oil cure rickets because sunlight produces in the skin the sarne (or a similar) vitamin which cod liver oil provides ready made.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McFarlane, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pw97j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xm762</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cp01b"><ual:graduationDate>1947</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of World War II upon the financial position of Canadian corporate industry</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bush, Willard Schryer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A period of devastating war has ended.

The high-speed fixed-pitch airscrew incorporates the most recent aerodynamic theory and is manufactured from fibre-glass reinforced epoxy resin. To compete with conventional prime movers high efficiency, low cost and long life are maintained by the use of standard industrial and automotive transmission components. The strength of the blades and supporting structure has been confirmed by structural proof tests. Field tests, in which the windmill was connected to a standard deep-well turbine pump for sprinkler irrigation, have been made to determine the aerodynamic integrity of the airscrew design. The detailed performance characteristics obtained over an extended operating range provide a guide for wind pumping performance prediction purposes in water resource development programmes in the Caribbean and elsewhere.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Broughton, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x4496.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sg75f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afq977z15d"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ionic fluxes in gastric pouches</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chambers, Robert T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neutral and acidic fluid instillation tests were carried in dog denervated corpus gastric pouches with and without topical treatment of the pouches by saline or urea solutions to delineate the ionic fluxes involved with gastric mucosal competence and acidity regulation. Results showed a bidirectional chloride ion flux. The flux of chloride from lumen to mucosa was independent of the type of cation but seemed to be constant for the luminal concentration of chloride. Treatment with four molar urea solution results in the loss of the ability, of the pouch to contain an acid solution, the gastric mucosal competence. Weaker urea solution treatments result in only an influx of sodium chloride containing fluid into the pouch. The exact mechanism of gastric mucosal competence and acidity regulation could not be delineated but a probable mechanism is suggested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wlodek, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd473059z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977z15d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
