However, the clogging phenomenon can be an advantage for certain purposes, such as the creation of near-watertight membranes for sealing manure holding tanks. The conceived advantages of non-woven needle-punctured geotextiles are that they are less expensive due to lower material quantity, they are more resistant to tensile stresses compared to impermeable plastics and concrete, and they are easily installed. This thesis describes experimental work on the permeability and clogging characteristics of a Non-woven Polyester Geotextile with three different porosities (13.4, 19.5 and 26.0mum) but the same hydraulic conductivity (Kw = 10-5 m/s), when subjected to different heads of cattle slurry at 1, 2 and 4% total solids (TS) concentrations. The resulting infiltration rates were used to establish the effect of geotextile pore size and manure TS on geotextile sealing and to find the location of the seal, whether at the surface or within the geotextile. After 100 days of experimentation, the lowest infiltration rate of 1.1 L/m2/d was reached with the 13.4mum geotextile. Manure TS had a significant effect on the sealing and at least 4% TS was required to minimize the geotextile's infiltration rate. Clogging occurred within the pores, suggesting that the seal remains even after removing the manure. This advantage can be translated into economic benefit when fun cost comparisons with sealing liners such as geomembranes and concrete are undertaken. This research also reviews and analyzes the physical, chemical and biological processes leading to clogging of geotextiles as well as a cost-benefit comparison with the other sealing materials. The analysis concludes that clogged geotextiles are a wise choice for Canadian livestock producers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barrington, S.

First, we have expressed and purified histidine-tagged wildtype (wt) and mutant RTs by metal chelate affinity chromatography. The purification of wt RT and RTs containing the mutations M184V, M1841, E89G and E89G/M184V, by the method of Le Grice and Gruninger-Leitch (1990), will be discussed in Chapter 2. These enzymes were produced to evaluate the effects of these mutations on fidelity and processivity in vitro. Second, we have cultured wt and M184V-containing HIV-1 in the presence of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, targeted to the V3 loop in gp120, and monitored for the emergence of neutralization escape variants. Although both cultures generated escape variants, sequence analysis revealed different neutralization escape mutations in wt and M184V-containing HIV-1. In the V3 loop cloned from wt cultures, the substitution of Lys for Arg at amino acid 20 (R20K) was associated with escape. In contrast, in M184V-containing cultures, the substitution of Tyr for Asn at amino acid 5 (N5Y) was associated with escape. The appearance of different neutralization escape mutations, encoded by different nucleotide substitutions, in wt and M184V-containing HIV-1 cultured under identical selection conditions is intriguing. We find the generation of an alternate escape variant by M184V-containing HIV-1 evidence that the mutational bias may be altered in this virus.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wainberg, Mark A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386m58p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w197x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c2820"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of intravenous anaesthetics on formalin-induced FOs immunoreactivity in the rat spinal cord</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gilron, Ian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The study of neuroplasticity following noxious stimulation has reinforced the clinical concept of pre-emptive analgesia, i.e. perioperative analgesic strategies aimed at diminishing post-operative pain. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the suppression of noxious stimulus-induced spinal sensitization by intravenous anaesthetics using FOS-like immunoreactivity (FLI) as an indicator of spinal sensitization in the rat formalin model. Pre-formalin injection (1.5% SC) treatment groups (3--4 rats/group) included IV saline controls, an IV anaesthetic (pentobarbital 20 mg/kg [barbiturate], propofol 10 mg/kc, [GABAergic anaesthetic], alphaxalone 1.5 mg/kg [steroid anaesthetic] or ketamine 10 mg/kg [dissociative anaesthetic]) and, for comparison, high-dose alfentanil 170mug/kg [synthetic mu-opioid]. Following perfusion 2 h post-formalin, spinal cords were dissected, sliced at 30 gm and processed by immunoperoxidase staining with an antibody against the FOS protein. Quantification and determination of the laminar distribution of FOS labeled nuclei were performed at the L4/5 spinal level ipsilateral to formalin injection. Drug groups demonstrating FLI suppression were comparatively studied in a 5 min post-formalin treatment group.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811km871.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c2820</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811km889"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Dexamethasone Suppression Test and 24 hour cortisol profile in depressive, hypomanic and euthymic phases of bipolar patients</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gelber, Stephen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The investigation of neuroendocrine abnormalities have been an active area of research in biological psychiatry. Nevertheless, there has been little prospective research on the Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST) and 24 hour cortisol profile in Bipolar patients. These tests are measures of cortisol and the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis which are indirect indications of abnormal limbic: system activity. The present study examined 24-hour cortisol levels and DST responses in 18 bipolar patients (6 depressed, 5 hypomanic and 7 euthymic) and 5 age and sex matched controls. In addition, two patients were examined in depressed, hypomanic, and euthymic states and served as their own control. The population studied consisted of outpatients between 25 to 62 years of age who were diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder following DSM-IV criteria. In the group study, bipolar patients in all phases exhibited substantially higher cortisol levels than age and sex matched controls. Higher cortisol levels in the hypomanic state have been observed when bipolar patients served as their own control. In addition, the DST did not appear to be highly sensitive or specific in bipolar patients and was not associated with 24 hour cortisol levels or severity of symptoms. The results demonstrate that HPA disturbances occur in all phases of bipolar disorder, not only during depressed states. These findings bring us closer to understanding the neuroendocrine pathophysiology occurring in bipolar disorder.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462761r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km889</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Psychobiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hm36b"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Androgen receptor mutation in breast cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Elhaji, Youssef A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Normal breast growth and development depends on functional androgen:estrogen (A:E) balance. Androgen actions are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), a DNA-binding, transcriptional-regulatory protein. Decreased AR transactivational. activity lowers A:E balance and may result in functional hyperestrogenicity: this could promote the pathogenesis of breast cancer (BC). The present study is the first to seek AR mutations in female BC. The length of the polymorphic CAG-repeat in exon 1 of the AR correlates inversely with the transactivational activity of the AR. Using 10% polyacrylamide gels, I found a significant (p &lt; 0.0001) shift to greater CAG-repeat lengths in BC samples. This suggests a role for ARs with long polyglutamine tracts in the initiation and/or progression of BC. Exons 2--8 of the AR in 81 fresh frozen BC tumor tissues were screened for mutations using SSCP analysis. I did not detect any mutations in these exons.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zz752.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hm36b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Breast -- Cancer</dc:subject><dc:subject>Androgens -- Receptors</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abr86b551r"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of shear on the triplet state decay of chromophores in synthetic polymers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dracopoulos, John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is proposed that the viscosity dependence of the triplet lifetimes of aromatic chromophores arises from local diffusional-type motions around the chromophore. In an attempt to ascertain if motions of this type are indeed responsible for triplet quenching, the phosphorescence decay of carbazole covalently bound to a methyl acrylate (90%) methyl methacrylate (10%) copolymer backbone, with a glass transition temperature of 19°C, was studied as a function of temperature. The phosphorescence decay was non-exponential but well defined using a bi-exponential fit. It showed the greatest drop in intensity and lifetime centered around the glass transition temperature. Mechanical shear was exerted on the polymer with varying force, frequency and temperature, so as to induce motional perturbations on the carbazole. Frequencies matching the approximate timescale of the polymer motions, and temperatures slightly above the glass transition, showed the greatest effects of perturbation. Under optimal shearing conditions, relative increases in the short-lived component of the decay of up to 22% were observed, while the long lifetime dropped by 5%.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kq285.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b551r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Physical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wf99k"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Quadriceps muscle endurance, fatigue and recovery in rowers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Di Spirito, Michele</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Quadriceps, muscle endurance, fatigue and recovery were evaluated in elite and novice rowers in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development and recovery from fatigue following several bouts of exercise. Baseline evaluations recorded the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) using a force transducer, muscle activation via the Interpolated Twitch Technique (ITT) and the compound muscle action potential (m-wave) from the electromyographic (EMG) signal. Contractile properties of the twitch, which included the peak tension (Pt), time to peak tension (TPT) and half-relaxation time (RT 1/2), were also recorded. The rowers then completed a 2500 meter simulated rowing race and the muscle was re-evaluated. Two successive standard fatigue protocols (SFP) followed with subsequent evaluations taking place after each SFP. The successive bouts of exercise caused the MVC to drop considerably. Results revealed that excitation-contraction (E-C) uncoupling was the major factor behind the development of fatigue in both groups due to the differential effects of fatigue and recovery on Pt versus MVC. Activation levels dropped minimally and m-wave amplitudes were unchanged from pre-fatigue levels. Elite rowers' quadriceps muscles demonstrated superior endurance during both SFPs, but to a lesser extent following the second SFP. These results suggest that possible metabolic differences in the environment of the muscle may lead to increased resistance to local muscle fatigue in elite rowers. This research study contributes to the current understanding of neuromuscular fatigue and adds to the physiological profile of athletes who participate in the sport of rowing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gn12d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wf99k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Recreation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pc718"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Novel androgen receptor-protein interactions as possible contributors to the pathogenesis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Tourreil, Sunita</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The human androgen receptor (hAR) is a ligand-activated, DNA-binding nuclear transcription factor. Mutations in the hAR result in varying degrees of androgen insensitivity (AI); they may play a predisposing or pathogenetic role in both prostate and breast cancer. Expansion of the hAR's N-terminal polymorphic Glutamine (Gln) repeat causes a late-onset progressive motoneuronopathy which is associated with mild androgen insensitivity: spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). SBMA belongs to a group of translated CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion neuronopathies that includes Huntington disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and five distinct spinocerebellar ataxias. The fact that this group of disorders is caused by polyGln expansions in totally unrelated proteins, is one of the main reasons for postulating that a common gain-of-function mechanism must underlie their communal pathogenesis. This common pathogenetic mechanism is postulated to occur via aberrant protein interactions. I undertook a search for hAR-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. A human testes cDNA library was screened several times with two forms of an N-terminal fragment of the hAR: a normal (20 Gin) hAR and an expanded (50 Gin) hAR. A few candidate hAR-interacting proteins were isolated during the library screenings and I tested them for physiological relevance. A second aspect of my project included the analysis of an aberrant 75-kD protein fragment generated in COS-1 cells transfected with a polyCAG-expanded (n = 44) hAR cDNA. Recent work in Huntington disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 shows the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates primarily in the nucleus of certain brain cells (Davies et al., 1997; Scherzinger et al., 1997; Paulson et al., 1997). I confirmed the presence of the aberrant hAR-fragment in the nucleus through western analysis of protein samples extracted from the nucleus.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bd856.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pc718</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Muscular atrophy -- Pathogenesis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Androgens -- Receptors</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rq92v"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of smoking cessation on changes in dietary intake</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Crawford, Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Smoking cessation leads to weight gain but the reason for this gain is not clearly established.

Egg measurements varied more between subspecies of E. calcarata than between E. calcarata and E. coriacea; the mtDNA sequence equally showed higher intraspecific differences between E. calcarata subspecies than within E. horrida populations. Morphological and genetic data showed that E. horrida and E. calcarata are very closely related. Morphometric ratios between the two species were not significantly different, although there was a variance close to 6.2 percent in the mtDNA sequencing results.

Indomethacin (INDO), at a dose level of approximately 10 mg/kg, has been commonly used in studies on the role of prostagiandins (PG) in the porcine ovulatory process since it was believed to be specific in its inhibition of the COX pathway. Other evidence suggests that INDO also has inhibitory effects on the formation of LOX metabolites including 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE). There is also evidence that LOX metabolites may have a role in the ovulatory process of the rat and the pig. In the previous studies on PGs in porcine ovulation, the effect of INDO on LOX metabolites was not examined. It has been shown that progesterone has a role in the formation of eicosanoids in the ovary in the rat and the ewe. The results of this study indicate that an intramuscular injection of INDO, at dose levels as high as 5 mg/kg, reduces ovulation rat and preovulatory follicular fluid concentrations of PGF2alpha without affecting concentrations of 12- and 15-HETE in the gonadotropin-primed pig. Indomethacin, at dose levels as low as 1 mg/kg, reduced ovulation rate and intrafollicular PGF2alpha concentrations but 0.1 mg/kg had no effect on ovulation rate or PGF2alpha. In cultured granulosa and theca interna cells, 10 ng or greater of INDO per 3 x 105 cells reduces PGF2alpha accumulation in the media. Accumulation of 12- and 15-BETE in the media was reduced by 100 ng or greater of INDO per 3 x 10 5 cells. To examine the role of progesterone in the formation of eicosanoids, danazol, an inhibitor of steroidogenesis, was added to cultures of porcine follicular cells. This treatment had no effect on progesterone production by either cell type and, similarly, had no effect on eicosanoid production.

The technical mixture of toxaphene contains over 800 different congeners; however, the numbers decrease along the food chain. Only two major congeners, 2-exo, 3-endo, 5-exo, 6-endo,8,8,9,10,10-octachlorobomane (T2) and 2-exo, 3-endo, 5-exo, 6-endo,8,8,9,10,10-nonachlorobomane (T12) have been found in humans. Information on the embryotoxicity of toxaphene is based only on studies using the toxaphene technical mixture and not its major congeners. Diabetes mellitus, one of the most common maternal illness resulting in congenital defects, is now on an upgrowth trend in many native communities. Xenobiotics, such as toxaphene, may induce interactive effects with hyperglycemia, a teratogenic metabolic agent. In the present study, the relative dysmorphogenic effects of the toxaphene technical mixture or its congeners (T2 and T12) and the interactive effects of these compounds and high glucose concentrations were investigated using rat embryo culture. Early stage embryos (0--2 somite) were treated with three different doses of the toxaphene technical mixture, T2, T12, or 50:50 mixture of T2 and T12 and incubated in normal or hyperglycemic culture media for 48 h.

From 1994 to 1996, N20 emissions were determined under continuous corn and corn-legume rotations in different soils of Quebec. Continuous corn was studied on four sites, two from a long-term experiment, a Ste. Rosalie heavy clay (Humic Gleysol) and a Chicot sandy loam (Gray-Brown Luvisol), at 0, 170,285 and 400 kg N ha-1, and two from a corn rotation study, a Ste. Rosalie clay (Humic Gleysol) and an Ormstown silty clay loam (Humic Gleysol). Treatments in the rotation study included no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT), monocropped corn, monocropped soybean-, corn-soybean; and soybean-corn-alfalfa phased rotations. Nitrogen rates of 0, 90, and 180 kg N ha-1 for corn and 0, 20, and 40 kg N ha-1 for monocropped soybean were used, and soybean/alfalfa with no fertilizer N following corn. Rates of N2O emissions were significantly affected by N fertilization, tillage and soil moisture content. Generally, N2O emissions were higher in the NT systems, with corn, and increased with increasing N rates. Increased nitrogen applications led to linear increases in N2O emission over the three years for both Ste. Rosalie (2) and Ormstown soils at a rate of 1.0 to 1.6 percent of added N. The N 2O emission rates were significantly related to soil denitrification rates, water filled pore space, and soil NH4+ and NO3-- concentrations in all three years. A corn system using conventional tillage, legumes in rotation and reduced N fertilizer would decrease N2O emission from agricultural fields.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mackenzie, A.

The insect fauna of four types of alvars (grassland, grassland savanna, shrubland and pavement) was sampled in the summer of 1996 on Manitoulin Island, Ontario. A total of 9791 specimens from four target insect groups (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Homoptera: Auchenorrhyncha, Hymenoptera: Symphyta and Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea) was identified. Results showed that the grassland savanna and grassland alvars supported the highest number of insect specimens whereas the pavement alvar supported the highest number of species. The origin of the fauna differed between the taxa depending on their closer association with specific microclimatic conditions (Carabidae) or on the presence of host plants (Auchenorrhynca).

Six colonies were used, four located on open islets and two on forested islands. Three experimental treatments were used that entailed varying the frequency and time occurrence of visits in incubation. Every years, each treatment was applied to several eider colonies differing in the density of nesting gulls on the same island. During visits, incubating females were flushed and nest fate recorded. Several variables also were measured during visits describing female quality (assessed by clutch size and laying date) and nest site quality (assessed by nest concealment, distance to shore, vegetation height, and density of nesting gulls on the island). Results showed that frequency of visits did not affect nesting success of eiders, mainly because most observed nest failures occurred after the first visit The time occurrence of the first visit during incubation was of primary importance; eider nests visited early were much more affected by our presence. The nesting success of eiders was related to the density of associated colonies of nesting gulls only when visits occurred during early incubation. Female eiders of greater reproductive quality were those most successful when disturbed regularly. These females were in greater proportion on islands associated with lower density of nesting gulls, i.e., on forested islands rather than on open islets. Within colonies, they were mainly found nesting near shore where nest concealment is sparse. Results showed that visits to eider colonies can greatly affect their reproductive output. Visits during early incubation on open islets had the greatest impact.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guillemette, Magella</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Titman, Rodger D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408032x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns064799v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eider -- Québec (Province) -- Mingan Islands -- Reproduction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Eider -- Nests -- Québec (Province) -- Mingan Islands</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj236424m"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of salt stress on phosphorus and sodium absorptions by soybean plants</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Attumi, Al-Arbe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The radiotracer methodology was combined with the Hoagland solution culture of growing soybean in a greenhouse to investigate the absorptions of phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and sodium (Na) as a function of salinity. Salt stress was varied by using zero to 120 mM NaCl. The research was initiated because of a need to increase soybean production in the saline soils of the semi-arid regions of the world. Although P absorption increased with time at each concentration of NaCl, increasing its concentrations ([NaCl]) to 120 mM reduced P uptake considerably. The addition of inorganic P (Pi) to the salt medium improved P absorption significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) in stem, petiole, and roots. Polynomial regressions showed the relationship between 22Na activity and [NaCl] for leaves and petiole to be cubic (R2 = 1) while in the stem a quadratic relationship prevailed. A maximum of P and Na absorption was observed at 40 mM NaCl. The relationship between 32P activity and increasing [NaCl] was linear for the roots (a positive slope) and the stem (a negative slope). 45Ca and 32P dual labelling part of the experiments failed to produce results because an unexpectedly high degree of tissue quenching which prevented from obtaining the minimum counting requirements for separation. Shoot fresh and dry weights decreased linearly with increasing [NaCl] as did the root fresh and dry weights. Leaf chlorophyll content during the last week of the final harvest showed a linear relationship with time. Chlorophyll increased with time linearly when the growth medium contained zero and 40 mM NaCl; whereas a negative slope was obtained for 80 and 120 mM NaCl. It seems that P fertilization of the soil could ameliorate the salt effect. 22 Na uptake results indicated that there is a mechanism for exclusion of Na from soybean plant parts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barthakur, N.

Gillett of the community of Loodokilani, Kajiado District Kenya and by extension, contribute to its sustainable use. Vatovaea pseudolablab is found in occasional, yet distinct patches in Lookidalani and these patches may be associated with a particular soil-water regime. The associated soils are moderately developed, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, Munsell) clayloams, with small (5.61 mm), angular blocky aggregates. The patches were moderately covered (30%) with medium-sized stones (9.5 cm). Woody and leafy cuttings from wild stock were collected and rooted easily using a minimum of technological inputs. Roofing percentages were better under the hotter and drier conditions in Kilinito. In conclusion, the data gathered for this study were analyzed within the framework developed by Amold et al. (1985) for evaluating sustainable use strategies for indigenous plants. The low densities of V. pseudolablab found within the patches coupled with the high grazing pressure make it unlikely that wild resources could sustain higher usage. This study highlights some of the greatest methodological problems facing ethnobotanical, and related, research in pastoral communities. More attention should be directed towards developing research methodologies to further our understanding of wild food plants in pastoral communities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Johns, Tim</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mf065.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b5539</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vatovaea pseudolablab -- Ecology -- Kenya -- Kajiado District</dc:subject><dc:subject>Legumes -- Ecology -- Kenya -- Kajiado District</dc:subject><dc:subject>Masai (African people) -- Food -- Kenya -- Kajiado District</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wild plants, Edible -- Kenya -- Kajiado District</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw95052565"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Orthopaedic Research Laboratory</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of facet joint geometry on lumbar segmental kinematics : an ex-vivo &amp; in-vivo study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Andreou, Antonios</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It has long been postulated that the facet joint geometry (FJG) has an important influence on lumbar segmental motion. Although their sagittal orientation has been described in detail, there are very few studies describing the three-dimensional (3D) FJG. None correlates the latter to segmental kinematics. In view, we developed a method to quantify 3D FJG and compared the results to segmental kinematics. In the ex-vivo set-up, facets of individual cadaveric vertebrae taken from a previous biomechanical. study were digitized using a 3D morphometer and the geometry of the facet joints in respect to the vertebra's local coordinate system was quantified. In the in-vivo set-up, re-recruited subjects from a previous kinematic study had a MRI of their lumbar spine. The images were digitized and the facet joint's 3D geometry was evaluated. The two methods used for FJG measurements were validated. Kinematic data derived from both previous studies was correlated with their respective FJG. We did not find a significant influence of the FJG or tropism on lumbar segmental kinematics. Different coupling patterns were measured in the ex-vivo and in in-vivo experiments. This is likely due to the absence of muscle activity in the cadaveric specimen. Future in-vivo studies should be done with simultaneous muscle activity recording to better understand the coupling patterns. Studying FJG in defined spinal pathologies may render valuable information on the etiology of spinal diseases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Aebi, Max</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440v86z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w95052565</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43p0371"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Interpatient variability with the disposition of verapamil</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Anacleto, Ana Isabel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The pharmacokinetics of verapamil were evaluated in the young and elderly after steady state administration of a sustained release formulation.

In Vasubandhu's case the physiological preconditions of conscious life is inherited from traditional Buddhist psychology (skandhas), but are expanded into the Yogacara concept of the alaya-vijnana (storehouse consciousness). This novel form of consciousness has been interpreted as both a soul theory in Buddhism, and a form of metaphysical idealism. It is these elements that I juxtapose with similar notions found in Jamesian studies (self and idealism). Thus, Chapter One examines consciousness from the isolated perspective of each thinker, Chapter Two moves to an examination of self, and Chapter Three looks at the possibility of Idealism which is explicitly rejected by James, and is rejected also by many interpreters of the alaya-vijnana.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayes, Richard P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wp920.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m169b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>James, William, 1842-1910</dc:subject><dc:subject>Yogācāra (Buddhism)</dc:subject><dc:subject>James, William, 1842-1910.

Our approach aims at generating an instruction sequence with a low register pressure and a high level of Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) exploitable by the dynamic issue mechanism of the processor. Our objective is to improve the performance of the program by taking advantage of the out-of-order execution and register renaming mechanisms of the processor to reduce the amount of spill code introduced by the register allocator. Our approach uses a traditional ILP scheduler to generate an initial schedule for the program, and then reorders its instructions to reduce the register pressure of the program. This reordering is performed carefully. to ensure that the dynamic issue mechanism of the processor is able to exploit from the reordered sequence as much parallelism as available on the original schedule. We have proposed an approximate method to determine, for a given instruction sequence and a given instruction schedule, whether a particular dynamic issue superscalar processor can exploit from the sequence as much ILP as present in the schedule.

North America will not achieve prosperity if it allows its urban infrastructure to decay to the Developing World's levels. Increased new sources of revenue need to be explored by political officials to pay for the cost of upgrading our infrastructure to an acceptable level. In addition, developing an effective management, approach is a long-term way to handle a problem as large and as serious as our current infrastructure crisis.
