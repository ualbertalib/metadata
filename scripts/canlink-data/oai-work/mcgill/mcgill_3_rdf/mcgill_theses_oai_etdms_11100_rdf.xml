It is not realistic to consider the reticular formation either functionally or structurally in isolation. Its extent, events and effects are by very definition widespread and diffuse.

Neither the postmicrosomal supernatant (100 x 10^3 g supernatant) nor the microsomal pellet (100 x 10^3 g pellet) alone has activity, but if the two are recombined a response to vitamin K1 is obtained. Liver homogenates and their subcellular fractions from warfarin pretreated rats fail to produce factor VII in the presence of vitamin K1. To localize the intracellular site of inhibition by warfarin, "cross-mixing" experiments were performed. When the postmicrosomal supernatant from warfarin pretreated rats was mixed with the microsomal pellet from vitamin K-deficient rats a response to vitamin K1 was obtained, whereas the recombination of the postmicrosomal supernatant from vitamin K-deficient rats with the microsomal pellet from warfarin pretreated rats gave no response.

In all cases, a standard dose of ethanol was administered in a fasting state and their blood ethanol concentrations were studied. The time period taken for the maximum blood ethanol concentration to be achieved reflects gastric absorption. By studying the timing of this maximum, the subjects could be divided into 3 groups; rapid, standard and delayed absorbers. The effects of milk, olive oil and glucuronolactone an ethanol absorption were investigated.

Half of the animals developed a hyperdynamic circulation in response to sepsis, and the rise in cardiac output was significantly correlated with an increase in muscle capillary blood flow, demonstrating that no pre-capillary arteriovenous shunts were present. The increased flow was also related to decreased arteriovenous oxygen extraction. It was also demonstrated that after muscle exercise, in contrast to the findings after sepsis, the arteriovenous oxygen extraction was increased. This study suggests that the sequence of events seen in hypovolemic or cardiac shock (where low tissue perfusion and tissue hypoxia cause secondary cellular damage) is reversed in septic shock; a primary cellular defect occurs, causing the hemodynamic disturbance as an attempted compensatory mechanism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacLean, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hv724.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d3078</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k830g"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Properties of biological perfusates for extracorporeal support of the isolated heart</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sze, Stephen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The experiments included in this work were carried out for the purpose of studying some of the properties of blood and plasma and their effects on the preservation of left ventricular contractility during hypothermic coronary perfusion of the isolated heart. When blood is used to support the heart, both its viscosity and diffusible calcium concentration play an important role in determining the level of left ventricular function. The existence of a linear relationship between the viscosity of blood and left ventricular pressure has been demonstrated. Various compounds capable of raising the viscosity of plasma have been evaluated. Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is the most suitable because of its stability and lack of toxicity. When the viscosity of plasma is progressively raised, a calcium dependent linear relationship between perfusate viscosity and left ventricular pressure was also obtained. Although the properties of blood, resulting from its high viscosity cannot entirely be duplicated by artificially raising the viscosity of plasma, a new equilibrium can be achieved which although different from that of blood produces the same effects.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pitzele, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w782q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k830g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akw52jc01g"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of a bioassay for the determination of ACTH</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Smith, Glennell R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This assay was based on the corticosterone response to the intravenous administration of ACTH in 4 hours hypophysectomized rats.

This was related to the amount of soluble and insoluble forms of the enzyme. The relative amounts of each form depended on the pH. The rate-limiting effect was shown to be eliminated when the muscle extracts were prepared in a slightly alkaline medium. The importance of the ATPase in the homogenates and extracts in controlling the rate of glycolysis was also shown. Increasing the amount of ATPase up to a certain level stimulates glycolysis by supplying ADP for the phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase steps.

Advanced age, pH of aspirated gastric contents below 1.75, prolonged hypoxia and concurrent sepsis were the main factors associated with high mortality.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hansen, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63t0053.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311s59h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55zb916"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Alteration of mortality rate and gasto-intestinal lesions in severely burned rats fed an elemental diet</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Langlois, Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Experimental gastro-intestinal lesions secondary to extensive surface burns have studied in rats and thought to be similar to the lesions observed in hemorrhagic shock. Because of the beneficial effect reported from pre-feeding a shocked animal an elemental diet, we served this preparation to our burnt animals. The elemental diet is a liquid diet equivalent to the normal diet, but in which total protein has been replaced by amino acids. We observed a significant improvement of the 24 hour mortality rate and a marked reduction in the incidence of the gastrointestinal lesions. It is impossible to feed the elemental diet to a patient prior to burn, but because the gastrointestinal lesions secondary to burns encountered clinically are delayed, we believe that the elemental diet could find some application in extensive burn therapy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074z223.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55zb916</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qt01g"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Histological and histochemical studies on pathological states of the ureter (in particular congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction and ‘adynamic’ distal ureteral segments)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khonsari, Homayoun</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The histology and histochemistry in clinical and experimental hydronephrosis due to pelviureteric strictures and adynamic ureters have been studied.

To determine the possible origin of these conjugates, their excretion was measured in women prior to and following parturition and in non-pregnant women. Double isotope assays were employed to characterize and quantify all urinary steroids, the main ones being the sulfates of cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and the glucuronides of tetrahydrocortisone and tetrahydrocortisol. Prior to delivery the mean excretion of cortisol sulfate and cortisone sulfate was 193 and 54 µg /day. The values for the glucuronides of tetrahydrocortisol and tetrahydrocortisone were 986 and 2000 µg/day. The mean excretion rate of corticosterone sulfate and 11-dehydrocorticosterone sulfate was 219 and 35 µg/day respectively. Following parturition the excretion of all these sulfates decreased three to sevenfold, falling within the range observed for non-pregnant women. The data are consistent with our previous hypothesis that during the last trimester of pregnancy these steroid sulfates originate mainly from the fetus. Following birth their urinary output by the newborn reflects processes which were initiated in utero.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Klein, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hs74h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z401m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214s40j"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Composition of alginate in relation to strontium binding</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hurlburt, Andrea J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Alginic acid from Laminaria hyperborea was partially hydrolysed and the non-dialysable degradation products were fractionated into several components, with different proportions of guluronic and mannuronic acid. Sodium salts of these products were examined by intubation technique in rats for their suppressive activity of intestinal absorption of radioactive strontium and calcium. In vitro binding capacity was tested by dialysis against water containing strontium and calcium. 'Poly-L-guluronic acid' was found to be most effective; its degradation products did not show any higher activity. These degradation products had a lower degree of polymerization than the parent compound and it appears that the maximal gel formation with strontium occurs. It was concluded that high biological activity is dependent on chemical composition, including guluronic acid content, viscosity, chain length. Inhibition of calcium absorption was invariably low and the various preparations did not show any significant difference in their effectiveness.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Skoryna, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712mb01g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214s40j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924f81s"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of hepatectomy on body spaces in the dog</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Freeman, Joel B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The role of the liver in the control of body water was evaluated by performing body space measurements before and after total hepatectomy in the doge Standard isotopic dilutional techniques were carried out, using tritium for Total Body Water; Na22 and Inulin for Extracellular Water; Cr51 for Red Cell Volume and I121 for plasma volume and Glomerular Filtration Rate. The only significant changes observed were for the PV and RCV and these changes can probably be accounted for by pre, intra and post-operative blood loss. The stable extracellular spaces were parallelled by unchanging large vessel and whole body hematocrits. Although not statistically significant, some interesting tendencies were observed when the sodium and inulin spaces were compared, suggesting that the simultaneous use of a large non-diffusable molecule and a smaller diffusable isotope could be beneficial in estimating the interstitial water space.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gutelius, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816q611.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924f81s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax059cb54z"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of adenosine triphosphate in the phosphorylation of membrane components of chromaffin granules</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dworkind, Jack</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Adenosine triphosphate acts on the ATPase of chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla to release catecholamines, endogenous ATP, and soluble protein (Poisner and Trifaró, Mol.

A study by competitive protein binding</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dorr, Patrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Plasma progesterone levels in normal and abnormal human pregnancy have been determined by Competitive protein Binding, utilizing the affinity of progesterone for corticosteroid binding globulin. The technique is rapid (8 hours), sensitive (to 1 microgram/100 ml.), and requires small sample volumes (1 ml.). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision of the assay have been determined. The literature on progesterone in pregnancy has been reviewed concerning; synthesis and metabolism, reported plasma levels and alternative assay techniques. Plasma progesterone levels, (in microgram/100 ml.), are reported throughout normal pregnancy to delivery, (early: 1 - 5, late; 5 - 25), postpartum (0), and fetal levels (umbilical vein; 40.8, artery; 18.7). There is poor correlation between progesterone levels and the "progesterone effect" by vaginal cytology. In threatened abortion, abnormally low progesterone levels (below 1), carry a poor prognosis. With intrauterine fetal death, levels varied from abnormally low to normal values, (1.1 - 15.8).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Murphy, B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q7413.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903305p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
