The focus is primarily on OPAP, a mixed extractant consisting of mono- and di-octyl phenyl phosphoric acids, as well as on di-(2-ethyl hexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA). The effects of certain parameters on the extraction of nickel, both quantitative and qualitative, have been studied. The parameters include: modifier presence, concentration and type; OPAP concentration; phase ratio; aqueous environment; age of organic solution; and mono-/di-OPAP ratio. The ability to strip nickel from the organic solution as well as selectivity and kinetic tests were carried out. The use of 10% isodecanol as a modifier was found to be essential for the purpose of OPAP solubility in kerosene and phase separation. Furthermore, the cation exchange reaction proceeds very quickly, attaining equilibrium within 10 minutes. Unlike other phosphoric acid reagents, OPAP is able to extract significant amounts of nickel in the acidic pH range of 1 to 2. As well, nickel is easily stripped using a 1.0 M sulphuric acid solution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Distin, P.

Practices that involve detailed simulation of the complete flow field, including flow through the orifices, are limited by the need for extensive grid refinement near each orifice, and by slow convergence rates. Other approaches, such as modeling of the flow in each domain separately, and linking these flows by one-dimensional flow networks, reduce the accuracy of the solution. In this thesis, an alternative treatment is developed in which finite-volume modeling (FVM) inside the slot is replaced by specified flow conditions at the slot boundaries. These conditions are updated once per iteration by a correlation function, based on flow conditions local to the slot, as generated by the primary-domain FVM solution. The correlation function is derived empirically, using data from detailed numerical simulations. Application of this approach to laminar flow in two parallel channels linked by a small slot has produced encouraging results.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baliga, B.

But are there words that can express the horror of the Holocaust? Would silence not be more appropriate in respect to the victims? Elie Wiesel is not the first to confront such a dilemma. Throughout Jewish history, tragedies and catastrophes have forced Jewish writers to face the issue. Many literary schools have emerged, particularly in the "modern period" (1850-1945), which have dealt with the question of how to best respond to the tragedy. It is therefore fitting to try and consider Elie Wiesel's works in light of these various literary currents. However, the Holocaust is not just another tragedy, not even another catastrophe. The event has no precedent; it is unique; it represents the ultimate evil. How to come to terms with it? What is the way between the powerlessness of language and the impossibility of silence? Elie Wiesel must find the delicate art of making silence be heard beyond the noise of words. He will suggest rather than tell the event. He will maintain a distance to protect the secret of the victims in front of the horror. Survivors who share the secret, express themselves with a code, which is not transmissible. Language has been devalued and words have lost their meaning. But to remain silent might also be a form of treason. From Night, his first book, and throughout all his works, Wiesel assiduously develops his way of bearing witness in the name of the victims. He rejects the silence which would be synonymous with passive acceptance. He identifies with Job and demands account from God for His absence and His silence, while evil was committed. He distrusts language but must find the way to translate the uniqueness of the Holocaust. He finds his inspiration in the tales and legends of the literature of the Bible, the Talmud and the Hassidism. He evokes, suggests and tells while trying to respect the blanks between the words. In language and in silence, Wiesel developed a certain art of suggesting for what cannot be told otherwise.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Anctil, Pierre</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Morisot, Jean-Claude</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010q918.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw661</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wiesel, Elie, 1928- -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117p74h"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Methane emissions from the eastern temperate wetland region and spectral characteristics of subarctic fens</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Windsor, James</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Emissions of methane were measured by a static chamber technique at 9 sites on 5 wetlands in the Eastern Temperate Wetland Region, north of Montreal. Mean daily methane fluxes measured from May to October ranged from 0.18 to 1071 mg/m$ sp2$/d, and estimated annual flux ranged from 0.02 to 186 g/m$ sp2$/y. Laboratory incubations of peat samples showed potential anaerobic methane production rates which ranged from 0.00 to 9.12 $ mu$g/g/d, and potential aerobic consumption rates from 0.55 to 3.75 $ mu$g/g/d. Seasonal methane emission patterns are related to water table level and CH$ sb4$ production and consumption potentials in the peat profile. Episodic fluxes were found to be important at several sites, contributing a significant portion of the total emissions. Analysis of spectral reflectance data from 20 sites on 2 subarctic fens was carried out to address the issue of scaling up CH$ sb4$ emissions using satellite imagery. Hummocks, lawns and pools were found to be spectrally distinct enough to be differentiated by band 5 of Landsat MSS and band 3 of Landsat TM sensors. The averaging of spectral information in mixed pixels proved unlikely to be able to distinguish between wet lawn and string and pool communities. Such weaknesses can be overcome with the use of higher resolution data.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Moore, T.

The method of velocity singularities was originally developed by Mateescu and Newman in conjunction with a polynomial representation of the normal perturbation velocities. The present method uses a cubic spline representation of the aerofoil contour, which led to improvements in the accuracy and stability of the solution, especially in the case of the jet-flapped aerofoils. This method has been first validated for the cases of rigid and flexible aerofoils. The pressure distributions obtained with the spline formulation have proven to be in good agreement with the previous solutions based on conformal transformation, or obtained by Thwaites, Nielsen, and by Mateescu and Newman. The spline-velocity singularity method has been used for the jet flapped aerofoils and then extended to analyze the aerofoils with multiple sections, such as aerofoils with a flap. The solutions for these problems have been found to be in good agreement with the results obtained theoretically or experimentally by Spence, and Dimmock, and by Seebohm and Newman, based on a surface vortex method. The spline-velocity singularity method displayed a better accuracy and an enhanced stability of the solution, in comparison with the polynomial formulation, especially in the cases when the aerofoil contour is not known a priori, such as for the flexible or jet-flapped aerofoils.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mateescu, Dan F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r385x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rf38j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dg56t"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of a composite cDNA clone encoding mouse testicular N-Cadherin and the mouse homologue of a human breast tumor autoantigen</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Munro, Sandra Bronwen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A mouse testis cDNA library was screened with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a sequence in the 5$ sp prime$ region of mouse N-cadherin cDNA.

(Philip Francis)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines pond aquaculture as a development strategy in the Philippines, with particular reference to its impact on the local environment and the livelihoods of local people. A theoretical framework is provided by recent literature in development studies and human geography, which attempts to move away from an essentialist and ethnocentric development praxis, and towards a locally-based, participatory process of empowerment. From the perspective of such 'alternative' development ideas, orthodox strategies involving modernization, formalization of economic activities, and resource mobilization, can be reassessed. The promotion of pond aquaculture--and the widespread mangrove deforestation associated with it--is shown to be a strategy endorsed and supported by national and international development agencies. What is often overlooked, however, is the local ecological and economic importance of mangrove ecosystems. This study examines the effects of mangrove removal and fishpond development on the entitlements of people in three coastal communities in the Philippines. Aquacultural development is shown to have detrimental effects on the integrity of the coastal ecosystem and the livelihoods of certain groups of local residents; a rich common property resource is converted into a privately-owned system of cultivation. While benefits accrue to those with access to the capital necessary for the construction of fishponds, the costs of development are borne largely by mangrove gatherers and artisanal fisherfolk, whose share of a diminishing resource base is steadily declining. For these marginal groups, aquaculture is shown to provide few compensating economic benefits. The study supports, through concrete local evidence, the criticisms made of orthodox approaches to development, and the need to construct attitudes and strategies which are more attuned to local sustainability and equity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Armstrong, Warwick</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924c64q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cf09x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mangrove swamps -- Philippines -- Panay Island</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economic development -- Environmental aspects -- Developing countries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fish ponds -- Philippines -- Panay Island</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fish culture -- Philippines -- Panay Island</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bf83m"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Lithofacies and diagenesis of the Cooking Lake platform : carbonates, Alberta Basin subsurface, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chouinard, Hugo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Cooking Lake Formation in east-central Alberta is a widespread sheet-like carbonate unit that is up to 100 m thick. The lithofacies of the Cooking Lake Formation platform are assigned to eight depositional environments: (1) deep subtidal argillaceous calcimudstones, (2) deep to shallow subtidal nodular wackestones, (3) intermediate subtidal skeletal lime wackestones, (4) intertidal stromatoporoid/coral floatstones to rudstones, (5) shallow subtidal to lagoonal Amphipora floatstones, (6) shallow-shoal grainstones, (7) semi-restricted shallow subtidal peloidal wackestones/packstones, and (8) upper intertidal to supratidal laminated grainstones to algal-laminated limestones. Near-surface diagenesis is characterized by rim, syntaxial, equant and blocky calcite cements. During shallow-burial diagenesis, replacement dolomite and compaction features such as stylolites and dissolution seams developed. Intermediate to late-burial diagenesis is characterized by anhydrite, coarse-crystalline and saddle dolomite cements and late, coarse-crystalline calcite cements. Replacement dolomite and later dolomite cements occur across the entire platform but it is less important in the more muddy middle member. Petrographic and stable isotope data suggest that replacement dolomite formed during shallow-burial diagenesis associated with compaction features. Massive replacement dolomite only occur close to the dolomitized Rimbey-Meadowbrook reef trend. The highest porosity (interparticle) occurs in the peloidal grainstone facies. Submarine equant and blocky calcite cements appear to be the most abundant cement whereas replacement dolomitization, dissolution, and fracturing slightly increased porosity, except in the massively dolomitized facies. The western part of the platform, which is massively dolomitized, may have served as an aquifer for the dolomitizing fluids.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mountjoy, Eric</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts42p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bf83m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687j31f"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterisation of submerged powder injection into water using an in-line particle detection system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yamanoglu, Güller</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Particle behaviour during the downwards, pneumatic injection of powder into an aqueous medium (water) has been investigated by means of a new method which involves direct measurement by making use of an Aqueous Particle Sensor (APS) unit. Through this method, phenomena and parameters related to injection processes, such as gas-particle jet penetration distance, jet diameter, jet cone angle, particle dispersion and distribution within the liquid have been investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Flow observations comprised part of the experimental program for the purpose of confirming the characteristics of the "gas-only" and "gas-powder" injection regimes reported by previous workers. The effect of gas and powder flow rates (powder/gas loading ratio) in determining the injection regimes and particle behaviour within the liquid were the main parameters investigated. It was demonstrated that the jetting regime can be easily achieved as a result of increased momentum transfer from the particles to the gas phase. However, this required a high loading of particles. Entrainment of gas with the injected particles took place not only during coupled flow (jetting) but also during decoupled (bubbling) flow, such that some gas was always entrained by the particles and penetrated the liquid as a gas-particle jet, leaving large gas bubbles at the lance tip. It was further demonstrated that the gas flow rate had a greater effect on particle suspension within the liquid than did the powder flow rate.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guthrie, R. I.

Although a student of Heidegger's at Freiburg between 1936 and 1939, Nishitani shows no evidence of a heideggerian influence in The Self-Overcoming of Nihilism. In this period (1949), he considers, contrary to Heidegger, that the affirmative aspects of nietzschean philosophy constitute a radical overcoming of nihilism. It is only in What is Religion? (1961) which appears in 1982 as Religion and Nothingness (English translation) that his view changes, reflecting more closely a heideggerian position. Nietzsche's concept of the Will to Power is evidence for Nishitani that Nietzsche enmeshed still in a philosophy of "Being", remains within traditional Western metaphysics. Because in Nishitani's view, Western metaphysics is nihilist, he finally concludes that Nietzsche did not overcome nihilism. This development in Nishitani's thought is considered, in a concluding perspective of the present text, as evidence of the markedly more profound influence of Heidegger on the later, more mature work of Nishitani.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boutin, Maurice</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k099.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cx17j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nihilism (Philosophy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nishitani, Keiji, 1900- -- Contributions in concept of nihilism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, 1844-1900 -- Contributions in concept of nihilism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407z09r"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM in splotch mutant mouse embryos</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Neale, Sondra-Ann</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cell adhesion molecules are known to play crucial roles in a variety of developmental processes. The neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM is strongly implicated in neurulation and neural crest cell (NCC) migration and was thus studied in splotch (Sp) neural tube defect mutant embryos. At the 20 somite-stage of gestation day 9, Sp N-CAM was found to contain polysialic acid (PSA) side chains which are normally only present beginning at gestational day 11. Younger embryos at 12 and 14 somites also showed the presence of PSA on N-CAM, which was absent in controls. Enzymatic removal of PSA from N-CAM resulted in isoforms which migrated identically to PSA-free N-CAM isoforms in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The post-translational modification of N-CAM appears to be the primary target of the Sp gene. In view of N-CAM's importance during development, an alteration at a critical stage is likely to result in the cascade of abnormalities seen in Sp mutants. A new genotyping assay was also implemented for examination of N-CAM in Sp and other related wildtype strains.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Trasler, D.

Depending on the net relfectivity and absorptivity of the haze column and on the surface albedo, the net effect could be a cooling or a warming. But better understanding of the influence of aerosols is handicapped by lack of data and by the fact that their composition and distribution is highly variable in space and time. For the same reasons, the incorporation of aerosols in climate models is usually rudimentary. We have in-situ measurements of the vertical profile and size distribution of aerosols ($&gt;$0.09 $ mu$m in radius) taken over several places in eastern Canada at different times of the year. These data have been incorporated in a simple multi-layer radiative transfer model to estimate the effects of aerosols on the local radiation budget. A broad range of refractive indexes has been used and the increase of the particles size with the relative humidity is included.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leighton, Henry L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b64x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827c572</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct77z"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>FSL : a language for constraint programming with booleans and reals</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pidcock, Andrew H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we present FSL, a constraint programming language for numerical computation in booleans, integers and reals.

Despite this feature, FSL's input is entirely in the form of equations with a minimum of additional syntax. A users' manual for FSL and some examples of the problems it was applied to introduce the language and its uses. The design of the FSL language is discussed, and then an overview of the implementation of the interactive FSL interpreter is given, followed by complete details, suitably organized and indexed for maintenance and continuation of the project. A full tutorial of the CASE tools Lex and Yacc is included, detailing the specific example of FSL and the interaction of the tools in the design of a parser.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Merrett, T.

The objective is then to analyze the main female characters since they constitute a subversive presence which is constantly challenging the patriarchal order and which is potentially capable of transforming it. Our goal is also to demonstrate that the writing of the female characters undermine patriarchal discourse.

The central idea that governs Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior, Smaro Kamboureli's in the second person, and Minnie Bruce Pratt's "Identity: Skin Blood Heart," is this: life-writing cannot be divorced from dialogical relations because living cannot be divorced from dialogical relations. Accordingly, if it is impossible to conceive and define ourselves without reference to other selves, it must be equally impossible to write our life-stories without reference to others. Hence, the process of "self-invention" or "self-fashioning" typically associated with the autobiographical project must be reconsidered within the larger frame of history and heritage, community and collaboration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bristol, Michael D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n203z989.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50ts404</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dialogue</dc:subject><dc:subject>Autobiography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abr86b4266"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Production of a cloned xylanase gene in Bacillus cereus and its performance in kraft pulp prebleaching</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tremblay, Louis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Xylanase production from a Bacillus subtilis gene cloned into a strain of Escherichia coli was measured. Although this gene was expressed in E. coli at several temperatures, efficient normal xylanase secretion did not occur, the observed protein release apparently depending on cell leakage or lysis. Screening for a better microbial protein secretor free of cellulase selected B. cereus #259. The strain had wild plasmids that were hard to eliminate using acridine orange and elevated temperature curing techniques. While still bearing 5 wild plasmids, attempts to transform B. cereus #259 were unsuccessful using conventional methods and electroporation. Another strain, B. cereus #518, found to be free of wild plasmids, was then used. A bidirectional vector shuttle plasmid (pMK3) was employed to carry the cloned gene into this B. cereus strain. Transformation was carried out by high voltage electroporation. Xylanase production by the new B. cereus clone was similar to that from E. coli, but was shown to be continuously and normally secreted. The xylanase gene products from the E. coli and B. cereus hosts were shown to function identically. Both xylanases improved the delignification of unbleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulps, thus reducing the Cl$ sb2$ required to achieve a given degree of bleaching, without altering the physical properties of the fibers. Using a target kappa number lignin content) of 5, xylanase pretreatment of aspen kraft pulp led to a 22% saving of chlorine. Adsorbable organic halogens in the bleachery effluent were also lowered by more than 50%.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Archibald, Fred</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr171z02v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b4266</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sulfate pulping process</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bacillus cereus</dc:subject><dc:subject>Escherichia coli</dc:subject><dc:subject>Xylanases</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g3520"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Expression of the membrane fusion protein of measles virus in insect and mammalian cells using recombinant viruses</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tam, John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The fusion (F) protein of measles virus is responsible for viral penetration at the plasma membrane and syncytia formation. In order to facilitate future structure/function studies, the F protein was expressed in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus, and in mammalian cells using both vaccinia and adenovirus recombinants. The baculovirus system exhibited the highest levels of recombinant protein expression, but the majority of the product was found to be in the form of detergent-insoluble precursors. Replacing the signal peptide of the F protein with insect-derived sequences did not enhance posttranslational processing. Also, expression of truncated, anchor-minus forms of the F protein did not result in improved solubility or secretion. The vaccinia virus recombinant VF exhibited higher levels of expression than measles virus-infected cells. However, the majority of the F protein was expressed as insoluble precursors. The biologically active portion, represented by the proteolytically cleaved F protein, was found to be soluble. The vP455 vaccinia virus recombinant and the AdF adenovirus recombinant expressed similar levels of processed F as in measles virus-infected cells. The products of these recombinants were found to be soluble. F protein expressed by vaccinia virus recombinants in primate and murine cells were observed to cause syncytia formation in the absence of measles virus hemagglutinin (H) co-expression. This H-independent fusion could not be inhibited by Z-D-Phe-L-Phe-Gly. When the adenovirus system was used, F protein could not facilitate fusion unless measles virus hemagglutinin was present as well.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Richardson, Chris</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zh62p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g3520</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33rx50r"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Simulation of fluid flow and heat transfer in impingement flows of various configurations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Seyedein, Seyed Hossein</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Results of numerical simulation of two-dimensional flow field and heat transfer impingement due to laminar and turbulent single as well as multiple slot jets discharging normally into a confined channel are presented.

A control volume-based finite difference method was employed to solve the governing mass, momentum, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and energy equations in the turbulent impinging jet cases. A separate program was written based on a body-fitted coordinate system to predict the transport characteristics of multiple laminar jets impinging on a plate surface with an inclined upper confinement surface. The parameters studied include: the jet Reynolds number, nozzle-to-impingement surface spacing and for the inclined confinement surface cases, the angle of inclination of the upper surface. From the low-Reynolds number model studied it was found that models presented by Lam-Bremhorst and Launder-Sharma to be applicable to single turbulent jet impingement heat transfer predictions. Inclination of the confined surface so as to accelerate the exhaust flow was found to level the Nusselt number distribution on the impingement surface.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mujumdar, A.
