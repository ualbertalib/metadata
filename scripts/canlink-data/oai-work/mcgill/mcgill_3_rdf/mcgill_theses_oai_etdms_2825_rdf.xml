Method: Data were gathered from parents of children with Down syndrome in French and English samples in Quebec and Ontario respectively, using the Oral assessment-in-Down-syndrome (OADS) questionnaire, the non-communicating-children's-pain-checklist (NCCPC) and additional questions related to the last pain. Results: Parents who reported difficulty perceiving pain also observed more behaviours of pain compared to those reporting no difficulty. Age of children was a determinant in the level of difficulty that parents had perceiving pain, with decreasing difficulty from 68% to 31% as age increased. Severe pain, long duration ofpain and pain associated with serious diseases were related with higher number ofbehaviours chosen. Conclusion: The association ofpain perception and number ofbehavioUfs manifested may indicate that the NCCPC is useful to determine the level of difficulty that parents have perceiving pain in their children with Down syndrome.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k9435.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zw69s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences - Dentistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h1735"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of receptor tyrosine kinases in synaptic plasticity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hislop, Jonathan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have many roles, including in growth, differentiation, and development. More recently several RTKs have also been shown to have a role in synaptic plasticity. I report here the cloning and characterization of three novel RTKs from the marine mollusk Aplysia Californica. The first is a member of the Ror family. It is a 155 kD protein expressed in the nervous system of juvenile and adult animals, is activated in response to treatment with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, and co-localizes in immunocytochemistry with a P-type calcium channel. It may have a role in organizing functional subdomains in the cell. The second receptor may form a novel family of RTK but does have some similarity to Ret and FGF receptors in the kinase domain. It is a 125 kD protein when expressed in heterologous cells, however it was not possible to detect expression in tissue. In a parallel study, the mRNA for the Lymnaea stagnalis ortholog was shown to increase following neurite injury, suggesting a role in neurite growth. Expression of the receptor in Aplysia cultured sensory neurons indicates a role for the receptor specifically in inhibiting neurite growth. Finally, a receptor with strong intracellular homology to receptors from the Trk/Ror/MuSK families was identified. This receptor has strongest conservation with Trk receptors, although it has a non-conserved extracellular domain. The mRNA for the receptor is expressed primarily in the nervous system. The RTK is a 110 kD protein, expressed in the nervous system both in cell bodies and neurites. Activation of a chimeric form of the receptor shows that it leads to activation of MAP kinase. Furthermore expression of activated but not kinase dead receptor in Aplysia sensory neurons induces MAP kinase phosphorylation. The native receptor may be activated by tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors or by 5HT in cultured sensory neurons, and these effects are blocked by application of the Trk-specific inhibitor K252a. Since 5HT and MAP kinase also have important roles in facilitation in Aplysia these data suggest the receptor may be involved in this process.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698971n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h1735</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988n29k"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>In vivo application of magnetic resonance methods to study the substrate for disability in multiple sclerosis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Narayanan, Sridar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation presents a series of studies aimed at elucidating the relationship between clinical disability and central nervous system pathology in multiple sclerosis (MS) using multiple magnetic resonance (MR) surrogates of pathology. MR spectroscopic (MRS) measurement of the neuronal-specific metabolite N-acetylaspartate provides an index of neuronal/axonal integrity. Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging provides measures related to myelination. Visualization of brain regions that become activated while performing a given task is possible using functional MRI (fMRI). Sophisticated image processing techniques allow more of the information contained in MR data to be extracted, such as the degree of atrophy of the brain or spinal cord. We generated lesion probability images in stereotaxic space for relapsing-remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) MS patients and demonstrated that the greater axonal damage per unit lesion volume previously observed in SP patients was not due to differences in lesion distribution between the two groups. Average NAA/Cr images in stereotaxic space showed that axonal injury extended into regions of low lesion probability, providing evidence for axonal injury in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). We showed that a portion of the axonal injury in NAWM was due to chronic metabolic dysfunction by observing recovery of chronically low central brain NAA in patients treated with interferon (3-lb. Combining MRS and fMRI, we presented convincing evidence that cortical adaptations to injury could augment recovery from relapse in early stage MS, potentially masking underlying axonal injury. A combined quantitative MT and MRS study showed that while diffuse axonal damage and demyelination in the NAWM were not linked, lesion volume weighted by an index of demyelination within lesions correlated well with diffuse axonal damage, suggesting that wallerian degeneration of axons damaged within lesions contributes to diffuse axonal injury in the NAWM. However, diffuse axonal and tissue injury were demonstrated in non-disabled patients with very low lesion burden and no brain atrophy, suggesting that a direct mechanism of NAWM injury also exists. Cerebral axonal injury was shown to be relevant to disability from the early stages of MS, while spinal cord atrophy was strongly linked to disability in late stage MS. Prolonged axonal dysfunction may eventually lead to axonal degeneration and tissue loss.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870z16m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988n29k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology - Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r062k"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Netrin-1 signaling : cellular consequences and molecular mechanisms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shekarabi, Seyed Masoud</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During the embryonic development of the nervous System, groups of multipotent cells proliferate, migrate, and differentiate to become neurons. The new born neurons need to make precise connections with their targets. These may be a great distance away from their soma. To make these connections, neurons send their axon through a biochemically complex environment and their growth cones may make many guidance decisions on the ways to their targets. The existence of axon guidance molecules was inferred by the early classical neuroanatomists. We now know of multiple examples of secreted or membrane-bound proteins that either attract or repel axonal growth cônes by causing the growth cône to collapse or extend. The molecular mechanisms that regulate growth cone collapse or extension are  closely linked to reorganization of the cytoskeleton. The small Rho GTPases, Cdc42, Rac, and Rho play key roles in neuronal growth cônes by regulating the organization of the cytoskeleton. Netrins are a small family of secreted guidance eues that are implicated in the attraction and repulsion of axons during the development of the nervous System. The netrin-1 receptor deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) is highly expressed by commissural neurons in the developing spinal cord. The findings described here show that DCC is present at the tips of filopodia and the edges of lamellipodia of HEK293T, NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma cells, and the growth cones of embryonic rat spinal commissural neurons. Furthermore, netrin-1 protein causes an increase in filopodia number and surface area of embryonic rat commissural neuron growth cônes and the cell fines when transfected to express DCC. Further experiments indicated that netrin-1 activates the small GTPases Cdc42 and Racl in the cell lines and the embryonic rat commissural spinal cord neurons. The activation of Cdc42 and Racl by netrin-1 requires DCC. Furthermore, netrin-1 causes increased phosphorylation of Pakl, an effector for both Cdc42 and Racl. Expression of a dominant negative form of N-WASP, an effector for Cdc42, blocks the netrin-1 induced morphological changes in the growth cones of commissural neurons. Evidence is presented that netrin-1 induces the formation of a complex of proteins interacting with the intra-cellular domain of DCC that includes Nckl, Cdc42, Racl, Pakl, and N-WASP. The findings described lead to a model whereby netrin-1 binding to DCC triggers the activation of Cdc42 and Racl, which leads to actin based membrane extension and changes in growth cone morphology.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cw29q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r062k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology - Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p6908"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Acute otitis media in Quebec's children : antibiotic prescribing patterns and outcomes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Quach-Thanh, Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Acute otitis media ( AOM) is one of the most common indications for antibiotic use in children. We used the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec databases to better understand the prescribing patterns of physicians and to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotics in the treatment of AOM. We selected a cohort of 60,513 children aged &lt; 6 years with a first episode of AOM between June 1999 and June 2002. Failure was defined as either a new dispensation of antibiotic or a hospitalization or outpatient visit for complications related to AOM in the following 30 days. The antibiotic most widely used was amoxicillin (42.8%). Failure occurred in 12,693 (21%) children. Overall, azithromycin was the only antibiotic that was less associated with failure when compared to amoxicillin (odds ratio 0.88; 95% confidence interval 0.82, 0.94). In the first 3 days of treatment, a 50% increased risk of failure was seen when macrolides were initially given. However, azithromycin was associated with a 20% decrease in the risk of failure occurring &gt; 14 days after the beginning of treatment. Other risk factors associated with treatment failure were age &lt; 24 months, antibiotics or hospitalization in the preceding month, and otitis-prone conditions. Considering the results of the effectiveness study, the importance of macrolides resistance among pneumococci, and because there is no single factor or combination of factors that predict with certainty which child will develop early or late failure, amoxicillin should remain the first-line drug of choice.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10ws591.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p6908</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences - Epidemiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mh689"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Comparison of three linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery techniques</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Oliveira, Silvana C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, physical and biological aspects of three linear-accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery techniques, namely the dynamic rotation, static conformal beam, and intensity-modulated beam, are compared.

The phantom is CT-scanned with a stereotactic frame, and the images are transferred to the treatment planning systems. The best possible treatment plans are generated for each simulated target and for each of the three techniques. Treatment plans are compared using both physical (homogeneity and conformity indices) and biological parameters (integral biologically effective dose, tumour control probability and normal tissue complication probability). Possible correlation between physical and biological parameters is investigated for the three techniques. Finally, some experiments are performed to explain the lack of correlation obtained when multiple isocenters are employed in the dynamic rotation technique for the treatment of irregular targets.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w686m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mh689</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azc77ss136"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Elucidation of the roles of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA trafficking signals in the viral replication cycle</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bériault, Véronique</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two RNA trafficking cis sequences (A2RE-1 and A2RE-2) were identified in HIV-1 RNA.

Aberrant expression of any of the regulating factors usually results in metabolic bone disease. Therefore understanding the mechanisms of skeletal homeostasis may disclose new therapies for treating these disorders. While the complete pathway that defines normal osteoblast differentiation remains indeterminate, several regulatory factors have already been identified and characterized. Using gene targeting technology, the importance of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) in skeletal biology has been well established, as PTHrP^-/- and PTHrP^+/- mice demonstrate skeletal abnormalities. Several lines of evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that PTHrP has unique roles in osteoblast biology, independent from its well-established roles in chondrocytes. The presence of an intronic variable number tandem repeat sequence (VNTR) in the human PTHrP gene has been proposed to provide a novel mechanism of transcriptional gene regulation in osteoblasts. A preliminary survey indicated that osteoporotic patients with low bone mineral density have the shortest allele of the VNTR. In this work, we set out to investigate the role of the minisatellite in PTHrP expression and as a potential predictor of decreased bone mineral density. However, in a large sample of osteoporotic patients, a correlation between bone mineral density and VNTR length was not apparent. Also, the presence of the VNTR, or its length, seemed not to affect PTHrP promoter activity in osteoblast-like cells. EMSA experiments demonstrated the ability of the VNTR to bind proteins whose natures remain unclear. We also studied the effect of the newly identified zinc-finger transcription factor, Osterix, on the GC-rich PTHrP promoter. Osx did not bind the promoter or affect its transcriptional activity. However, unexpectedly, we observed that the transcription factor Cbfal, the master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, decreases PTHrP gene expression, likely through a molecular intermediate. Our investigations have shed some light on the role of PTHrP in osteoblast differentiation, and its regulation in this process by polymorphic elements and transcription factors specific to osteoblasts. The potential role of these parameters in the homeostatic regulation of the skeleton and the development of metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis warrants further investigation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77ft659.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q366f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology - Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nd30m"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Comparison of classical and transient analysis methods for estimation of VOR dynamics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chan, Wilbur Wai Pang</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Vestibular Ocular Reflex (VOR) controls the stability ofgaze in mammals and operates even in darkness.

The classical and a new transient analysis method are first tested on simulated VOR data. The results show that the transient method is more consistent, while the classical method applied to fixed-parameter simulations provides VOR characteristics that apparently change with stimulus level and/or fast phase frequency.

We developed a primary culture system using rat bladder smooth muscle cells, and found that these formed typical N-cadherin positive junctions more typical of those formed between fibroblasts as opposed to epithelial cells.

Analysis of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in S. cerevisiae revealed the presence of two deacetylase  complexes, one containing Hda1 as its catalytic subunit, and the other possessing Rpd3. The three previously identified human HDAC proteins, HDAC1-3, were found to be homologs of Rpd3. This observation suggested that mammalian cells might contain an uncharacterized class of biochemically distinct Hda1-like proteins. The goal of my project has been to identify and characterize mammalian HDAC proteins which are similar to Hda1. I first identified the human histone deacetylase HDAC4, which contains a carboxy-terminal region significantly similar to the catalytic domain of yeast Hda1. When tethered to a promoter, HDAC4 functions as a transcription corepressor. Furthermore, HDAC4 interacts with the transcription factors MEF2 and RFXAf\lK and represses transcription of their target genes, supporting the notion that HDAC4 is a transcription corepressor in vivo. Surprisingly, HDAC4 is localized mainly in the cytoplasmic region and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC4 is controlled by multiple mechanisms. HDAC4 possesses a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) for its dynamic nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Binding of 14-3-3 proteins exposes the NES of HDAC4, which then results in its nuclear export. From this work, I have identified HDAC4 and shown that it functions as a transcription corepressor whose activity is regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634592s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m406f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences - Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A76537335h"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Population-based case-control study of the effects of antidepressant drugs on the risk of development of cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tamim, Hani M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although mechanisms have not been identified, animal and epidemiological studies suggest that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) promote tumor growth in humans.

This conjugation is a multi-step process involving three different enzymes. Upon polyubiquitination of a target protein, the 26S proteasome is recruited, leading to the degradation of the substrate. The ubiquitination of proteins, and hence their degradation, can be prevented through the action of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), cysteine proteases that cleave the isopeptide bond through which ubiquitin moieties are attached to their substrates. How DUBs recognize their substrates has been unclear. Two isoforms of a novel testis-specific deubiquitinating enzyme, UBP-tl and UBP-t2, which contain identical core regions but different N-termini, were identified 1. This thesis describes the further characterization of the function of the N-termini. Assessment of the kinetic parameters of UBP-tl, UBP-t2 and the core domain of the two enzymes alone (UBP-core) for the substrate ubiquitin-PEST revealed that the different N-termini increased the Km's of the enzymes, thereby diminishing their affinity towards the substrate. The Vmax of UBP-t2 and the core domain were similar, suggesting that the N-termini do not affect catalytic efficiency. As well, UBP-tl and UBP-t2 had lower activity than UBP-core against endogenously ubiquitinated testis proteins. Thus, the N-termini probably restrict the deubiquitinating activity of the core domain to specific substrates. The UBP-core deubiquitinating activity was not exclusive to testis proteins, as endogenously ubiquitinated proteins in liver, brain, and muscle extracts were also deubiquitinated, however at a slower rate than those in testis. UBP-testis appears to be specific for ubiquitinated proteins, as the enzymes could not remove Nedd8 (the ubiquitin-like protein most similar to ubiquitin) from endogenously neddylated proteins. Since the N-termini appeared to be involved in regulating substrate specificity, they were used as ligands in affinity columns to try to bind substrates and/or interacting proteins from testis extracts. AUFl, a protein regulating mRNA stability was found to be a possible interacting protein with the UBP-tl N-terminus.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f351d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rg608</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry - Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cn11c"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of eIF4E-interacting partners from Drosophila melanogaster</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Miron, Mathieu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Numerical notation systems are structured, visual, and primarily non-phonetic systems for representing number. This study employs a diachronic and comparative framework to examine over 100 systems used during the past 5000 years. The historical context of each system's origin, transmission, transformation, and decline is traced, linking systems together into phylogenies, but according priority to neither analogical or homological explanations. Structural aspects of numerical notation systems are compared and the limits of variability among them are established. A two-dimensional typology is presented that analyzes the intraexponential and interexponential structuring of each system, in addition to one or more numerical bases. In previous approaches, the only relevant factor considered was the presence or absence of positionality, which led inevitably to unilinear and progressivist conclusions. The analysis of historical relations among numerical notation systems permits a direct approach to questions of how and why they changed. The application of a multilinear cultural evolutionary framework reveals both synchronic and diachronic regularities among numerical notation systems. Where possible, these cross-cultural regularities are related to principles of cognitive psychology. Full explanations of the cultural evolution of numerical notation must also take account of social factors because changes in systems are always the product of decisions made in particular social contexts. Most numerical notation systems are used only for recording and communication, not computation, so it is illegitimate to evaluate their usefulness for functions for which they were never used. A model is presented that relates structural features of numerical notation systems to the contexts of their use and transmission. Because positional systems are most useful for functions related to administrative and scientific institutions that promote cultural hegemony, the observed trend towards positional numerals is a consequence of the dominance of societies that possess such institutions rather than the numerals' inherent superiority.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343v20m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cn11c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry - Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82k944f"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Study of class I and class II P-glycoprotein chimeras</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cayrol, Romain</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Multidrug drug resistance (MDR) phenotype is a major limitation to chemotherapy. The MDR phenotype arises when class I P-glycoproteins (P-gps) are overexpressed in cultured cells in vitro and in tumor cells in vivo. P-gps are encoded in rodents by three genes: mdr1, mdr2 and mdr3. Class I P-gps (Mdrl, Mdr3) confer drug resistance upon transfection in non-resistant cells and act as ATP dependent drug efflux pumps, class II P-gps (Mdr2) do not convey MDR but act as lipid flippases in the canalicular membranes of hepatocytes. P-gps are composed of twelve transmembrane domains and two nucleotide binding sites. The membrane spanning domains (MSD) of Pgp show the lowest level of similarity amongst family members and are postulated to be responsible for the different substrate specificities of the two classes of P-gp. In this study, chimeric cDNAs were constructed between class I and class II P-gps. The cDNAs were optimized for expression and study in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris) expression systems. The ATPase activity of the expressed constructs was studied by vanadate induced trapping of nucleotides.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d8739.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k944f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry - Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jw799"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Functional and molecular ovarian deficits in the prepubertal Follitropin Receptor Knockout (FORKO) mouse</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Balla, Agneta</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We characterized the structural, functional and molecular aberrations occurring in the peri/postnatal ovaries of Follitropin Receptor Knockout (FORKO) females. Immature FORKOs have 40-50% smaller reproductive organs. Estradiol is undetectable but testosterone and LH levels are elevated. Developmental markers (Mullerian Inhibiting Substance, GATA-4, estrogen receptor p\ and androgen receptor) are differentially expressed in granulosa cells (GC). Bi-directional communication between oocyte and GCs is inferred as altered in the FORKOs as demonstrated by absence of connexin 43, a gap junction protein, from the ovaries of FORKOs, and by up regulation of connexin 31.1, a mediator of atresia. We conclude that intercellular communication between the follicular cells is altered in the FORKOs and FSH-R signaling is absolutely necessary for the regulation of connexin 43 /31.1 proteins in the ovary. Most importantly, we suggest that the FSH/receptor system is a major contributor to the formation and recruitment of the primordial follicle pool as early as postnatal day 2 in the mouse.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580p782.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jw799</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology - Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795986h"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Glutathione release from an airway epithelian cell line</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chang, Colin A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant antioxidant in the lung and plays an important protective role.

Invoking the EDW causes one collimating jaw to move across the field to produce a predefined wedged dose distribution. Measured dose profiles were compared with plans calculated by a treatment planning system for various fields. EDW fields were examined for various wedge angles currently available for clinical use. EDW fields for non-clinical angles, which are not currently available, were also produced by applying the ratio of tangents method and delivered with the use of the Dynamic Beam Delivery (DBD) utility. The measured dose profiles correspond to the generated treatment plans within acceptable tolerance limits. Wedge factors were measured for EDW angles (clinical and non-clinical) for asymmetric fields. The production of the non-clinical angles serves as a validation of the current methodology used to generate wedge profiles, and extends the capabilities ofthe current EDW system. Lastly, a comprehensive set of quality assurance tests for the EDW were developed and are presented in this thesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng92s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nd31w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics - Radiation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p096938f"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A comparison across cultures of the impact of oral health problems in children</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zou, Jingyi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I started this project work in November 2001.

Application of GABA-A receptor antagonists, such as bicuculline (BMI), both in vivo and in vitro transforms these slow oscillations into spike-wave discharges (SWDs). We studied if some areas of the cerebral cortex have a stronger propensity to generate SWDs and trigger SWDs in other less prone areas. Ten sequential mouse brain slices were prepared and named after 1-10 from posterior to frontal. During application of BMI spontaneous SWDs were observed in all slices and cortical sites. Interestingly, SWDs recurred at different frequencies in different slices; posterior slices (1-6) had a higher rate than the frontal slices (7-10) (~0.2 vs 0.1 Hz, posterior vs frontal). Investigating the origin of this discrepancy we found that neocortices are not primarily different. Instead, intrinsic differences along the posterior-frontal axis of the piriform cortex are what secondarily differentiate posterior and frontal slices.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w2019.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kc88p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology - Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k7287"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Parasympathetic innervation of the rat lower lip skin following sensory denervation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ramien, Michele</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is known to play a role in the genesis of neuropathic pain. In the skin of the rat lower lip (hairy skin), sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres normally innervate the same blood vessels in the lower dermis but do not occur in the upper dermis. However, we have shown that sympathetic fibre migration into the upper dermis occurs following mental nerve lesions (1. Compo Neurol. 422:287-296, 2000). As sensory denervation has a dramatic effect on sympathetic fibre innervation patterns in the rat lower lip skin, we decided to investigate the possible changes in the other autonomic fibre type in the skin - the parasympathetic fibre. Sensory denervation of the rat lower lip was achieved by bilateral transection of the mental nerve, and animals were allowed to recover for one to eight weeks. Lower lip tissue was processed for double labelling light microscopic immunocytochemistry (ICC), using antibodies against substance P (SP), which labels a subpopulation of peptidergic sensory fibres, and against the vesicular acetycholine transporter (VAChT), used as a marker for parasympathetic fibres. In sham-operated rat, SP-immunoreactive (IR) sensory fibres were found in the epidermis and upper and lower dermal regions, whereas VAChT-IR fibres were confined to the lower dermis. Mental nerve lesions induced the gradual disappearance of SP-IR fibres from all skin layers accompanied by the progressive migration of VAChT-IR fibres into the upper dermis. Cholinergic fibre migration was evident by the second week post-surgery and the ectopic innervation of the upper dermis by these fibres persisted even at the last time point studied (8 weeks). VAChT-IR fibres were observed in the upper dermis, well above the opening of the sebaceous glands into the hair follicles. These results show that considerable changes occur in the innervation patterns of parasympathetic fibres following mental nerve lesions. The unique cutaneous innervation of the trigeminal region - sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic - presents novel opportunities for close interactions between these three fibre types and may have implications for improving the existing understanding and treatment of neuropathic pain in this region.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wm41c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k7287</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences - Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah128ng932"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>TGF-[beta] receptors on human chondrocytes : hetero-oligomerization and function</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Parker, Wendy Lynne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Human cartilage does not have the capacity for parent-like regeneration; instead, following injury, there is a programmed attempt at regeneration that ultimately results in fibrocartilage formation. This lack of intrinsic repair has been attributed to the avascular state of the tissue and chondrocyte dedifferentiation towards a cell incapable of type II collagen production and with altered responsiveness to the structural and regulatory mediators within its microenvironment. For several decades, debate has existed regarding the role Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-P) plays in modulating articular cartilage. Blocking of TGF-p signaling in mice by a dominant negative type II TGF-p receptor and transgenic knockouts of Smad 3, a central mediator of TGF-p signaling, result in osteoarthritic-like phenotypes, whereas local up-regulation of TGF-p promotes cartilage healing in degenerative joint disease models. Despite TGF-p being implicated as a key player In the regulation of chondrocyte phenotype and extracellular matrix (ECM), little is known about TGF-p action in human chondrocytes. These investigations have established a critical link between variation in TGF-p receptor expression at the cell surface and TGF-p action in cartilage. In addition to the TGF-p signaling receptors, the presence of betaglycan and RIIB (a spliced variant of the type II signaling receptor) was confirmed on human chondrocytes. Moreover, the expression of three novel TGF-p receptors was identified, namely Sol RI (a soluble form of the type I receptor), Alk-l, and endoglin. These receptors formed a variety of heteromeric complexes and regulated TGF-p signaling. More importantly, RIIB and endoglin were demonstrated to regulate type II collagen levels and evidence was provided that they likely represent chondrocyte phenotypic markers. A critical link between endoglin expression, cell phenotype, TGF-~ responsiveness, and ECM was established. These results demonstrate the formation of TGF-~ receptor heteromeric complexes of various subtype composition on chondrocytes suggesting that such complexes may regulate TGF-~ signaling pathways in those cells. Cell surface TGF-~ binding proteins, acting as phenotypic markers in human cartilage, are potential modulators of complex interactions between the cell and its microenvironment. Therefore, novel TGF-~ receptors may provide an avenue to regulate the effects ofTGF-~ locally and establish new insights into cartilage regeneration or repair.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225d264.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128ng932</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences - Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50gz370"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The natural history and epidemiology of cervical human papillomavirus infections in Montreal university students</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Richardson, Harriet</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Introduction. Only a small proportion of women with oncogenic HPV infections will eventually progress to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or invasive cervical cancer (ICC), although the reasons why are not well understood. Additional knowledge about viral transmission and persistence is still needed, since some studies have shown that certain environmental co-factors, such as previous STDs or alcohol use may facilitate the sexual transmission of HPV or the persistence of an established HPV infection. The objectives of this study were to: 1) Describe the incidence and clearance rates of type-specific HPV infections; 2) Identify determinants of high- (HR) and lowrisk (LR) HPV acquisition and clearance, and; 3) Identify viral determinants of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). Methodology. In a prospective cohort of 621 Montreal university students, cervical specimens were collected for cytology and HPV DNA detection. Information on potential risk factors was obtained by interview at baseline, and at return visits. Follow-up visits were scheduled every 6 months over 2 years, for a total of 5 visits. Results. The two-year cumulative incidence of any HPV infection was 36% and the mean duration of an episode with a type-specific HR- or LR-HPV infection was 16.3 and 13.4 months, respectively. After adjusting for age and sexual activity, co-factors for HPV acquisition included a recent Chlamydia infection, oral contraceptive use, alcohol use and washing after sex. Some determinants of HPV clearance included tobacco and alcohol use, in addition to use of tampons, daily vegetable consumption and condom use. Slightly different sets of the aforementioned co-factors or predictors were observed for HR- and LR-HPV infections. Non-European HPV 16 or -18 variants appear to be strongly associated with incident low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). Conclusion. HPV infections occurred frequently in this cohort, and 24% or 12% of the women remained positive after 24 months with an incident type-specific HR- or LR-HPV infection. Some modifiable co-factors, independent of sexual activity, may facilitate transmission or persistence of certain HPV infections. These results may have implications for public health education and cervical cancer screening programmes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k729h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gz370</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences - Epidemiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
