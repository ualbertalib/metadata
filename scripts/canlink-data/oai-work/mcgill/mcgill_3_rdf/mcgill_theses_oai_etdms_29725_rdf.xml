Protein and zinc restrictions, at these levels, produced independent effects on final worm burdens. While mice fed both marginal and low protein diets, and marginal zinc diets had significantly higher worm burdens in a primary infection, the response to a challenge infection was only impaired in animals fed the low protein diet. Eosinophilia was significantly reduced by zinc restriction in the primary infection and by the lowest level of protein restriction in the challenge infection. The magnitude of the serum IgG1 concentration was significantly lowered by protein restriction in both the primary and challenge infections. The impaired response to a challenge immunizing protocol in the animals fed the 3% protein diet, along with the reduced eosinophilia and IgG1 response, indicates a negative effect of protein deficiency on the host immune response to an intestinal nematode infection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Koski, Kristine</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301249d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676w897</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Heligmosomatidae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proteins in animal nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice -- Parasites</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zinc -- Physiological effect</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A44558f515"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Impact of water table management on ground water contamination by two herbicides</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Aubin, Eric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two field investigations were undertaken to study the role of water table management in reducing herbicide pollution of ground water. One of the three-year studies (1992-1995) was conducted in a sandy field near Joliette (Laurin farm), (Quebec) to monitor the herbicide metribuzin where potatoes were grown. Two water table management systems were evaluated, namely subsurface drainage and subirrigation. Soil and ground water samples were taken at two week intervals, once before and six times after the herbicide application. The amount of rainfall received in the first few weeks following herbicide application is crucial in assessing the extent of ground water contamination. In 1992, fewer rainfall events occurred after the application as compared to 1993, so metribuzin leached slowly. In 1992, it appears that subirrigation reduced ground water contamination by a factor of 10 through enhanced degradation and the greater effect of dilution. However, the role of subirrigation in reducing the metribuzin contamination of ground water was negligible in 1993 due to considerable leaching soon after the application. The second project was conducted in an organic soil in St-Patrice-de-Sherrington (Van Winden farm) where the herbicide prometryn was studied. Surface irrigation with a controlled water table was also used as a water table management system. One experimental unit was used for each of the three treatments (subirrigation, surface irrigation and subsurface drainage). The herbicide application rate was greater at the Van Winden farm than in the Laurin farm (5.5 kg/ha versus 1.0 kg/ha). However, a higher adsorption coefficient of the organic soil minimized the leaching process. Ground water contamination was less extensive in the organic deposit. The effect of subirrigation in reducing ground water contamination was significant when the water table was shallow. Prometryn degradation was relatively slow during the summer. Moreover, significant amounts of prometryn carried-over into the soil after the winter season, so it appears to be a quite persistent herbicide in our climate.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yong, R.

The hypothesis is that once we can adequately define rhythm, we can then begin to design and implement models to gain insight into the perceptual processes which occur when listening to rhythmic sequences. This research outlines studies which have attempted to define and outline both the structure and the perception of rhythm. Based on the conclusions of these investigations, a computer model is designed and implemented using connectionist techniques. The emphases on this model are to arrive at a viable solution for extracting rhythmic material from performed input, and to implement time-scale invariance. Time-scale invariance allows the system to recognize (categorize) similar patterns played at different tempos as being the same pattern. The performance of this model is evaluated against earlier models designed with similar neural network architectures as well as in relation to the conclusions drawn by music theorists and psychologists.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pennycook, Bruce</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w1056.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801ph611</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Musical meter and rhythm</dc:subject><dc:subject>Auditory perception</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music -- Data processing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9w0324248"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Van Dyck at the court of Charles I : thoughts on court life and the portraits of the Garter Sovereign</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abouzia, Roya</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Anthony van Dyck's contemporary vision of sovereignty and knighthood made him the principal image-maker in England during the 1630s. His portraits of Charles I exemplified the Arcadian realm and philosophies held at court, as well as complying with the artistic and historical traditions of English painting. As a celebration of Monarchy by Divine Right, Van Dyck's portrayals of the Sovereign summarize the philosophical concepts of knighthood expressed in the Platonic Love theory and the Order of the Garter. Charles I was Defensor Fides, Pater Patriae, the suitor to his lady, and the courtly gentleman--all roles of the knight. Beyond his stylistic influence, Van Dyck's foremost contribution was the endowment of maiestas to the royal image, followed by divine apotheosis for posterity. A better understanding of Van Dyck's Charles as the Garter Sovereign leads us to modify our perception of the artist, since he became the painter of contemporary British history.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glen, Thomas L.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hq964.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w0324248</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Charles I, King of England, 1600-1649 -- Portraits</dc:subject><dc:subject>Van Dyck, Anthony, Sir, 1599-1641 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tw44k"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Irish body : in sickness and in health</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gray, Teresa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous research on healing in Ireland has primarily been the concern of folklorists. Based on interviews with a variety of healers, this thesis broadens our understanding of healing in Ireland by considering the socio-political context within which healing beliefs and practices occur. Theory from the anthropology of the body and the critical interpretive approach within medical anthropology provide means for exploring how the body is used as a symbol to express anxiety about social change in Ireland and how individual bodies are socialized and regulated within an economy of power. Prevailing views of the correct "Irish body" are shown to be important elements of Irish identity, especially vis-a-vis the outside world. By drawing attention to the significance of key themes of healing within contemporary Irish society, this thesis suggests that "Irishness" is inscribed in the body in healing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Aronson, Dan R.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25x973g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tw44k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Irish -- Ethnic identity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body, Human -- Ireland -- Symbolic aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Healers -- Ireland</dc:subject><dc:subject>Traditional medicine -- Ireland</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6m311q54q"><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French Language and Literature</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>L'expression narrative du doute dans le Tiers livre de Rabelais</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Erhahon, Evbuawemwenruhe Evelyn</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mg79m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311q54q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rabelais, François, ca. 1490-1553?
