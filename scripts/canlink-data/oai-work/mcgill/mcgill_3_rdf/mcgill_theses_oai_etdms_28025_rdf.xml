determination of the mechanical axis of the knee on a short X-ray : a new radiographic technique</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Labib, Sameh A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most authors recommend drawing the mechanical axis on a three-foot (90 cm) full leg length x-ray for accurate assessment of knee alignment. Three foot x-rays are difficult to perform and reproduce and involve undue radiation to the gonads. The purpose of this project is to propose a new radiographic technique whereby the mechanical axis of the knee can be assessed on a short A/P x-ray of the entire tibia. Methodology. 21 normal adults and 25 patients with malaligned knees were investigated in the following manner--the patient was x-rayed in standing position with the legs positioned exactly parallel to one another and vertical to the floor. Under these circumstances, the ankles were apart by a distance (distance F$ sb1$) equal to the distance between the femoral heads (distance F). The mechanical axes were hence parallel to one another and parallel to the long axis of the x-ray cassette and vertical to the floor. Two separate x-rays were taken, a three-foot (90cm) long x-ray and a short x- ray of the entire tibia. The mechanical axis was determined on the 90 cm, three-foot long x-ray. A vertical line drawn on the short x-ray starting from the centre of the ankle and extended upwards and parallel to the long axis of the x-ray cassette could accurately identify the mechanical axis of the knee using either technique. (Fig. 1) The technique has been called the "Parallel Mechanical Axes X-ray Technique". It has been validated and it will be demonstrated that such an x-ray technique: (1) Standardizes positioning of the lower extremities. (2) Is a precise, easily controllable method to assess knee alignment. (3) A short x-ray of the entire tibia is sufficient, thus reducing the cost of x-rays by 50%. (4) Obviates the need to visualize the pelvis thus minimizing net radiation exposure. (5) May be used in clinics and smaller hospitals, since it requires simple and inexpensive x-ray facilities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Laurin, C.

Linear discriminant function analyses were performed on a subset of data from a large prospective pain prevalence study. The relationships among selected demographic, medical, psychological, and cognitive variables with the development of chronic pain was examined in 371 hospitalized patients experiencing acute pain at the initial interview. Pain was assessed at follow-up interviews (3 weeks, 3 and 6 months). A prediction equation maximizing the differences between the group who subsequently developed chronic pain and the group whose pain resolved was developed. Patients who developed chronic pain reported significantly higher pain intensity levels continuing to the 3-week follow-up, higher anxiety and distress levels continuing to the 3-week follow-up, less certainty that their pain would resolve, had been hospitalized for a longer period of time in the past year, were less independent in their ambulation, and were more likely to have a diagnosis of trauma and not to have undergone surgery. Multiple factors contributed to the development of chronic pain. An awareness of these factors could lead to early identification of those individuals with acute pain who are at risk for developing chronic pain.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jeans, Mary Ellen</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074w361.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb4949701</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak3569565j"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Etude spectroscopique des vapeurs de cuivre d'un arc en rotation dans l'argon contaminé</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Desaulniers-Soucy, Nicolas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An emission spectroscopy study was performed on a magnetically rotated electric arc between two concentric copper electrodes. Two methods were proposed to analyse the recordings of the line intensities as the arc column passed in front of the optical system. The averaging of a series of intensity profiles was the first method. Consistancy between the average value of some parameters applied to these profiles and the value of these parameters on the average quantity was checked. Volumetric emissivity profiles were then obtained. The second method consisted of electronic integration of line intensities during several arc passings. The proportionality between this average intensity and the maximum emissivity in the arc column was checked. These two methods were used to determine the copper vapour density and the arc temperature as a function of two contaminants in the main argon flux: carbon monoxyde and nitrogen. The temperature was slightly superior to 7500 K in the first case and slightly inferior in the second. Maximum copper vapour density found was 5 10$ sp{21}$ m$ sp{-3}$ in argon contaminated with carbon monoxide. It was probably higher than 10$ sp{22}$ m$ sp{-3}$ in Argon contaminated with nitrogen.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Buchinger, Fritz</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Meunier, Jean-Luc</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b5919598.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569565j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Optics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472x61d"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of support and landing surface stiffness in the control of jump downs in humans</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bastien, Madeleine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The kinematics, temporal and sequential organization of the lower limb joints were assessed during jump downs at a constant height (45 cm) in seven practised subjects under four conditions: (SS) stiff takeoff and landing, (SC) stiff takeoff and compliant landing, (CS) compliant takeoff and stiff landing, and (CC) compliant takeoff and landing surfaces. The timing and sequencing of joint motions were unaffected by the compliance of the takeoff or landing surfaces. During takeoff ankle adjustments may have been influenced by proprioceptive inputs about the takeoff surface compliance, whereas knee adjustments could mean that the landing program interferes with the takeoff. Adjustments prior to, at, and post landing depended on the landing surface compliance and suggest that different strategies might have been employed to control joint motions. This study may provide valuable information on the coordinative strategies used to encounter various surfaces as found in the natural environment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McKinley, Patricia A.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f471s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472x61d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x2566"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structure and reactivity of monolayer and micelle interfaces</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wei, Ling, 1961-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research in this thesis is focused on the structure and reactivity of monolayer and micelle interfaces. The kinetic results of ring formations of a series of $ sigma$-($ omega$-bromoalkoxy)phenoxides in a cationic micellar environment (CTAB) revealed that the ring closure rate constants from the 7-membered ring to the 14-membered ring decrease by $ sim$6-fold. This is much smaller than that observed for a homogeneous reaction environment ($ sim$1500-fold). In addition, micellar effective molarities (EM)$ sb{ rm m}$ for these reactions are found to be 7 to 1900 fold greater than in homogeneous solution. This catatysis can be reasoned to originate from an increase in the ground-state free energy of the substrate induced by localization of the phenolate oxygen and alkyl bromide moieties at the polar micelle interface. Monolayer isotherm studies establish a dependence of isotherm features on the structure of the phospholipid. It is found that the liftoff area increases as the position of the second hydrophilic group is located further from the dominate polar group. The transition pressure reaches its highest value when the substituent is in the 7-position. The condensed area for almost all these substrates gives nearly the same value ($ sim$45 A$ sp2$/molecule). These may be explained by that the molecules lie flatly on the air/water interface at high surface concentration after which the hydrophobic parts in a molecule are forced out of the water surface. The hydrophilic groups remain on the water surphase so as to produce a loop conformation. At high pressure all the molecules are approximately perpendicular to the water surface so as to form a highly dense packing state. The unusually broad first order phase transition in isotherms of some boloform and macrocyclic phospholipids is consistent with these substrates being reorientated at large areas to yield stable bilayers, trilayers, etc.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lennox, R.

It combines complex shaping with high green densities, resulting in low shrinkage and good densification behaviour. This method, however, has received little attention in the field of engineering ceramics especially with regard to silicon nitride. Commercial fabrication of silicon nitride, a major contender for high temperature applications due to its excellent thermomechanical properties, has been confined to hot pressing. This is an expensive process and has geometrical limitations. Slip casting, followed by sintering, has been identified as a potentially economical alternative fabrication method, however a number of parameters have to be optimized before a good slip cast silicon nitride body can be made. The aim of the present work is to control parameters such as pH, viscosity and deflocculation in order to form dense, homogeneous, slip cast silicon nitride bodies. A detailed investigation of the rheological properties of Si$ sb3$N$ sb4$ and careful control of processing parameters, made it possible to produce slip cast Si$ sb3$N$ sb4$ bodies having up to 97% TD on sintering. Mechanical strength values obtained by slip casting were compared with those obtained by die-pressing. Strength values of the slip cast material was limited by iron inclusions entrained in processing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>ew, R. A.

As a paradigmatic extremity, it circumscribes the field of civic artifice. Babel is the absolute limit, and in that regard, its presence is enduring and timeless. The legacy of exegetic readings are textual shades, emanating from the point source of the paradigm. Athanasius Kircher's Turris Babel is an appropriate and intentional unfolding of this condition. Firstly, that in the awakening of the Baroque scholar to history, origin materializes as the sole legitimate chronological reference. Secondly, that the paradigmatic extremities collapse into the empirical standard of the theoretical discourse. This thesis is a speculative study of architecture, drawn through Turris Babel, in the shadow of the paradigmatic limits of Babel. Written in three parts, each dealing with the implications of artifice in confrontation with the post-Babel adversaries of dispersion, tyranny, and decay.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf84w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k839c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Semitic languages -- Early works to 1800</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hamitic languages -- Early works to 1800</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kircher, Athanasius, 1602-1680.

Climatological seasonal cycles were calculated by averaging the weekly ice cover fraction means over the sampling period. The interannual variability was investigated using seasonal and monthly means. The major findings are the positive trend of the seasonal means and the prominence of variability at the interdecadal scale (12-15 yr). Relationships with runoff, monthly surface air temperature, monthly air circulation, autumnal water salinity and temperature profiles, and particular climatic events are investigated to determine the major causes of the variability. From the original 83-cell grid data, the monthly-averaged icefields of the Gulf were calculated and their maps generated for the months of January, February, March, April and May for every sample year.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ingram, R.

In the last fifty years, social and material change, prompted by residential schooling and the growth of settlement life, have catalyzed a shift in teenage perceptions of parental authority and norms of social relations. Today the peer group is a pre-eminent agent of socialization, generating pressure to drink and be sexually active. The peer group also, in part, sustains the valuation of motherhood, and some indigenous norms of interpersonal communication and socially appropriate behaviour. In this contemporary context, the meanings of teenage childbearing are multiple, and different for each individual. Although a biological fact, teenage pregnancy may also be seen as a product of how differentials in power between teenagers, their peers and people of different age and social groupings are played out. The construction of a category of adolescence and the centrality of fertility and reproduction are keys to understanding the social and symbolic significance of teenage pregnancy. This analysis emphasizes the interactive relationship between historical change, ideological beliefs and individual perceptions in shaping the meaning of teenage pregnancy in a Cree community.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lock, Margaret</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741t029.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719n57s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teenage pregnancy -- Québec (Province) -- Mistassini</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cree Indians</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
