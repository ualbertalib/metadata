The energy response was also  measured for TLD-100H card-mounted dosimeters encapsulated in Teflon RTM, used as  part of the Harshaw Type 8855 environmental dosimeter. The EGSnrc Monte Carlo system  was used to calculate the dose to the TLDs in both the bare chip holder and the 8855  dosimeter, in order to calculate the thermoluminescence per unit of absorbed dose to  the TLDs. The results were broadly consistent with existing data, with the response  of both TLD materials correlating with the ionization density of the photon  beams.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ross, Carl K.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930bx77f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hs527</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rp29w"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Lower limb joint kinematics of hockey skating</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chang, Ryan, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to describe various kinematic  variables of the skating stride.

Three velocities were examined on the skating treadmill: slow (12  km/hr), medium (18 km/hr) and fast (24 km/hr). Electrogoniometers at the hip (H),  knee (K) and ankle (ANK) were used to acquire angular displacement and velocity  profiles. A trend for increasing range of motion and a significant (p &lt; 0.05)  increase in stride rate was observed with speed.

Its subcellular localization appears to  dictate which pathways become activated. Although clathrin-mediated endocytosis  plays a role in this targeting, molecular components that specifically regulate Trk  internalization have not been explicitly identified. I will present evidence that  GIPC1 can act to couple TrkA to the endocytic machinery. GIPC1 is able to associate  with the endocytic proteins AP-2 and Eps15 in a NGF-dependent manner.  Over-expression of GIPC1 in Cos7 cells blocked internalization of the transferrin  receptor while its over-expression in PC12 cells also inhibited internalization of  TrkA. Lastly, GIPC1 is able to promote the formation of a complex between TrkA and  Eps15. Therefore, GIPC1 appears to be involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and  these observations indicate that it may act to target TrkA to forming CCVs. Work  examining possible mechanisms for regulating GIPC1's activity will also be  presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kaplan, David</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v8381198.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz183</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj96021256"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The regulation of PHEX expression by 5/6 nephrectomy and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin Dâ‚ƒ</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brewer, Angela</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mutations in the PHEX gene are responsible for X-linked  hypophosphatemia, the most prevalent form of inherited rickets in humans. PHEX is an  endopeptidase that is expressed in bone and parathyroid gland and shown to cleave  parathyroid hormone [PTH]. To determine whether PHEX is regulated by PTH we used two  models: (1) 5/6 nephrectomized [5/6 Nx] rats which exhibit significant  hyperparathyroidism and (2) 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D]-treated rats,  which are characterized by marked hypoparathyroidism. We demonstrate that 5/6 Nx  elicits an increase in PHEX mRNA and protein abundance in rat tibia whereas  1,25(OH)2D causes a decrease in both tibial parameters. In addition, administration  of 1,25(OH)2D to 5/6 Nx rats blunts the increase in PHEX gene expression in bone. We  also observe a significant correlation between serum PTH concentration and tibial  PHEX expression. Our data thus provides evidence for a role of PTH in the regulation  of PHEX expression.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tenenhouse, H.

It controls gene expression by heterodimerizing with RXRs on RA response elements.  We hypothesised that Erk1/2 inhibits RARbeta2 transcriptional activity in  RARbeta2-expressing and RA-resistant cell lines by phosphorylating RXRalpha.  Treatment of RA-resistant, RARbeta2-expressing cell lines (A549 and Hs578t) and a RA  sensitive cell line (H157) with PD98059 synergized with RA in inhibiting growth.  Cloning an active mutant of MEK1 (MEK1DD) into H157 made these cells around 40% less  sensitive to ATRA. EGF-mediated Erk1/2 activation inhibited the ATRA-induced  transcription of both a synthetic reporter and an endogenous (RARbeta) gene. In both  cases, PD98059 reversed this inhibition. Finally, MEK1DD inhibited to approximately  90% transcription from the reporter gene. These results indicate that Erk1/2 reduces  RA-mediated transcription by all RARs, possibly by phosphorylating RXRalpha and that  RA may be effective clinically when used in combination with drugs acting upstream  of MEK1/2 such as Iressa and Herceptin.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bradley, W.

The thesis aims  to determine whether the transposition of EC legislation has been undertaken with a  view to effective implementation of the acquis communautaire and to assess what  implications this process will have for the Czech Republic. To this end, three areas  of law which are subject to approximation are examined, namely competition law,  environmental law and company law. Accordingly, Chapter I provides a general  overview of the process of approximation and the challenges it poses for the Czech  Republic. The process of approximation in the field of competition law is examined  in Chapter II, followed by environmental law in Chapter III. The area of company law  is addressed in Chapter IV. Finally, Chapter V concludes with an analysis of the  findings of the previous chapters with a discussion of the implications of  approximation for the legal order of the Czech Republic.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Janda, R.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gh02v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712m7245</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corporation law -- European Economic Community countries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antitrust law -- Czech Republic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corporation law -- Czech Republic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antitrust law -- European Economic Community countries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental law -- Czech Republic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental law -- European Economic Community countries</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m479n"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Constructing a basis of corporate liability for massive violations of human rights : using the common core of European private law</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kuzmarov, Betina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a three point argument, it is asserted that general  principles of law can be used to establish liability of corporations for massive  violations of human rights.

Satellite communications being activities  that intrinsically have a global outreach, mutatis mutandis they require legal rules  that would not focus on purely regional or local interests. National and  international space law have for the past decade encountered criticism with respect  to obvious insufficiencies that in turn affected space activities. The first  reaction of learned space lawyers was to call for some redrafting of international  space law. A second thought about it had them take into account national legislation  in this possible harmonization process, but in any case this was to primarily be of  concern for States. However, the new millennium has brought its share of  intellectual renewal and in the field of space law it has been translated in the  acknowledgement that the private sector would have an important role to play, on the  international scene, for the improvement of space law. It is this new legal thinking  that has been characterized as "international cooperation" as applied to  the private sector, that is the subject of this study. Hence, what is looked at is  the position of the satellite communications sector on the international scene and  what expertise it has to share with public fora for the overall improvement of space  law and space activities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jaichu, Ram</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf392.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn9997323</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Artificial satellites in telecommunication -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Space law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Telecommunication -- International cooperation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p528k"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Project financing power plants in Mexico</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Banerjee Bhattacharya, Asmita</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Project finance is a debt finance and risk allocation technique.

In such projects, there is a limited amount of freedom for the  negotiation of the contractual terms and conditions. Contracts for the engineering, procurement and construction of  power plants implemented under the project finance structure are subject to the  ordinary law of contracts as opposed to the administrative law which may place the  government in a stronger bargaining position. Regardless of the application of the  private or administrative law the principle of autonomy of will may seem to be  relegated to a secondary level in these transactions.

Rosny the Elder, Maurice Renard and many popular novelists. This literature, however, never succeeded in establishing itself as a literary genre in its own right. It was only with the discovery of American science fiction in the fifties that science fiction was recognized as such in France. The problematic situation of French science fiction before and after 1950 can only be explained by means of sound hypotheses concerning the genological specificity of science fiction, on the one hand, and a thorough textual analysis of works reflecting the various strains of imagination in our period, on the other hand. The introduction reviews the current state of research in science fiction, focussing on the main essays on the history and theory of the genre. We then expose our own hypotheses on science fiction as a "poetics of otherness". An examination of French science fiction from 1918 to 1968 reveals that the genre is made up of heterogeneous strains, despite a real community of themes. There are five such strains, which we analyze through five authors exemplifying their specific characteristics: (1) A strain whose particular characteristic is the appeal of "otherness": J.-H. Rosny the Elder; (2) A strain that could be called "middle-of-the-road science fiction", which is a blend of science fiction proper, the fantastic and the popular novel: Maurice Renard; (3) The "catastrophic imagination" strain: Jacques Spitz; (4) The mass-produced science fiction strain: B. R. Bruss; (5) A strain characterized by an "imaginative drift": Stefan Wul. In conclusion, the chronic state of crisis of French science fiction is interpreted as a symptom of the difficulty in achieving this literary genre's potential as a "poetics of otherness".</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p099r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dd098</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Science fiction, French -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rp31x"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Price changes and movements in the composition of output and employment in Canada : theoretical framework and empirical analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Seccareccia, Mario</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis directs attention to the way in which the economics profession has sought to explain the phenomenon of inflation. The first half is primarily a detailed survey of the mainstream postwar literature in this area. The first five chapters provide a comprehensive review and a critical reappraisal of the basic theoretical contributions of successive theorists. The second half of the thesis proposes an alternative approach built essentially upon the early ideas of the neo-Wicksellian over-investment writers and upon the underlying 'structural' model found in Keynes' Treatise on Money. The problem of whether market organization affects the relationship between inflation and the structure of output and employment is also examined, and it is found to be of little importance. The Keynes-Wicksell structural model is then tested against Canadian time-series data for the period 1924-1981. Despite uneven results, the empirical findings give definite importance to the structural variable in explaining price formation in Canada.

The dissertation comprises an annotated selection of Stringer's correspondence and a discussion of him as man of letters. The Introduction draws on Stringer's personal papers--including unpublished manuscripts, notebooks, and correspondence--to illustrate his working methods, his relationship with editors and publishers, and the role he played in the literary community. The letters selected show Stringer handling the daily problems of authorship, giving support to other Canadian writers, and (in the letters written for publication) discussing literature and literary criticism. The dissertation includes a chronology, a check-list of Stringer's books, notes on his correspondents, and a list of the repositories of his letters.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182k81x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j6731460j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stringer, Arthur, 1874-1950 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stringer, Arthur, 1874-1950 -- Correspondence</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63sw52p"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pathologic effects of estradiol on the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Schipper, Hyman M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The pathologic effects of sex steroids on the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of adult rats were examined using numbers of reactive microglia and astrocytic granules as quantitative indices of neuropathology. Microglial and astrocytic reactions were observed in adult female rats entering a state of "persistent estrus" following a single injection of 2 mg estradiol valerate (EV) or exposure to continuous illumination. Lower doses of EV failed to elicit both the persistent estrus state and significant glial responses. In EV-treated animals, a hypothalamic lesion could be prevented by prior ovariectomy or by pituitary-ovarian suppression with medroxyprogesterone acetate indicating that an ovarian factor is responsible for the neuropathological changes. This ovarian product is probably estradiol since dose-related enhancement of glial reactivity occurs in male rats treated with multiple injections of EV. Arcuate pathology developed spontaneously in "senile persistent estrus" female and aging male rats. In females, but not in males, early gonadectomy suppressed age-related arcuate glial reactivity. Conceivably, estrogen withdrawal or EV-treatment respectively retards or accelerates histologic aging of the female gonadotropic hypothalamus. Testosterone treatment occasionally elicited mild arcuate glial responses, possibly through prior aromatization to estradiol. In contrast, 5 (alpha)-dihydrotestosterone (a non-aromatizable androgen) appeared to suppress astrocytic granule counts below control values. The EV-induced persistent estrus rat may serve as a useful model for Clover disease of the ewe and the human polycystic ovarian syndrome.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brawer, James R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nh71n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw52p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57nr62k"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The immunobiology of feto-maternal relationships</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chatterjee-Hasrouni, Saswati</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Immune mechanisms underlying the non-rejection of the allogeneic fetus and the placenta were investigated. Whether paternal type Class 1 major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens, which were detectable on dispersed trophoblast cells of the placenta, were sequestered away from the maternal face of these cells in vivo, was examined radioautographically after a local arterial perfusion of the placenta with ('25)I-labeled monoclonal anti-H-2K antibody. The results revealed significant and specific labeling of the sinusoidal face of labyrinthine trophoblast cells, in direct contact with maternal blood. However, trophoblast cells examined radioautographically after exposure to polyspecific or monoclonal anti-Ia antibody revealed a paucity of cell surface Ia (Class 2 MHC) antigens, which may be responsible for the low immunogenicity of these cells. Systemic changes in maternal T lymphocyte subsets were analysed radioautographically on the basis of I-J and Lyt surface markers. The appearance of I-J bearing cells and an increase in Ly 2,3 bearing cells in various maternal lymphoid organs during the course of pregnancy indicated the presence of suppressor T cells during pregnancy, more appreciably so during allogeneic pregnancy. To evaluate the functional significance of our observations of an influx of null non T, non B lymphocytes from the bone marrow to the secondary lymphoid organs of the mother, changes in the natural killer (NK) cell population, known to be a subset of null cells, were analysed. An increase in the NK activity as well as the incidence of NK lineage cells identified by the tumor-target binding ability of null lymphocytes, were seen during allogeneic pregnancy. Such an increase was not apparently deleterious to the fetus. Thus, local rather than systemic mechanisms must be sought to explain the survival of the feto-placental allograft.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p0967712.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57nr62k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784m381"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of peanut mottle virus infection upon nodulation of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wongkaew, Sopone</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effects of peanut mottle virus (PMV) infection upon nodulation and nodule function of Early Prolific peanut, inoculated with either effective or ineffective cowpea Rhizobium grown under controlled conditions, were assessed at 4 different growth stages. Virus-infected plants showed differences in symptom expression, magnitude of yield reduction, and nodulation pattern, depending on whether they harbored the effective or ineffective rhizobial strain. In the virus-infected plants with effective Rhizobium, the commencing of nitrogenase (C(,2)H(,2)) activity was delayed and the activity measured per plant basis was reduced but the maximum nodular specific activity was not altered as compared with those of the healthy plants. There was no correlation between leghemoglobin content and nitrogenase (C(,2)H(,2)) specific activity of the nodules from PMV-infected plants but a positive correlation was observed in the healthy controls. The results from infectivity assays, electron microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence indicate the presence of infective PMV in the tissues of both effective and ineffective nodules. Histological and cytological abnormalities observed in the nodular tissues of PMV-infected plants are suggested as a cause of reduced nitrogen-fixation efficiency of the peanut.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278t67z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784m381</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Peanuts</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gn95v"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The behaviour of Fe and Co in a Cr based SDW host</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wilford, Donald Francis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I have measured the magnetic and transport properties of Fe and Co in the variable SDW host, CrMo. Analyzing the behaviour of the Neel temperature shows that Co interacts with the SDW, almost an order of magnitude more strongly than does Fe. Also that it magnetically polarizes the SDW more strongly than Fe. Resistivity measurements show that Co reduces the nesting area of the Fermi surface while Fe increases it. Overall, the Neel temperature is strongly reduced by Fe and much less reduced by Co. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show that Fe supports an effective magnetic moment below T(,N) while Co does not. However, as suggested by Friedel, only nearest neighbour Fe pairs contribute to the effective Fe moment, while isolated Fe moments, like Co, are locked into the SDW antiferromagnetism. In the absence of SDW formation, the strong interaction between Co and the CrMo host leads to a Kondo state, while the smaller interaction with Fe allows the onset of spin glass ordering.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q212x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gn95v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cobalt -- Magnetic properties</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chromium-molybdenum-iron alloys -- Magnetic properties</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ferromagnetism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electron transport</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spin waves</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rv07b"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Some factors affecting problem solving effectiveness in business : a study of management consultants</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wade, Peter F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous research has concluded that individuals develop relatively invariant problem solving 'styles' which cause them to be more comfortable and effective in certain task environments. This study of management consultants, employing a self descriptive questionnaire, found that fifteen measured attributes clustered onto three factors: a line/staff orientation, a grounded/ungrounded approach to problem conceptualization, and a rational/instinctive approach to conclusion drawing. Attributes were analyzed by functional area, consulting firm, task effectiveness, potential to become a partner, etc. Task performance ratings and personality assessments were provided by supervisors. It was found that many of the attributes studied did not correlate with task effectiveness ratings, but did with other assessments made by the supervisors. Many predicted behavioural characteristics were confirmed. Certain attributes were found to cluster by function and firm. Some claims made for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Kolb Learning Style Inventory were confirmed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq38r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rv07b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Decision making</dc:subject><dc:subject>Business consultants</dc:subject><dc:subject>Management -- Research</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55z845p"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Synthesis on some new-l-lactam antibiotics : a thesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ugolini, Antonio</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The syntheses of the cephalosporin analogs cis-N-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylacetamido-4-hydroxymethyl-2-azetidinone (37), cis-N-(2'-hydroxy-5'-nitrophenyl)-3-phenylacetamido-4-hydroxymethyl-2-azetidinone (59) and 7-(beta)-phenylacetamido-3'-hydroxybenzo{3,4}-0,2-isocephem (77) are described.

An explanation is sought in the changing food market linkages between producers and consumers. To this end the nature of consumer demand, the conduct and marketing strategies of processors and retailers, their productivity and competitiveness are reviewed in turn. It is shown that the market system is inherently dynamic and increased vertical control is identified as a key factor. Its role in the process of change is explained in terms of the joint working of economic and political forces. Much policy is found inadvertently to reinforce existing trends. An explanation is suggested in the failure to recognise the complexity of the market process. As a result structural rigidity now threatens the market system. All this is directly evidenced in the spatial characteristics of the farm landscape. Policies are suggested to resolve the issue and strengthen the farm sector.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956g47k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r6273</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agriculture -- Economic aspects -- QuÃ©bec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Farm produce -- QuÃ©bec (Province) -- Marketing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Farm produce -- Marketing -- Case studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pb06r"><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Russian and Slavic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The illusion of off-stage life in theatre and its application to Chekhov's drama : an analysis of The sea gull</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Slejskova, Nadezda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cette etude developpe un concept original en theorie dramatique: "l'illusion de la vie hors-scene," moyen auquel a recours le dramaturge quand le monde imaginaire qu'il a cree ne peut etre depeint dans sa totalite sur scene a cause des contraintes temporo-spatiales du theatre.

To this effect, conventional cartel theory is expanded so as to include the impact of the major institutional factors, with emphasis on centre-periphery (North-South) relationships, the roles played by governments of producing and consuming countries, by transnational enterprises as well as the particular conditions of supply and demand of various commodities. This framework is applied to bauxite, coffee and sugar industries, because each presents unique characteristics. As a principal focus of this study, a comparative analysis of these commodities is undertaken. The analysis demonstrates that a bauxite cartel has the potential to gain large monopoly profits, but the evidence is against the long run profitability and stability of coffee and sugar cartels. The differences in the characteristics of the primary commodities differentiate the behaviour of cartels and the expected outcomes. Ultimately, the benefits of successful cartels will have to be measured by how the financial gains are used to transform internal structures, eliminate poverty, and promote social justice. As well as being useful for the study of primary commodity cartels in general, this analysis can also aid policy makers concerned with producer cartels.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010q71s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75r857z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bauxite</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sugar trade</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trusts, Industrial</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coffee industry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Commodity control</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
