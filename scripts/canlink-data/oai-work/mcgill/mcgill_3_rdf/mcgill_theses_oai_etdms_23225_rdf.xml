Both route of administration and formulation dramatically affected the bioconversion of netobimin (NTB) pro-drug, N-methoxycarbonyl-N$ sp prime$-(2-nitro-5-propylphenylthio)-${ rm N} sp{ prime prime}$-(2-ethyl sulphonic acid) guanidine, and the bioavailability and disposition kinetics of its active albendazole (ABZ) metabolites in both sheep and cattle. The efficacy of NTB conversion by the gastrointestinal (GI) microflora, was markedly lower after subcutaneous (SC) administration of NTB pro-drug compared with enteral administrations in both species. Although trisamine and zwitterion formulations of NTB were bioequivalent after SC treatment, the zwitterion suspension was two-fold more bioavailable in terms of ABZ metabolites, after oral administration to cattle. ABZ sulphoxide (ABZSO) and ABZ sulphone (ABZSO$ sb2$), the main metabolites found in plasma, were reversibly exchanged between plasma and GI compartments and concentrated in the abomasum. ABZ, ABZSO and ABZSO$ sb2$ were detected in the GI tract for 72 h post-NTB administration to cattle. In vitro, ABZ was oxidized into ABZSO and ABZSO$ sb2$ by liver microsomes and ruminal and ileal fluids. However, only ABZSO was reduced (back to ABZ) by these GI fluids. The rate of ABZ sulphoxidation by liver microsomes was significantly lower in cattle compared to sheep. However, while the oxidizing activity was greater in GI fluids of cattle, the reducing activity was prevalent in those of sheep. This was consistent with the higher ABZSO$ sb2$/ABZSO ratio and the markedly faster disposition of both metabolites in cattle compared to sheep.

The effects of altering the backbone, the type of ammonium group, the number of ammonium group, the hydrophobicity of the pendant group, and of varying the metal ions on the adsorption of BS's, were studied to elucidate the structure-activity relationship. The binding capacity of the resins for BS's generally increased with increasing number of ammonium groups per pendant group of the ammonium-bearing resins, and with higher charge of the metal complex cation of the metal-ion coordinated resin, demonstrating the primary importance of electrostatic interactions. It was also observed that, as the resin backbone was changed from hydrophilic polyacrylamide to hydrophobic polystyrene, the adsorption capacity increased substantially, demonstrating that hydrophobic interactions (H-H's) between the resin backbone and the BS's also play a significant role in the binding. The incorporation of hydrophobic segments -(CH$ sb2) sb{ rm n}$- into the pendant groups on polyacrylamide resins increased binding capacity, but had no effect for the more hydrophobic polystyrene resins. Primary ammonium-bearing resins often showed higher binding capacities than their quarternary analogs, suggesting that H-bonding reinforces the binding. Isotherms with an S-shape observed for most polyacrylamide resins indicate a positive cooperativity in the binding due to H-H's and H-bonding among BS anions bound at adjacent positions within resin beads. Binding models have been proposed to depict the formation of pendant group-BS mixed reversed micelles and ordinary BS micelles. The studies of the kinetics of the binding of BS anions by the resins showed that a small resin particle size and more intense shaking substantially increase the rate of binding. This indicates that the binding process is mainly controlled by the diffusion of BS anions near and within the beads.

This work dealt with the development of a simple forecast model to time fungicide application to manage the blight. Two studies were conducted to examine the effect of relative humidity (65, 88, 92, 96%, and wet) temperature (15, 20, 25, and 28 C) and exposure period (6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr) on spore production. Spores were produced at all levels of relative humidity and temperature tested. Overall spore production increased with increasing relative humidity. The greatest and the least were produced after a 48 hr wet period at 20 and 28 C, respectively. Two regression models were developed to predict spore production as functions of relative humidity and temperature. In order to validate the infection function model a field experiment was conducted in 1989 to quantify latent period. A mean latent period beginning of 12 days, a mean latent period 50% of 14 days, and a mean latent period ending of 19 days were established. Two regression models were developed to predict latent period beginning and latent period ending as functions of mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures. In order to develop a simple forecast model field experiments were conducted in 1989 and 1990. From these studies two simple forecast models are proposed to initiate fungicide applications: (1) Initial disease occurrence. (2) A cumulative disease severity value (CDSV) of 23. Using the forecasts proposed it is possible to reduce five to seven applications of fungicides during the celery growing season in Quebec.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hq54m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/765372006</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Septoria apiicola</dc:subject><dc:subject>Celery -- Diseases and pests -- Control</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62f905d"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification of integrins on the central nervous system glia and their function in cell-substratum contacts</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tawil, Nabil Jean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The rat integrin $ alpha sb1$ subunit was purified, its N-terminal sequence and its full cDNA sequence were obtained. The $ alpha sb1$ subunit is found complexed with the $ beta sb1$ subunit forming a heterodimer that mediates the adhesion of type-1 astrocytes to laminin and collagen. Cultured type-1 astrocytes also express other functional integrins from the $ beta sb1$ and $ beta sb3$ subclasses. Type-2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes express different arrays of $ beta sb1$ and $ beta sb3$ integrins suggesting that CNS glia interact differentially with the extracellular matrix. Integrins on type-1 astrocytes are localized either to focal contacts or point contacts. In well spread astrocytes, most integrins are concentrated in focal contacts. This thesis presents the first evidence that integrins in point contacts are functional mediating the adhesion and spreading of type-1 astrocytes. Unlike integrins in focal contacts, integrins in point contacts rarely colocalize with actin or vinculin and instead they codistribute with clathrin. These point contacts are also seen on the cell body and growth cones of dorsal root ganglion neurons (Wilson and Carbonetto, unpublished data) suggesting that point contacts are common cell-substratum contacts for neural and non-neural cells.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t7134.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f905d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qs860"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The images of women in western and eastern epic literature : an analysis in three major epics, The Shahnameh, The Iliad and The Odyssey</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Naraghi, Akhtar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The central thesis of this work is twofold: (1) contrary to the images perpetuated in works of criticism, there exists no sustained misogyny in the text of exemplar epics by Ferdowsi and Homer, or antagonism toward women rooted in the poets' attitude, and (2) using the principle of androcentric (rather than gynocentric) feminist literary theory we have tried to prove the existence of a "systematic inconsistency" in the roles and images assigned to the women of The Shahnameh, the Iliad, and Odyssey. We have identified the presence of a double structure concerning the question of women. Instead of endlessly praising the female characters, or fully condemning the portrayal of such figures, we have instead tried to turn the issues around and examined opposed aspects in female roles and images. We have examined the conflict of opposites and the systematic inconsistency within each text in which a double structure splits the female image in two directions: one force is represented by exalted, praiseworthy, and positive images endowing women with powerful characteristics such as prowess, courage, wisdom, insight, fearlessness, and a host of other attributes. Yet within the same text, the same woman, through another force, is not only relegated to a subservient role, but also finds imposed upon her the condition of not being taken seriously, severe handicaps regarding her full integration in the social fabric of the story, and not being allowed to use her considerable abilities. Within this paradoxical double structure, it is not that one structure eventually cancels out the other, rather the coexistence of both structures in the same work results in the readers' suspension between the conclusions each of them separately urges. The dichotomy in the characterization of women in epic literature is not limited to a single culture; a consistent thread runs through the universal inconsistency in the make-up of women in epic. The thread runs across the border between the East and the West, wherever that border may be drawn on the map geographically, historically, or culturally.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rv258.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qs860</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epic literature -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qj508"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evolutionary links between the class III transposable phages MU and D108 and the class II transposons, Tn3 and IS101</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cameron, Robin K. (Robin Katrine)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It has been observed that the class III bacteriophages Mu and D108 and the class II elements, Tn3, Tn1000, IS101 and Tn951, share the characteristics of replicatively transposing to random positions, producing 5 bp target site duplications and of containing the sequence 5$ sp prime$-PUCGAAAPu-3$ sp prime$ at bp 21 from their ends. These shared characteristics led to the hypothesis that these class III and class II elements evolved from a common ancestor transposon. Functional evidence which supports this hypothesis was obtained using the band retardation and in vivo transposition-mating assays. Mu and D108 transposase proteins were shown to mediate the formation of specific protein-DNA complexes with the ends of Tn3 and IS101, but not with the ends of the IS102 element (class I) demonstrating the conservation of the first step in the transposition reaction between Mu, D108, Tn3 and IS101. Transposition-mating assays with Mu transposase and the Tn3kan element demonstrated that recombination (rec A independent) products between Tn3kan-containing plasmids and the target (pOX38cam) were formed in the absence of Mu transposase, but their formation was stimulated 200-fold in the presence of Mu transposase protein. These transposition-mating products were resolved in rec $A sp+$ hosts, to generate resolution products suggestive of replicative transposition. Upon subsequent analysis, it was shown that the resolved products (pOX38cam::Tn3kan) had not been cleaved precisely at the Tn3kan element ends, but in the adjacent donor plasmid (pDV-cam) sequences. Similar experiments with the IS101 element demonstrated that plasmids containing IS101 plus adjacent pSC101 sequences (bp 2233 to 2424), including a formerly unknown, but functional (bound by IHF) IHF site (bp 2238-2251), produced resolvable transposition-mating products in the presence of Mu transposase. These resolution products suggested that IS101 (like Tn3kan) was replicatively transposed. The results presented provide functional evidence that links (evolutionarily) the class III transposable phages Mu and D108 and the class II elements Tn3 and IS101.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gt42m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qj508</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722h966b"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of the genome in Timothy (Phleum pratense L.) : polyploid nature, phylogenetic relationships, and protein variation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cai, Qinyin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The genome constitution and phylogeny of hexaploid timothy (Phleum pratense L., 2n = 42) have been studied with C-banding and genome-specific DNA techniques. The cultivated species and two diploid wild relatives P. alpinum (2n = 14) and P. bertolonii (2n = 14) were karyotyped. In P. pratense, two sets of seven chromosomes could not be distinguished from each other either in gross morphology or in C-banding patterns and the third set was found to be differentiated from them. Two genomes, A and B, were established in this species presumably with the genome formula of AAAABB. The banded karyotype in P. alpinum was close to the A genome and that of P. bertolonii was analogous to the B genome, which suggests these wild species were the genome donors of P. pratense. To reinforce this, a molecular assay was performed with genome-specific probes. Eight clones specific to the genome of P. alpinum and thirteen specific to the genome of P. bertolonii were respectively isolated from the genomic DNA libraries of P. alpinum and P. bertolonii. Three P. alpinum-specific sequences and three P. bertolonii-specific sequences were used as probes to hybridize the DNA of P. pratense on slot blot and Southern blot. All the three P. bertolonii-specific probes and two of the three P. alpinum specific probes exhibited cross-hybridization to P. pratense DNA. This has confirmed the allopolyploid origin of hexaploid P. pratense. In addition, phenotypic variations of seed storage proteins were investigated within the cultivated P. pratense with SDS-PAGE analysis. A total of 44 protein monomers were detected in mature seed extracts from 19 cultivars of timothy. The protein banding patterns were differentiated among all the examined cultivars except for two pairs. Such differentiation makes it possible to identify the timothy cultivars.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225b83b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722h966b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Timothy-grass -- Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g8347"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulation of ornithine-[delta]-aminotransferase in retinoblastomas</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fagan, Richard Joseph</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ornithine Aminotransferase (OAT) is expressed at high levels in liver, kidney, and retina. Tissue-specific regulation of OAT has been described for rat kidney and liver. To characterize OAT regulation in retinal lines, we studied OAT synthesis in retinoblastomas RB355 and Y79. OAT transcription and mRNA levels in the two lines were similar, but 3-fold greater immunoreactive OAT protein and enzyme activity were observed for Y79. Characterization of polysome-associated OAT mRNAs indicated that they were translated less efficiently, due to decreased initiation, in RB355. Initiation factor eIF-4E mRNA and protein were reduced in RB355; eIF-4E overexpression in RB355 increased OAT translation and OAT protein to the level observed in Y79. Estrogen and thyroid hormone increased OAT expression in both strains. Estrogen increased translational initiation, with no effect on transcription, whereas thyroid hormone was primarily a transcriptional activator. An alternatively-spliced OAT mRNA was identified in these retinoblastomas; this mRNA was poorly translated and was not affected by eIF-4E overexpression, estrogen, or thyroid hormone. This study has demonstrated several post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for OAT in retinal tissue.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rozen, Rima</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jm201.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g8347</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Genetic regulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aminotransferases</dc:subject><dc:subject>Retinoblastoma</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ornithine aminotransferase</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831ck80c"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A mathematical model for simulating pesticide fate and dynamics in the environment (PESTFADE)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Clemente, Roberto Sulit</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A one-dimensional transient mathematical model which can predict simultaneous movement of water and reactive solutes through homogeneous soil systems under saturated/unsaturated conditions is developed. The physically-based numerical model, called PESTFADE, considers the interactive processes/mechanisms such as mass flow, plant uptake, adsorption/desorption, dispersion, volatilization, chemical/microbial degradation and runoff in the simulation. The PESTFADE model employs SWACROP, a model developed in the Netherlands, to simulate transient water flow in the unsaturated zone; evaluates non-equilibrium sorption in macropores, analyzes soil heat flow to to model microbial degradation, calculates pesticide partitioning in runoff/sediment as affected by agricultural management practices, and describes first order degradation and sorption kinetics. The governing partial differential equation describing the various processes is solved numerically via the Numerical Method of Lines (NMOL) technique, and the computer programs are written in FORTRAN 77. The resulting computer code (PESTFADE), is run on a microcomputer and has been implemented for interactive simulation on IBM PC or compatible microcomputers. The model was tested and validated using actual data measured from field plot experiments involving herbicide atrazine which was post-emergently applied in a corn field on a loam soil. Various analytical solutions were used to check the accuracy of the different components of PESTFADE, and parametric sensitivity analyses were performed to determine how the model output reacts to changes in some selected input parameters. Results indicate that model predictions generally agreed with measured concentrations of atrazine and compared closely with the analytical solutions. Moreover, model performance tests showed that predicted values are within acceptable ranges of model accuracy and bound of experimental uncertainties. It was also found that the model is very sensitive to degradation rate constant (k), sorption coefficient (K$ sb{ rm d})$ and soil temperature and slightly sensitive to management practice (CN) and sorption site fraction (F). Finally, the various field scenarios and pathways for non-point source contamination evaluated in the study have demonstrated the wide applicability and flexibility of PESTFADE.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bc39w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831ck80c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pesticides -- Environmental aspects -- Computer simulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Herbicide movement -- Computer simulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Groundwater -- Pollution -- Computer simulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Pesticide content -- Computer simulation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axs55mc755"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Indigenous green vegetables used as food and medicine by the K'ekchi people of Alta Verapaz, Guatemala</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Booth, Sarah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The dietary and medicinal uses of indigenous green vegetables were studied quantitatively over a 13-month period in a rural, semi-rural and urban K'ekchi population in Guatemala.

It was demonstrated that such lesions impair performance on tasks that require memory for spatial information but that the deficit depends on both the amount of damage within the region as well as the degree of difficulty of the task. A dissociation in the effect of such lesions on performance of comparable spatial and nonspatial memory tasks was shown. In contrast to the severe deficits observed on spatial memory tasks, the acquisition and retention of a complex nonspatial memory task was not impaired after extensive damage to the mammillary region. Such lesions also did not impair performance on two conditioned aversion tasks. These experiments suggest that the mammillary region may be selectively involved in spatial learning and memory. The relevance of these findings to Korsakoff's syndrome is discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rh84g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv362</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Korsakoff's syndrome</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rats -- Behavior</dc:subject><dc:subject>Learning -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Perceptual learning</dc:subject><dc:subject>Memory -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak06988306"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Trieste crisis, 1953</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Croci, Osvaldo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study applies the ICB model of state behavior in international crisis to one actor, Italy, in the 1953 Trieste crisis. At the historical level it reconstructs in detail, through recently declassified American and Italian documents, the flow of events from mid-1951 until October 5, 1954 when the signing of the so-called Memorandum of Understanding solved the Trieste question. At the theoretical level, it seeks to determine the impact of crisis-induced stress on the coping processes and choice patterns of Italian decision-makers. The findings confirm the major hypothesis (advanced by Holsti and George) about the stress-performance nexus, namely that "moderate" levels of stress improve decision-making performance while "high" stress might impair it. A modification of the definition of foreign policy crisis adopted by the ICB model is also suggested.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752h52b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k06988306</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- Territorial questions -- Italy -- Trieste</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trieste (Italy) -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xj46x"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Wordsworth and later eighteenth-century concepts of the reading experience</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tweedie, Gordon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Influential later eighteenth-century critics and philosophers (Stewart, Knight, Alison, Jeffrey, Godwin) argued that poetry's moral and practical benefits derive from "analytical" modes of reading rather than from the poet's instructive intentions. Frequently exploiting the philosophical "language of necessity," Wordsworth's essays and prefaces (1798-1815) protested that poetry directly improves the reader's moral code and ethical conduct. This dissertation discusses Wordsworth's criticism in the context of analytical principles of interpretation current in the 1790s, providing terms for exploring the theme of reading in early mss. of Peter Bell and The Ruined Cottage (1798-1799), the 1798 Lyrical Ballads, and later poems such as "A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags," "Resolution and Independence," "Elegiac Stanzas," and The Prelude (Book V). These poems anticipate Wordsworth's presentation of reading as the "art of admiration" in the "Essay, Supplementary" to the 1815 Poems, and indicate a sustained search for alternatives and correctives to detached investigative approaches to the aesthetic experience. Attempting to reconcile the extremes of the credulous or fanciful response, reflecting a childlike desire to be free from all constraints, and the analytical response, fuelled by perceptions of contrast between poetic illusion and reality, Wordsworth's criticism and poetry depict the reader as the"auxiliar" of poetic genius. The purpose, traditionally undermined by critics as peremptory and egotistical, was to challenge readers to examine their basic motives in seeking poetic pleasure.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rp42f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xj46x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wordsworth, William, 1770-1850 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43nx853"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Role of the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems of the rat neostriatum in learning and associative memory functions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Viaud, Marc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The experiments in this thesis investigated the neuropharmacology of memory in the caudate nucleus, using the conditioned emotional response (CER) with visual and olfactory conditioned stimuli (CS). In experiment 1, post-training, intrastriatal microinjections of both amphetamine and LY 171555, but not SKF 38393: (1) into the posteroventral area improved memory of a visual, but not an olfactory, CER; (2) into the ventrolateral area improved memory of an olfactory, but not a visual, CER. In experiment 2, sulpiride, but not SCH 23390, blocked the memory improving effect of amphetamine. These findings are consistant with the hypothesis that dopamine D2 receptor stimulation mediates the memory enhancement effect of amphetamine in the neostriatum. In three experiments on a visual CER, pre-training intrastriatal micro-injections of scopolamine impaired acquisition; post-training micro-injections improved consolidation; and pre-testing micro-injections impaired retrieval. These findings are consistant with the hypothesis that striatal muscarinic receptor stimulation mediates some aspects of acquisition and retrieval of sensory-motor memory, and that blockade of these receptors following training has an effect on memory consolidation similar to that of D2-receptor stimulation. In experiment 6, destruction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons abolished the memory improving effect of intrastriatal post-training micro-injections of scopolamine and AFDX-384, a specific muscarinic M2 antagonist. These results suggest that the post-training memory improvement produced by muscarinic blockade may be mediated by an M2 receptor, known to be located on dopaminergic nigro-striatal terminals.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tc86x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43nx853</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Perceptual-motor learning</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rats -- Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Learning -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Memory -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neostriatum</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9k41zf31j"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Classical and logic based control theory for finite state machines</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wang, Suning</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis formulates the state estimation and control problem for partially observed finite machines in terms of classical and logic-based approaches. First, in Part I, we present a set operation based formulation of an observer (tree) and a dynamic programming based controller. Then we provide the results of computational complexity of building and running such classical observer and controllers. In Part II, we introduce a notion of a logic-based dynamical system, a new paradigm for controlling finite machines. In particular, we give concepts of a logic-based dynamic observer, and a logic-based dynamic controller and demonstrate an equivalence between classical and logic-based systems. Then we introduce a conditional observer and controller logic--COCOLOG for finite machines, which consists of a family of first order logics each corresponding to a node in the observer tree. Conditional control statements are formulated so that (closed loop) control actions occur when specified past measurable (i.e. past observation dependent) conditions are fulfilled. A semantics is supplied for each COCOLOG in terms of interpretations of controlled transitions on a tree of state estimate sets indexed by observation o(k). Consistency and completeness of the first order theories in a COCOLOG family are established. Furthermore, through a certain unique model property, we obtain the decidability result for each logical theory in a COCOLOG family. Last, in Part III, a function evaluation based resolution for COCOLOG theorems, called FE-resolution, is presented. Completeness results for the FE-resolution method is given in terms of relative truthfulness and validity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zf32t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zf31j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73pw846"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Professional and personal adaptation of returning Indian academics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Van Balkom, Wilhelmus Duffie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Indian academics leave India in large numbers to study or work abroad, primarily in the U.S.A., Great Britain, and Canada.

It examines adaptation in relation to motivations for emigration from India, life abroad, and return motivations. Professionally, returnees face conflicts with the nature of the institutional environment, with limited opportunities to maximize the skills and knowledge acquired abroad, with the lack of support for research, and the resulting constraints on the contributions they could otherwise make to science and development. At a personal level, they face conflicts with regards to salary and living conditions, differences in culture and value systems, and conformity with the expectations of others.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085m00p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73pw846</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Scientists -- India</dc:subject><dc:subject>Scholars -- India</dc:subject><dc:subject>Culture conflict</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407z08g"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Physiology, chemistry and immunocytochemistry of selected synaptically elicited responses in dorsal horn neurones aof the cat spinal cord</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Koninck, Yves</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The studies presented in this thesis relate to the physiological, chemical and immunocytochemical characterization of specific synaptically elicited responses following activation of defined sensory inputs to dorsal horn neurones in the spinal cord of the cat. Low-threshold mechanical stimulation of the skin produced two types of inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in dorsal horn neurones. One was shown to involve $ gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting on a GABA$ sb{ rm A}$ receptor and the other one involves adenosine acting on a P$ sb1$-purinergic receptor. The adenosine-mediated IPSP is mediated by activation of ATP-sensitive K$ sp+$ channels. Further characterization of these IPSPs revealed that the adenosine-mediated IPSP is involved in a system responding optimally to repetitive mechanical stimulation. Stimulation of hair afferents produced EPSPs which are mediated by an excitatory amino acid. Characterization of the input from single hair afferents to single dorsal horn neurones revealed that the central excitatory response to guard-hair afferent input, but not that to down-hair afferent input is subject to a prolonged GABA$ sb{ rm A}$-mediated inhibitory mechanism. The response to noxious cutaneous stimulation involves at least two types of EPSP in dorsal horn neurones. The fast EPSP in response to a brief stimulus is probably elicited by an excitatory amino acid, whereas sustained noxious stimulation elicits a slow, prolonged EPSP mediated by substance P acting on the NK-1 receptor. These results demonstrate the participation of specific chemical mechanisms in the mediation of specific physiological responses in identifiable sensory pathways in the spinal cord.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t714d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407z08g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666525t"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The apical development, and the effects of chlormequat and ethephon on the development, physiology and yield of spring barley</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ma, Baoluo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Plant growth regulator(s) (PGR) can be used as lodging inhibitors and/or yield promoters for spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). From 1987 to 1990 four field experiments were conducted to monitor barley main-stem apical development and to determine the effects of chlormequat (CCC) and ethephon on the development, physiology and yield of spring barley. Our data provide a description of barley apical development and the general pattern of leaf and spikelet primordium production under field conditions. In general, PGR treatment reduced the apical dominance of dominant sinks allowing the survival and greater development of more subordinate sinks. Early application of either CCC or ethephon retarded development of the main-stem apex from shortly after application to the awn elongation stage and reduced the number of aborted spikelet primordia, thus increasing the potential number of grains per spike and sometimes grain yield. Ethephon applied at ZGS 39 reduced plant height and lodging. Early application (ZGS 30) of ethephon, alone or in combination with CCC increased the number of spikes m$ sp{-2},$ but not grain yield. The number of spike-bearing shoots per unit area or per plant was increased by early PGR treatment, primarily by enhancement of tiller number rather than tiller survival. Early application of CCC or ethephon to spring barley is not justified, and caution must be taken when using ethephon at the currently recommended rate and stage for lodging control. Post-anthesis application of ethephon can efficiently enhance grain fill and yield of spring barley.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn009z69c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666525t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ethephon</dc:subject><dc:subject>Barley -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Barley -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Barley -- Yields</dc:subject><dc:subject>Barley -- Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr171z01k"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulation of gene expression by the tat-responsive region of HIV- 1 : role for RNA-protein interactions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Roy, Sophie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The 5$ sp prime$ untranslated region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNAs comprises the cis-acting target sequence TAR responsive to the viral transactivator protein Tat. The TAR sequence folds into a stable stem and loop structure and interacts with two proteins: Tat and the cellular double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase P68. The Tat-TAR interaction is centered on a tri-nucleotide bulge in the RNA. It is thought to bring Tat in proximity to the transcription complex and augment, in an ill-defined manner, the processivity of the RNA polymerase. The P68-TAR interaction is dependent on the integrity of the RNA stem structure and correlates with activation of P68, ultimately leading to inhibition of protein synthesis. However, productive infection by HIV-1 is associated with a decrease in the amount of P68. Downregulation of P68 kinase could provide a means for the virus to switch from latent to active replication. These results demonstrate that the stem and loop structure in TAR has both positive and negative effects on viral gene expression.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515p17q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr171z01k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj236285x"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dynamics of neutrophil aggregation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rochon, Yvan P.

Using direct particle counting, we demonstrated that light transmission does not accurately reflect aggregation, and showed that in contrast to previous reports, newborn neutrophils do not aggregate irreversibly. We developed a flow cytometric technique to measure the kinetics of neutrophil aggregation, including latent times for onset of aggregation, initial forward and reversal rates, and maximal extents of aggregation. The kinetics of neutrophil aggregation were related to changes in initial cell concentration, stir speed (shear), and activator type and concentration. Physiologic activators stimulated reversible aggregation, accompanied by an exponential decay in aggregatory potential with increasing time. The fraction of occupied activator receptors was found to correspond to the fraction of maximal rates or extent of aggregation. Monoclonal antibodies were used to show that neutrophil aggregation is mediated by the Mac-1 integrin (CD11b/CD18). Direct measurements of aggregation have enhanced our understanding of the (patho)physiologic process of neutrophil aggregation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rm145.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236285x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296wz84v"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of low temperature applied at early growth stages on pepper development and anatomy (Capsicum annuum L. cv Lady Bell)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Clavijo, Claret Michelangeli de</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), which originates from tropical environments is particularly sensitive to low temperatures. The Canadian climate, with its risks of cool temperatures during spring time, greatly limits the production of this temperature-sensitive crop. This work dealt with pepper plant exposure to low temperatures (9 and 15$ sp circ$C), at two early growth stages. 'Lady Bell' pepper plants were grown from seed under controlled conditions of 21$ sp circ$C, 50 $ pm$ 10% R.H., 16/8 light/dark cycle and 300 $ mu$molm$ sp{-2} / rm s sp{-1}$ PAR at the canopy level. Once plants had reached either the cotyledonary or the three-true-leaf stage low temperatures were applied. Treatment conditions lasted until plants had produced three additional leaves after which they were returned to the pretreatment conditions. Evaluations were made at six recognized developmental stages and included destructive measurements for growth analysis, pigment content and leaf anatomical features as well as weekly non-destructive measurements. Results showed that plant responses to 9 and 15$ sp circ$C were not the same when applied at the cotyledonary or the three-true-leaf stage. Overall growth decreased with decreasing temperatures and plants exposed to 9$ sp circ$C at the cotyledonary stage died. Plants exposed to cold treatments underwent a whole complex of changes in morphology which included reduction in leaf size, stem diameter, internode length and on leaf, branch and developing fruit abnormalities. Dry matter accumulation and distribution, leaf area production and leaf pigment levels varied with treatments. The anatomical changes which included alterations in epidermal and mesophyll cell dimensions and arrangement were reminiscent of a general response to a wide range of stress conditions reported for several other plant species.

The genus Diaphania and all the species treated are redescribed, except D. antillia Munroe. Diaphania is divided into the "hyalinata", "fumosalis" and "auricollis" species-groups; keys are given for these groups and for the species studied. Lectotypes and paralectotypes are designated for: Glyphodes columbiana Hampson (male lectotype and three males paralectotypes); Glyphodes eurytornalis Hampson (male lectotype and four males paralectotypes); Glyphodes holophaealis Hampson (male lectotype and seven males paralectotypes); Glyphodes magdalenae Hampson (male lectotype and two males paralectotypes); and Glyphodes oeditornalis (male lectotype). The following new synonymies are presented: Eudioptis aclista Meyrick, Glyphodes semibrunnea Druce = Diaphania argealis (Walker); Glyphodes eurytornalis Hampson = Diaphania lucidalis (Hubner); Glyphodes decapitalis Dognin = Diaphania mirabilis (Druce); Glyphodes holophaealis Hampson = Diaphania indica (Saunders); and Glyphodes niveocilia Hampson = Diaphania translucidalis (Guenee). Some morphological terms are clarified and renamed or named for the first time: anal tuft; male coremata (= parategumen sclerites in this study); and female coremata (= gynecoremata in this study). A new organ (anepisternal scale organ) associated with possible pheromone production and/or distribution is described. The monophyly of Diaphania is based in the presence of spatulate scales in anal tuft in both sexes; labial palp with scaling of second segment broad, almost as large as the eye; and the presence of gynecoremata. The genus Omiodes is considered the possible sister-group of Diaphania on the basis of a brief phylogenetic analysis of 21 genera which could be associated with Diaphania. All species studied are found in tropical and subtropical America, except D. indica (Saunders) which has a pantropical distribution. Host plants for the few species for which information is available mostly belong to the family Cucurbitaceae.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sw65r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pr09n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pyralidae -- Classification</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
