The compensatory role of lordosis and equinus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Burke, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study reports on a biomechanical analysis of the vertical standing posture of normal human subjects and muscular dystrophy patients. The compensatory roles of lordosis and equinus in stabilizing the knee joint were studied using a force plate, cinephotographic and electromyographic methods. The results indicate that both lordosis and equinus stabilize the knee in extension. These compensatory mechanisms are progressively negated by progressive knee flexion contractures, resulting in inability to stand when the quadriceps muscles are severely weakened. An explanation is offered for the significant clinical observations of lordosis which disappears with knee bracing, requirement for knee bracing following heel cord lengthening, and of work hypertrophy of the calf muscles, which occur in muscular dystrophy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Miller, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z8246.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505356c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
