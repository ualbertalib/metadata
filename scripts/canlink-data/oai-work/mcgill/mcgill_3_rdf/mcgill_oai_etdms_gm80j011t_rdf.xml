H. (Kenneth H.)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The annual apple production of the world has increased immensely during the last two decades and parallelled with this there has been an increase in the number and complexity of chemical treatments to combat the various pests attacking this fruit. Spraying is now an accepted, though not welcome, practice and it is becoming increasingly evident that the desired control can not be attained at this time through the use of chemicals alone. Arthropod pests "resistant" to chemicals have been observed in numerous instances. Suppression of one pest only to allow another to increase is a common result of disturbing nature's natural balance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DuPorte, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cf41z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80j011t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Entomology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
