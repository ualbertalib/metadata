His compositions,underperformed in the past, are now attracting renewed interest. Haas's writing for piano, while not ahuge body of work, is an example of the diversity of Czech works in the inter-war years. On one handcomposers continued in their art-music tradition, on the other, they pursued modernist tendencies withthe same intensity as other European composers. This paper examines Haas's contribution to the soloand chamber piano literature, it scrutinizes various techniques that he employed, both modernist andthose harking back to the past, and it looks at Haas's inspiration from and methods of working withMoravian folk music.

Numerous scholars haveshown how twentieth-century composers have appropriated the fugue by highlightinghow these artists integrated contemporary musical idioms into traditional fugalprocedure. Yet, the literature remains relatively silent on how a performer can benefitfrom the analyses, especially when approaching these difficult works. Accordingly,this dissertation demonstrates how musical analysis can inform a performance ofthese works, and likewise, how an interpretation can influence an analytical approach.Based on current scholarship, this research examines the diverse ways in whichthe four composers appropriate their fugues from the eighteenth- and nineteenthcenturyfugal practices, yet seek to "update" the genre to suit their modernist outlooks.This dissertation fills a gap in current music research and performance studies bydemonstrating how an understanding of both traditional and modern musical elementsand techniques in these twentieth-century works-such as approaches to structure,motivic connection, twentieth-century harmonic and rhythm techniques, andtraditional contrapuntal device-can guide performers to project both large-scalerelationships (i.e. motivic connection and form) and small-scale considerations(interpretative details in phrasing, tone color, articulation, dynamics, timing, etc.), toachieve a balance between the intellectual and the emotional content.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Ce memoire presente, a travers Ia lentille d'une interprete, une analyse comparativede quatre mouvements fugue provenant de sonates pour piano a plusieursmouvements qui ont ete ecrites dans Ia premiere moitie du XXe siecle : Sonate n° 3,Op. 36 (1917) par Karol Szymanowski, Troisieme sonate pour piano (1936) par PaulHindemith, So nate pour piano ( 1945--46) par Elliott Carter et Ia So nate pour piano,Op. 26 (1949) par Samuel Barber.

My research observes how contemporary solo cello workscan be performed in fresh and direct dialogue with music by Italian Baroque cellists. Suchdialogue illustrates how contemporary works may be appropriately informed by an earlier valuesystem.

Both artists performed the music during the composers'lifetimes and both worked directly with each composer during the performancepreparations. This important historical fact allows us to understand how certain elementsof violin technique were used in performances heard by the composers.Subsequently, in order to expand the technical abilities and musical understandingof today's violinists, sample technical exercises and etudes are provided with explanationsthat attend to matters specific to the violin music of the Second Viennese School.Sample exercises include left hand techniques such as fingering, shifting, and intonation,as well as right hand techniques, addressing issues of bowing, dynamics, and extendedtechniques. Musical considerations such as ensemble playing, gesture, and syntax are alsoincluded, as these are directly connected to the School's compositional techniques.

Arc welding has come more and more into use as time has passed, and as confidence in its results increased. Even now, however, large factors of safety are employed due to certain unknown conditions which arise in arc welding. The first of these unknowns is the personal element, the fact that no two welders using the same materials and equipment will obtain exactly the same results. The importance of this factor has greatly decreased with the development of proper welding rod for various types of weld, and with the increased availability of expert welders. The second unknown is the magnitude and importance of stresses developed in the parent metal by welding, due to local heating and to shrinkage on cooling. These stresses are what is known as residual or locked-up stresses, and while they may be practically eliminated in small articles by heat treating, larger articles may be too heavy to support their own weight under sufficient heat treating to reduce the stresses, and of course, such structures as buildings, large hoppers and pressure vessels are too large to be heat treated at all. [...] The present work is the first attempt at McGill to evaluate stresses in three directions, that is, longitudinally, transversely, and through the thickness of the plate.

The quartz gabbros were altered by albitizing solutions coming from within the magma, giving rise to the “granodiorites” (albite - oligoclase tonalites and tonalites) of the Bourlamaque batholith. Remnants of metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic roof rocks occur in the batholith as roof pendants and possible extensions into the “granodiorites” from the marginal volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Magmatic differentiation apparently went on in successively deeper zones and finally culminated in the formation of ore deposits, which were emplaced in zones of weakness resulting from the cooling and contraction of the consolidating rocks. The gold veins seem to occur in the more albitized parts of the country rock and those parts in which acidic dykes were emplaced. The veins with gold, pyrite, tourmaline and quartz may be related to and one phase of the solutions that produced the albite.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Osborne, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526g45b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72pb50j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117s14p"><ual:graduationDate>1946</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The design and construction of a spectroscopic isotope detector and its application to the isotopes of radioactive lead</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hardie, Robert H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The determination of the isotopes of various elements is of interest to scientists in many fields, particularly physics and chemistry.

The most prevalent methods of determining isotopes make use of some form of mass spectrograph; but, according to modern theories of atomic structure, spectroscopic means, although more difficult in some ways, and less sensitive to traces of isotopes, may be applied without expensive equipment. With this object in view, it was suggested that a suitable form of discharge tube should be designed to eliminate any possible extraneous effects on the spectrum (such as the influence of electric and magnetic fields) and that the hyperfine structure of the spectrum of radiogenic lead be examined in an attempt to determine any isotopes which may be present.

The commonest cause of fatality is, however, acute renal insufficiency with anuria and uraemia subsequent to the introduction of incompatible blood.

Some modern schools of criticism are as much to be distinguished by political allegiance as by aesthetic doctrines. There are signs, however, that a reaction may soon take place, and that literature may be judged, once more, by purely artistic criteria, to the comparative neglect of social or tendentious implications. The extremes of either method are, of course, undesirable, for literary value cannot be assessed and weighed unless the critic has been able to consider the work from every possible aspect, neglecting neither the political implications (when there are any), nor the purely formal and technical problems which the author has attempted to solve. Furthermore, art does not exist in a vacuum. [...] There have been many biographical, psychological and critical studies of Swift and his work, but most critics have been content to dismiss his political beliefs with a few remarks about their broad philosophic basis and some generalizations about their lack of originality. It has even been claimed that Swift had no coherent system, but preferred to approach each new problem on its own merits and to seek solutions only for particular and present situations.

On the face of it, the assertion would seem true enough. There were two parties: two etiquettes would be the better term, to borrow an expression from the French Canadian political vocabulary. Liberals and Conservatives, rouges and bleus, contested elections and formed governments. The two-party system had a real meaning, but political life did not end there. Behind the labels of rouge and bleu lay the more complicated picture of struggling groups and factions. In these divisions personalities counted for much, private interests counted for something, but underlying everything was a problem in conflicting ideas. There is one contrast which lies at the root of every discussion of Canadian politics of the late-nineteenth century period. It can be summed up this way: “While English-speaking Canada looked west, French Canada looked east. English-speaking Canadians, with the Americans to the south, devoted their attentions to expansion, economic and territorial expansion; in short, to material expansion. The greatest strength of the Conservative party in English speaking Canada was that it had effectively associated itself with an expanding Canadian life, willing to undertake great things in the present with the conviction of faith that the future would justify them.

These encysted larvae or "metacercariae" do not all belong to a single species of trematode. They may occur in pigmented and non-pigmented cysts.

His first investigations were in the field of igneous rocks. Prior to the publication of Hall’s investigations, geological thought had been guided purely by observation, reasoning and analogy. That some of the principles, which had by then been developed, should be tested by direct experiment had not occurred to anyone, and consequently Hall’s decision to embark on a course of experimental work was quite revolutionary. A contemporary pillar of the geological world, James Hutton (1726-1797) disdained the idea of experimentation, feeling that the scale of earth processes was so great that no small imitation of them, such as could be performed in a laboratory, could possibly lead to any reliable results. This is unfortunately only too true, and the bulk of subsequent experiments has been purely illustrative, in a qualitative way, of geologic processes. What prompted Hall to devise geological experiments was the attitude of very highly-folded sedimentary rocks which he had studied along the Berwick shire coast. Hall found ripple marks in these strata, which strata he reasoned had therefore been deposited in a horizontal position under water. Since the idea of the folding of strata was not recognized at that time, Hall set out to illustrate a possible mechanism for the folding.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4307802.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xh95x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bs633"><ual:graduationDate>1946</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The refining and hydrogenation of fish oils</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Legendre, Rosaire</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Refining and the hydrogenation of fish oils in the preparation of solid fats for general industrial purposes have been in general use for a comparatively short time. So an attempt was made to determine the most satisfactory conditions for the refining of fish oils and to investigate the rate of hydrogenation of these oils in the presence of nickel catalyst. The author studied also the variation of iodine value with hydrogen absorption, the mecanism followed by the hydrogenation, as given by an interpretation of the results, and the order of the reaction. The oil used for this investigation was seal oil probably because this oil, being relatively little known in the industrial applications, possesses however many properties capable to render it very useful for different purposes. The hydrogenation was carried out at atmospheric pressure in an apparatus of the closed type. The thesis proper contains a review of the general properties of fats and a short historical account of the main workers in the field of hydrogenation. Following this is a complete description of the apparatus used and experimental procedure involved in the investigation together with a description of the results obtained with tables and graphs. The interpretation of these results and graphs is fully discussed in the section headed “Discussion”, and the conclusions are summarized under a separate heading.

It is conceivable that changes in the science of philology, particularly with regard to newly suggested etymologies, may render necessary a restatement of some of the attendant factors, though the basic idea of the law must remain unaltered. For the accomplishment of this purpose, a list of those words which were affected by the law has been compiled. The basis for the selection has been the etymologies of Walde, in the “Etymologisches Woerterbueh der Indogermanischen Sprachen”, and of Boisacq, in the “Dictionnaire Etymologique de la Langue Grecque”. Though this will necessarily exclude several suggestions which might have more value than those of Walde or Boisacq, it is felt that a certain standardization is necessary. These words are considered in groups as they bear relation to certain aspects of Grassmann’s Law as he had it published in the “Zeitschrift fuer Vergleichende Sprachforschung” in 1863. Compound words have generally not been included in the discussion, because they are obviously not affected by the law of dissimilation of aspirates. By the term compound word is meant any word resulting from the combination of two other words, each of which has a separate existence in the Greek language.

The experiments reported in this thesis have shown that, under certain conditions, pretreatment with DCA would cause a deposition of glycogen in the livers of adrenalectomized mice. This was interpreted as meaning that DCA possesses carbohydrate activity which is probably qualitatively similar to that of corticosterone and that the difference lay in the rate and mode of action. Because of the difference in rate and duration of action of these corticoids, it was suggested that the control which the adrenal cortices normally exert over certain organs and tissues might be mediated through the constant production of small amounts of corticoids of the desoxycorticosterone type.  When the organism is exposed to a stress, the adrenal cortices would then respond by producing corticoids which have a more rapid, more pronounced, and briefer action as is the case with the corticoids of the corticosterone type. Under the conditions standardized in the experimental section, both DCA and cortical extract will cause the deposition of liver glycogen, but DCA is negative in this respect when the regular 7-hour assay method is used. Thus, a combination of these two methods might enable one to differentiate between these two types of corticoids.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Browne, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924f822.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rx77f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s344j"><ual:graduationDate>2013</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Music (Performance Studies)</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cornerstones of the Ukrainian violin repertoire 1870 – present day</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Klopoushak, Carissa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Le répertoire unique pour violon provenant de compositeurs ukrainiens est grandement inconnu  du reste du monde.

Kittel’s method book is considered an important source, teaching organists how to improvise both chorale-based works and free works. Although the pedagogical tools used in this treatise are based on his studies with J. S. Bach, Kittel also draws on contemporary musical culture in his examples. (...) Musical examples have been selected to represent all genres: chorale prelude, chorale accompaniment, chorale variation, and free works. Further, this essay addresses several interesting issues for additional information, including an intriguing insight into Kittel’s original intention for his 16 Grosse Präludien (1809) based on a comparison between these free works and their counterparts in Der Angehende Praktische Organist; the association with the use of the organ and the Passion chorale in Lent; and Johann Christian Heinrich Rinck’s (1770-1846) Praktische Orgelschule (1819-1821) as a link between Kittel and Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847).</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Dernier étudiant de J.

From this small beginning, pisciculture has become an industry of national importance. McCay of Cornell University and Davis of the United States Bureau of Fisheries have clarified many problems pertaining to fish culture and nutrition. The food of wild trout varies with the locality, the season, and the age of the fish, but it consists mainly of the larvae of various insects such as the dragonfly or caddis fly and crayfish (l). Species’ differences play a part in food selection; for example, 15% of the stomach contents of rainbow trout consists of algae (2), while green vegetation is eaten in negligible amounts by other species of trout. Perhaps this fact may account for the difficulty which is sometimes experienced in raising rainbow trout in captivity. The food available for hatchery feeding may be divided into three classes: (a) fresh meat, such as liver, heart, et cetra; (b) dried animal products such as meat or fish meal, and dried skim-milk; (c) vegetable products such as wheat middlings and cottonseed meal. Liver was one of the first substances to be used and has continued to be one of the most successful of artificial trout foods. However, there are certain disadvantages in using liver as a trout food. For example, when scattered on the surface of the water, it imparts a milkiness due to solution of its soluble and valuable constituents.

The effects of oxidation on edible fats include loss of palatability, destruction of contained vitamins (the fat-soluble A, D and E), and bleaching of the natural pigments, which are often of a carotenoid nature. In addition, oxidized fats may exhibit toxic properties. It is therefore evident that the prevention and detection of oxidative rancidity are problems of considerable practical significance. An oil or fat consists of a complex mixture of glycerides, these being combinations of glycerol with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids are ordinarily stable in air but may oxidize to some extent under extreme conditions, as, for instance, under the influence of the peroxides present in oxidizing fat mixtures. Fatty acids react more readily with oxygen as the number of double bonds in the molecule increases. For example, linoleic acid oxidizes more rapidly than oleic acid under the same conditions. Ease of oxidation is governed in some measure by molecular structure; thus oleic acid is less resistant than its geometric isomer, elaidic. The insertion of a hydroxyl group into oleic acid to form ricinolelc acid likewise results in a decrease in susceptibility. It is also probable that the position of a double bond in the chain relative to other unsaturated centres and to the carboxyl group will influence its rate of oxidation.
