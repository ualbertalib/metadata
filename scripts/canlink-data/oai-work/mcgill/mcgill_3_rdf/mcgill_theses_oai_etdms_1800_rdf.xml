The thesis examines the sources of a duty to investigate and to punish human rights violations of a prior regime in international treaty and customary law which is not affected by a succession of States. An analysis of different methods by which post-communist democracies of Central and Eastern Europe come to terms with their past gives evidence of lustration (screening); condemning a previous regime and banning its ruling party as a criminal organization, and criminal proceedings against Communist Party officials. With specific reference to the example of Ukraine, where there exist valid grounds for accountability of the previous communist regime, it is argued that during the transitional period, justice could be achieved by way of outlawing the Communist Party of Ukraine. The accountability of the previous communist regime would be much facilitated by involving international law standards and international investigating bodies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Provost, Rene</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f3458.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q8422</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290c657"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sexual orientation : prospects and perspectives of a changing norm in international law</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Andersen, Jacob Strandgaard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sexual orientation, especially between males, has historically been met with harsh criminal sanctions. Only in this century has the issue been one of fundamental freedom and private choices. This study analyses the legal history of the concept of choice in sexual orientation in the European Commission of Human Rights (the Commission) and the European Court of Human Right (the Court), and documents the evolution of sexual orientation rights from the 1950s until today specifically focusing on why the human rights protection has changed. Until 1975 the Commission did not consider absolute criminalisation contrary to the right to respect for privacy or as discrimination, but this approach started to change in 1975. A stricter test of what is considered necessary in a democratic society led to the Dudgeon judgement in 1980 where absolute criminalisation of homosexuality was found to be contrary to the right to respect for privacy in the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention). This judgement has largely been responsible for decriminalisation throughout the Council of Europe member-States. This decriminalisation was limited to private, adult acts that were consensual and this was the norm until 1997. In that year, unequal ages of consent also was found to be contrary to the Convention. The study showed that this evolution was facilitated mainly by a European consensus, based on the legislation of the member-States and expert knowledge. The European consensus doctrine has proven to be a very complex concept, and this study argues that a regional approach to the consensus enquiry is a better solution than the present doctrine, and solves some of the problems it has proven to cause.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Provost, Rene</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w0325104.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290c657</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human rights</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sexual orientation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axk81jn62r"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nafta and the EU : a comparison of the use of harmonization as a tool for regional integration</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Altamirano Ortiz, Martha Elizabeth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The European Community, today European Union, has been considered as a model to measure the success or failure of other Regional Integration Arrangements (RIAs). Harmonization can be understood as the promotion of convergence within different legal systems. Particularly in this case, harmonization of Member States' legislation has been a central legislative tool in establishing the internal market. However, harmonization, in areas such as technical standards and professional services, is not pursued as a main goal by all RIAs. This is because not all RIAs pursue the same degree of economic integration. However, due to the fact that differences in national legislation in the above mentioned areas can constitute non-tariff barriers to trade and go against their ultimate goals, even RIAs pursuing lower levels of economic integration such as the formation of a free trade area (FTA) as NAFTA, have taken action directed towards the harmonization of their Member States legislation in the above mentioned areas. These actions may take place through different channels due to the different institutional structure accomplished by RIAs, but the goal pursued is the same: the harmonization of Member States' legislation in order to avoid non-tariff barriers to trade and promote economic integration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mestral, A.

The growth rate of FDI, which exceeded that of international trade and world output throughout the 1990s, raises important questions regarding the value of FDI to developing countries as host countries to FDI and the role it can play in their development. In an attempt to answer these questions, this thesis tackles the main issues underlining FDI and developing countries. After analysing the pros and cons of FDI for developing countries and other interested parties, this thesis scrutinizes the regulation of FDI as a means to balance the interests of the concerned parties, giving an assessment of the balance of interests in some existing and potential FDI regulations. Furthermore, this thesis highlights the case against the deregulation of FDI and its consequences for developing countries.

In this thesis, we present a new channel allocation strategy with waiting queue model instead of the block-and-clear model so that the quality of service in cellular network can be improved. From a computational and network resource viewpoint, our model is based on the Mobile Agent Paradigm that has great advantages on reducing network traffic and dynamic adaptation. We also show the possibility to implement our algorithm on the Grasshopper mobile agent environment, which is compliant to the MASIF standard. In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed model, a simulator is written in Java, which shows that our algorithm gives the lowest average blocking probability under different traffic load comparing with LP Scheme, First Available DCA Scheme and Simple FCA Scheme. Specifically, our algorithm has a tremendous capability of alleviating congestion in the hot spots of a cellular system.

While the relational algebra provides operations to manipulate relations as data primitives, the domain algebra allows the manipulation of the attributes of relations. With the nested relational model, the domain algebra subsumes the functionality of the relational algebra. The conventional relational operations (e.g. selection and projection) may be applied to the attributes of a relation. The domain algebra for nested relations has many advantages. For example, the domain algebra makes the nesting and unnesting of relations very easy. This ensures that any hierarchical database schema can be validly translated into a conventional 1NF database schema. With the nested domain algebra, defining abstract data types for domains can be achieved as well. The system consists of three modules; the relational algebra, the domain algebra and computations. This thesis deals with the domain algebra module. The implementation is part of the jRelix project at McGill University. The most significant feature of jRelix is the support for the nested relations with an arbitrary but finite level of nesting. The Object-Oriented programming language Java was used exclusively during the implementation, which secures jRelix as a platform independent database programming language.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Merrett, T.

To achieve this goal, we present in this thesis the related work on QoS and resource reservation. We also design a simulation environment to perform our improved network routing algorithm which realizes the QoS routing and resource reservation with good network transmission performance. Since QoS parameters are the focus of QoS research, we begin the study QoS parameters and their management. We specify a few concepts and formulae for basic parameters and some fundamental functions for QoS management. Then, we discuss various routing algorithms implemented in existing networks. We pay particular attention to QoSRBF algorithms. Based on it, we propose our new schemes. According to our simulation results, the new algorithm can not only find a route, if it exists, to satisfy the desired QoS constraints, but also consume minimum resources and reduce all blocking probability as well. In this thesis, we also address the issues concerning QoS routing and resources reservation in wireless networks. The issues are more complex than in general wired network not only because of wireless networks' special features such as high latency, temporary disconnection, etc., but also due to mobile users' move and uncertainty for this movement. We propose "home cache" and "foreign cache" in our algorithms to keep track of mobile user's movement. We also set efficient reservation mechanism to guarantee seamless connection during handoff procedures. All these strategies make our algorithm provide good network transmission performance under QoS constraints in our simulation environment. According to the simulation results, this algorithm is proved to be a good tool to perform QoS-driven routing and resource allocation in wired and wireless systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dini, Petre</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Ratzer, Gerald</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wm382.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741t916</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apk02cd03b"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular genetics and characterisation of functional methionine synthase deficiency : mutation analysis and gene cloning</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wilson, Aaron</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Methionine synthase (MS) is a vitamin B12(cobalamin;cbl) dependent enzyme that catalyses the methylation of homocysteine to methionine.

Functional MS deficiency may occur as a result of a defect in either enzyme. Patients with this disorder have been classified into two complemetation groups according to which protein is defective: cblG patients are deficient in MS and cblE patients in MSR. A subset of cblG, known as cblG variant, is unique in showing barely detectable MS activity and failure of cbl incorporation into MS in patient fibroblasts. I report the mutations responsible for three cblG variant patients, two of them siblings, and connect their phenotype to lack of protein expression. I also report the cloning of the MSR cDNA, aided by confirming the identity of the cDNA through the discovery of two deleterious mutations in three cblE patients.

The proximal and distal regions of the small intestine responded differently to the dietary glucose restriction. Proximal small intestine GLUT2 protein levels did not change throughout postnatal development and remained unaltered with dietary glucose restriction, while distal small intestine GLUT2 protein expression changed throughout postnatal development and with dietary glucose restriction.

Detailed characterization of the micro-environments within 1 m2 plots centered around established individuals of Carex backii, C. communis, C. plantaginea, and C. platyphylla revealed significant differences among species. Carex plantaginea was found at the wet end of a moisture gradient, with C. backii and C. platyphylla at the dry end. Carex backii occurred in plots with higher phosphorus availability and in earlier successional stands than C. platyphylla. Carex communis occurred in the broadest range of micro-environments, often co-occurring with C. backii and C. platyphylla. Both equilibrium and non-equilibrium factors act to maintain diversity within the genus Carex in the forest understory.

Birds were excluded from portions of these fields through the use of bird-proof netting. Rhopalosiphum maidis, Ostrinia nubilalis, Agrotis spp. and Sphenophorus spp. were all found at greater densities in plots where birds were excluded as compared with the non covered plots. Only the adult Diabrotica longicornis population was not reduced by birds. Results significantly suggest that birds can reduce insect pest populations. Bird visits in cornfields with respect to distance from field edge, type of edge habitat and corn phenology were also studied. Red-winged Blackbird, Song and Chipping Sparrows and American Robin were the most frequently observed bird species inside cornfields. Early in the summer, birds tended to stay closer to the field edge, especially when composed of mature coniferous trees. Different bird species visited the cornfields at specific periods during corn development.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stewart, R.

The cyclic AMP analogue 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (500muM), or a combination of the adenylyl cylase activator forskolin (20 muM) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (10 muM) increased choline uptake in rat hippocampal synaptosomes. Of the four protein kinase A inhibitors studied, H-89 (60--200nM) and KT5720 (0.49--1.12 muM) suppress 8-bromo-cyclic AMP enhancement of choline uptake, whereas H-8 (13muM) and Rp-8-bromo-cyclic AMP (675 muM) did not. H-89 but not KT5720 was found to dose dependently suppress high-K+ enhancement of choline uptake as well as stimulated acetylcholine release in the synaptosomes. Since KT5720 suppressed the effect of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP but not the effect of high-K+ on choline uptake in synaptosomes, we concluded that protein kinase A, stimulated by cyclic AMP is not involved in the regulation of high affinity choline uptake following depolarization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Collier, Brian</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97ks56g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p9293</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jw73n"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Potential of selected natural products as repellents against vertebrate pests of crops</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tilly Gaoh, Abdouramane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is a need for effective and environmentally sensitive methods of controlling vertebrate pest problems in agriculture and urban environment. Nonlethal natural repellents may meet this need where more traditional methods of control, such as scaring, shooting, and trapping, are either ineffectual or unacceptable. Neem (Azadirachta indica A Juss) extracts: oil, seed and leaf powder and chemicals from cockroach (Blaberus giganteus L.) were tested for their repellent properties. In addition defensive volatiles from B. giganteus were tested in an arena based on choice by smell (cheese or insect volatiles). This arena test used laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus Berk.); females were more active than males. Both sexes visited the holes with cheese more than holes containing insect's volatiles. However in a feeding test with one choice of food the control did not differ from the treatment. Neem products seem to act as antifeedant on rats: neem seed oil, neem seed powder and neem leaf powder reduced rats feeding respectively at concentration of 15 ml of oil/kg, 15--50 g of seed powder/kg, and 25--50 g of leaf powder/kg of rat chow. Overall neem leaf powder was less effective than seed powder and oil. Neem and insect products may have potential in controlling rats particularly in storage situation, which could lead to an important reduction of post-harvest loss of grains in Sahelian and Asian countries.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hsiung, C.

I studied 49 nests in 1995, and 68 nests in 1996 within the military low-level flying zone. Nest occupancy, clutch size, number of hatchlings, and number of young at 41 days of age were assessed at each nest. GIS flight track records provided frequency of aircraft at given distances and altitudes from the nest. Logistic regression analysis assessed the impact of flight frequency in four distance categories and four altitude categories on Osprey reproduction. The frequency of flights within each category were not accurate predictors of Osprey reproductive output. Nests were then randomly assigned to a buffer-zone radius of either 0, 1.85, 3.7, or to a control of 7.4 km, and reproductive output was compared among treatments, and between years. No significant differences were discovered among the reproductive parameters within either 1995 or 1996, but reproductive output was significantly higher in 1995, likely due to adverse weather conditions experienced in 1996.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bird, David M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s6963.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t419q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Airplanes -- Noise -- Environmental aspects -- Newfoundland and Labrador -- Labrador</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Military -- Environmental aspects -- Newfoundland and Labrador -- Labrador</dc:subject><dc:subject>Airplanes -- Noise -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Osprey -- Reproduction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Military -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xk72r"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An algebraic approach to communication complexity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tesson, Pascal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this work, we define the communication complexity of a monoid M as the maximum complexity of any language recognized by M, and show that monoid classes defined by, communication complexity classes form varieties. Then we prove that a group G has constant communication complexity for k players if and only if G is a nilpotent group of class at most ( k - 1), and has linear complexity otherwise. When M is aperiodic, we show that its 2-party communication complexity is constant if M is commutative, logarithmic if M is not commutative but is in the variety DA, and is linear otherwise. Moreover, we show that if M is in DA, there exists a k such that M has constant k-party communication complexity. We conjecture that this condition is also necessary and prove lower bounds in that direction. These results lead us to state a conjecture which would generalize Szegedy's theorem to O(1) players. They also suggest several interesting possibilities to further uncover algebraic characterizations of communication complexity classes.

Most dynamic schemes use a table of state counters associated with specific branches, coupled with a buffer recording recent branch outcomes to correlate the behaviour of individual branches with the history of other recently executed branch instructions. The combination generally yields a higher prediction rate than branch-specific counters alone. There is always a question of how much correlation to use and recent studies have reported that some programs benefit from higher levels of correlation than others. In our preliminary studies, we have made the following observation about the nature of branch behaviour: although it is true that most of the branches are correlated with previously executed branches, the actual number of branch outcomes they depend on varies strongly from one branch to another. This thesis presents the Elastic History Buffer, an effective scheme that can exploit the property that each branch instruction may have a different degree of correlation with other branches, while keeping the simple structure of a single global branch history.

Additional reports have implicated PKR in transcriptional regulation. In this study, a role for PKR in the regulation of signal transduction pathways that are required for IFN action was examined. It is demonstrated that PKR negatively regulates signaling pathways induced by IFNs and dsRNA. This regulatory effect is attributed to a protein-protein interaction between PKR and STAT1, the signaling component common to these pathways, that impairs STAT1 transcriptional function. The interaction between PKR and STAT1 is not a kinase-substrate relationship since PKR does not phosphorylate STAT1 and both wildtype and catalytically inactive PKR can interact with STAT1. It is also shown that PKR regulates STAT1 protein expression. The regulatory effect does not occur at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level since STAT1 mRNA transcription and stability are unaffected by PKR. Regulation of STAT1 expression is specific for STAT1 since expression of other STATs is not affected by PKR. The ability of PKR to regulate STAT1 function and expression has important implications in the control of gene expression, viral immunity, and cell growth.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sj37w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jq96r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8w32r7660"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Biomedical Ethics Unit</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ethical questions in human germ-line gene therapy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Szebik, Imre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although the first steps in somatic gene therapy have already taken place, research on human germ-line gene therapy still remains taboo.

A systematic and critical analysis of the arguments for and against germline gene interventions, such as "playing God" and moving on the slippery slope to enhancement will be elaborated. Special attention will be focused on the irreversible changes of the genome of future generations as well as on ethical considerations raised by different therapeutic and experimental possibilities, such as In Vitro Ovum Nuclear Transplantation (IVONT) or the creation of transgenic organisms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glass, Kathleen C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988n22n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r7660</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hf31r"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Expression of cadherins in human lymphocytes and skeletal muscle cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Symonds, James Matthew</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cadherins are a family of membrane glycoproteins involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The expression of cadherins in two human cell types, lymphocytes and skeletal myoblasts, was examined. Human peripheral lymphoid tissue lymphocytes were analysed for N-cadherin expression. A specific population of B lymphocytes was shown to express N-cadherin. Further, N-cadherin was shown to be expressed in a distinct pattern within the germinal centers of lymph nodes by immunohistochemical techniques. N-cadherin was also detected in a B cell population from human bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. These results suggest that N-cadherin may play a role in the development, differentiation and cell survival of B lymphocytes. Human myogenic cells were studied for cadherin expression before and after the induction of myoblast fusion. Polymerase chain reaction identified two cadherins, N-cadherin and OB-cadherin, in human myoblasts. These two cadherins were shown to be developmentally regulated during myogenesis. Collectively, these studies point to a role for cadherins in human myogenesis and lymphocyte differentiation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Blaschuk, Orest</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fk18m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hf31r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
