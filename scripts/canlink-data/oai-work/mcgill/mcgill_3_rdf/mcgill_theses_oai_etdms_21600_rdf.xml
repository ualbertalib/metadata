primaire : analyse de la politique du Burkino Faso</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lacroix-Maillette, Nathalie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Burkina Faso, French is the language of instruction at all levels of the educational system. The most recent research in linguistics suggests that it is preferable to teach linguistic minorities in their first language. This is particularly applicable in Burkina Faso, where over sixty national languages are used by different minority groups. This thesis outlines both the background and the problems of implementing such a policy in Burkina Faso. Using the contingency theory, and within the constraints of the local environment, it suggests possible scenarios for the introduction of instruction in national languages at the primary level. The thesis demonstrates that the introduction of educational reform in Burkina Faso including the teaching in national languages would not only be innovative but would require implementation in a very uncertain environment. Given these serious limitations, an adaptive management strategy is suggested. This particular strategy requires a constant task adjustment based on the experience of the participants and within the context of decentralised decision making.

A randomized double-blind clinical trial using placebo was conducted. Thirty patients were equally distributed between two groups. Each group received Penicillin G two million units intravenously pre-operatively, and one million units I.V. every three hours intraoperatively and three hours post-operatively. Group one then received Penicillin G, one million units I.V. every six hours for eight doses, then Penicillin V suspension 300 mg orally every six hours for eight doses. Group two received placebo in a similar dosing schedule. The wounds were inspected post-operatively for infection. One patient out of fifteen in group one (2.2%) and nine patients out of fifteen (60%) in group two (placebo) became infected. The overall infection rate was 33.3%. There was a statistically significant difference in rates of infection between the two groups (p $&lt;$ 0.01). Antibiotic prophylaxis for orthognathic surgical procedures should continue beyond the immediate post-operative period. Five days of antibiotic administration appears to provide adequate coverage.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801ph49r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mz63q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Dentistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adz010r265"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Rearrangement of Ig genes in avian B cell precursors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Benatar, Tania C.

To analyze early (pre-bursal) stages of B cell development, day 14e-15e chick embryo bone marrow cells were transformed with the avian REV-T(CSV) retrovirus and cloned. Some clones contained rearranged and expressed immunoglobulin genes, demonstrating that the bursal microenviornment is not required for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and expression. In order to examine the sequence of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements during chicken B cell development, day 12e embryo bursal cells were transformed using REV-T(CSV). Clones containing either rearranged immunoglobulin light chain or rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain genes demonstrated that chicken immunoglobulin variable region gene rearrangement occurs stochastically rather than sequentially (as is the case in mammalian species). Furthermore, sequencing of chicken immunoglobulin variable region genes demonstrated that allelic variations arise as a consequence of germ line gene conversion rather than point mutation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fs475.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010r265</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajh343t30n"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of oxyanion hole mutants of the cysteine proteases papain and cathepsin B</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Carrière, Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is well accepted that papain and cathepsin B work by stabilizing the transition state of the substrate formed during catalysis. This species carries a formal negative charge which, in the serine proteases family, is stabilized by an oxyanion hole formed by the enzyme. The same structure has been proposed to exist for cysteine proteases. Because the side chain of a Gln residue contributes one stabilizing hydrogen bond to the transition state in the oxyanion hole of papain and cathepsin B, site directed mutagenesis was used in this work to change this residue to Ala and Ser. It was found that this Gln contributes between 2.5 and 3.7 kcal/mol to the transition state stabilization in papain and 3.7 kcal/mol for cathepsin B. The pH profile of cathepsin B is also shifted to higher pH indicating a destabilization of the catalytic ion-pair caused by the mutation. These results demonstrate that the oxyanion hole plays an active role in catalysis by cysteine proteases.

Departing from previous criticism, which focuses on Sterne's playful narrative techniques, the discussion here elucidates other ways in which Tristram Shandy exemplifies the kind of irony Schlegel theorizes. These ways include: Sterne's "Mischgedicht" method, which amalgamates in a single work many types of style, or diverse permutations of form and content; the depiction of Parson Yorick, who epitomizes Socratic irony as Schlegel defines it in the 108th Lyceum fragment; Sterne's gentle satirizing of systematic thinkers, including his own narrator, Tristram; and Sterne's attitude toward words, knowledge, and reading. At the end of chapter 5, Sterne's irony is unraveled and reconstructed. This disentangling leads to a proposed refutation of recent interpretation of both Sterne and Schlegel. These studies see Sterne and Schlegel's irony as implying lack or flux of meaning. It is the strong contention of the following thesis that an essential aspect of Sterne and Schlegel's shared ironic world view is the continual, optimistic attempt to understand life, which necessarily presupposes a sincere and profound belief in both meaning and the reliable conveyance of it.

This thesis studies the land policies and practices in Metropolitan Kano, Nigeria, and investigates the issues and problems hindering the adequate supply of residential land to low-income groups. The thesis commences with a general study of urban land policies and low-income housing in developing countries. It examines the nature of housing problems in developing countries, the role of land in the housing problems, issues addressed by land policies, and policy measures and strategies used. The general study is followed by a specific study of the land policies and practices in the study area. The policy and institutional management frameworks are identified and examined. The roles of the major institutions are explained. The last section identifies and examines the main issues and problems with the existing policies. The thesis concludes that actions are necessary to address the identified issues and problems with the policies in order to avoid chaos. Suggestions for policy reform are made.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fs48f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jh343t326</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Land use -- Nigeria -- Kano</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poor -- Housing -- Nigeria -- Kano</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zc184"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Comparison of feedback generated by experts and learners during formative evaluation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Israeloff, Alanna</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite the recommendation to use both expert and learner feedback during formative evaluation, little research has compared the differences in data produced by these two sources. The presents study examines the differences in feedback produced by experts and learners. Six sessions with experts and six sessions with learners were conducted to obtain feedback about a six page instructional unit. The think-aloud method was used to gather data from experts and the talk-aloud method was used with learners. Comments from experts and learners were transcribed, segmented, and coded according to two coding system which addressed both the amount and type of feedback. Results indicated that when compared to learners, experts identify a higher percentage of problems, make more comments related to their knowledge of the subject matter, provide more revision suggestions, and summarize their comments and actions more often. Learners elaborate more about each problem and focus on issues related to instructional design and language. The findings support the use of both experts and learners to evaluate instruction.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w032417v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zc184</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Learning, Psychology of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Specialists</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t0349"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Aceh and the Portuguese : a study of the struggle of Islam in southeast Asia, 1500-1579</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hadi, Amirul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The coming of the Portuguese to Malacca in 1511 disrupted the existence of the people of the Malay-Indonesian archipelago, where trade and Islam were the main influences. The Christian European intruders were regarded as both economic competitors and religious enemies. The Muslim kingdoms of the region put up fierce resistance to the Portuguese. The strongest opposition was shown by Aceh. Its response was mainly expression in three aspects; military action, political maneuvering and economic reaction. Jihad (holy war) also played an important spiritual role in the response. This resistance combined with the strategic location of Aceh in the northern tip of Sumatra and the support of other Muslim powers accelerated the rise of Aceh in the sixteenth century.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35t961x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t0349</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islam -- Indonesia -- Aceh -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aceh (Indonesia) -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z200x"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Expression of measles fusion protein in insect and human cells using Eukaryotic expression vectors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marshall, Philip</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Measles virus is an animal enveloped virus that is a member of the genus morbillivirus in the paramyxoviridae family. Its envelope contains two surface glycoproteins H and F which are required for viral attachment and entry respectively. Virus penetration occurs via a process which involves fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane at the cell surface. Replication of the virus thus follows and leads to giant cell (syncytia) formation. The infectivity of measles virus is dependent upon a host proteolytic cleavage of the F$ sb0$ glycoprotein into two active subunits F$ sb1$ and F$ sb2$. This cleavage was later shown to expose a hydrophobic sequence at a NH$ sb2$ terminal of the F$ sb1$ which is directly involved in cell fusion and virus penetration. In order to increase our knowledge concerning cell mediated fusion events we have expressed the fusion glycoprotein of measles virus in insect and human cells by using recombinant baculo- and adenoviruses respectively. Analysis by SDS-PAGE demonstrated that our protein was first synthesized as a 60 Kd protein and cleaved subsequently into its two respective subunits F$ sb1$ and F$ sb2$ of 40 Kd and 20 Kd respectively. Hemolysis assays confirmed the biological activity of this protein in both systems. However, the fusion protein was unable to fuse insect cells.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806091w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z200x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
