Finding such a network toproduce the desired wave shape from a given input is reduced to twogeneral methods.The first method is a deductive one, reducing the required networkcharacteristics to design parameters, for a graphical synthesisprocedure. This is described in a general way only.The second method is an inductive or empirical one, based oncataloguing the responses obtained by applying a given input, atdifferent fundamental frequencies, to various networks. The procedureis illustrated experimentally and analysed mathematicallyfor simple cases.

The immunity induced in mice was nonspecific since S. minnesota ribosomal vaccines protected against S. typhimurium challenge infection in A/J mice and L. monocytogenes challenge infection in C57Bl/6J mice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vas, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vr691.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gk541</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Microbiology and Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xw04n"><ual:graduationDate>1975</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Use of immune electron microscopy to investigate antigenic relationships of virsuses: studies with arboviruses and hepatitis B antigens</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fauvel, Micheline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Representatives of five arbovirus taxons (alphavirus, flavivirus, bunyavirus, rhabdovirus and orbivirus) and Hepatitis B core antigen were studied by immune electron microscopy (IEM) in an attempt to determine the suitability of IEM for the study of antigenic relationships among viruses, for rapid identification of virus unknowns and for antibody detection. Arbovirus antigens were used to titrate hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluids and guinea pig sera. With the exception of the orbiviruses, specific clumping was observed for all homologous systems studied. Studies by IEM confirmed the antigenic relationships between arboviruses which had previously been demonstrated by other serological tests. Alphavirus unknowns were identified in the IEM test by the use of appropriate dilutions of antisera. The Hepatitis B core antigen was used in the IEM test to detect core antibody in sera from patients with hepatitis B infections. In the same test, the core antigen did not show any cross-relationship with Hepatitis B surface antigen.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Spence, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085p30t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xw04n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Microbiology and Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322h70j"><ual:graduationDate>1975</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Etude des effets d’une obstruction chronique et progressive du canal pancréatique principal sur l’épithélium des canaux et sur le tissue pancréatique exocrine: un nouveau modèle expérimental</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Biron, Simon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>L'incidence accrue du cancer du pancréas nous orienta à étudier un modèle expérimental pour produire une obstruction progressive des canaux pancréatiques.

When cells were grown under glucose limitation in chemostat cultures, the morphology was normal at specific growth rates between 0.05 and 0.125 per hour (doubling times between 14 and 5.5 hours) at 25°C. At the same specific growth rates and temperature, but under biotin limitation, aberrant morphology was observed. Therefore, cellular aberration is not the result of a reduced growth rate, but probably is due to the impairment of reactions in cell wall synthesis which require biotin as a cofactor. Growth-limiting concentrations of glucose and biotin were established for the organism prior to the chemostat studies. A globiformis 425 undergoes sphere-rod morphogenesis at a specific growth rate of 0.11 per hour at 25°c under glucose limitation. Aberrant cells did not exhibit a morphogenetic cycle.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s562n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107216c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Microbiology and Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s563x"><ual:graduationDate>1975</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Panspecific immunosuppression and neoplastic enhancement</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wherry, Patrick E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study was divided into three separate sections. PAR T I examined the production of a state, of hypogammaglobulinemia within a murine model. By sequential treatment of newborn mice with heterologous anti-mouse immunoglobulin M (IgM), panspecific immunosuppression ensued. This was documented by assaying serum immunoglobulin levels, and by comparing these values to macroscopic and microscopic parameters. PART II examined the growth characteristics of two solid neoplasms. By careful selection of the relevant conditions, a change in tumor growth was achieved by immunological manipulation. With the tumor, P-815-X2, this satisfied the definition of neoplastic enhancement. With the tumor T1699 enhancement of tumor growth was vaguely suggested, but not documented. PART III represented an attempt to synthesize these seemingly disparate areas. By removing the immunological factors involved (via panspecific immunosuppression), and by employing an enhancible neoplasm, abrogation or prevention of this phenomenon was attempted. Results were not specific. They suggested that this approach warrants further investigation, but failed to document any definitive relationship.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gordon, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386n684.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s563x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azc77st08j"><ual:graduationDate>1976</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Autoradiographic studies of collagen synthesis in the growth plate of the growing rat</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Spector, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The technique of autoradiography is discussed with respect to technical and theoretical considerations, as well as historical and modern applications. The literature is reviewed concerning collagen: its properties, structure and biosynthesis. The experimental work presented deals with the application of autoradiographic technique to the study of bone matrix turnover in general, and the study of collagen synthesis and turnover in particular. Studies reported concern quantitative autoradiographic assessment of glycine and proline incorporation into the matrix of the distal femoral growth plate of the growing rat. The differential incorporation of tritiated glycine into nucleic acid and protein synthesis in the distal femur of the growing rat has been studied using scintillation methods. The nucleic acid/protein ratio, of tritiated glycine incorporation was determined. Results of this study reveal that it is inaccurate to use this amino acid- in quantitative autoradiography of collagen synthesis in young rats. Finally the effect of high dose calcitonin administration on collagen synthesis in the distal femur of young rats was investigated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brooks, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b1842.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77st08j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
