Eighteen males with at least one legally charged pedophilic offense (excluding incest) participated in the research. Seven of the subjects sexually molested a male child (homosexual pedophiles) and eleven subjects sexually molested a female child (heterosexual pedophiles). Subjects were administered the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI). Subjects and their therapists also participated in a structured interview which sought data on psycho-social and offense variables. Analysis of the MCMI results found that when profile configurations were compared, the homosexual group showed higher mean sub-scale elevations, a more cohesive pattern of sub-scale elevations, and significantly higher sub-scale scores for Passive-Aggressive personality as a feature. The heterosexual group shared Avoidant/Dependent features of personality with the homosexual group but individual profile configurations were much less homogeneous in sub-scale elevations. The analysis of the NPI results found no significant difference between the groups. A comparison of the structured interview data for the groups strongly suggests that homosexual offenders are more structured in their pedophilic interest than heterosexual offenders. The results are discussed in relation to the validity of the fixated/regressed model for homosexual and heterosexual pedophiles, respectively. The relationship between personality, aetiology of pedophilic behavior, and offense pattern is considered. Implications and suggestions for future research are outlined.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rp33g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kb409</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pedophilia -- Research</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child sexual abuse -- Research</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r9674387"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of auditory streaming upon duplex perception of speech</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ciocca, Valter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>When a formant transition (isolated transition) and the remainder (base) of a synthesized syllable are presented to opposite ears most subjects perceive two simultaneous sounds, a syllable and a nonspeech chirp. The isolated transition determines the identity of the syllable at one ear and, at the same time, is perceived as a chirp at the opposite ear. This phenomenon, called duplex perception, has been interpreted as the result of the independent operation of two perceptual modes, the phonetic and the auditory mode. In order to test this hypothesis, the isolated transition was preceded and followed by a series of identical transitions sent to the same ear. This streaming procedure weakened the contribution of the transition to the perceived phonetic identity of the syllable. This weakening effect could have been explained in terms of the habituation of an hypothetical phonetic feature detector sensitive to the repetition of identical transitions. For this reason, the same effect was replicated by capturing the isolated transition with others which were aligned on the same frequency-by-time trajectory as the isolated one. These findings are consistent with the idea that the integration of the transition with the base was affected by the operation of general-purpose auditory processes. This contrasts with the hypothesis that the phonetic mode integrated the dichotic stimuli independently of the auditory mode.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf456.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9674387</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Auditory perception</dc:subject><dc:subject>Auditory evoked response</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p784r"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Binding interactions of bile acids and bile pigments with amines</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhu, Xiao Xia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The binding of selected bile acids and bile pigments by peptides and quaternary amines has been studied by adsorption and NMR experiments. Novel adsorbents with quaternized peptide-containing functional groups for bile acids have been prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis techniques. The adsorption studies, conducted in aqueous buffer solutions, show that these resins have an enhanced capacity, on a per active site basis, and improved specificity over cholestyramine and colestipol. The interaction between bile acid anions and the pendants is predominantly ionic linkage, although hydrophobic and other interactions are also important. An NMR study of the binding between bile acids and various ligands, including peptides, by the determination of carbon-13 spin-lattice relaxation times, confirms the ionic and hydrophobic interactions which occur cooperatively and simultaneously. New adsorbents for bilirubin have been prepared by covalently coating a water-swellable polyamide resin with polypeptides. These resins have much higher capacities for bilirubin in aqueous buffer solution than cholestyramine and improved capacities over the resins with attached oligopeptide pendants. The binding behavior of the resin coated with poly- sc D-lysine is the same as that of poly- sc L-lysine. The amount of bilirubin adsorbed by these resins is directly proportional to the number of lysine residues on the resin, which is consistent with the formation of an ionic linkage. This is confirmed by a study of the interaction of bilirubin with an oligopeptide, sc L-lysyl- sc L-lysine, by measurements of proton and carbon-13 NMR spin-lattice relaxation times combined with nitrogen-15 NMR experiments. The $ sp{15}$N NMR spectra of bilirubin and some related bile pigments have also been assigned by two-dimensional $ sp{15}$N-$ sp1$H heteronuclear correlation experiments.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c351z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p784r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p7851"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A mass spectrometric investigation of two rat models of defective medium chain fatty acid oxidation using deuterium labelled substrates</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Montgomery, Jane Aimée</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Medium chain fatty acid oxidation was investigated in riboflavin deficient and 2-octynoic acid treated rats.

A new method to quantitate individual acylcarnitines in urine using fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and deuterium labelled acylcarnitines as internal standards demonstrated that administration of L-carnitine did enhance excretion of free carnitine and short chain acylcarnitines along with some dicarboxylcarnitines in all groups.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870w53b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p7851</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55z851t"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of informal social support on coping, stress and life satisfaction in mothers of children with severe developmental disabilities</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marcenko, Maureen Olivia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The trend towards family care of children with developmental disabilities has lead us to examine ways to support families. One source of help primary caregivers have available to them is informal social support. Ninety mothers of children with severe developmental disabilities, residing in four Michigan counties (two urban and two rural) were interviewed face-to-face to determine the nature and extent of their informal social support systems. The types of support investigated were perceived, instrumental, emotional, informational and network. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate techniques. The findings indicate that mothers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day care of their children. However, the help they do receive is important to them. Assistance proffered to mothers comes mostly from immediate family members. Although married and working women perceive greater support from some family members, when help with daily tasks was measured, these women did not actually receive any greater assistance. Multivariate analysis revealed that perceived informal social support was associated with better ability to cope and lower levels of stress. The influence of informal social support on life satisfaction was less certain. Ability to cope was significantly correlated with decreased stress and increased life satisfaction. None of the various types of informal support explained coping, stress or life satisfaction. However, emotional support turned out to be a proxy for emotional problems, and so it was associated with higher stress, and lower coping and life satisfaction. None of the other independent variables included in the model (severity of handicap, formal support or life stress) explained the variance in the dependent variables. When actual regression coefficients were examined, it was concluded that increasing the amount of social support to mothers is not a very efficacious approach to helping them reduce their stress and improve their copin</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418n933.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z851t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Adaptation level (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stress (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mothers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akp78gh077"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Kinetic properties of two folate-dependent dehydrogenase-hydrolases</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rios-Orlandi, Ethel Marie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The kinetic relationship between the activities of multifunctional enzymes from folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism were examined. Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase catalyzes the main disposal reaction for excess one-carbon units produced in the liver. The enzyme, which catalyzes also a hydrolytic reaction, was purified from porcine liver and a radioactive assay was developed to measure both activities simultaneously. These and other kinetic measurements established that the dehydrogenase and hydrolase are kinetically independent activities of a single type of polypeptide. NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase is found in all transformed mammalian cells and catalyzes sequential reactions with channeling of the metabolic intermediate. However, these activities are kinetically independent in contrast to similar activities of the NADP-dependent trifunctional enzyme found in all eukaryotic cells. These properties explain the observation that only the NAD-dependent enzyme conjugate can catalyze the conversion of formyl- to methylenetetrahydrofolate in vitro.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182k869.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gh077</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Folic acid</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj430546b"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Paleo-Indian occupation of southwestern Ontario : distribution, technology, and social organization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Deller, D.

More than 15 sites and numerous loci associated with Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene societies in southwestern Ontario are reported. These are organized into archaeological complexes and their interpretation is synthesized into a broader understanding of early occupations in the Northeast. Complexes are defined by projectile point typology and substantiated by other technological traits and patterns of lithic raw material utilization. Early (fluted point associated) Paleo-Indian complexes are, in suggested chronological order, Gainey, Parkhill, and Crowfield. Late Paleo-Indian complexes are Holcombe and Madina. All date between 11 000 and 10 000 B.P. according to geological considerations, pollen dating, and comparisons to dated materials elsewhere. Seasonal rounds of resource exploitation within broad territorial ranges are suggested for Gainey and Parkhill populations. Commodity exchange involving particular implement categories provides evidence of band interaction. Mortuary practices and religious beliefs are suggested by possible cremation burials at the Crowfield site. Other significant behavioural patterns are revealed through inter- and intra-site analyses.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741s45w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430546b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Paleo-Indians -- Ontario</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ontario -- Antiquities</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prehistoric peoples -- Ontario</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956g540"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Spectrally correct finite element analysis of electromagnetic fields</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pinchuk, Amy Ruth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Direct solution for three dimensional electric or magnetic field vectors throughout the frequency spectrum is accomplished by a finite element formulation which includes displacement and conduction currents, and requires no special treatment for material interfaces. Analysis of bus bar and Bath cube eddy current problems demonstrate the capabilities of the method. Spurious components in solutions to vector field problems are shown to corrupt deterministic solutions. These corruptions are identifiable with spurious modes familiar to high frequency modal analysis. Spectrally correct mixed order finite elements are demonstrated to retrieve accuracy in deterministic analyses. The formulation may be limited by computer round-off at matrix assembly which affects the solenoidality of vector fields. Furthermore, extreme values encountered in low frequency eddy current analysis lead to ill conditioning and unreliable solutions. These numerical instabilities are overcome by parametric adjustment of permittivities. Error estimates are established to monitor inaccuracies introduced by permittivity adjustment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440t06t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g540</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eddy currents (Electric)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Finite element method</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electromagnetic fields -- Computer simulation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab8515p08r"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Oceanography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An ecological study of a reef-associated zooplankton community of Barbados, West Indies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Boers, Jacobus Johannes</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A reef-associated zooplankton community was monitored at weekly intervals for 53 weeks. Samples were collected from quadrats of dense coral cover using emergence net traps. The numerical and biomass fluctuations of 15 taxonomic groups, 7 size classes and 5 feeding groups of the community were determined both temporally and spatially. The community was composed of abundant and diverse taxa (81) with cyclopoid copepods being the most important taxon. Larger-sized fauna (e.g. amphipods, decapods, mysids, etc.) were the second most important abundance and biomass contributors. Size class analysis illustrated a bimodal size distribution spectrum. The well developed second mode of the spectrum was attributed to substratum characteristics which permitted an enhanced macrofaunal/detritivore presence. Although week to week fluctuations of the abundance/biomass data were marked, diversity indices indicated a persistent and resilient community. The nocturnal vertical migrations of the fauna did not show a persistent pattern with the varying phases of 12 sequentially monitored lunar cycles. Substratum heterogeneity was primarily responsible for the spatial distribution pattern of the fauna. Although the data variance suggested stochasticity, time-series procedures determined that cross-correlations between the numerical abundances of taxa, size classes and feeding groups occurred without a lead or lag. Similar analyses identified chlorophyll a as the important environmental variable and also as a leading indicator of particular taxonomic, size and feeding group abundances. It was concluded that reef-associated zooplankton communities are abundant, diverse assemblages structured by periodicities which in combination act to form important links between tropical, inshore benthic and pelagic ecosystems.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g0880.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515p08r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Marine zooplankton -- Barbados</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cyclopoida</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coral reef ecology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82k792p"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The ecological importance of algal phagotrophy to lake plankton communities</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bird, David F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this thesis is to incorporate the smallest organisms, in particular the heterotrophic bacteria and their predators, more fully into current descriptions of aquatic community structure and dynamics. A strong, positive empirical relationship was found between bacterial abundance and chlorophyll concentration in freshwater and marine systems. Common members of the photosynthetic phytoplankton (all chrysophyceans) were shown to be major, even dominant, grazers of these bacteria. This phagotrophic capability is quantitatively important to the bacterioplankton, to the mixotrophs themselves, and in some cases, to the structure of the limnological community as a whole. Grazing by mixo- and heterotrophic protozoans is concentrated on the largest bacterial cells that also have the greatest growth rates. Relatively lower removal rates of the tiniest cells, with low growth rates, is proposed to explain their numerical dominance in lakes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gk537.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k792p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lake ecology -- Experiments</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phagocytosis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Algae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plankton</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p529v"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Shortages of skilled blue collar workers in the machining trades in Montreal</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lepine, Irène</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to examine the evidence of and responses to shortages of skilled blue collar workers in the machining trades--tool and die makers and machinists--in the Montreal metropolitan region. The period studied is 1974 to 1981 and the study focuses on employer behaviour. It was found that data available from government sources documenting the supply and demand for thee occupations are generally inadequate. The research underlines that one of the fundamental difficulties in compiling net supply and demand figures for these occupations is the pinning down of skill levels involved. Employers' definitions of skill are therefore analyzed. This research indicates that organizational factors appear to influence the recruitment process as well as the choice of adjustment measures. It was found that employers dispose of and use many measures to respond to shortages. Specifically it was found that the adjustment process does not take place only through changes in wage rates. Rather employers will tend to favour adjustment measures that maintain existing arrangements within firms and preserve management discretion.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000071z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p529v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Industrial relations -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Labor supply -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Machinists -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Supply and demand</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tool and die makers -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Supply and demand</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j167b"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Technology and management : a study of the diffusion of numerical control machinery in Central Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lewis, Alan D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study analyses the diffusion of numerically controlled machine tools in sixty Quebec and Ontario engineering and metalworking firms.

Reducing the dietary AC-balance from +314 to $-22$ (meq kg$ sp{-1}$ dry matter (DM)) did not affect plasma Ca level but reduced Ca retention mainly due to a 10-fold increase in urinary Ca excretion with similar rate of apparent absorption. It also decreased urine pH and titratable acidity. The response to induced hypocalcemia created by the infusion of 4.6% EDTA solution revealed that reducing dietary AC-balance from +354 to +37 (meq kg$ sp{-1}$DM) did not affect the volume of the compartment, within which there was rapid equilibration of free Ca but tended to increase the rate of Ca mobilization from it during the infusion. The Ca kinetic study with a four-compartment model indicated that reducing dietary AC-balance from +338 to $-127$ (meq kg$ sp{-1}$DM) during the eucalcemic period and from +429 to $-147$ (meq kg$ sp{-1}$DM) during an EGTA-infusion period (simulated lactational Ca loss) caused hypercalciuria and increased ionized form of plasma Ca. Increased true intestinal Ca absorption and reduced bone accretion were observed in the lowest AC-balance diet only during the EGTA-infusion period. There were no differences in the size of total exchangeable Ca pool but the amount of Ca movement between them tended to increase in reduced AC-balance diets during both periods.

Densities of seal holes were determined using a combination of trained dogs to locate the subnivean breathing holes and removal sampling. Birth lairs were not seen before 4 April, but the incidence of these structures increased as the season progressed. Structures maintained by male seals were evident in late March, but were not found after mid-May. In 1984, densities of seal holes were correlated with ice thickness. In 1985, no relationship was detected between seal hole density and habitat. In 1986, the highest densities of subnivean structures including birth lairs, were associated with deep snow conditions located in areas of late consolidating ice. No relationship was identified between the density of male structures and any habitat variables. The mean reproductive rate for females $&gt;$7 years old was 0.64. Between March and June for adult males lost 204 g per day with 72% of this weight being lost from blubber. Pregnant females lost 467 g per day with 68% of the loss occurring from the blubber.

London components of the surface free energy were calculated from the increment per methylene group in the free energy of adsorption of n-alkanes at zero coverage. Values typical of low energy surfaces were obtained for both types of "as received" carbon fibers. Cleaning of the fibers at elevated temperatures under nitrogen caused a significant increase in the London component. This was attributed to the desorption of physically adsorbed species (CO$ sb2$, H$ sb2$O) that occupied the high energy sites on "as received" fibers. Similar results were obtained in the finite coverage region where London components were calculated from the spreading pressures of the hydrocarbons. Type II adsorption isotherms were measured for n-alkanes on carbon fibers. The fibers were pretreated by heating to various temperatures under nitrogen. The BET surface areas of the fibers increased with increasing pretreatment temperature, due to the presence of microporosity. From the spreading pressures of ethanol on carbon fibers, the polar interactions between ethanol and the fibers were estimated.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nx66w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257f86p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Carbon fibers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gas chromatography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asq87bv262"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cloning and characterization of Mu-like transposable bacteriophage D108</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Szatmari, George B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bacteriophage D108 is a temperate, transposable, mutator phage similar to phage Mu. These heteroimmune phages have 37 kb linear, double-stranded DNA genomes which are over 90% homologous. We have isolated four independent insertions of an entire thermoinducible D108 c ts10 phage genome in the low-copy plasmid pSC101. We also characterized a previously isolated Mu c ts62 insertion in the same plasmid replicon. Fine-structure analysis of these insertions showed that lytically transposing Mu and D108 genomes caused 5 bp duplications of the target site. In addition, we cloned and sequenced the terminal 800 bp of the right end of D108, a region important for the transposition of the phage genome. This analysis has delineated the critical DNA sequences required for D108 transposition, and has also indicated that these sequences are not entirely homologous to those of phage Mu, despite the fact that the phages can transpose each other's DNA. Moreover, a 520 bp insertion of DNA found in the right end of D108, but not Mu, has also been characterized, and has begins 72 bp from the right end of D108, immediately adjacent to the cis -acting sequences required for D108 transposition. This insertion does not appear to be an insertion element, but rather an extra gene in the right end of D108 whose function is apparently non-essential for D108 growth. The sequence differences and rearrangements between Mu and D108 in this region indicate a complex evolutionary relationship between these phages at their right extremities. In addition to characterizing the DNA differences between Mu and D108, we have also examined a difference occurring at the protein level. The L gene products of Mu and D108 have different molecular weights, but are encoded from a region of homology between the two phages. We cloned a region of D108 DNA that was able to rescue amber mutations in the L gene of Mu by homologous recombination, but not complement Mu L amber phages in vivo. This region produced a gene product which was truncated at the carboxy terminus, but was able to cross-react with anti-Mu phage serum. The production of this truncated protein was lethal to growing Escherichia coli cells, apparently interfering with cell wall biosynthesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m242w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bv262</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988k60n"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies towards a synthesis of sesbanimide</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tan, Charles Chu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A general method of transforming aldehydes via $ alpha$,$ beta$-unsaturated esters to the 3-substituted glutarimide ring was developed and was applied to the construction of ring A of $(-)$-sesbanimide A (1) and the AB ring moiety of (+)-sesbanimide A (2).

The procedure which uses a citrate-dithionite-bicarbonate (CDB) reagent has been chosen among five commonly used methods. It makes it possible to distinguish four statistically different modes of association between P and Fe based on the (Fe/P)$ sb{ rm CDB}$ values. The extraction sequence is applied to suspend particulate matter and to surface sediments of the Saint-Lawrence Upper Estuary. The intensity and the position of the core of its maximum turbidity zone is determined by sediment exchanges between the channel and large intertidal flats. These exchanges are controlling seasonal fluctuations observed in the estuarine phosphorus geochemistry: The fresh to salt water early transition zone is the main site for the flocculation and deposition of river derived colloids, mainly as surface coating on particle, a process which results in phosphate adsorption on the suspended matter; After this process has reached equilibrium in the water column, partial desorption occurs on the flats as the particles settle temporarily in spring and summer. The P-depleted solids are returned to the estuary when the marsh vegetation is destroyed in the fall by migrating snow geese. Laboratory experiments with natural materials confirm the equilibrium level of P-adsorption observed in situ, and evidence its reversibility under the low reducing conditions typical of marsh surface sediments.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1392592.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dn04h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Phosphorus</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geochemistry -- Québec (Province) -- Saint Lawrence River Estuary</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz8060462"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of hypoferremia on a murine lymphoma and a comparison with Neisseria meningitidis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Caldwell, Margaret</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Both neoplastic and Neisseria meningitidis cells can obtain iron from transferrin in vivo. Previous findings (Holbein, 1980) showed that the murine hypoferremic response inhibits Neisseria meningitidis infection by iron deprivation. The present studies demonstrated that hypoferremia does not limit Fe acquisition by or growth of murine lymphoma cells. Transferrin binding sites on lymphoma cells and N. meningitidis were enumerated and the transferrin binding affinities were determined. Iron deprivation increased the number of transferrin binding sites on N. meningitidis cells. N. subflava and Escherichia coli were unable to bind transferrin. Competition binding studies demonstrated that lymphoma cells bound human transferrin over murine and bovine transferrin, conalbumin, and lactoferrin and suggested that neisserial transferrin binding sites had lower specificity. Further competition studies indicated that lymphoma transferrin binding sites had higher affinity for ferri-transferrin than for apo-transferrin while neisserial sites bound these two ligands to the same extent. This can explain why hypoferremia inhibits iron acquisition by N. meningitidis but not by lymphoma cells.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kr14r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz8060462</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085k88m"><ual:graduationDate>1986</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Topogenic sequences of mitochondrial precursor proteins</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nguyen, Mai</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A cDNA encoding the precursor form of rat liver mitochondrial matrix enzyme, ornithine carbamyl transferase (pOCT) was cloned and its complete nucleotide sequence was determined. Full-length pOCT cDNA was cloned in pSP64 and expressed under the control of the SP6 promoter. The SP6-produced precursor protein was imported by rat heart mitochondria in vitro and processed to mature protein. Fusions of pOCT presequence to bacterial asparagine synthetase (AS) facilitated delivery of the hybrid protein to the mitochondrial matrix, indicating that the signal sequence of precursor ornithine carbamyl transferase contains sufficient information to target and translocate attached proteins into mitochondria. Deletion mutation within the pOCT signal sequence (removal of residues 22-30) resulted in a mutant precursor which was imported into the mitochondrial matrix, but remained largely unprocessed; furthermore, the low level of processing that was observed appears to be incorrect. Deletion and substitution mutation introduced to the downstream region of the normal pOCT processing site affected neither import nor correct processing. Fusion of pOCT amino-terminal region to the vesicular stomatitis G protein (VSV G), an integral protein localized to the plasma membrane of infected cells, allows post-translational insertion as well as proteolytic processing of the hybrid protein. The protein, however, remained anchored at the mitochondrial inner membrane, apparently via the hydrophobic VSV G stop-transfer domain. Taken together, the results help to elucidate the nature of signal domains within mitochondrial precursor proteins that specify targeting, membrane-translocation, translocation arrest, intra-mitochondrial sorting, and processing-site recognition.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rk998.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085k88m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rh72p"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Interaction forces between human red cells aggutinated by antibody</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tha, Susan P.

The mean forces separating the cells of individual doublets were found to be proportional to antiserum concentration from 0.73 to 3.56% v/v, normal forces increasing from 0.060 to 0.197 nN and shear forces from 0.023 to 0.072 nN. It was impossible to determine which force was responsible for break-up. Measurements of the doublets' mean dimensionless period of rotation indicated that doublets were rigidly linked.

The assembly properties of exhaustively dephosphorylated NF subunits were found to be similar to those of untreated subunits, as determined by SDS-PAGE and electron microscopy. Moreover, in vitro dephosphorylation removed only about half of the phosphate moieties suggesting the possible presence of inaccessible phosphorylation site(s). The anomalous migration of NF subunits on SDS-PAGE was abolished when the glutamyl carboxyl groups, localized largely in the carboxyl terminal domain, were chemically modified by glycinamidation. The apparent molecular weights of NF subunits on SDS-PAGE after glycinamidation, and dephosphorylation were $ sim60$ Kd, $ sim112$ Kd, and $ sim138$ Kd for NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H, respectively. The expression of all three NF subunits in cultured adrenal chromaffin cells was demonstrated by immunocytochemical staining, and by immunoprecipitation techniques. The NFs in chromaffin cells, which are largely restricted to the perikaryon, were found to be hypophosphorylated, as they comigrated with in vitro dephosphorylated bovine NF subunits on SDS-PAGE. Triton-soluble pools of NF-M, and NF-H were shown to be present in chromaffin cells. These were found to be distinct from the cytoskeleton-associated NF subunits based on differences in their relative amounts, and in the rate of $ sp{32}$P turnover. In addition, differences in the phosphopeptide maps of Triton-soluble and cytoskeletal NF-M suggested that certain phosphorylation sites may be important in regulating NF subunit assembly. Treatment of chromaffin cells with phorbol esters markedly increased the phosphorylation of NF subunits in both the cytoskeletal and Triton-soluble fractions. This protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation was accompanied by a decrease in the electrophoretic mobilities of NF-M and NF-H on SDS-PAGE, indicating the attainment of higher phosphorylation levels. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis indicated that protein kinase C phosphorylates NF-M at a new site(s). Incubation of chromaffin cells in growth medium containing 8-Br cAMP and NGF also resulted in the increased $ sp{32}$P labelling of NF subunits. The in vitro phosphorylation of cytoskeleton preparations from chromaffin cells resulted in the hyperphosphorylation of NF subunits to levels seen for axonal NFs.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pn62t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d717r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qm68v"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mechanism of decrease of protein synthesis by sodium cyanate in murine P388 leukemia cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lazarus, Philip</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this study was to examine the inhibition of protein synthesis in murine P388 cells by sodium cyanate (NaOCN).

NaOCN does not appear to affect the P388 cell ribosomal machinery, tRNA or protein synthesis elongation processes. The formation of the 48 S initiation complex was significantly inhibited by NaOCN.

In 52 anesthetized animals, the responses of 440 cells were studied in three series of experiments. In series 1, iontophoretic administration of various doses (7-200 nA) of ACh produced increased firing rates in 16% (33/203) of the neurons tested. Responses to somatic stimuli were modulated by ACh in 29% of the cases. These modulatory effects were predominantly excitatory, with only 5% of the cells being depressed by ACh. In series 2 and 3, 50 nA of ACh applied in the absence of other overt stimula altered the responsiveness of a cell to subsequent tactile stimulation or iontophoretically-applied glutamate. This occurred in 21% (13/61) of the cells. In contrast, when 50 nA of ACh was administered simultaneously with glutamate and/or receptive field stimulation, altered responsiveness occurred in 77% (76/99) of the cases. One-third (32/99) of these cells displayed prolonged changes in responsiveness, lasting from 7 min to over 1 h. Cells modulated by ACh were found in all cortical layers. The percentage of cholinoceptive cells was highest in layer VI (78%), and was not less than 50% in any layer. Both long and short-term potentiating effects of ACh on responses to somatic stimulation and responses to glutamate administration could be reversibly blocked by low iontophoretic doses of atropine.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526d04p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w66344392</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
