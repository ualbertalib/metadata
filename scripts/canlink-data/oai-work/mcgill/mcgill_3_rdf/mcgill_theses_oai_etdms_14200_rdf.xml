By comparing rocks of two different metamorphic grades, i.e. rocks of the greenschist and amphibolite facies, any observed differences in the distributions of elements between coexisting micas might be related to the pressure temperature conditions at the time of formation. Biotite and muscovite pairs from a granite pegmatite, two granites, and a quartz monzonite were included for comparison in the study.

This so-called afterglow was first reported by Warburg in 1884 (l) and was subsequently studied spectroscopically by Lewis (2). The physical and chemical properties of the glowing gas were investigated in more detail by Strutt (later, Lord Rayleigh) during the period from 1911 until his death in 1947. He found it to be chemically very reactive, and named it "active nitrogen".
