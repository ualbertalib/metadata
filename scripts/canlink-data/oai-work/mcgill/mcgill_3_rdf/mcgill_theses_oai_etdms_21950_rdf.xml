Beyond realism, Sciascia's writing comprises important information regarding the author's conception of the intellectual's work in the political and social domains. Sciascia had to develop writing techniques that enable him to efficiently merge his essayist bent and narrative inspiration, his penchant to document facts and his capacity to create them artistically. These are the origins of his unusual narrative technique--an amalgam of the eighteenth century essay and contemporary detective novel, locked in a crossroads of reason and non-reason. Sciascia's cultural background, a section between illuminism and Marxism, is the reason behind his need to ignore the traditional divisions between literary genres in order to originate a text which vehicles both his social and political engagement and his artistic creation. Although Sciascia's works reflect this unique pattern, critical studies to date have overlooked it, mislead, as they may be, by the polemic impact of the text and the man behind it.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gilordino, Sergio Meria</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k5888.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm52t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sciascia, Leonardo -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw3763772v"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Determinants of health care seeking behaviour in the Pahou PHC project in the People's Republic of Benin : an exploratory study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Belanger, Marc Andrew</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this study is to identify factors which may be preventing use of an experimental health care program in the People's Republic of Benin. While previous surveys have focused more specifically on the impact of fees on use and demand, our aim to identify a wider range of factors. There are two principle methods by which this can be done. One is to extract possible factors from a review of the relevant literature. The other is to carry out an exploratory, qualitative study in the field. We have used both these methods. A qualitative study is a necessary prelude to a survey, since we initially have no specific idea about which factors to measure and investigate. The aim is to identify factors which may be relevant so that a subsequent survey, with a larger number of cases, could quantify and measure their influence and statistical significance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eschen, Donald Jon</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sh12t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763772v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Medical care -- Utilization -- Benin</dc:subject><dc:subject>Primary health care -- Benin</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qj622"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Wetting of alumina-based ceramics by aluminum alloys</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lebeau, Thomas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During the last 20 years, ceramic fiber reinforced metal matrix composites, referred to as MMCs, have provided a relatively new way of strengthening metals. High specific modulus and a good fatigue resistance in dynamic loading conditions or for high temperature applications make these composites very attractive for replacing classic alloys. The first requirement for the fabrication of MMCs, especially by processes involving liquid metals, is a certain degree of wetting of fibers by the liquid metal which will permit a good bonding between the two phases. The conventional experimental approach to wettability consists of measuring the contact angle of a drop of the liquid metal resting on flat substrate of the ceramic reinforcement materials. This work deals with the fabrication of eutectic $ rm ZrO sb2/Al sb2O sb3 (ZA), ZrO sb2/Al sb2O sb3/TiO sb2$ (ZAT), and $ rm ZrO sb2/Al sb2O sb3/SiO sb2$ (ZAS) ceramic substrates and the study of their wetting behavior by different classes of Al alloys. Wetting experiments were performed under high vacuum or under ultra high purity Ar atmosphere. Four major variables were tested to study the wetting behavior of the different ceramic/metal systems. Variables include holding time, melt temperature, alloy and ceramic compositions. Ceramic materials were sintered under vacuum at temperatures ranging from 1500$ sp circ$C to 1790$ sp circ$C for 2.5 hours, and achieved over 96% of the theoretical density. An experimental set-up was designed to measure in-situ contact angles using the sessile drop method. For any ceramic substrate, a temperature over 950$ sp circ$C was necessary to observe an equilibrium wetting angle less than 90$ sp circ$ with pure Al; by alloying the aluminum, wetting could be observed at lower temperatures ($ theta$ = 76-86$ sp circ$ at 900$ sp circ$C for Al-10wt%Si, $ theta sim72 sp circ$ at 850$ sp circ$C for Al-2.4wt%Mg). Finally, ZAS specimens reacted with molten Al alloys over 900$ sp circ$C to produce Zr-Al based intermetallics at the metal/ceramic interface.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>ew, R. A.

(2) Thirteen characteristics: 3 rheological properties (viscosity, bleeding, setting time) and 10 mechanical properties (grain size, modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio, compressive strength, indirect tensile strength, bond strength (direct tensile), shrinkage/expansion, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water permeability and leached water analysis, and microstructural characteristics. (3) Three temperatures: 4$ sp circ$C, 10$ sp circ$C and 20$ sp circ$C. (4) Eight water/cement ratios (0.4:1, 0.5:1, 0.6:1, 0.8:1, 1.0:1, 1.2:1, 1.5:1 and 2.0:1). (5) Other parameters: different types and amounts of admixtures, mixing times and mixing speeds. The study revealed that: (1) Temperature variations have a strong influence on grouts' setting time and some mechanical characteristics (compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio, etc.). (2) The variation of grout water/cement ratios is important for both rheological and mechanical behavior; high W/C ratios lead to stability problems (high bleeding), which results in an effective W/C ratio which is not the same as the ratio recorded during mixing. (3) Superplasticizers are needed to improve the fluidity (viscosity) of microfine cement-based grouts in order to achieve the same degree of workability as the ordinary Portland cements, but they increase the grout setting time. (4) Both mixing time and mixing speed (in the range tested) have minimal effect on the rheological characteristics of the grouts. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mirza, M.

When these films are prepared by vacuum evaporation, a precise control of the substrate and source temperatures is needed to obtain the required stoichiometry. It is therefore interesting to study a simplified vacuum evaporation method which does not need the precise control of substrate and temperatures. In the present work, a thermal evaporation technique has been adopted for the deposition of the Sb/In metallic sandwich layers. The composition of the films was controlled by regulating the amount of elemental material introduced to the boats. Using this method, multilayer films of Sb/In have been deposited sequentially on glass or (111) oriented single crystal silicon substrates with no intentional substrate heating. After the deposition, the films were treated either in an open tube environment, an ampoule or a vacuum system. Effects of different heat treatment conditions on the physical and electrical properties of the films were studied. XRD results revealed that the films treated in vacuum had a polycrystalline structure. The films deposited on glass substrates and treated at temperatures between 490$ sp circ$C and 530$ sp circ$C had a highly oriented structure with a preferred (111) orientation. A room temperature Hall mobility of 18,000 cm$ sp2$/V-sec was found for the films treated at 520$ sp circ$C. Study of magnetoresistance effect shows the close agreement with theory by assuming that lattice scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism. Crystal grains with an average diameter of about 7 $ mu$m were obtained on 11.5 $ mu$m thick films.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shih, I.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh64r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806063q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920fx62k"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Heterojunctions on monocrystalline silicon</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Laou, Philips</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Transparent low resistivity CdS films have been evaporated on p-Si and n-p Si monocrystalline substrates to form heterojunction solar cells. Electrical and optical properties are investigated by I-V, C-V and quantum efficiency measurements. By comparing to conventional n-p Si cells, it is found that CdS/n-p Si configuration has the advantage of homojunction cells with a high V$ sb{ rm oc}$, and the advantage of heterojunction cells with a high I$ sb{ rm sc}$. The high V$ sb{ rm oc}$ is due to the electrical property domination of the homojunction of this configuration and the high I$ sb{ rm sc}$ is due to more electron-hole pairs excited by high energy photons at or near the homojunction of this configuration. Effects of interface states on heterojunctions is also studied. Frequency dispersion on capacitance is observed on CdS/p-Si cells. The dispersion is due to the lattice mismatch between CdS and Si which introduces high densities of interface state. The densities of interface state and the relaxation time constant are calculated. The cause of dispersion can be determined by doing capacitance measurements at low temperature so that trap level effect is eliminated. No significant dispersion is observed on CdS/n-p Si cells. It further confirms the electrical property domination of the homojunction of the CdS/n-p Si cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shih, I.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn106z96h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fx62k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mw13b"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Some spatial aspects of Irish economic development</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>O'Neill, Helen B.</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn106z97s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mw13b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ireland -- Economic conditions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5d86p1212"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Russian and Slavic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The substandard lexical features in Dostoevsky's post-exile literary works</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Perelmuter, Joanna</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m033r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p1212</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821-1881 -- Language</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apr76f431t"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Peasant cocoa production in Western Nigeria : an economic analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Olayemi, Joseph Kayade</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f920h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f431t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cocoa -- Western Nigeria</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agricultural industries -- Western Nigeria</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j3333134"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Oceanography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Adaptations of chaetognaths to subarctic conditions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Newbury, T.
