The goal of this project is to determine if there is a link between the presence of aggregated amyloid peptides and tau hyperphosphorylation. We incubated the human fetal primary neuron cultures with A$ beta sb{1-40}$ and A$ beta sb{1-42}$ (100nM). The western blots show that serine 202 epitope of tau protein is phosphorylated in a cyclic manner. With the tau phosphorylation assay, we showed that A$ beta sb{1-40}$ and A$ beta sb{1-42}$ activate one or more protein kinase(s) able to phosphorylate tau protein and more specifically the serine 202 epitope. We conclude that pathological concentrations of aggregated peptides A$ beta sb{1-40}$ and A$ beta sb{1-42}$ activate protein kinases which induce the phosphorylation of tau protein and serine 202 epitope.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>LeBlanc, Andrea</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042v953.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903191b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278w239"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Response of leafy reduced-stature maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids to plant population densities and planting patterns in a short-season area</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Begna, Sultan Hussein</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The yield of short-season hybrids is lower than long-season hybrids, mainly as a result of the low final leaf area developed by the short-season plants. This is due to the smaller plant stature and smaller leaf number and size of short-season adapted hybrids. In addition, in short-season areas the thermal-time available may be insufficient to mature grain of current maize hybrids. Maize hybrids which accumulate leaf area quickly, mature earlier, yield well and tolerate higher population densities better than the currently available hybrids would be more suitable for production in short-season areas. The "Leafy reduced-stature" maize hybrids, which have only recently been developed, have traits which address these criteria. There has been no previous effort to evaluate the effects of more than two plant population densities or the effects of planting patterns on the yield, yield components and vegetative growth of these hybrids. in 1995, field experiments were conducted at two sites near Montreal to compare the response of leafy reduced-stature (LRS), non-leafy normal stature (NLNS), and non-leafy reduced-stature (NLRS) maize hybrids to plant population densities and planting patterns. LRS maize hybrids showed the most rapid growth of the first ear, and the highest yield per single plant and per hectare at high plant population densities in paired rows. LRS hybrids also had longer grain filling periods, lower grain moisture contents and higher harvest indices than conventional (NLNS) hybrids. Rapid growth of the first ear and a higher harvest index are indications that LRS hybrids should be more tolerant of higher population densities than currently available hybrids. Therefore, LRS hybrids show promise for production in short-season areas at high plant population densities where maize cultivation is not currently economical due to shortness of the growing-season.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, D.

Both vegetation (species composition, cover, density, growth) and soil characteristics (pH, N, P, K, Ca, Mg) were monitored throughout the 1995 breeding season. Exclosures were installed within the colonies as control sites to prevent gull activity and these were compared to "treatment plots" or areas where gulls were present. All plants located at the study sites were native perennials with the exception of Stellaria, a native annual. Ledum groenlandicum was the only plant species significantly affected by gull activities. Both % cover and shoot growth for Ledum were greater in the exclosures than in the treatment plots over the breeding season. The gulls were also found to significantly increase pH and phosphorous levels in the soil through the deposition of faeces. Gull roosting sites were found to have higher nutrient levels than the nesting areas (treatment plots). The gulls appear to have minor effects over the short term, however the increases in soil nutrients may lead to significant changes over the long term. It is therefore imperative the exclosures remain in place to monitor for any long term changes which may occur.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Titman, Rodger</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m603q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dp39t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tundra plants -- Québec (Province) -- Mingan Islands</dc:subject><dc:subject>Herring gull -- Québec (Province) -- Mingan Islands</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bird pests -- Québec (Province) -- Mingan Islands</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tundra soils -- Québec (Province) -- Mingan Islands</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82k922d"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dynamic wedge dosimetry on a dual energy linear accelerator</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Barry, Devin P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The dynamic wedge is created by moving one of the primary beam limiting collimators in a continuous fashion to create a continuously decreasing field width while the radiation beam is on. Because of this collimator motion, different segments of the treatment field will be exposed to the primary beam for different intervals of time. This process of shrinking the field width while modulating the collimator jaw velocity and dose rate creates the desired wedge-shaped isodose gradient across the treatment field. The amount of dose that is delivered to the patient as the collimator moves across the treatment field is controlled by pre-specified computer selected look-up tables. Before a dynamic wedge option can be implemented clinically, it must be thoroughly tested by measuring pertinent beam characteristics, thereby determining the reliability of this technology. Unlike beam measurements in static field radiotherapy, dynamic beam radiatiotherapy requires the use of an integrating dosimetry technique. In this thesis data was accumulated with the use of film dosimetry and direct integration ionization chambers. Using such systems the dosimetric properties of the dynamic wedge installed on a dual energy Clinac 2300 C/D linear accelerator were investigated.

The study periods were July to early November 1995, and early May to July 1996. Five sample sites, showing ecological and hydrological contrast, were investigated. Measurements of Net Ecosystem Exchange showed peak photosynthetic capacity (GP$ sb{ max})$ ranging from 0.52 $ pm$ 0.04 mg C m$ sp{-2}$ s$ sp{-1}$ (June 1996) to 0.03 $ pm$ 0.02 mg C m$ sp{-2}$ s$ sp{-1}$ (early November 1995).

Site average methane measurements ranged from 29-72 mg m$ sp{-2}$ d$ sp{-1}$, and showed a strong relationship to water table on a seasonal basis, but a poor correlation to simultaneous NEE. Modelled Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) among sites ranged from 17.1 to 115 gC over the entire study period. The CO$ sb2$ exchanges in late spring and early fall made a large contribution to the figure due to the imbalance in the photosynthetic and dark respiration components of the carbon budget. No discernible relationship was found between seasonal NEP and methane release. The results suggest a large importance of the extreme ends of the growing season in an analysis of the carbon budget of peatlands, periods hitherto little investigated. They also suggest that NEP/methane connections may be restricted in their significance to mainly flooded mires.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Moore, T.

In 1965 the per capita consumption of butter in Canada was 8.23 Kg which decreased by about 70% to 2.66 Kg in 1994. Previous research indicates that consumers are switching from butter to margarine due to concerns about heart disease and high cholesterol levels in butter. Therefore, a market study was conducted in Montreal to estimate the potential demand for a new product called "modified" butter which would create 50% less cholesterol in the body than regular butter. When the concept of "modified" butter was introduced, out of 157 respondents about 80% of the respondents indicated that they would buy "modified" butter. Also, the total quantity of margarine demanded in a month decreased by 47% and the regular butter demand decreased by 85%. The market share of "modified" butter comes to about 67%. The average of the price that the consumers are willing to pay for a kilogram of "modified" butter is $7.50. A detailed cost analysis shows that the production cost of ``modified'' butter at the experimental level is high, but the average costs show a decreasing trend when the scale of production is increased. If the economies of scale were to continue along the derived cost curves, 7 tons of "modified" butter would have to be produced to reach the break-even point of $7.50/Kg cost of production. This shows the industrial potential of producing large quantities of ``modified'' butter by taking advantage of the economies of scale. Furthermore, the overall sales of butter (regular butter plus ``modified'' butter) would increase by about 25 % which would boost the consumption of butter in Canada.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gunjal, Kisan</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612q64j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g467t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Butter trade -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy products -- Québec (Province) -- Marketing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax346d616k"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Apatite in the Kensington and Sainte-Véronique plutons, near Mont- Laurier, Québec : an indicator of magmatic and hydrothermal processes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Andrews, Oluf E.G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Apatite is an early crystallizing phase in Proterozoic potassic alkaline and shoshonitic magmas, and is used here to model and further the understanding of the source regions, and magmatic and hydrothermal processes of 1.08 Ga potassic plutons in the southwestern Grenville Province, Mont-Laurier area, Quebec.

Various methods are used for measuring fish and meat quality, each with its particular advantages and limitations. However, methods based on monitoring the products of proteolysis have received relatively little attention. The objective of the present study was to identify specific protein and peptide products of proteolysis as indicators of freshness and quality during chilled storage of fresh fish and meat. Samples of meat and fish were subjected to chilled storage; at intervals of 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 days, samples were subjected to protein and peptide extraction, and separation of individual sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins by SDS and native electrophoresis. These extracted proteins along with acid soluble nitrogen (ASN) were separated by RP-HPLC, fractions were collected and identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). RP-HPLC separated at least thirty fractions from the ASN extract of fresh fish. ESI-MS revealed the presence of at least twenty-five polypeptides with molecular weights (MW) ranging from 2 to 32 kDa. The relative area % of the polypeptides with MW 32.8 kDa and 42.8 kDa decreased during the storage while polypeptides of MW of 10.9 kDa and 16.7 kDa increased during storage. Changes in polypeptides of MW 12, 34.2 and 42.8 kDa was also observed. The sarcoplasmic protein extracted from ground and whole meat contained at least 12 polypeptides with MW ranging from 11 to 42 kDa. The relative area % of polypeptide of MW of 35.7 kDa decreased during storage. The results suggest that changes in proteins and polypeptides of MW 10.9, 12, 16.7, 32.8, 34.2 and 42.88 kDa in fish and 35.7 kDa in meat could serve as indicators of spoilage.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alli, I.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708z84v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x336x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Proteins -- Biodegradation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Food spoilage</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fishery products -- Spoilage</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proteolytic enzymes</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7h149r664"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cytokines in rat lung in response to antigen challenge</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Al-Assaad, Ali-Samer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In humans, it has been demonstrated that Th-2 type cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5) are highly expressed in bronchial biopsies from asthmatics.

Denitrification rates ranged from less than 15 g N ha$ sp{-1}$h$ sp{-1}$ to nearly 2000 g N ha$ sp{-1}$h$ sp{-1}$. The CC method was more sensitive to treatment effects. The denitrification rates were dependent on the soil type, being higher on soils with high clay content. The variables that had the highest degree of relationship with denitrification were water filled pore space, soil NH$ sb4$-N and NO$ sb3 $,-N concentrations. Higher rates of N increased denitrification. As to assessment of available soil N, this was accomplished N and C mineralization measurements. Potentially mineralizable N(N$ sb0$) ranged from 144 mg N kg$ sp{-1}$ to 30.3 mg N kg$ sp{-1}$. Higher rates of organic amendment resulted in higher measured values on Brandon soil while higher rates of inorganic N on Chicot and Ste. Rosalie soils caused no change in mineralizable N or respired C. Total N, organic C, water soluble organic C (WSOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC) increased with increasing amounts of organic or inorganic N amendment on Brandon soil. Higher rates of inorganic N resulted in lower WSOC and MBC on Chicot and Ste. Rosalie soils. Nitrogen mineralized, C respired, total N, organic C, WSOC and MBC were all related to soil texture. MBC and WSOC were found to have a strong positive relationship with potentially mineralizable N.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mackenzie, A.

Microspheres were coated with chitosan or poly-L-lysine membrane materials. The membrane coated alginate-DNA microspheres were examined under the light microscope. The thickness of both chitosan and poly-L-lysine membranes was measured, with chitosan forming a thicker membrane. The thickness of the chitosan membranes ranged from 30 $ mu$m to 50 $ mu$m, while that of the poly-L-lysine membranes ranged from 3 $ mu$m to 13 $ mu$m. Factors affecting the thickness of poly-L-lysine membranes included: the concentration of alginate, poly-L-lysine and calcium chloride, treatment time with saline, membrane formation time and the molecular weight and pH of poly-L-lysine. The retention of DNA within poly-L-lysine coated alginate-DNA microspheres was also studied. It was found that alginate concentration, poly-L-lysine concentration and pH of the saline all affected the retention of DNA. The poly-L-lysine coated microspheres could retain 78% of the DNA initially encapsulated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Neufeld, R.

The thesis begins with a literature review of contemporary computerized medical information systems followed by an overview of the PDMS. A description of the design and implementation of the Nursing Workload Management System of the PDMS is followed by evaluation and performance results of the system. The evaluation of the performance results is encouraging and further on site testing of the NWMS is recommended.

Although the fracture resistance and locking strength of the junction do not appear to be at risk, the particulate debris generated and released into the joint space may elicit adverse biologic reactions that could eventually compromise fixation of the implant in the bone. It is hypothesized that improving the mechanical linkage between modular hip implant components connected via a Morse taper may mitigate the adverse effects of fretting. Three design parameters, surface finish, taper mismatch, and taper size, were examined in a simplified model of a Morse taper femoral head/neck connection to evaluate their effect on fretting damage at the junction under cyclic load. Microscopic and profilometric methods were used to assess fretting damage on the male tapers qualitatively and quantitatively after 2 or 5 million cycles. Fretting wear was evidenced by damage to the peaks of the machining marks on all taper surfaces. A smooth surface finish of 0.2 $ mu$m RMS on the male taper contained less volume of material in the machining marks compared with a rough surface finish of 1.6 $ mu$m RMS, and thus had the potential to generate less particulate debris. Taper mismatches of $ pm$8$ sp prime$ appeared to have no significant effect on the overall fretting wear compared to a 0 taper mismatch. Large tapers with a two-fold increase in surface area and a four-fold increase in flexural rigidity compared to small tapers significantly reduced fretting wear, presumably because of lower shear forces at the taper interfaces.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bobyn, J.

Flotation is a popular method for removing ink from fibres (deinking) and is traditionally performed in mechanical cells. Column flotation has been proposed as an alternative to mechanical cells. In this work, open and packed laboratory and pilot-scale columns were operated to determine their relative merits and how they compare to a circuit of mechanical cells. It was found that the type of sparger was critical for obtaining high flotation efficiencies. Fine porous stainless steel spargers (0.5 $ mu$m) produced flotation efficiencies which were equal to those of the mechanical cells. Packing was effective in increasing flotation efficiency when the coarse porous stainless steel sparger (100 $ mu$m) was used in the laboratory column and when the variable gap sparger was used in the pilot column. The organic loss from all column configurations (laboratory and pilot-scale) was less than 3%. The scale up procedure was evaluated using data from the laboratory column and pilot column dimensions. Finally, using data from the laboratory column, industrial columns were designed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff3657208.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290c54q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Industrial</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Environmental</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sf59v"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A VRML-based anatomical visualization tool for medical education</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Warrick, Philip A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The advent of the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) as a portable file format for describing three-dimensional (3-D) scenes has created the ability for researchers, educators and students to share anatomical models on the WWW. The implication for medical teaching is that students can interactively examine anatomical structures and their 3-D spatial relationships, using current personal computer (PC) technology. The work of this thesis creates, for the first time, a high-resolution middle-ear model that is accessible on the World Wide Web (WWW). The 3-D model is created by automated aligning of the source images (histological sections), interactive segmentation, and 3-D surface reconstruction. The resulting model is translated into VRML format. Images of the histological sections can be superimposed on the model, allowing students to view a section in its 3-D context. To enhance the viewing of these scenes, a VRML browser is modified to support transparent rendering of surfaces. Finally, a WWW interface is designed to allow users to selectively choose the model structures, section images and associated viewing parameters, in order to build their own 3-D scene.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Funnell, W.

The model displayed more mobility than predicted. The increased mobility of the model was attributed to extra rotary joints inadvertently created by the design of the mechanism. The mobility and workspace of this newly created mechanism, dubbed Tetradon, are examined qualitatively. The movement of Tetradon is described by the rigid body rotation and translation of one tetrahedron relative to another. A method to calculate Tetradon's joint coordinates based on this rotation and translation is presented. The underconstrained solution for Tetradon and the constrained solution for a modified version of Tetradon are given. With a view toward applying Tetradon as a positioning mechanism, three different ways in which to calculate the direct kinematics of Tetradon are presented. Complementing the direct kinematic solutions, a solution to the inverse kinematics of Tetradon is presented. A Newton-Gauss approximation scheme is applied to a set of constrained objective functions. The objective functions are used to maintain the intersection of the six edge pairs in the mechanism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zsombor-Murray, Paul</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g940k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m6040</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abz60cz54w"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of a regulatory strategy for odour impact assessment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tsakaloyannis, Michael K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Based on a critical review of North American odour regulations, it was concluded that current statutory nuisance laws and threshold principles do not meet the requirements of an effective regulatory strategy. An Odour Impact Model (OIM) developed previously helps to solve this deficiency by incorporating the effects of odour hedonics into odour impact assessments. This investigation fit a mathematical expression to the OIM dose-response curves of six pure odorants. A natural extension of this led to the development of the Odour Impact Dispersion Model (OIDM). This model merges the OIM's dose-response profiles with atmospheric dispersion modelling to predict and map a surrounding community's probability of response and degree of annoyance to an odorous emissions. The OIDM is applied to a case-study to investigate the impact of the facility's odorous emissions on surrounding communities. Recommendations for the development of an effective regulatory strategy for measuring and predicting the impact of odorous emissions are presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicell, J.

The implementation presented has the advantage of using an equal interpolation for all the variables. It is also very economical in terms of the amount of memory required from the computer, since a fully decoupled formulation has been adopted, along with an iterative solver which permits to store in memory only the non-zero coefficients of the linear system of equations to be solved. Specialized elements are used to avoid resolving the near-wall region of the flow. The apparent viscosity concept is derived for the finite element formulation, along with a correction factor which permits a better representation of the Reynolds stresses. The RSM is compared to the older $k - epsilon$ model in two test cases where experimental data was available. The conclusion drawn from this work is that the RSM is able to reproduce more phenomenon occurring in turbulent flows than the $k - epsilon$ model. It is thought that the $k - epsilon$ model will gradually be supplanted by more complex models, as more computing power become available.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hedberg, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wf77j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365721j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30pv60p"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Granular flow from a flat-bottomed bin with an attached standpipe</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sumner, Scott</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis describes experiments on granular flow from a flat-bottomed bin with an attached standpipe. The experiments focused on three key aspects of standpipe-flow: (i) the effect of length-to-diameter ratio (L/D) on the mass flow rate and interstitial air pressure distribution, (ii) the effect of surcharge on the flow rate, and (iii) the effects of apparatus grounding and electrostatic charges on flow characteristics. Two materials (coarse sand and fine glass beads) were tested in both the loose and dense flow regimes. In general, experimental data correlated well with previous experimental work, but not with theoretical predictions. Theoretical predictions of the pressure distributions agreed qualitatively with the experimental results in the loose flow regime, but not in the dense flow regime. Mass flow rate theories for the loose flow regime are qualitatively and quantitatively inaccurate when compared with experimental results. The effect of surcharge level on the mass flow rate was found to be insignificant. The transition between loose and dense flow regimes was studied with respect to both static electricity and standpipe air pressure. Experiments suggest that static electricity may play a key role in the flow dynamics of standpipe systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Savage, S.

By making relatively few assumptions about the data, the method can be applied at an early stage in an automated data analysis, before a tissue intensity or geometric model is available. Described as Non-parametric Non-uniform intensity Normalization (N3), the method is independent of pulse sequence and insensitive to pathological data that might otherwise violate model assumptions. To eliminate the dependence of the field estimate on anatomy, an iterative approach is employed to estimate both the multiplicative bias field and the distribution of the true tissue intensities. The performance of this method is evaluated using both real and simulated MR data. Preprocessing of MR data using N3 is shown to substantially improve the accuracy of anatomical analysis techniques such as tissue classification and cortical surface extraction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Evans, Alan C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418q14v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qp03f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602285v"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dynamic modeling of an articulated forestry machine for simulation and control</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sarkar, Soumen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recently, robotic technology has begun to play an important role in forestry operations. An important class of forestry machines is comprised of systems equipped with a mobile platform fitted with an articulated arm carrying a tree processing head. The dynamics of such systems are needed for simulation and control purposes. In contrast to conventional industrial manipulators, which are mounted on stationary bases, a mobile manipulator is dynamically coupled with its base. Base compliance, non-linearity and coupled dynamics result in positioning inaccuracies which in turn give rise to control problems. The dynamics of the FERIC forwarder forestry machine including its compliant tires were developed and implemented symbolically in compact form with the help of an iterative Newton-Euler dynamic formulation. Various models with increasing complexity were derived. Based on a simplified dynamics model, a valve-sizing methodology was developed and used to size hydraulic proportional valves of the machine's actuators. System parameters have been obtained by various methods, including use of blueprints, weighing, solid modeling and various experiments. A set-point feedforward controller was designed and the machine's responses for various inputs were obtained to analyze the dynamic behavior of the system. Although initial simulations were done in Matlab and Simulink, C programs were developed for increased speed of execution. In addition, techniques to minimize computation time have been developed and applied to result in almost real time simulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Papadopoulos, Evangelos</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278w24k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602285v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agriculture, Forestry and Wildlife</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Agricultural</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
