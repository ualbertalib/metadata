In this scheme the role of the spinal cord is secondary; the cord's capabilities for maintenance of background tone and for adaptive and homeostatic responses, when its connections with the higher centres are severed, are considered negligible. Instead, the neurones of the vasomotor centre in the brain stem are believed to be the site where convergence and integration of inputs takes place, the true final common path of the system.

A predominantly monetary economy replaced the pre-Emancipation system of exchange, in which money had not played a substantial role. The planters continued to barter their production for imports forwarded by English marchants, but after 1834 labour had to be paid for in cash and expressed its consumption demand in monetary form. This labour which was required by the planters was now subject to market supply and demand since in most islands there were alternatives to work on the plantation.
