(Hasan Haider), 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explores China's relations with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, from 1991 to 2005, contributing to the body of knowledge by arguing that China's relations with post-Soviet Central Asia were shaped by security and economic imperatives in Xinjiang, home to Muslim Turkic nationalities who have historically challenged Beijing's jurisdiction. As discussed in Chapter One, after 1949, the Communist Party sought to bring Xinjiang firmly within Beijing's orbit, ending a 150-year long period during which Beijing's hold over Xinjiang periodically faltered. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, coupled with instability in Afghanistan, led to new challenges to Beijing's authority. Chapter Two examines China's relations with Central Asia from 1992 to 1996. In the post-Cold War order characterized by US primacy, China envisioned Central Asia as an arena of cooperation between China, Russia, and the independent republics. However, the republics became fertile ground for transnational Islamist movements. China feared spillover into Xinjiang; consequently, China extended economic cooperation to the impoverished republics with the understanding that they would suppress emigre Uighur organizations. Bilateral economic cooperation was also important for Xinjiang, which benefited from cross-border trade. Chapter Three examines Sino-Central Asian relations from 1996 to 2001, exploring the development of the Shanghai Five mechanism in 1996 between China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, which initially addressed confidence building, but after 1998, focused on regional security. This was important for China, since in 1996/1997, Xinjiang experienced instability that was exacerbated by the independence of Central Asia. Competition over the region's energy is also examined, which contributed to international rivalry. Chapter Four examines Sino-Central Asian relations from 2001 to 2005. In June 2001, the Shanghai Accord signatories, and Uzbekistan, established the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). While envisioned as a forum for wide-ranging cooperation, combating "terrorism, separatism, and extremism," was an immediate priority. Following the attacks on September 11, 2001, the United States sought a military presence in Central Asia that temporarily undermined China's influence, heightening China's concerns over energy security. China's response was to gradually deepen relations with the republics in the energy and security fields.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278z57j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dr34v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>China -- Relations -- Asia, Central</dc:subject><dc:subject>China -- Relations -- Kyrgyzstan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kazakhstan -- Relations -- China</dc:subject><dc:subject>China -- Relations -- Kazakhstan</dc:subject><dc:subject>China -- Foreign relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tajikistan -- Relations -- China</dc:subject><dc:subject>China -- Relations -- Tajikistan</dc:subject><dc:subject>China -- Relations -- Russia (Federation)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kyrgyzstan -- Relations -- China</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462957k"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Political economy and ethic of care : toward a unified theory of utilization of assisted reproductive technologies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kayaalp, Emre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Any ethical argument involving the problems of access to assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) should entail the discussion of the decision protocol and consider the individual deliberating on the appropriateness of these remedies from the point of view of self and community. Yet, arguments based on patients' own moral calculations are rare in the bioethics literature. The moral voice behind most discourses concerning ARTs is that of an outwardly independent spectator, who nonetheless proceeds to justify a personally significant worldview in the utilization of these resources. Investigators grounded in social and legal sciences have offered relevant arguments in this regard, but because their discourses are derived from research protocols specific to their respective disciplines, they fail to provide a general rationale applicable to moral deliberation. Fortunately, it is possible to bring two seemingly incongruous discourses, one from ethics and the other from economics, under the rubric of a more general model of utilization of ARTs. Specifically, the basic principles of a certain economic perspective, political economy, appear largely reconcilable with those of a particular ethical perspective, ethic of care. This ethical perspective is based on the premise that healthcare givers, simultaneously cognizant of the larger decisional environment as well as the contingencies specific to the immediate client-agent interaction, are sympathetic and responsive to their patients' unique needs. This moral precept finds a direct reflection in a contemporary strand of political economy represented by Richard Posner, Amitai Etzioni, Harold Hochman, and Amartya Sen. The objective of this work is to blend the political economic perspective with that of an ethic of care by means of a patient-oriented model of demand for ARTS. The political economic paradigm of subjective valuation, substantially enhanced with the key elements provided by ethic of care, will offer an operational framework within which the preferences of seekers of ARTS can be analyzed in more satisfactory terms. The integration of the two perspectives requires the surmounting of a series of methodological hurdles, but the effort will be worthwhile. For, the model of choice will be conducive to an equilibrium that is not only efficient, but also equitable.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bk19d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462957k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722hf06q"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Quantitative longitudial analysis of spatially heterogeneous brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kezele, Irina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The importance of axonal loss and tissue atrophy in multiple sclerosis (MS) has become progressively more appreciated. Axonal injury and loss have been recognized both by pathology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It has been shown that tissue injury in MS, including axonal loss, starts at the onset of the disease, even in the absence of any clinical signs. Many lines of evidence link axonal loss and atrophy to chronic disability, and some researchers consider brain atrophy the best correlate of clinical progression. Although axonal loss has been observed both in lesions and in normal appearing brain tissue (NABT), the mechanisms of axonal loss and atrophy have not been yet fully understood. Two main hypotheses are: (1) the primary pathology is related to lesions and the changes in NABT are secondary; or (2) MS is a diffuse, primary degenerative disorder. To address these, a method to detect, quantify, and characterize local brain atrophy in patients with MS has been developed. The method is applied to longitudinal series of brain MRIs that were spatially normalized by means of both linear and elastic non-linear image registration. Non-linear deformation fields were analyzed to evaluate local volume change, per voxel, in overall NABT. Novel distance metrics have been introduced to relate spatially local volume change to white matter (WM) lesions. Regional atrophy in WM fiber tracts were analyzed and related to corresponding regional and global lesion loads. A number of image processing algorithms employed in this thesis was improved, adapted or combined in such a way to comply with specific requirements of applications to MS. The studies performed within this thesis demonstrated that there was a component to atrophy that was related to WM lesions, and possibly resulted secondary to tissue injuries inside lesions, but that it did not explain atrophy in the whole. Evidence of a component to atrophy, not directly linked to WM lesions, was also offered. Together, the results suggest that the whole brain is affected globally, and that atrophy can additionally propagate from WM lesions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d570172z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hf06q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g9120"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of Gas6-Axl in vascular biology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hasanbasic, Ines</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Gas6, the product of a growth arrest specific gene, is a member of the vitamin K-dependent family of gamma-carboxylated proteins and the ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptor Axl. Gas6-Axl interactions are important in many biological functions such as cell survival, mitogensis and regulation of thrombosis. We show that gas6 plays an important role in endothelial cell survival and that its post-translational modification (gamma-carboxylation) is necessary for its biologic activity. Using flow cytometry, we first demonstrate that gas6 can prevent apoptosis induced by serum starvation of primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). This effect is mediated through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) and Akt pathway, known anti-apoptosic regulators. In addition, in the presence of the PI3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, gas6 is unable to induce Akt phosphorylation during serum-stress resulting in endothelial cell apoptosis. Similarly, dominant negative Akt constructs prevent gas6-induced endothelial cell survival, underscoring the importance of Akt activation in gas6-mediated survival. Several downstream regulators of this survival pathway were also identified in HUVECs, namely, NF-kappaB as well as the antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and caspase 3, respectively. Luciferase assay experiments indicate that gas6 induces a rapid increase in NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. We also show that NF-kappaB is phosphorylated early after gas6 treatment as evidenced by Western Blot analysis. As well, the level of Bcl-2 protein increased, supporting the notion that the Bcl-2 antiapoptotic pathway is stimulated, and levels of caspase 3 activation, a know proapoptotic regulator, are significantly reduced with gas6 treatment. These initial results indicate that gas6-Axl interactions are an important mediator of endothelial cell survival during serum stress through activation of classical antiapoptotic pathway, namely, Akt phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, increased Bcl-2 protein expression, and a reduction in caspase 3 activation. A most intriguing feature of gas6 as a mediator of cell survival is its unusual posttranslational modification, gamma-carboxylation. Thus, understanding the role of Gla domain of gas6 in gas6-Axl interaction is of fundamental importance since gamma-carboxylation may influence the anti-apoptotic property of gas6-Axl interaction. Here for the first time we show that Gla domain of gas6 is indispensable for its anti-apoptotic function. Initially, we show that carboxylated gas6 binds to phosphatidylserine-containing phospholipid membranes in an analogous manner to other gamma-carboxylated proteins whereas decarboxylated gas6 does not. Further, the gamma-carboxylation inhibitor, warfarin, abrogates gas6-mediated protection of NIH3T3 fibroblasts from serum starvation-induced apoptosis. A similar effect is observed on endothelium where only carboxylated but not decarboxylated gas6 protects endothelial cells from serum starvation-induced apoptosis. In addition, we also demonstrate that proper gamma-carboxylation of gas6 affects activation of its downstream targets, Axl and Akt. These results thus clearly indicate that this post-translational modification imparts a significant role in function of gas6. Therefore, we propose that gas6 plays important role in endothelial cell survival and that its post-translational modification, gamma-carboxylation, is crucial for this function.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763c063.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g9120</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z5091"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Signaling and biological roles of the angiopoietinstie-2 receptor pathways</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Harfouche, Rania</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Angiopoietin (Ang)-1, -2 and -4 are ligands for the endothelial cell (EC)-selective Tie-2 receptors. Ang-1, and to a lesser degree Ang-4, promote EC survival, migration and angiogenesis, whereas Ang-2 was initially described as a Tie-2 antagonist but might also exert context-dependent roles. Angiopoietin expression was recently shown to be upregulated in breast cancer. Breast cancer progression to the more aggressive phenotype is characterized by the loss of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and the upregulation of angiogenic cytokines. The underlying mechanisms by which angiopoietins modulate EC apoptosis and their regulation during breast cancer progression remain unknown and were investigated. Ang-1 simultaneously activated antiapoptotic (P13K/AKT and ERK1/2) and proapoptotic (p38 MAPKs and SAPK/JNK) pathways in serum deprived ECs. Ang-1-mediated ERK1/2 activation was partly mediated downstream of the PI3K pathway, whereas both the PI3K and ERK1/2 pathways attenuated p38 MAPKs activation. The net effect of Ang-1 was to inhibit EC apoptosis through the preferential activation of the antiapoptotic pathways. Ang-1 also induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) second messengers derived from a NADPH oxidase complex in ECs. These ROS inhibited Ang-1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation while promoting activation of the promigratory kinase PAK1. Ang-2 also inhibited serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in ECs through the selective activation of the P13K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathways over the p38 MAPKs pathways. However, Ang-2 treatment did not evoque significant SAPK/JNK and PAK1 activation like Ang-1. In breast cancer cell lines and mice xenografts, Ang-1 levels were inversely correlated with that of ERalpha but positively correlated with the expressions of the angiogenic markers, VEGF and CD31. Ang-1, Ang-2 and Ang-4 levels were also inhibited by estrogen in ERalpha-expressing cells. We conclude that Ang-1 and Ang-2 promote EC survival through the preferential activation of antiapoptotic (PI-3 kinase/AKT, ERK1/2) over proapoptotic (p38 MAPK, SAPK/JNK for Ang-1) pathways. However, only Ang-1 promoted EC migration through PAK1 activation downstream of ROS second messenger, indicating that ROS act as molecular switches to shift EC responses from survival to migration. During breast cancer progression, Ang-1 levels increased in the more aggressive ERalpha negative cancers, whereas in ERalpha positive cancers, Ang-1, Ang-2 and Ang-4 levels were inhibited by estrogen.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558j298.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z5091</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257j894"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Perceived interpersonal climate and interpersonal complementarity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Foley, J. Elizabeth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Few studies of interpersonal complementarity have examined individual differences that might moderate the relation between one person's behaviour and the other's response. The present research investigated the degree to which global perceptions of others (perceived interpersonal climates) moderated the relation between event-level perceptions of the other and behavioural response in social interactions. The influence of interpersonal perceptions on social behaviour was examined in two field studies; the first study was conducted with university undergraduates, and the second study was conducted with a community sample of working adults. Event-contingent recording procedures were used to collect information about participants' communal (agreeable---quarrelsome) and agentic (dominant---submissive) behaviours and perceptions of partner communion and partner agency. Based on hypotheses derived from interpersonal complementarity, it was expected that perceptions of communion would predict communal behaviour according to the principle of correspondence (agreeableness evokes agreeableness and hostility evokes hostility) and perceptions of agency would predict agentic behaviour according to the principle of reciprocity (dominance invites submissiveness and submissiveness invites dominance). As predicted, perceived interpersonal climates moderated the relation between perception of the other and behaviour in specific interactions. Perceived communion in an event predicted correspondence with regard to communal behaviour; this response was stronger for individuals who generally perceived others as cold-quarrelsome rather than warm-agreeable. Perceived agency in an event predicted reciprocity such that individuals responded to perceptions of dominance with more submissive behaviour and perceptions of submissiveness with more dominant behaviour; this response was stronger for individuals who generally perceived others as submissive, and this response was weak to non-existent for individuals who generally perceived others as dominant. The moderating effects of perceived interpersonal climates were independent of five-factor and interpersonal traits; global perceptions of others provided unique interpersonal information not captured by the five-factor model of personality. Both studies support the basic principles of complementarity while indicating that complementarity does not apply equally to all people. The present research shows that interpersonal perceptions are not only useful for studying behaviour within an event, but that global perceptions of others (perceived interpersonal climates) influence our reactions to the social environment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qx007.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257j894</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Interpersonal relations</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2227mv158"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Distinct roles of histone deacetylases 3 and 4 in regulating the transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Grégoire, Serge</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors plays important roles during muscle differentiation as well as in different programs of non-muscle cells. Covalent modification has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating MEF2 function. The goal of my thesis project was to identify novel post-translational modifications that modulate MEF2 transcriptional activity and to determine whether histone deacetylases coordinate these modifications. I first demonstrated that MEF2D is modified by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO. Sumoylation of MEF2D at a single residue, lysine 439, inhibits the myogenic activity of this transcription factor. Fascinatingly, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) potentiates the sumoylation of MEF2D. In addition, HDAC4 stimulates this modification by promoting phosphorylation of serine 444 of MEF2D. In support of this, phosphorylation of serine 444 is required for sumoylation at lysine 439. Thus, I have identified a phospho-sumoylation switch that turns on and off MEF2-dependent transcription. Moreover, I found that MEF2D is subject to lysine acetylation catalyzed by the acetyltransferases PCAF and p300. Unexpectedly, HDAC3, but not HDAC4 and homologs, reverses this modification. Moreover, HDAC3 reverses autoacetylation of p300 and PCAF. Altogether, these results indicate that HDAC3 and HDAC4 are important regulators with distinct role in controlling MEF2 modifications, and further suggest that multiple HDACs cooperate to achieve efficient control of MEF2-dependent transcription and that disruption of MEF2-HDAC interaction may lead to pathological conditions like cardiac hypertrophy, coronary artery disease and lymphoblastic leukemia.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687n45d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mv158</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adz010v16j"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A novel microencapsulation system : preparation and characterization of genipin cross-linked alginate-chitosan microcapsules for live cell oral delivery and other applications</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chen, Hongmei, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Oral therapy utilizing artificial cell microencapsulation has shown promise in the treatment of many diseases. The key requirements of microcapsules for such applications include biocompatibility, mechanical stability, permeability and resistance to the human gastrointestinal (GI) environment. In particular, preservation of structural integrity is crucial when live genetically engineered cells are used. One of the main obstacles in the progress of this strategy is attaining biocompatible and stable microcapsules. This thesis aims to develop a suitable microcapsule system, the genipin crosslinked alginate-chitosan (GCAC) microcapsule, for live cell oral delivery. The preparation procedure, including calcium-alginate ionotropic gelation, coacervative chitosan coating and covalent cross-linking by genipin, was established and optimized. Control factors affecting the formation of microcapsule membrane were identified. The structural and physical characteristics of GCAC microcapsules, such as mechanical stability, swelling characteristics, permeability, controlled release, degradation, and others were investigated and compared with earlier established microcapsule systems including alginate-chitosan and alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate (APA). In addition, live cell oral delivery features were evaluated with a computer controlled dynamic simulated human GI model using genetically engineered Lactobacillus plantarum 80 cells as an example. Results show that by incorporating genipin, a new class of GCAC microcapsule system can be formulated. Results also show that covalent cross-linking by genipin considerably enhanced the microcapsule stability and durability while maintaining permeability similar to that of the APA membrane. The GCAC membrane possessed strong resistance to structural degradation and GI impediments, while providing a favorable microenvironment for cell proliferation and survival in harsh GI conditions. In addition, this research found that the fluorogenic attributes of genipin can be exploited to characterize the microcapsule membrane by confocal laser scanning microscopy. A simple, in situ, and non-destructive approach was established and extended to assess other microcapsule systems. Rapid determination of coating material distribution, binding intensity, and membrane thickness on a routine basis was achieved using this novel and superior method. This work highlights the immense potential of the novel genipin cross-linked alginate-chitosan microcapsule as an oral delivery vehicle for live therapeutic cells and other important applications. Further studies will investigate its full potential for artificial cell oral therapy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rn41h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010v16j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qh40c"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Novel mechanisms for he involvement of hypercapnia in retinal blood flow and neovascularization : implications for retinopathy of prematurity and beyond</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Checchin, Daniella Marie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hypercapnia, elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), is an established vasodilator, is present during ischemic episodes, and is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity, a disease of the retinal vasculature. Retinopathy of prematurity is an ischemic retinopathy, which like other ischemic pathologies, regresses with the reparation of existing blood vessels and the formation of new ones. However, the potential role of CO2 in this process has been relatively overlooked, particularly in comparison to the numerous studies examining hypoxia in ischemia. Therefore, the central aim of this work was to elucidate how hypercapnia affects the retinal vasculature, impacting blood flow and neovascularization. Retinal blood flow (RBF) studies in hypercapnia-exposed piglets, and rodent models of CO2-induced retinopathy, demonstrate that hypercapnia leads to initial increases in prostaglandin (PG) E2, which mediates an early elevation in RBF, and subsequently augments the endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression and activity responsible for a later rise in RBF. Ex vivo retinal organ bath experiments and in vitro studies on retinal endothelial cells (ECs) confirmed these findings and revealed that PGE2 increases via EC calcium entry triggered by hypercapnia's accompanying acidosis. While the elevation in RBF creates an oxidative stress, which is detrimental in and of itself, the NO exacerbates this by generating a nitrative stress, resulting in diminished neovascularization. The mechanisms implicated in this include: (1) an altered EC/astrocyte interaction vital to vascularization; (2) the downregulation of the angiogenic PGE 2 receptor EP3; and (3) the direct loss of ECs and microglia, the latter of which we unveil for the first time to have a role in blood vessel development. Collectively the data suggests that CO2, despite typically being considered rather innocuous, can be detrimental in certain circumstances. In the neonatal retina hypercapnia inappropriately augments RBF via a sequence of events, culminating in a free radical-mediated stress that impairs key players required for proper neovascularization. These findings impart several novel avenues for future research as not only do they improve our understanding of developmental, pathological, and therapeutic retinal neovascularization, but they convey a seminal perspective of CO2 creating a framework within which to examine hypercapnia in other tissues.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cq033.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qh40c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Ophthalmology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tr13v"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Critical deflagration waves that lead to the onset of detonation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chao, Jenny C., 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The conditions that are required for DDT are studied in the present thesis by focusing on the final phase of the onset of detonation. A series of experiments were carried out where high speed turbulent deflagrations were generated downstream of a perforated plate by reflecting a CJ detonation upstream from the plate. Four different detonation tubes were used to investigate scaling effects. Four different fuels (acetylene, hydrogen, propane, and ethylene) were used with either pure oxygen or air as an oxidizer to investigate the effect of mixture sensitivity on the onset of detonation. In some cases, fuel-oxygen mixtures were diluted with either nitrogen or argon. Perforated plates with various hole diameters and hole spacings were used in order to control the turbulence parameters in the reacting downstream flow. A theoretical study was also carried out to determine the various flow fields as well as the ignition processes via turbulent mixing. It is found that a high speed turbulent deflagration traveling at about the CJ deflagration speed of the mixture (around 800 to 1200 m/s, depending on the given mixture) is required for the onset of detonation in a smooth tube. This critical ve locity is found to be rather insensitive to boundary conditions, which supports the conclusion that critical deflagrations are driven by the expansion of the combustion products (similar to a CJ detonation) and are dependent on the energetics of the mixture rather than on transport rates. The ignition mechanism in a critical deflagration differs from that of a CJ detonation and is effected by the turbulent mixing of combustion products with the unburned mixture. Therefore, intense turbulence is required in the reaction zone. Since the initial plate generated turbulence decays, the sustained propagation of a critical deflagration wave in a smooth tube relies on "flame generated turbulence" where the high temperature sensitivity of the mixture can mantain the turbulence in the reaction zone. It is also found that the critical deflagration is comprised of a leading shock wave followed closely by an extended turbulent reaction zone rather than the conventional shock wave followed by a distinct thin flame. Once a critical deflagration wave is established, the onset of detonation requires the generation of transverse waves that couple to the reactions and are sustained by the chemical energy release as in a cellular detonation. The onset of detonation can be effected by the amplification (via the Rayleigh criterion) of repeatedly reflected transverse waves resonating with the reaction zone in a confined tube. It can also occur via the formation of a local explosion centre where an overdriven detonation bubble and the accompanying retonation wave is formed in the turbulent reaction zone.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54ks261.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tr13v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r2752"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Microstructure of vibration welded joints of polyamide-6</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chung, Young Mi, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a detailed study of the effects of processing parameters on the microstructure of vibration-welded joints, which ultimately determines the weld strength. The material used is unreinforced polyamide-6 and polyamide-6 reinforced with 30% glass fibers. Conventionally, thicker HAZ (heat affected zone) and random fiber reorientation in HAZ were believed to be key factors to achieve higher weld strength. The study of microstructure, including morphology, crystal phase transition and molecular orientation showed that crystal morphology of HAZ consists of two distinct layers: a recrystallized layer and a deformed layer. The above microstructural aspects are strongly influenced by processing parameters and HAZ characteristics. Various aspects of microstructure and characteristics of HAZ and their responses to processing conditions may be explained by a proposed model that predicts the thermo-mechanical history experienced by the polymer during the process. For example, the model predicts the distributions of temperature, shear stress, and pressure, and the viscosity at the solid-melt interface during the vibration motion. A polishing and etching technique was developed to obtain 3-D fiber orientation in HAZ. High pressure at low amplitude enhances fiber reorientation along the squeeze flow direction. However, overall, different processing conditions do not significantly reorient fibers. In fact, fiber reinforcement weakens the joints. Measurements and analysis of mechanical properties, with reference to experimental data regarding crystallinity and morphology, showed that the weld strength is determined not by HAZ thickness or fiber random reorientation but by the crystallinity of the recrystallized layer. High welding pressure causes low quality welds by giving significantly low crystallinity in the recrystallized layer.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763c07c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r2752</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440x88x"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular mechanisms of Vitamin A-induced limb defects in the mid-organogenesis-stage mouse limb bud</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ali-Khan, Sarah Esme</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this thesis was to move toward defining the molecular mechanism(s) of Vitamin A-induced limb malformations. Vitamin A and its biologically active metabolites, the retinoids, are potent limb teratogens, inducing reductive defects, preceded by decreased chondrogenesis and upregulated apoptosis. To target the origins of these effects, we focused initially on characterizing the pathway of Vitamin A-induced apoptosis. Our first objective was to identify mediators of the degradation and commitment phases of this process. We show dose-dependent activation of the effector caspase, caspase-3, and increased mitochondrial cytochrome-c release after treatment. The next objective was to determine whether these changes were receptor-mediated. Both pan-RAR (BMS 189453) and, surprisingly, pan-RXR (HX603) antagonists were able to ameliorate Vitamin A-induced limb malformations and apoptosis, indicating both receptor subtypes are important mediators of these processes. Interestingly, exposure to either antagonist alone also upregulated apoptosis. Each compound induced a specific, reproducible pattern of limb bud apoptosis, reiterating the fact that proper regulation of this process is crucial for normal limb morphology. Our final objective was to identify genes that may be responsible for the apoptosis and other pathologies observed after retinoid exposure. Vitamin A treatment significantly upregulated 81 genes, including key limb development signaling molecules, oncogenes, extracellular matrix/cell adhesion molecules, and transcriptional regulators such as Id3, Snai1, Hes1 and Eya2. To link these expression changes to teratogenic outcome, the response of these 4 genes was assessed after Vitamin A exposure, and after limb bud rescue with BMS 189453 and HX603; expression levels were correlated with limb malformations. Pathway analysis of the significantly upregulated genes reveals that many that are associated with cell-cycle, apoptosis and chondrogenesis are functionally linked. Moreover, members of these cascades cross-talk with one another, indicating that retinoids affect multiple cellular processes in a coordinated fashion to induce their teratogenic effects. Collectively, these studies have advanced our understanding of Vitamin A-mediated apoptotic pathways. In addition, we have proposed several mechanisms for retinoid-induced limb malformations, identified novel retinoid targets, and revealed multiple avenues for future research.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2774069s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440x88x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57nv92x"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanism of metastable Al-AlmFe phase and fir-tree zone formation in DC-cast Al-Fe-Si alloy ingots</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Aliravci, A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In DC-cast 1xxx-series aluminum alloy ingots, the presence of Fe and Si, and cooling rates increasing from &lt; 1°C/s in the ingot center to ~20°C/s near the surface cause the formation of metastable intermetallic Al6 Fe and AlmFe compounds in addition to the stable Al 3Fe. The highly contrasting etching/anodizing response of the Al 6Fe and AlmFe particles forming in the adjoining central and peripheral regions, respectively, creates the fir-tree zone (FTZ) defect in DC-cast ingots. This, in turn, causes streaking in Al sheets. The need was great for a good fundamental understanding of the mechanism of metastable Al-A1mFe eutectic phase formation. Therefore, the mechanism was studied via the kinetic (experimental: Bridgman growth and DSC analyses), thermodynamic (macroscopic: phase diagram computation), and crystallographic (atomistic) approaches. The controlled growth of Al-Al3Fe, and metastable Al-Al xFe, Al-Al6Fe, and Al-AlmFe eutectic phases was obtained in AA1050 and its binary analogue Al-0.33wt% Fe alloys via Bridgman growth at various growth velocities (V = 0.15 -60 mm/s). For each phase, by acquiring a series of growth-velocity-dependent invariant (for binary alloys) and univariant ( for AA1050) melting temperatures (T) via DSC, the binary and ternary melting and growth kinetics were determined as T vs ln(V) plots extrapolated to V = 0.001 mm/s. Using the binary melting kinetics and tentative growth kinetics plots, the Gibbs free energy parameters of binary phases in the AA12S database were optimized, and the previously non-existent binary and ternary stable and metastable equilibrium phase diagrams (computed at V = 0.001 mm/s) and stable and metastable kinetic and dynamic phase diagrams (computed at the DC-casting velocity; V = 1 mm/s) were obtained via ThermoCalc(TM).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gj145.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57nv92x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085q255"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Aging effects in 319-type alloys</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Andrade González, Neivi Rocío</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present work was performed on primary A319.2 alloy to investigate the effect of magnesium and strontium additions on the heat treatment behaviour and mechanical properties of the alloy. Samples were cast in permanent mould, then cut in order to obtain coupons which were solution heat treated at 495°C for 4 and 24 hours, followed by quenching in hot water. Two different artificial aging temperatures were applied at 180°C and 220°C for times from 0.5 h up to 24 hours. The investigation consisted of a systematic measurement of macrohardness and matrix microhardness of samples under different heat treatment conditions. Tensile properties were also measured and electron microscopy study of critical samples was done. It is seen that the alloy does not exhibit the common peak-overaged aging conditions due to the presence of several coexisting phases. It was found that multiple aging peaks are present in the age-hardening curves of Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloys. From the scanning electron microscopy studies, it is seen that addition of magnesium (~0.40 wt%) leads to the precipitation of coarse A1 5Mg8Si6Cu2 particles. Strontium modification of the high magnesium alloys leads to segregation of Cu-intermetallics in areas away from the growing Al-Si eutectic regions. It was found that strontium modification retards the precipitation of the silicon out of the matrix. The effect of aging time and temperature on the structure of the age-hardening precipitates was studied with TEM. TEM observations reveal that the age-hardening behavior is related to the precipitation sequence of the alloy. For the Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloy, the first aging peak is the result from the high-density GP zones, while the subsequent are from metastable phases. The transition from GP zones to metastable phases may be the main reason for the formation of multiple aging peaks.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nq52f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085q255</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j529r"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the common-link theory</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Alhomoudi, Fahad A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Common-Link Theory, invented by Joseph Schacht and widely accepted in modern scholarship, argues that ḥadith authorities knowingly and purposefully placed traditions in circulation with little care to support these ḥadiths with satisfactory isnads. G. H. A. Juynboll, Michael Cook and other Schachtians subsequently embraced and elaborated upon this theory. This dissertation challenges the accuracy of Schacht's founding theory. The first chapter traces back and elucidates the formation of Schacht's Common-Link Theory, demonstrating how it is related to his other theories. The second chapter examines the responses to Schacht's theory, arguing that its proponents do no more than either expand upon it, or apply it to other fields of Islamic studies. The third chapter employs a critical technique in examining the evidence cited by Schacht and Juynboll, which not only shows the theory's deficiency, but also confirms its flawed nature by the very evidence they use. Two other critical approaches are demonstrated in the fourth chapter. The first rests on an analysis of relevant terms and rules employed by muḥaddiths, thereby offering a workable alternative to Schacht's faulty hypothesis. The second demonstrates the flaws of Schacht's methodology through a synthesis of multiple critiques developed here as well as by other scholars. The last chapter elucidates how Schacht's other theories would collapse as a result of the faultiness of the Common-Link Theory. Because of the interconnectedness of Schacht's many theses about ḥadith and Islamic law, the findings of this dissertation will not only challenge the significant Common-Link Theory in legal ḥadith studies, but will, perforce, also open the door for scholars to question other important theories held by Schacht and his followers with regard to larger issues in Islamic legal history.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214t411.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j529r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Schacht, Joseph, 1902-1969</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islamic law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f546z"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Business as usual? : Turkish industrialists, the state and democratization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yavuz, Devrim Adam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is a debate on the exact relationship between capitalist development and democracy. Some maintain that there is a theoretical and empirical affinity between the two, while others have demonstrated that authoritarian regimes have been as able to accommodate capitalist development. A major part of this debate revolves around the economic elite's political preferences, which in some cases is perceived as championing democracy while in others, especially in cases of late-development, as supporting the rise of authoritarianism or, in the least, benefiting from the deficiencies of limited democracy. The shifting position of this elite therefore begs the following question: Is there an instance under capitalist development that makes democracy more appealing to the business classes? To study this question, I have focused on the case of TUSIAD (Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association), a voluntary association made up of several hundred members and founded by the owners of the largest Turkish corporations, that has in 1997 published a report on democratization in Turkey which promoted major changes to the Turkish state and its institutions. The topic is of relevance to the above debate by presenting a case where individuals that were previously perceived as benefiting from the deficiencies of Turkish democracy and/or were too shy politically were promoting major changes to political life. In order to understand the process behind this break and the shifting political attitude of the association's members, I have conducted several expert interviews with key actors from TUSIAD and the business community. I have also included a comparison between the case of TUSIAD and the demands of associations in the similar cases of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico in order to further test the generalizability of my case study. My research and the dissertation suggest that changes in the activities of Turkish industry, characterized by economic development and a greater international integration achieved primarily through the European Union, present a new structure of opportunities and constraints for TUSIAD members. The factors that entrepreneurs perceive as being necessary for staying competitive and manage growingly complex enterprises not only make increased democracy more appealing but also create a tension between a segment of business, which is becoming increasingly formal, and a state that has traditionally depended on its informal ties with societies to strengthen its control. However, my research reveals that these economic changes are not sufficient to constitute a radical break from the state. To understand the case of TUSIAD it should be taken into account that this has been possible because of the economic elite's increasing autonomy (due partly on endogenous changes and the opportunities that internationalization offers) and relationship to the state. Turkish political tradition has enabled the state and governments to isolate themselves from business more than in other cases studied. In fact, states in my comparative cases have tended to grant greater access to business, except for various periods, and as such affected its propensity to mobilize politically. It is therefore the apparent indifference of the Turkish state towards the needs and power of industry that has affected the attitude and ideology of businesspeople, thus leading to a greater break than what the current literature would predict. In outlining this process, the current dissertation therefore contributes to academic debate by outlining the manner in which a positive relationship between the needs of business classes and democracy develops, while maintaining that whether this will lead to a radical break is determined by state tradition.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sf82z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f546z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Democracy -- Turkey</dc:subject><dc:subject>Turkey -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Businessmen -- Turkey</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36v272p"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Epigenetic programming by maternal behaviour</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Weaver, Ian Cassford Gordon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Individual differences in gene expression and behaviour are the result of an interaction between a given set of genes and a variety of environmental conditions. The study of epigenetics focuses on the nature of this interaction. The early developmental period in the life of a mammal is exquisitely sensitive to environmental cues. One critical question is how is the genome capable of adapting to these developmental or environmental signals? Building on an established rodent model, in which the effects of maternal care have been demonstrated to regulate the development and expression of neurobiological and behavioural measures in offspring as adults, the current project concerns how events during the first week of life can have sustained effects on gene expression, which persist throughout the life of the organism. The research presented in this thesis demonstrates how one facet of mothering style leads to a cascade of molecular and cellular changes, resulting in life-long alterations in the nature of stress responses and neuron survival. Frequent licking/grooming by rat mothers alters DNA methylation of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene and acetylation of histones early in life, providing a mechanism for these permanent changes in stress responses. Through postnatal cross-fostering studies, I was able to directly study how an identical gene within the same rat strain is expressed and regulated under the different developmental environments and how such effects on gene expression persist through life. I have also examined the potential for reversibility of the long-term consequences of postnatal environment and have demonstrated that both GR levels and the nature of stress responses exhibit a high degree of plasticity in adulthood in response to both pharmacological intervention and dietary amino-acid supplementation. These results demonstrate that the epigenomic marks established early in life through a behavioural mode of programming, are dynamically maintained and potentially reversible in the adult brain. These results contrast with the very dogmatic view that the genome is rendered fixed and immutable. I next questioned the global effects of early-in-life experience on the hippocampal transcriptome and anxiety-mediated behaviours in adulthood. Microarray analysis revealed &gt; 900 different maternal care-responsive mRNA transcripts. These results suggest that effects of early life experience have a stable and broad effect on the hippocampal transcriptome, which may play a role in the development of anxiety-mediated behaviours through life. Finally, both in vivo and in vitro studies show that maternal behaviour increases GR expression in the offspring via increased hippocampal serotonergic tone accompanied by increased histone acetylase transferase activity, histone acetylation and DNA demethylation mediated by the transcription factor NGFI-A. In summary, this research demonstrates that an epigenetic state of a gene can be established through early-in-life experience, and is potentially reversible in adulthood. We predict that epigenetic modifications of targeted regulatory sequences in response to variations in environmental conditions might serve as a major source of variation in biological and behavioural phenotypes. In the case of GR, the resulting individual differences in behavioural and physiological responses to stress are thought to be a major risk factor for the development of psychiatric and physical illness. Thus, in addition to contributing to our understanding of how gene-environment interactions shape development, our work provides a mechanism that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention to potentially reduce the prevalence of these disorders.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s4469.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v272p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n5376"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dangerous connections : maternal ambivalence in psychotherapy between women</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wexler, Sharon A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This two-year qualitative clinical study investigates the intea-psychic (within a person) and inter-relational (between people) effect of maternal ambivalence in female psychotherapy relationships. The participants are five, low-income single mothers, and I am the therapist researcher. Ambivalence describes the co-existence of loving and hating feelings. In traditional psychoanalytic theory, ambivalence originates in the developing infant's relationship to the mother and forms the basis of all adult relationships. A mother's experience of ambivalence is viewed as a regressive return to an earlier emotional experience with her mother. Maternal ambivalence is a feminist psychoanalytic concept developed by Parker (1995, 1997). Parker expands the Freudian and post-Freudian object relations concept of ambivalence using the perspective of the adult mother. In Parker's conceptualization of maternal ambivalence, a mother experiences feelings of ambivalence towards her infant and child that are not simply regressive, but are part of her normal adult development as a mother. Each mother's experiences and expressions of maternal ambivalence are affected by her social and cultural context of mothering. Each woman is consciously and unconsciously affected by her psychosocial constructions of maternal ambivalence and brings her beliefs and experiences into the clinical relationship. Through highlighting the narratives and interpreting the transference and counter-transference material, this study shows the impact of maternal ambivalence on the therapeutic alliance of women working with women in clinical social work. The therapeutic alliance refers to the quality of the relational bond between the therapist and client. This population of mothers was selected because they represent a significant group of clients seen in various clinical social work Dangerous Connections settings, such as youth protection, non-profit counseling agencies, and community centers. In this manuscript-based thesis, I present two of my participants' cases as an indepth exploration of my research process, its analysis, and the applicable theories I used. This research process indicates that in seeking to develop a more culturally and gender sensitive clinical practice and therapeutic connections, social workers may benefit from reflectively challenging their internalized psychosocial idealizations and denigrations of motherhood.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mk49h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n5376</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ambivalence</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mother and child -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Therapist and patient</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motherhood -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278z58t"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterizing the role of inter alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 2 and Slit2Robo1 in malignant brain tumor invasion</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Werbowetski, Tamra</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and medulloblastoma are among the most devastating of cancers and their extensive infiltration into normal brain tissue leads to recurrence and poor patient prognosis. This thesis focuses on negative regulators of malignant brain tumor invasion in three-dimensional collagen gel matrices. We observed a chemorepellent effect in co-cultures of glioma spheroids where C6 and U251 glioblastoma cells are repelled by a secreted chemotropic molecule produced by the adjacent spheroid. In addition, the inhibitory effect of glioma conditioned medium on implanted C6 and U251 spheroids suggests that a chemorepellent effect may be accompanied by an inhibitory kinetic effect on individual cells. We used this model of conditioned medium inhibition as a functional assay to isolate and identify natural inhibitors of glioma invasion using protein purification. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed inter alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 2 (ITI H2) as the most abundant protein in our purified fractions and validation studies confirmed its role as a strong inhibitor of glioma cell invasion and proliferation and a promoter of cell-cell adhesion. Lower levels of ITI H2 in high-grade primary human CNS tumors suggest that ITI H2 may play a role in brain tumor progression. In the final chapter, we demonstrated a role for the guidance cue, SIit2, in medulloblastoma invasion. Similar to ITI H2, Slit2 had an inhibitory effect on the velocity of individual cells; however, there was no concomitant effect on proliferation or adhesion. In contrast to ITI H2, Slit2 did not affect glioma cell invasion in three-dimensions, and RT PCR analysis did not reveal a correlation with malignancy. This study introduced sodium alginate bead "bioreactor" encapsulation as a method to exogenously supply Slit2 or other negative guidance cues. Mixed beads containing cells overexpressing Slit2 and dominant negative RoboN demonstrated that this method can be used to attenuate the continuous inhibition of Slit2, and may potentially be utilized to introduce molecules targeting multiple biological processes including invasion, proliferation, and apoptosis. Therefore, Slit2 and ITI H2 may play potential therapeutic roles in the treatment of malignant brain tumor invasion, and require further functional characterization.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289p195.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278z58t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axk81jq81c"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Electron-phonon interactions in molecular electronic devices</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sergueev, Nikolai</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Over the past several decades, semiconductor electronic devices have been miniaturized following the remarkable "Moores law". If this trend is to continue, devices will reach physical size limit in the not too distance future. There is therefore an urgent need to understand the physics of electronic devices at nano-meter scale, and to predict how such nanoelectronics will work. In nanoelectronics theory, one of the most important and difficult problems concerns electron-phonon interactions under nonequilibrium transport conditions. Calculating phonon spectrum, electron-phonon interaction, and their effects to charge transport for nanoelectronic devices including all atomic microscopic details, is a very difficult and unsolved problem. It is the purpose of this thesis to develop a theoretical formalism and associated numerical tools for solving this problem. In our formalism, we calculate electronic Hamiltonian via density functional theory (DFT) within the nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) which takes care of nonequilibrium transport conditions and open device boundaries for the devices. From the total energy of the device scattering region, we derive the dynamic matrix in analytical form within DFT-NEGF and it gives the vibrational spectrum of the relevant atoms. The vibrational spectrum together with the vibrational eigenvector gives the electron-phonon coupling strength at nonequilibrium for various scattering states. A self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) allows one to determine the phonon self-energy, the electron Green's function, the electronic density matrix and the electronic Hamiltonian, all self-consistently within equal footing. The main technical development of this work is the DFT-NEGF-SCBA formalism and its associated codes. A number of important physics issues are studied in this work. We start with a detailed analysis of transport properties of C60 molecular tunnel junction. We find that charge transport is mediated by resonances due to an alignment of the Fermi level of the electrodes and the lowest unoccupied C60 molecular orbital. We then make a first step toward the problem of analyzing phonon modes of the C60 by examining the rotational and the center-of-mass motions by calculating the total energy. We obtain the characteristic frequencies of the libration and the center-of-mass modes, the latter is quantitatively consistent with recent experimental measurements. Next, we developed a DFT-NEGF theory for the general purpose of calculating any vibrational modes in molecular tunnel junctions. We derive an analytical expression for dynamic matrix within the framework of DFT-NEGF. Diagonalizing the dynamic matrix we obtain the vibrational (phonon) spectrum of the device. Using this technique we calculate the vibrational spectrum of benzenedithiolate molecule in a tunnel junction and we investigate electron-phonon coupling under an applied bias voltage during current flow. We find that the electron-phonon coupling strength for this molecular device changes drastically as the bias voltage increases, due to dominant contributions from the center-of-mass vibrational modes of the molecule. Finally, we have investigated the reverse problem, namely the effect of molecular vibrations on the tunneling current. For this purpose we developed the DFT-NEGF-SCBA formalism, and an example is given illustrating the power of this formalism.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44ps051.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jq81c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3n204327b"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Critical Buddhism : a Buddhist hermeneutics of practice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shields, James Mark</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study critically analyzes Critical Buddhism (hihan bukkyo ; hereafter: CB) as a philosophical and a religious movement; it investigates the specific basis of CB, particularly the philosophical categories of critica and topica, vis-a-vis contemporary theories of knowledge and ethics, in order to re-situate CB within modern Japanese and Buddhist thought as well as in relation to current trends in contemporary Western thought.

After a brief analysis of violence, warfare and social discrimination within Buddhism and specifically Japanese traditions, some important background to the context in which Critical Buddhism arose is recalled. In addition, the development of so-called Imperial Way Zen (kodozen )---which represents in many respects the culmination of the 'false' Buddhism the Critical Buddhists attack---is examined. The following chapter on the roots of topica analyses a number of the larger epistemological and ethical issues raised by CB, in an attempt to reinterpret both 'criticalism' and 'topicalism' with reference to four key motifs in Zen tradition: experience (jikishi-ninshin: "directly pointing to the human mind [in order to realize the Buddha-nature]" [B.]); tradition (kyoge-betsuden: "an independent transmission apart from written scriptures" [M. 6, 28]); language (furyu-moji or furyu-monji: "not relying on words and letters" [M. 6]); and enlightenment (kensho jobutsu: "awakening to one's original Nature [and thus becoming a Buddha]" [Dan. 29]). Here and in Chapter 4, on "New Buddhisms: Problems in Modern Zen Thought," the CB argument against the many sources of topical thinking is outlined, paying particular attention to question of 'pure experience' (junsui keiken) developed by Nishida Kitaro and the Kyoto School. Chapter 5 on "Criticism as Anamnesis: Dempo/Dampo" develops the positive side of the CB case, i.e., a truly 'critical' Buddhism, with respect to the place of historical consciousness and the weight of tradition. Chapter 6, "Radical Contingency and Compassion," develops the theme of radical contingency, based on the core Buddhist doctrine of pratitya-samutpada (Jp. engi) as the basis for an effective Critical Buddhist epistemological and ethical strategy. The conclusion elaborates a paradigm for comparative scholarship that integrates the insights of Western philosophical hermeneutics, pragmatism, CB, and so-called 'Buddhist theology'. The implications of the Critical Buddhist project on the traditional understanding of the relation between scholarship and religion are examined, and also the reconnection of religious consciousness to social conscience, which CB believes to be the genius of Buddhism and which makes of CB both an unfinished project and an ongoing challenge.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r0750373.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n204327b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Buddhism -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Buddhism and state -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Buddhism -- Doctrines</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qp058"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cooperation among adversaries : managing transboundary water disputes in conflict settings</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shungur, Shantarene</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Intrigued by the observation that enduring, task-based water treaties have, surprisingly, emerged within protracted conflict settings that lock the riparians in a deadly embrace, I constructed an interdisciplinary theoretical framework to explain the causes of riparian conflict, and the conditions for riparian conflict resolution. Drawing on the literature from international relations, comparative politics, resource economics and public choice theory, I explain how the constraints posed by ecological forces in a conflict setting, and the political opportunities presented by a particular economic-developmental context shape the decisions of policymakers during the negotiation process that precedes regime emergence. Next, a model is developed that first illustrates the causal pathways among five independent variables, (water scarcity mode, critical environmental threshold, riparian position, state power profile and sustainable development of water resources); three contextual variables, (conflict setting, economic-developmental level, economic-developmental crisis) and the dependent variable of riparian conflict. The pathway is then extended with the addition of two more contextual variables (negotiation structure and strategy) to explain the second dependent variable of regime emergence. Eight hypotheses are then theoretically derived and tested with specifics from four cases covering both developing and developed state riparian conflicts within protracted and non-protracted settings. The Middle East, South Asian, and North American regions are thus studied. It was evident that the degree of water scarcity has either conflict enhancing or conflict mitigating properties depending upon the patterns of interaction among the variables. Both contextual variable clusters had theoretically significant effects on the nature of the regime. I inferred that the state formation dynamic influenced the economic-developmental context in which water policy is formulated and shaped the domestic configuration of water interests. It appears that the influence of rent-seeking groups opposed to a transboundary water treaty wax and wane once critical environmental thresholds, which aggravate or cause an economic-developmental crisis, are exceeded (especially in the most powerful state). This, along with other economic, international and geographic factors, ultimately, alters the preferences of the policymakers to enable compromise at the international level. A state's institutional capacity to adopt a more sustainable water usage pattern is also relevant in this regard.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p891z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qp058</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Water resources development -- Political aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water-supply -- International cooperation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water-supply -- Political aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az316q574j"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A machine learning framework for the classification and refinement of hand drawn curves</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Simhon, Shlomo Saul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a machine learning framework for the automatic classification and refinement of curves. The proposed framework is composed of both a representation and a family of algorithms for making inferences from examples, given suitable guidance from a user. The underlying computational paradigm taken consists of applying Hidden Markov Models to a wavelet representation of the curves of interest, each of which is presented as part of a pair of examples. The learning framework is exemplified by developing a gesture-based interface for two distinct applications: robot path planning and sketch beautification. For each, it is demonstrated that we can learn constraints on curves from a set of examples and apply them to augment rudimentary gesture information from a human operator. Further, it is demonstrated that we can identify what class of curves the human input belongs to, allowing us to automate the curve refinement process for unclassified inputs. Finally, in cases where gesture information is given in the form of an image, it is also shown that the same methodology can be used to detect and extract the most likely parametric curve from the image. There are three key issues that are addressed for the classification and refinement of curves. First, we must establish the way in which the input, training and output curves look like one another. In the framework presented, this likeness is expressed statistically using Hidden Markov Models that extend over multiple curve attributes (such as curve thickness or color) and scales. Second, when attempting to infer a curve, we must also determine the way in which the surrounding curves should affect the inference. Using a hierarchy of Hidden Markov Models, we can impose and exploit probabilistic interactions between multiple curves that make up an entire scene. Finally, in addition to the learned constraints, we must also determine a method for combining user-defined constraints with the Hidden Markov Models. It is shown that we can reformulate the Hidden Markov Models using a regularization framework and allow for the seamless integration of ad hoc biases to the learned models.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c474q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q574j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50tw69q"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Experimental optimization of process parameters to obtain class A surface finish in resin transfer molding process</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Raja, Moshan Haider</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Resin transfer molding (RTM) has great potential to become an efficient and economical process for fabricating large and complicated automotive composite structures. Low capital investment, excellent mechanical properties, closed mold processing, low pressure equipment, short cycle times and process versatility in component integration and assembly, make RTM very attractive for high volume automotive applications. However, a high class surface finish, required for exterior car body panels, is difficult to achieve with RTM. There are several material and process parameters that severely affect the surface quality of RTM molded components. One of the major contributing factors is the shrinkage related to the curing of thermoset resins. A volumetric shrinkage of 7-10% is common for polyester resins, which breaks the material's contact with the tool, resulting in poor surface finish. Low profile additives (LPA) are added to the polyester resin for shrinkage compensation; however the effects of LPA content on thermal, rheological and morphological properties of polyester resins, as well as surface finish aspects of resulting composites, are not well understood. In this research, the influence of material and processing parameters on the surface finish is characterized through experimental design techniques. Analytical, experimental and numerical methods are employed to optimize processing conditions for class A finish quality and shorter cycle times. Specifically, the effects of LPA content on cure kinetics, cure shrinkage and morphological changes are investigated through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), rheological and optical microscopic techniques. Models are developed to predict cure shrinkage, LPA expansion, cure kinetics and viscosity variations of the resin. These models are then incorporated in commercial software to predict resin flow, degree-of-cure evolution and pressure variations during cure. Analytical and numerical simulation results are then validated with the experimental data. Processing windows defined for different process parameters based on analytical and numerical analyses are further used in the test matrices designed through the Taguchi method. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple regression analyses are carried out on the surface roughness of test samples molded under varying conditions. The relative influence of the most significant parameters is characterized and empirical models are developed to predict surface roughness. The effect of post-cure shrinkage on the surface roughness of the test samples is also investigated. Levels of the most significant process parameters are then set for a high class surface finish, minimum cost and short cycle times. The results show that the LPA content had no significant effect on the cure kinetics; however cure shrinkage decreased non-linearly with increasing LPA content. LPA content at 10% was found to be the minimum amount for shrinkage compensation. LPA content (≥10%) resulted in pressure increase and morphological changes during RTM manufacturing. A cure gradient was observed for low pressure injections which had a significant effect on the resin pressure and roughness. LPA was found to be the most influential parameter affecting surface finish. A minimum of 10% LPA was required for class A surface finish. Higher injection pressures and filler content improved surface quality, whereas styrene content, cure rate and temperature gradient had no effect on the surface roughness in the range tested. A direct relationship was observed between LPA content, final cure shrinkage, resin pressure and surface finish.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h386n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tw69q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1v53k2290"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Schizophrenia in Turkey : a meaning-centered study of psychosis, culture and subjectivity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rahimi, Sadeq</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation develops a meaning oriented model of the relationship between culture and the subjective experience of psychosis, by analyzing interviews and other ethnographic data collected over the course of a 12 month fieldwork in Istanbul, Turkey. The theoretic framework for the study is introduced on the basis of detailed discussions of the notion of schizophrenia, the questions of Turkey and Turkish identity, and the basic theories of semiotics. Derived from the theoretic framework, four principles are then proposed as fundamental features of the relationship between culture, meaning systems, subjectivity and psychosis, as follows. (1) the inseparability of the notions of subject, culture, and meaning system.(2) the simultaneous synchronicity and diachnoricity of sign systems. (3) the heteroglossic nature of private associative networks and narratives. (4) the conglomerate composition of subjective autobiographical narratives. Based on these principles, an analytic approach is then developed and applied towards in-depth cultural semiotic analyses of data collected from interviews with three psychotic inpatients, their families and their clinicians. The results of the analyses demonstrate strong evidence for an interrelational model of culture, meaning, subjectivity and psychosis, as well as a fundamental presence of diachronic modality in patterns of association and networks of meaning in patients' discursive efforts to re-establish psychic wholeness and self-identity. Based on these findings and in reference to the earlier theoretical principles, the results are formalized to conclude three principal modes of 'continuity': (1) the mutual continuity of private experience and collective meaning, which reflects the importance of understanding private psychological and subjective phenomena as contextualizated processes always embedded within collective systems of meaning and power, such as culture and politics. (2) the continuity of psychotic and non-psychotic modes of subjectivity, which further highlights the embeddedness of psychotic models of experience and behavior in local systems of meaning and power. (3) the continuity of systems in time, which highlights the temporal dimension of private and collective modes of experience, and thus emphasizes the significance of considering not only private life histories, but also local historical and political trajectories in clinical and intellectual assessment of subjective and psychological experiences such as psychosis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75rd140.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k2290</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
