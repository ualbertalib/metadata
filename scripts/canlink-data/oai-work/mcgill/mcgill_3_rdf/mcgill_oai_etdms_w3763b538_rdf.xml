M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>For many years casein was believed to be a homogenous protein. However, early work with fractional precipitation methods showed that casein was not a single protein, and later, electrophoretic studies proved conclusively that casein is composed or at least three tractions. The tractions were designated as alpha-, beta- and gamma-casein. The physical properties and the composition or the three tractions have been investigated in some detail, but there has been much controversy as to the presence or carbohydrate in casein.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baker, B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r686t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763b538</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
