In this approach a hollow gas column is puffed in the z-pinch diode by magnetically ionizing and compressing an inert gas in an annular plenum. This gas column is preionized by the radiation coming out from the plasma in the plenum and pinched by a fast electrical discharge. It is shown that the system can be improved considerably by modifying the gas puff design. Three gas puffs developed in this work are optimized for x-ray emission from argon, krypton, and neon gases. In the optimized conditions the output x-ray energies of 0.5 J from Ar-K shell, 2 J from Kr-L shell, and more than 2 J from Ne-K shell are obtained. The implosion dynamics is studied with different gases under varying conditions. The average implosion velocity, the final pinch diameter, the current waveform, and the emitted x-ray energy are measured. The pinched plasma parameters such as temperature, density, and the average ionic state are estimated using the corona model calculations, and the pinched current waveforms. The spectrum of the neon radiation clearly shows the characteristic H-like and He-like lines. The neon spectrum is used to estimate the plasma temperature. The dynamic performance of the magnetically induced compression gas puff is studied carefully. A special ion probe was developed for studying the dynamic parameters of the gas puff. The ion measurements with the probe have led to the characterization of the gas puff performance under varying operating conditions. It is shown that ions are generated through photoionization of the injected gas by the UV light emitted from the inside of the gas puff plenum through the nozzle. It is found that the jet velocity and ion density can be in excess of $3 times10 sp3$ m/s and $2 times10 sp{14}$ cm$ sp{-3}$, respectively. A theoretical model is developed to simulate the plasma evolution in the gas puff. This model uses the magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) equations solved by the finite difference method. The magnetic field in the vacuum is calculated using the Laplace equation and self consistent boundary conditions. The model predicts the evolution of plasma variables such as density, temperature, velocity, and magnetic field. It also calculates the variation of the total mass flow rate, optical output, and the ionic signal. The simulation results are shown to compare favourably with the experimental measurements.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r270c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75df14b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Electricity and Magnetism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zj368"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Vibrational and NMR spectroscopic studies of some inorganic and organic crystalline solids</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Huang, Yining</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The vibrational spectra of $( eta sp5$-C$ sb5$H$ sb5$)Re(CO)$ sb3, ( eta sp5$-C$ sb5$Me$ sb5$)Re(CO)$ sb3, ( eta sp6$-C$ sb6$H$ sb6$)Cr(CO)$ sb2$(CS), Cr(CO)$ sb5$(CS), Re(CO)$ sb5$Cl, CH$ sb3$Re(CO)$ sb5$ and CH$ sb3$Mn(CO)$ sb5$ have been recorded under high pressures ($&lt;$ 50kbar).

(Lois Sianoi)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examined the Kenyan Diversified Secondary School Curriculum (KDSSC) which was implemented in 1985. Data were collected from twelve provincial secondary schools selected from urban, semi-urban and rural regions. Questionnaires were administered to Form three students, teachers and staff of the Kenya Institute of Education (KIE). Additional data were collected through interviews with the deputy Director of Education in charge of the implementation of 8-4-4, deputy Director of KIE and relevant official documents. The findings indicate that KDSSC addresses the needs of national development and is influenced by human capital theory and the philosophy of African Socialism. KDSSC is characterized by an academic orientation and the process of implementation is affected by conceptual and operational difficulties. Consequently, a state of distress is evident in schools. Ultimately, the study concludes that the rationale for KDSSC reflects the prevailing will of policy-makers to ensure that desirable national development takes place in Kenya. However, KDSSC as currently structured is a limited strategy for meeting the needs of national development. The study has implications for national development strategies, curriculum planning, teaching, and theory on educational innovations. Recommendations are made which may help shape future directions of KDSSC and national development strategies. Finally, areas for further research are proposed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p6292.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p195v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education, Secondary -- Kenya -- Curricula</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405sb919"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Renewable Resources</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae and base cation fertilization in sugar maple (Acer saccharum marsh L.)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cooke, Margaret Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Under field conditions, vesicles were the most frequently observed mycorrhizal structures in sugar maple, while greenhouse grown seedlings formed more arbuscules. Seasonal fluctuations of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae existed. Mycorrhizal associations formed within 30 days in the greenhouse. Arbuscules were usually formed from hyphal coils and occasionally from linear hyphae spreading from cell to cell. Degenerating arbuscules were not observed. The addition of basic cations increased the number of vesicles formed and decreased the overall infection rates and seedling growth. The uptake of calcium, magnesium, and nitrogen decreased, and potassium uptake increased as fertilization rates increased. Positive correlations existed between the incidence of arbuscules and plant growth and health and between the incidence of arbuscules and the uptake of calcium, magnesium, nitrogen and phosphorus, and with the uptake ratios and these elements with potassium. This suggests that vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae may in some way be regulating ionic balance in these seedlings.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zc78k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sb919</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sugar maple -- Fertilizers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35tb01p"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Remaking labour, reshaping identity : cotton, commoditization and the culture of modernity in northwestern Zimbabwe</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Worby, Eric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Until the 1960s, the Gokwe region of northwestern Zimbabwe was perceived as the wild, remote, and culturally backward domain of the "Shangwe" tribe. Since the introduction of small-holder cotton production in the 1960s, and the influx of immigrants from the south, it has been represented as a miracle of agrarian transformation, a frontier of commoditization, and more broadly, as an exemplar of the transition to modernity. In this thesis, I explore how alternative narratives of commoditization inform modes of state intervention, representations of ethnic difference, and forms of agrarian labour in Gokwe. Using my own ethnographic journey through Gokwe as a referent, I examine the different ways in which colonial maps, indigenous myths, and ritual exchanges variously locate relations of power, labour and identity in social space. Labour forms and commodity relations are continually remade as farmers, traders, ethnographers and administrators argue over the signs of modernity and its antitheses.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th08t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tb01p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cotton growing -- Zimbabwe</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zimbabwe -- Rural conditions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hr332"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Four-dimensional string theories via Nonabelian twists</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Zhishun</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The construction of four-dimensional string models via nonabelian twist is discussed in an operator formalism.

We present a systematic procedure for the identification of the final gauge group, whose rank is generically reduced in a nonabelian twist.

The organization of the body representation in primary somatosensory cortex was then studied at different intervals with neurophysiological mapping techniques and compared to the organization seen in normal cats. The objective was to determine whether responsiveness was recovered in the cortical area which had lost both cutaneous and deep inputs, and, if recovered, to characterize the time course and spatial extent of this recovery. Normal cats were found to have a topographically organized representation of the body in primary somatosensory cortex. As determined by cortical mapping procedures, approximately 60% of this representation is responsive to deep and cutaneous inputs from the forearm and forepaw. Immediately, following the nerve transections, most if not all of the representation from these nerves were unresponsive to any kind of natural somatic stimuli. With time, cortical responsiveness was recovered and representation of inputs adjacent to the denervated area only partially expanded into the former forelimb representation. The time course of changes in the somatotopy, modality and various response characteristics differed among cytoarchitectonic areas. Major reorganizational changes occurred within area 3b while area 3a remained relatively unresponsive for a period of at least two months. These findings suggest that cortical representations of denervated territories can become, over time, activated by substitute inputs. However, cortical reorganization may occur only over a limited extent of the body representation within the primary somatosensory area. The results presented here are discussed in the context of several different hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of cortical reorganization following peripheral injury.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440v17j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fz33b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25xb12z"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The diversification of a pastoral society : education and employment among the Maasai of Narok District, Kenya</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Holland, Killian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research investigates the determinants and effects of two key indicators of diversification, schooling and employment, on Maasai community.

At this average capelin egg density, laboratory results suggest that, on a daily basis, only gut capacity and clearance time limit amphipod predation on eggs.

Multiple protein-DNA regulatory complexes span the D108 left-end intergenic region during different stages of phage development. A diverging and asymmetric pattern of transcription is initiated from the opposing Pc and Pe promoters in this region. During lysogeny, the phage genome remains quiescent through the action of c repressor, expressed from the Pc promoter. DNase I footprinting revealed that oligomers of c repressor bind two operators (O1 and O2), one of which (O2) overlaps the early promoter (Pe) such that bound c repressor prevented RNA polymerase binding and transcription of the early operon. During lytic growth, transcription of the early (transposase) operon is controlled by the phage encoded ner repressor in conjunction with the host protein IHF. The purified Ner protein, an 8.6 kDa monomer, bound a large region that overlaps the transcription initiation sites for both the repressor (Pc) and early (Pe) promoters. This operator spans five turns of the DNA helix and is composed of two 11 bp inverted repeats separated by an 8 bp AT-rich spacer. Enzymatic and chemical footprinting studies, in addition to protein cross-linking experiments, indicated that the structural features of Ner-DNA binding represent a novel form of such interactions. The apex of the intrinsically bent ner-operator was localized to the AT-rich spacer. This operator was conformationally altered upon Ner binding. In the absence of IHF, bound Ner prevented RNA polymerase from binding to either Pc or Pe. However, in the presence of IHF, which binds and bends the DNA upstream of Pe, RNA polymerase associated with Pe irrespective of the Ner-DNA complex. The IHF-induced DNA structural change may partially relieve Ner repression of the early promoter, thus ensuring stable transposase gene expression during lytic phage development.

C. (Guo-Chiang)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The putative neurotransmitters L-glutamate and L-aspartate can exert their excitatory action by activating the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the physiological role of these excitatory amino-acid receptors in neocortical slices of normal rats and epileptic patients. My experiments in the rat neocortex indicate that excitatory synaptic transmission in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) is primarily mediated by non-NMDA receptors, whereas the NMDA receptor is only activated when synaptic inhibition mediated by gamma-aminobutyric-acid-A receptors is reduced or blocked. Under such conditions, I found that the NMDA receptor participates in neuronal synchronization through polysynaptic circuits and contributes to the depolarization underlying the epileptiform discharge. In the epileptogenic human neocortex, I discovered that both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors are responsible for excitatory synaptic transmission in normal ACSF. Furthermore, their activation can lead to the appearance of epileptiform discharges. Together, the findings reported in this thesis suggest that the function of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors might be enhanced in the epileptogenic human neocortex, and lend further support to the hypothesis that excitatory amino acids are involved in epileptogenesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bd33f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591998z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj139363v"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regenerative synaptogenesis of retinal ganglion cell axons in non-retinal targets of the adult hamster</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zwimpfer, Thomas Joseph</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>After optic nerve transection in the adult hamster (Carter et al., 1989) and rat (Vidal-Sanz et al., 1987), axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can regrow long distances through peripheral nerve (PN) grafts and form connections in the superior colliculus, a normal target of RGC axons. This thesis further investigated synaptogenesis in the injured mammalian CNS: regenerating RGC axons of adult hamsters were guided through PN grafts into two novel targets, the cerebellum (Cb) and the inferior colliculus (IC). When examined 2 to 9 months later, RGC axons were found to have extended into the grey matter of both targets for distances of up to 650 $ mu$m. Growth into white matter was rare and limited to 50 $ mu$m. RGC axons formed terminals and synapses in both targets. Within the Cb, there was a marked preference for growth and synapse formation in the granule cell layer (GCL) which could not be explained by: the position of the PN graft in the Cb, a selective denervation of the GCL, local damage to other neurons, or the distribution of reactive gliosis. These anatomical studies indicate that regenerating CNS axons can form connections with novel targets in the adult hamster. The preferential synaptogenesis in the GCL of the Cb suggests that such connections are not formed randomly.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945s53w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139363v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612q24k"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Radiation transport in scale invariant optical media</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Davis, Anthony</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We focus primarily on the bulk response to external illumination of conservatively scattering thick inhomogeneous media (or simply "clouds") which are exactly or statistically scale invariant; these radiative properties are compared to those of homogeneous media with the same shapes and masses.

In all cases, the nonlinearity of the radiation/density field coupling induces systematic and specific variability effects.

To explore the regulatory mechanism, the effects of various steroids and peptides on the production of P4 by placental explants were studied. In early placental explant culture P4 production was stimulated by 19-nortestosterone (19-NT), androstenedione (A-dione), 5$ alpha$-androstane-3$ alpha,$17$ beta$ diol (3$ alpha$-diol) and 5$ alpha$-androstane-3$ beta,$17$ beta$ diol (3$ beta$-diol). Of all the compounds tested, 19-NT had maximal effect. At term, P4 production was stimulated only by 3$ beta$-diol. 19-NT and A-dione were poorly aromatized in early placental explants compared to another androgen (Androst-5-ene-3$ beta,$17$ beta$ diol). In accord with the above observations, placental levels of 19-NT and A-dione were higher in early gestation while the diols were higher in late gestation. 19-NT stimulated P4 production in early placenta by effects on the conversion of P4 both from 25-hydroxycholesterol and from pregnenolone. The stimulatory influences of A-dione and 3$ alpha$-diol were mediated by increasing the P450scc activity. The specific increase of the conversion of P4 from pregnenolone accounted for the P4 stimulation observed by 3$ beta$- diol treatment of culture. Cyloheximide (CH) treatment abolished the stimulatory influences of the aforementioned steroids on P4 production except for the initial phase of P4 stimulation by 19-NT, suggesting that all but the latter are dependent on protein synthesis. P4 production was also stimulated and prolonged to 30 days in the presence of human maternal serum (HMS); a good correlation (r = 0.74, P $&lt;$ 0.05) was seen between the histological appearance of the explants and P4 production. The stimulatory activity of HMS was heat labile, non-dialyzable and non-extractable into an organic solvent, suggesting that it is protein in nature. In conclusion, this study suggests that 19-NT and A-dione are important for placental P4 production at the time of the luteo-placental shift. For in vitro study of placental hormonal regulation, HMS is a better nutrient supplement than fetal bovine serum.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jn100.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801ph97d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gv24w"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulatory influences of microenvironmental factors on osseous cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bernier, Suzanne M.

Using representative cell lines, modulation of osteoblastic and chondrocytic phenotypic markers such as hormone-responsiveness, enzymatic activities, and matrix production by osteotropic factors was examined in vitro. In UMR 106 cells, a rat osteoblast-derived osteosarcoma cell line, a differential distribution of EGF and PTH receptors over proliferating and quiescent cells, respectively, was observed. EGF treatment resulted in expansion of a less differentiated population characterized by decreased PTH- and CT-stimulated adenylate cyclase and binding capacity, and increased CGRP-responsiveness. Using immunocytolysis, a mixed osseous cell population (OBCK6) was derived from fetal rat calvarial cells. Subsequent dilution cloning yielded two cell lines, the CFK1 line with osteoblastic characteristics and the CFK2 line with chondrocytic properties. Although only the OBCK6 cells deposited a mineralized matrix in vitro, organic matrix components were produced by the other two lines. EGF stimulated proliferation in both CFK1 and CFK2 cells. Retinoic acid decreased cell proliferation, PTH-responsiveness, and alkaline phosphatase activity, caused cell shape change and population reorganization, and increased EGF receptors in CFK1 cells. Induction of cartilage specific matrix components (type II collagen, proteoglycan core protein, link protein, and thrombospondin) was observed in CFK2 cells maintained in culture without passaging and could be regulated by EGF, PTH, dexamethasone, and retinoic acid. Thus, peptidergic and steroidal factors have been employed to modulate functional activity and cell cycle kinetics, and have resulted in the characterization of discrete stages of differentiation of osteoblastic and chondrocytic populations in vitro.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b5919997.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gv24w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b7772"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Nursing</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Parental relationships, coping strategies, received support, and well-being in adolescents of separateddivorced and married parents</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Grossman, Mary, 1950-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to explore the relationships in the perceived quality of the parental relationship, coping strategies, received support, and well-being in adolescents from separated/divorced and married parents. Two hundred and forty-four matched adolescents from separated/divorced and married households were drawn from an initial sample of 1044 students who were tested at five colleges and three high schools of a large metropolitan and rural area. Regression analyses supported the hypothesis that a perceived poor parental relationship, and not family status, was associated with low life satisfaction and sense of future, and high anxiety in adolescents of divorced and intact households. Path analytic techniques revealed that coping strategies and received support did not mediate the association between a perceived poor parental relationship and low levels of well-being in adolescents from divorced and intact households. However, in both groups, problem-focused coping mediated by nondirect support was associated with more life satisfaction and sense of future, and less anxiety than the direct effects of problem-focused coping alone. In addition, emotion-focused coping mediated by direct guidance was associated with higher levels of well-being than the direct effects of emotion-focused coping alone. In contrast, problem-focused coping in conjunction with direct guidance was associated with the lowest levels of adolescent well-being. The findings contribute to the field of adolescent stress and coping by suggesting that coping strategies may influence the type of support received by adolescents. The study extends current research findings by considering the combined effects of coping and received support in relation to measures of well-being. Finally the study contributes to the field of nursing by demonstrating that personal and social mediators may enhance the health oriented aspects of well-being.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848s16h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b7772</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Individual and Family Studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n277j"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La représentation de la lecture chez Jacques Poulin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Navarro Pardinas, Blanca</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the model(s) of reading proposed by J.

Through an empirical study of 382 firms using internal and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems, different characteristics of this model are examined via four hypotheses. First, using linear structural modelling techniques, it is shown that successful information systems share certain properties common to all systems, in addition to certain properties specific to each class of systems. Four generic factors influencing IS success are identified as (i) output reliability, (ii) system's characteristics, (iii) efficiency outcomes, and (iv) users' requirements. Second, the role of time in the IS adoption and assessment process is explored. By comparing firms that have adopted EDI with those that have not adopted EDI, it is shown that the decision maker's perception of IS success changes during different stages of the adoption and assessment process. Third, the role of stakeholders in the assessment process is examined by comparing perceptions of different managerial groups based on their educational background, management echelon, and functional area. It is shown that different stakeholders evaluate the success of IS differently. Finally, through an examination of various types of evaluation functions, it is shown that IS success is a multi-dimensional construct. Overall, cross-group comparisons of the dynamic hierarchical structural model of IS success provide sufficient evidence regarding the instability of IS success across time, type of system, and stakeholders involved in the evaluation process. In addition to the major hypotheses, two corollaries have also been examined. It is shown that user involvement in an IS project has a positive effect on the system's success. Further, the results of the study indicate that respondents in smaller companies are more satisfied with the support and services of the MIS department than their counterparts in larger companies. Finally, by comparing three versions of the questionnaire used in the study, it is shown that question order has a significant effect on responses. The implications of this finding for survey studies are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107078z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr171z81h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electronic data interchange</dc:subject><dc:subject>Management information systems</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electronic data interchange -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687j98t"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Drainage investigation of depressional areas in the St. Lawrence lowlands</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sylvestre, Gilbert J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Four ponded depressional areas were selected in a cultivated field near Ste-Agnes de Dundee, Quebec. In 1988, land, soil, water and crop parameters were measured under ponding and non-ponding conditions in order to formalate a drainage investigation procedure for ponded depressions. A sweet corn yield reduction of 39% was measured in depressions compared to ridges; this yield reduction occurred with 3 to 5 year interval of recurrence rainfalls. Loss of yield in depressional areas gave an overall reduction of 5% for the whole field. There was an additional loss in quality from poor uniformity of the corn cobs. The Ste-Agnes corn yield was estimated at 20% of the regional average. There was no significant difference between soil characteristics in depressions and ridges except for hydraulic characteristics such as infiltration and percolation rates as determined with the infiltrometer, and hydraulic conductivity as determined with the auger hole method. The ponding runoff coefficients (mean PRC = 0.11) measured during the summer of 1988 were similar to the ones (mean PRC = 0.13) calculated using the CN curve method (USDA, SCS). The low percolation rate of the subplow layer was found to be the main constraint to the subsurface drainage of the ponded depressions. Soil survey and ponding study results were used to formulate a drainage investigation procedure for ponded depressional areas in the St. Lawrence Lowlands.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sb92k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687j98t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corn -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drainage -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z2504"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of schooling on the nutritional knowledge, attitudes and practices of Ethiopian school children and mothers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Girma, Beshah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of schooling on nutritional knowledge, attitudes and nutritional outcomes in Ethiopia was investigated.

Mothers and students were administered tests measuring nutritional knowledge and attitudes. The nutritional status of children age 6-31 months was evaluated by measurement of the weight and height. Schooling, particularly upper secondary schooling, was found significantly influence nutritional knowledge and nutritional outcomes. A causal model is presented which suggests that modern nutritional knowledge, together with the educational level of the mother, is immensely important in influencing nutritional practices.

A method to correct for the effects of pressure flow superposed on the shear deformation was developed. The problems associated with sample renewal and temperature control in the shearing zone were explored with the help of simulations.

The ILR was used as viscosity sensor to control ionomer neutralisation by reactive extrusion. Proportional-integral and minimum variance control algorithms were successfully implemented.

However, it is a well known fact that molten steel temperature, especially during the continuous casting operation, can have a profound effect on the quality of the product. A knowledge of the instantaneous steel temperature in the tundish can serve as a valuable tool in the quest for better quality. With the implementation of statistical process control techniques such occurrences as breakouts, tundish freeze up or the nucleation of an extensive area of columnar grains in the cast section can be reduced. However, conventional thermocouples cannot withstand the severe corrosion around the slag line for a sustained period of time. Even though the sensing wires that comprise the hot junction can, if well protected, be used for long periods of time without serious deterioration, a suitable refractory cover or sleeve must be applied to the thermocouple prior to using it. For the present work, two methods for continuously measuring melt temperature were developed. One of these relies on deducing melt temperature while the other is based on providing a cooled sleeve for the thermocouple to minimize slag line corrosion. The first technique involves the use of multiple thermocouples embedded in a refractory section at various displacements. When the refractory is contacted by the melt, transient heat transfer is initiated through the section. By analyzing this transient behaviour with a suitable heat transfer model, it is possible to infer the temperature of the melt. A mathematical model that adequately describes this process has been developed and tested. An alternative approach that was developed uses heat pipe technology to prevent the corrosion of the thermocouple probe through solidification of slag onto the heat pipe which can serve as a protector of the probe. Heat pipes are devices capable of transferring large quantities of heat with very small temperature differences. Advantages of the heat pipe when used as a heat transmission device are constructional simplicity, flexibility, high heat transport capability, and no need for external pumping device. The heat pipe consists of a closed evacuated tube, porous wicking material, and working fluid. Heating one part of the external surface leads to evaporation of the working fluid and the establishment of a pressure gradient within the heat pipe. The resulting pressure difference drives the vapor from the evaporator to the condenser where the pressure and temperature are slightly lower. The effective conductance of the heat pipe can be several orders of magnitude higher than that of an equivalent solid copper bar. In the second part of this thesis, the feasibility of incorporating heat pipe technology to solidify and maintain a thin layer of slag on the heat pipe while it is in operation is presented.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zs41r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g1886</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
