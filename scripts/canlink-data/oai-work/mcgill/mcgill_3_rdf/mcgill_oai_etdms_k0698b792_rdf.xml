Some parameters of SRS-A and histamine release from skin fragments were compared with those of lung. By filtration through Biogel P-2 in aqueous medium, it was demonstrated that SRS-A released from lung or skin fragments exists as a molecular size species of about 1000 daltons, some of which is reversibly bound to macromolecular component(s). On the other hand, SRS-A sieved through Sephadex LH-20 ln 80% ethanol had a molecular weight of 350-400 daltons. A comparison was made of the gel filtration properties of SRS-A and several prostaglandins in both gel-solvent systems. The results suggested that 350-400 daltons may closely approximate the actual molecular weight of monkey SRS-A.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goodfriend, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429d51t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698b792</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
