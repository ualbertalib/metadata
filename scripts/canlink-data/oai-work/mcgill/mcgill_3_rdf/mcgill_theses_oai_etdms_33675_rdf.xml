I propose that the structure of IHRCs involves a modifying clause predicted of a head. We provide empirical as well as conceptual arguments showing that the head of an IHRC is a pro licensed by coindexation with the internal head. Following Safir's (1986) LCR, this licensing must be mediated by A$ sp prime$-Binding, which is effected by operator-movement to COMP within the modifying clause. Island Constraints provide evidence for operator-movement in IHRCs. IHRCs pattern with other Wh-constructions in this way. Correlatively, if there are no Island effects in IHRCs, there are no Island effects with other Wh-constructions (cf. Lakhota, Mojave). In this case an Unselective Binding relation is established in the language. Other properties such as the Definiteness Effect and the occurence of Switch-reference markers in IHRCs in Choctaw are also shown to follow from independent parameters. The consequences of our analysis for Baker's (to appear) theory of Configurationality are explored. We propose to expand Baker's theory to allow "discontinuous" constituents of the type (Wh$ sb1$ ... OP$ sb1$) to account for Island effects in IHRCs of pronominal languages like Mohawk and Navajo. No special rules for the interpretation of IHRCs are required. The LF-Raising rule proposed in Williamson (1987), which raises the internal head at LF to the COMP of the IHRC is shown to derive from the LCR as it is required to create an operator-variable (A$ sp prime$-Binding) relation. We provide further independent evidence for this rule in Chapter 2.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462712t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mk57n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Government-binding theory (Linguistics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Switch-reference</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Relative clauses</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b591997p"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Flaubert et l'art de la mise en scène</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Daunais, Isabelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The narratives of Flaubert usually begin with the creation of a closed setting, geographically or architecturally contained, that the observer perceives as a theatrical stage. In fact, the staging of space and sets plays such an important role in the narration that it is possible to read the novels as scenographies. Flaubert's tendency to treat life events as tableaux and space as a performing area is already at work in his travel notes and in the Carnets de travail, and he makes a systematic use of this vision in the elaboration of his novels. By showing only what is visible and by creating different spaces for action and observation, Flaubert equates space in the novel with the space of a play. The scenography of the sets as well as the way characters stage their own environment also contribute to this theatrical representation. By representing reality as a staged creation, without an omniscient narrator, scenography can be defined as both a narrative device and a narrative object.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p1964.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591997p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Flaubert, Gustave, 1821-1880 -- Technique</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87pr99t"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Gothic bodies : the politics of pain in romantic fiction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bruhm, Steven</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the ideology of sentimentalism, physical sensation integrates the parts of the body into a whole, and the fragmented members of the body politic into a social community. However, intense pain is always an individual experience. It not only isolates us from other people, but is also isolates us from our own bodies: pain renders our bodies out of control. Moreover, pain attacks our very notion of self by threatening to render us unconscious, and unable to perceive that self. This complex of problems became especially acute for late eighteenth-century writers, as they tried to reconcile their sympathy for the French Revolution with the intense pain that the Revolution signified. What they articulated was a process by which the self initially identifies with the pained body of the other, but then appropriates that pain to make it one's own, thereby isolating the self from infectious Revolutionary sympathies.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zw103.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pr99t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pain in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Romanticism -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag732db59c"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Anglo-Turkish alliance 1939-1940 : anatomy of a failure</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Millman, Brock, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is the contention of this thesis that the Tripartite Alliance came at the end of a period during which Britain and Turkey attempted to reconcile their often conflicting interests in order to ensure common security in the Near East. Between 1934-1939, contrary to the usual belief, the dynamics of Anglo-Turkish relations most often led Turkey to seek a formal relationship, which Britain, for reasons of its own, was reluctant to grant. Once conceded, in May 1939, with the proclamation of the Joint Guarantee, the fledgling Anglo-Turkish condominium promptly began to sicken, and by June 1940, had failed altogether. The primary reasons for this collapse were four. Firstly, the political under-pinnings of the alliance never seemed sufficient to permit either partner to consider advantageous the activation of the alliance once made. Secondly, the Alliance was afflicted by certain powerful dilemmas within Britain's global strategy which prevented British planners from coming to any lasting consensus regarding Turkey's role in imperial defence. Thirdly, if the alliance were to be made effective, sufficient and timely assistance--chiefly, material and economic assistance--would have to be provided the Turkish partner. During this early period, both Britain and France remained unable or unwilling to provide anything like the level of assistance required. Finally, the numerous inter-allied Staff conversations, which were a principle feature of the Alliance's early years, failed to produce a single viable option for the fruitful deployment of common forces against any possible enemy. Without such a plan, the entry of Turkey to the war would have been worse than ill-advised; it would have been pointless. Once the Alliance had definitely foundered on these rocks, in the infinitely more menacing conditions existing after June 1940, it was entirely unlikely that Turkey would permit the activation of an alliance no longer consistent, by any reading, with its essential interests.

The model accounts for both material nonlinearity due to yielding and strain-hardening and strain-softening effects and geometric nonlinearity due to large deformations. The finite element equations are formulated using incremental plasticity theory with Total Lagrangian approach where the Kirchhoff stress tensor and Green strain increment tensor are used. The model is developed for use on microcomputer system and is designed to perform 2-D nonlinear analysis of mine excavations in multiple-material domain, thus predicting the distribution of elastic, strain-softening, strain-hardening and residual strength zones. The model accommodates any arbitrary stope geometry and it allows for a variety of mining-type loading conditions in situ stresses, gravity loading and boundary tractions. Special provision has been made to permit the simulation of backfill as in situ stress-free material. Stress-space strain-softening is invoked into model using the concept of damage parameter in the incremental stress-strain relation. In addition to model verification and sensitivity analysis, two numerical modelling case studies have been undertaken. The first case study is of a narrow vein mine with backfill which is located in the province of Karnchanaburi, Thailand. The second case study is about a room-and-pillar design of a potash deposit in the province of Chaiyaphum, Thailand.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xg49m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75r9418</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602244m"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The kinetics of rapid crystallization of metallic glasses</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brauer, Stephan F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Time-resolved x-ray scattering has been used to study the kinetics of polymorphic crystallization of amorphous metals on time-scales varying from minutes to milliseconds. Using a high flux synchrotron beamline and fast position-sensitive detector system, simultaneous wide and small angle scattering patterns from the transforming material have been acquired in situ, with time-resolution as short as 3ms. A fast pyrometric temperature controller has been developed to change and regulate the sample temperature with microsecond response. Two alloys have been identified in which crystallization proceeds by thermally activated nucleation and growth of a single equilibrium phase at all observable transformation rates. Crystal volume fractions as small as 10$ sp{-4}$ can be measured and the results are well explained by a simple nucleation and growth model. There is no evidence for a nucleation transient. Small angle scattering from such alloys reveals an increase in intensity prior to crystallization followed by a rise commensurate with the crystallization itself. In all other studied alloys however, as the transformation rate is increased, the crystallization mechanism changes such that transient crystal phases are formed en route to the equilibrium structure. Two new metastable phases have been crystallographically identified. At high equilibrium rates, the kinetically favored phases are those which require the least atomic rearrangement from the glassy state.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752j40r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602244m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Physical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m825n"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Translational-torsional coupling in asymmetric structures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yoon, Young-Soo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An approximate method for predicting the degree of translational-torsional coupling of mixed-bent type multi-storey building structures subject to dynamic loading is presented. The method uses the parametric approach and is based on the generalized representation of asymmetric wall-frame structures by shear-flexure, torsion-warping cantilevers. It is applicable to structures consisting of any combinations of walls and frames that are uniform with height. Simple methods for predicting the uncoupled translational-torsional period ratio and the equivalent eccentricity, which require a knowledge of only the preliminary design information, are developed. The actual coupled period ratio can then be estimated in terms of these two quantities. The concepts of shear centres and centres of resistance of mixed-bent type multi-storey building structures are clarified, and the significance of the uncoupled and coupled period ratios in the assessment of the coupling effect is discussed. The derivation of the method and comparisons of results with those obtained by 3-D finite element dynamic analyses of discrete member models, are given. Numerical examples are worked to illustrate the application of the method. The applicability of the method to non-uniform wall-frame structures having changes in the stiffness through the height is demonstrated; a non-uniform distribution of mass over the floor is also taken into account.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xw610.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712m825n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494b08r"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Chaucer's intentionalist realism and the Friar's Tale</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Myles, Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>John R. Searle asks the following fundamental question at the beginning of Speech Acts: "What is the difference between saying something and meaning it and saying it without meaning it?" This dissertation demonstrates that Chaucer is interested in this same question and that his answer to it is essentially "modern." I show in a number of Chaucer's works, but primarily through a reading of the Friar's Tale, that Chaucer understands the intentional structure of all signs, based on the paradigm of language; that is, that signs are always simultaneously mind-related and world-related, that they possess what is called today a "three-level semantics." This semantics is at the heart of the dynamic play in Chaucer's poetry, and through it he is able to portray his characters psychologically. This being so, with Chaucer as an exemplar, this dissertation calls into question the widespread belief in a "medieval mentality" that is essentially "other" than a "modern mentality." To support this argument in the context of medieval thought, I explain that Chaucer could have such a "modern" understanding of the psychological import of language by describing certain of the common, shared presuppositions and characteristics of medieval Judeo-Christian metaphysics: its thesis of intentionality, its personalism and existentialism, and its semiological nature. The present study is of importance to Chaucerian studies in general because I argue that heretofore Chaucer's understanding of language has been inadequately, incorrectly, and confusedly described in terms of medieval nominalism and realism. Consequently, Chaucer has been seen as a nominalist thinker, a realist thinker or a combination of both. This dissertation lays these particular "Chaucers" to rest. I argue that Chaucer may be described as an "intentionalist realist," but the "realist" of this description is not identical with the "realism" of the scholastic debates on the nature of the universals. This dissertation further suggests that the semantics which Chaucer consciously considers and exploits in his works on the level of language, speech and other human-directed signs may serve as a paradigm of a general Chaucerian "semantics" in an extended sense: Chaucer's understanding of a structure of meaning or logos of all reality. On an individual human level this translates into a structure whereby a medieval Christian may judge if a person, including his or her own self, is relating properly, or improperly, to other individuals, to other created things, and to God.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gp96b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494b08r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chaucer, Geoffrey, d. 1400.

We evaluated the noise power spectrum (NPS) using the averaged periodogram technique. As predicted by theory, varying the image reconstruction filter produced a shift in the frequency content while slice thickness only affected the amplitude of the noise. In order to quantify the blur, we developed and evaluated two non-linear parametric models of the point spread function (PSF): the Gaussian and damped cosine models. We fitted these models to images of spatially distributed point sources and thus quantified the pattern of shift-variance. We found that the system produced a rotating blur and observed a loss of PSF radial symmetry as the input point source moved away from the center of the field of view. We validated the use of point sources by comparing non-parametric PSF estimates obtained with this input to those found using a correlation-based technique (Wiener-Hopf equation). We gained insight into the design of the input signal, which consisted of pseudo-randomly located holes, through an exhaustive simulation. The second goal was to investigate how this information could be used to process CT images. We formulated and evaluated a coordinate transformation for shift-invariant restoration of CT images. We developed a simple evaluation procedure which proved beneficial in delimiting the usefulness and detecting limitations of the method. We also formulated a number of recommendations regarding the use of the threshold and Laplacian of a Gaussian segmentation operators taking the shape of the PSF and of the NPS into account.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333392s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732db604</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j277s"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Illitesmectite diagenesis in the Beaufort-Mackenzie Basin, Arctic Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ko, Jaehong</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Illitization in the Beaufort-Mackenzie Basin is characterized by random, a mixture of random and ordered, R1-ordered, and R $&gt;$ 1-ordered illite/smectite (I/S). Proportions of I-layers increase with depth, while the dominant I/S type changes in that order. Illitization in offshore wells is generally more advanced than onshore because of higher geothermal gradients. Illitization in geopressure zones and sandy intervals appears to be faster than under normally pressured conditions and in shales, respectively, due to higher water/particle ratios. Hydrocarbons generally occur above and in the interval of random I/S, but rarely below the depth where ordered I/S is found. Layer formulae of S- and I-layers are estimated to be $ rm lbrack Al sb{1.57}Fe sb{.19}Mg sb{.31}Ti sb{.07} rbrack lbrack Si sb{3.84}Al sb{.16} rbrack O sb{10}(OH) sb2$ and $ rm lbrack Al sb{1.84}Mg sb{.16} rbrack lbrack Si sb{3.33}Al sb{.67} rbrack O sb{10}(OH) sb2,$ respectively. The increase in concentrations of $ rm K sb2O,$ Rb and rare earth elements (REE), the decrease in octahedral elements (Mg, Ti, Sc, Zn, Zr), and the increase in tetrahedral elements (Al, Be, V) can be attributed to the conversion of S-layers to I-layers with increasing depth. The REE appear to be mobilized during illitization. $ rm delta sp{18}O$ values range from 2.91 to 15.72$ perthous$ (SMOW), and increase with depth, contrasting to the trends observed in the Gulf Coast and elsewhere. This probably is related to the rapid increase in $ rm delta sp{18}O$ of pore waters with depth.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nn033.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j277s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r475w"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>One in heart : the marriage metaphor in nineteenth-century English-Canadian fiction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Murphy, Carl</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The marriage of English and French in nineteenth-century English-Canadian fiction is a trope reflecting anglophone nationalism and the anglophone desire for identity in a united nation.

The optimum alloy composition for SiC-SiC joints was computed to be Ni-14.5Cr-35Si (atom%). Brazing experiments were conducted to assess the effect of changing the Si content of the brazing alloy away from the calculated optimum on the joint microstructures and strengths. For alloys containing less than 37 atom% Si excessive reaction was observed, resulting in the formation of a porous reaction zone at the brazing alloy/SiC interface and poor joint strengths, the thickness of the porous zone decreasing and the joint strength increasing as the brazing alloy composition approached 37 atom% Si. The most favourable joint microstructures and highest joint strengths ($ approx$100MPa) were observed for the 37 atom% Si brazing alloy, in excellent agreement with the thermodynamic model. For alloys containing greater than 37 atom% Si, the microstructures exhibited localized debonding of the brazing alloys from the SiC and poorer joint strengths, also in good agreement with the thermodynamic model. For the SiC-Nb brazing study, the thermodynamic modelling procedure determined that a series of Ni-Cr-Si-Nb alloys were suitable for forming bonds. Brazing experiments were performed using two of the "optimum" brazing alloy compositions (i.e. Ni-11.6Cr-29Si-19Nb and Ni-11.2Cr-20Si-30Nb (atom%)) and two alloys of lower Si and Nb contents in order to assess the predictions of the thermodynamic model through evaluation of the joint microstructures. All of the joints exhibited porous reaction zones, with the thickness of the reaction zone decreasing as the Si and Nb content of the brazing alloys approached the computed optima. However, due to cracking and solidification porosity in the brazing alloy, these joints were found to be unsuitable for engineering applications. It was concluded that the solution thermodynamic method developed in this thesis was very useful for selecting Ni-based (Ni/Cr = 3.46) brazing alloy compositions suitable for forming SiC-SiC-Nb bonds.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c218z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128c554</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20sv34t"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Elderly persons and decision-making in a medical context : challenging Canadian law</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Glass, Kathleen Cranley</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The subject of this thesis is the investigation and critical evaluation of how Canadian legal institutions approach substitute decision-making in the particular context of making medical choices for incompetent elderly persons. Underlying the inquiry is an acknowledgment of the right of competent persons to have their autonomy recognized and the duty to protect from harm those with reduced competence. Statutes, case law and custom are examined to determine how well they serve older persons when choices concerning medical treatment and participation in research protocols are required. The adequacy of current Canadian law relating to informed consent to medical treatment and competency assessment is evaluated in light of the special characteristics of elderly persons. Recent and proposed law reforms are examined for their appropriateness in addressing the questions of who should make substitute decisions for incompetent persons and how these decisions should be made. The three foremost criteria used as the basis for making substitute decisions--best interests, substituted judgment and advance directives--are analyzed. A final proposal is made that would redefine the notion of a person's "interests", allowing us to view the criteria for substitute decision-making not as competing, but as complementary, the appropriateness of each varying with the situation in question. Ethical principles have been employed both as a critical framework for assessing the fairness and acceptability of particular laws and as complementary to these laws, since law by its nature can never be crafted to address adequately every question we may pose.

Minimum energy configurations of known surfactant molecules used in the preparation of water-in-oil emulsion explosives were obtained through the Tree Branch Methodology, and the optimised geometries used to calculate structural parameters assuming standard van der Waals radii around each atom. Comparison of the structural parameters to the stability of the emulsions in which the surfactants were used, allowed preliminary structural criteria to be established. Based on the structural criteria, a number of new families of surfactant head group were designed, and preliminary rules for matching head to tail group combinations proposed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g444h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x560v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xt33p"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A measurement of proton and pion induced P-wave charmonium hadroproduction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rosati, Marzia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The production of charmonium states, $ chi sb1$ and $ chi sb2$, was measured at 300 GeV/c with $ pi sp+$, $ pi sp-$, and proton beams on a lithium target.

(Patricia Lorna)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A general synthesis for bridged bicyclic disulfide compounds was refined and expanded from (3.2.1) to (4.2.1) and (2.2.1) systems. Various derivatives were synthesized through modification of the hydroxyl functionality in these molecules. The oxidation of all bridged bicyclic disulfide compounds to their corresponding bridged bicyclic thiosulfinate esters (a previously unknown class of compounds) was performed. Three crystal structures were obtained and selected bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles were compared with the calculated values obtained using MMX molecular mechanics via the PCMODEL program. The m-CPBA oxidation of the above bridged bicyclic thiosulfinate esters was followed at low temperature using $ sp1$H and $ sp{13}$C NMR spectroscopy. $ alpha$-Disulfoxides were detected as the first intermediates in this oxidation process and were seen at temperatures and concentrations greater than any previously reported. Strong evidence was also found to suggest the intermediacy of O,S-sulfenyl sulfinates. A clear mechanistic proposal for the rearrangement of bridged bicyclic $ alpha$-disulfoxides to their corresponding thiosulfonate esters was presented based on experimental results. Attempts towards the synthesis of the bridged bicyclic disulfide analogue of ergosterol peroxide using diatomic sulfur methodologies were reported. These attempts were not successful. The generation of the pseudo-diatomic species, R-P = S (thioxophosphanes), using a methodology previously developed in our laboratory was examined. The thioxophosphanes (R = C$ sb6$H$ sb5$, C$ sb2$H$ sb5$ and p-Cl-C$ sb6$H$ sb4$) were trapped with 1,3-dienes to give cyclic and bridged bicyclic thiophosphoranes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687j993.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m0979</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qn63p"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Implied terms of voyage charters</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pavliha, Marko A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a comparative study of English, American, French, Canadian and Quebec law relative to the implied terms of voyage charterparties. It addresses specifically the implied terms in the general law of contract demonstrating the similarity between the Civil and Common law systems as well as the need to convert the implied terms into rules of law not subject to exclusion by agreement. The latter proposal is also supported by the doctrine of frustration which has evolved from the notion of implied terms into a principle of law. The thesis treats the implied undertakings of the shipowner which are to provide a seaworthy vessel, to go the the port of loading with reasonable despatch, to exercise reasonable care and to proceed without deviation. In addition, it studies the implied undertakings of the charterer being, essentially, the obligation to nominate a safe port and/or berth, and the undertaking not to ship dangerous goods. The thesis takes into account the impact of the transportation of goods under voyage charterparties upon the environment and suggests how this impact and its effects might be prevented by international law. Finally, it is submitted that because implied terms have been and are part of the fundamental legal structure of the voyage charterparty in both Common and Civil law, they should become express rules of international law, not subject to exclusion by contract.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wr870.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qn63p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c2197"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Renewable Resources</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Surface charge evaluation of soils, clays and oxides</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Duquette, Martin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two objectives are achieved in this thesis: (1) to develop a new method to measure the pH-dependent net surface charge of soils and (2) to determine if, by a combination of the surface charge evaluated by potentiometric titration and ion adsorption, we can separate the permanent charge, generated by the isomorphous substitution, from the variable charge. First, a laboratory procedure, using backtitration, was developed for the measurement of the pH-dependent net surface charge. This method was tested on ten soil horizons from Gleysols and Podzols. It appears that the pH-dependent net surface charge, measured by this technique, shows good agreement with that measured by ion adsorption. It is also possible, with this method, to identify some plateaus and inflection points in the backtitration curve associated with protonation/deprotonation reactions of specific soil components. Secondly, it was demonstrated that it is possible to increase the surface charge of montmorillonite with Al-oxide coatings under specific conditions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246t61d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c2197</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electrochemical analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Surfaces</dc:subject><dc:subject>Potentiometry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avx021g86n"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Images and reality of fatherhood : a case study of Montreal's Protestant middle class, 1870-1914</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fish, Cynthia S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation examines the images and reality of fatherhood, between 1870 and 1914, using a case study of Montreal's middle class, and specifically the English speaking, Protestant community.

Fatherhood was also invested with authority and power. Yet, the sentimental family ideal entrusted the mother with the emotional elements of child-rearing.

Inflectional affixes are attached to stems which are formed in primary or secondary derivation. Chapter II discusses verb-forming suffixes ('finals') added to roots and certain suffixes to form verb stems.

G. Ballard's fiction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ostrowidzki, Eric A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In response to theoretical inquiries into the decline in the production of utopian literature, this dissertation argues that the decline or, rather, the "postmodern" loss of faith in utopian literature and utopian thinking results from the neo-liberal globalization of capitalism and its material and discursive/ideological appropriation of global space. To demonstrate this thesis, the dissertation examines the invariably dystopic imaginative geographies in the fiction of J. G. Ballard. By analyzing the historical-geographical discursive context of Ballard's imaginative geographies, the dissertation attempts to locate and recover those absent spaces that might have served as probable sites of Utopia. The first part of this dissertation examines Ballard's "Concentration City," "Report on an Unidentified Space Station," "The Enormous Space," "The Overloaded Man," and the novel High-Rise. This section concludes generally that the imaginative geographies inscribed within those texts are closed, insular, homogeneous, pathological and exclusionary social spaces that are antithetical to a Postmodern Utopia whose socio-cultural inclusiveness would be predicated upon a "politics of difference." The second half of the dissertation examines Ballard's later works, such as Rushing to Paradise (1994), Cocaine Nights (1996), and Super-Cannes (2001). By discursively analyzing the similar yet more ideologically transparent imaginative geographies in these recent works, the dissertation concludes that it is not exclusively the material and ideological conquest of social space by global capital that poses the greatest threat to Ballard's "utopian" socio-spatial imaginary. Rather, it is also the postcolonial threat of the dislocations and mass immigrations of the Indigenous Other precipitated by globalization. It is the emergence of the de-territorialized Other that impels Ballard's imaginative geographies to recoil inwardly into "Privatopias," "white enclaves" and "imperial ghettos" demarcated by neocolonial pathological geographies of exclusion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marchessault, Janine</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Hensley, David</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dn98s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fd40c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Utopias in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ballard, J.

The purpose of the study was twofold: (i) to identify sequence modifications associated with aberrant transposition that are informative regarding the mechanism of Ac/Ds transposition; and (ii) to extend our understanding of the mechanisms by which class II TEs can influence genome structure. This work focuses on a large inversion identified on chromosome II. A lone Ds element comprises one breakpoint of the inversion and the second breakpoint is composed solely of Arabidopsis sequences. The analysis of the sequence modifications present at both breakpoints indicates that the event was precipitated by the abortive transposition of Ds. This is the first event of its kind identified for an Ac/Ds and the event defines a novel mechanism by which these TEs can induce change within a genome. Further, the presence of deletions at both termini of the implicated Ds suggests that the transposition of Ac/Ds involves fully excised intermediates. To obtain further support for this model, a population of Arabidopsis individuals harboring Ds excision events was screened for reintegrated elements. Several integrations were analyzed at the sequence level and compared to wild-type integration sites. While no genome rearrangements were detected, a number of integrations display small deletions within both the Ds termini and the DNA flanking the elements. These results are consistent with the presence of fully excised Ac/Ds intermediates. Further, the results suggest that dissolution of the transposase active complex at different points in the transposition process will result in the formation of distinct aberrant transposition products. During the characterization of the inversion, a novel Arabidopsis TE family, FARE, was identified.
