A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The airborne magnetometer was developed during World War II as a submarine detector, and is now a standard tool of modern geophysics. Since its development, the airborne magnetometer has helped locate valuable ore deposits, it has aided to decipher geological structures, and it has been used to investigate the possible future activity of volcanoes. Airborne magnetic surveys are not essentially different from land magnetic surveys: aeromagnetic data are obtained and compiled along a continuous line, whereas ground magnetic surveys are made at separate points.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Saull, V.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064953n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593v005p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2f75rc71d"><ual:graduationDate>1956</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The geology of the St. Pierre Prospect, Fort Chimo district, Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mannard, George. W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The recent development of rich iron ore deposits in the heart of the Labrador-Ungava peninsula, with the subsequent construction of a 350 mi. railway connecting the deposits to the St. Lawrence River, has opened the door to the exploration of a vast region rich in indications of iron and base metal mineralization. Systematic exploration of this hitherto inaccessible territory has revealed that potentially economic concentrations of iron, copper and nickel lie within the “Labrador Trough”, a belt of ancient, more or less deformed sediments, which stretches at least five hundred miles from Menihek Lake in the south, northwestward to Payne Bay.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gill, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tk24m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75rc71d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053m012"><ual:graduationDate>1956</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The synthesis of diphosphopyridine nucleotide in the erythrocyte</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Malkin, Aaron</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>At the outbreak of World War II, work was initiated in the Department of Biochemistry at McGill University, under the direction of Dr. O. F. Denstedt, on a study of the means whereby the then existing methods of blood preservation might be improved. Similar investigations were undertaken in many other laboratories throughout the world, particularly in the United States and Great Britain. The availability of blood and plasma for prompt treatment of the wounded at the fighting front accounted for the tremendous saving of lives in World War II as compared with World War I.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Denstedt, O.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zm55w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053m012</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w3520"><ual:graduationDate>1956</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the constitution of casein</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacRae, Herbert. F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Probably no single protein has been the subject of as many chemical investigations as has casein. This is to be expected since casein is the main protein constituent of the milk of all mammals and because it can be readily isolated in a more or less pure state and with reasonably reproducible properties. For one hundred years following Mulder’s discovery that casein may be precipitated from milk by the addition of acid, casein was considered the typical example of a homogeneous protein. It was not until the classical solubility studies of Linderstrom-Lang were published, that casein was definitely shown to be a mixture of proteins.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baker, B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n226c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w3520</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
