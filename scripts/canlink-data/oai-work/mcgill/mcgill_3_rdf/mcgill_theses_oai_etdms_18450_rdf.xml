DDT, after its introduction in 1945, gave excellent control and is now the most widely used insecticide against the pest. Its use, however, has not been without some disadvantages, chief of which are an upsurge of phytophagus mites, and to a less extent other pests such as the red-banded leafroller, due in large part to the destruction of natural enemies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morrison, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd376145k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w8437</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Entomology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x5042"><ual:graduationDate>1956</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Uniqueness theorems for ordinary differential equations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Herschorn, Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Our aim is to establish and discuss a certain class of conditions on the functions fi which ensure that the system (E) has a unique solution through a given point of D.

C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Between January 1952 and May 1953 the United States Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3, stationed at Cairo, Egypt, undertook an extensive survey of the local fauna for the presence of schistosomes. As a result, a large number of helminths, other than schistosomes, was collected and some were forwarded to the Institute of Parasitology at Macdonald College for identification. This thesis deals with the classification of those nematodes collected from Carnivora. It is hoped that eventually a complete host list for all the parasites obtained in the area will be published.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cameron, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sf20z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kp423</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Parasitology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qg89m"><ual:graduationDate>1956</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of temperature and nutrition on the development of the house cricket, Acheta domesticus (L.)

S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Crickets belong to the family Gryllidae (Orthoptera) and are common in houses, fields, pasture, meadows, and some inhabit trees and shrubs. Most of them feed on plants and grains but some occasionally feed on other insects. Several species of crickets overwinter as eggs, laid generally in the moist ground or vegetation, while others in tropical climates pass the winter either as nymphs of late instars, or as adults. They are among the most familiar insects. In Italy and North Africa crickets, which are best known for the musical sounds made by the male, are kept in cages tor the sake of their notes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DuPorte, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816r286.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qg89m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Entomology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8p58ph633"><ual:graduationDate>1956</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nitramines of the pyridinecarboxylic acids series</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gantchev, Neno</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this work was to prepare nitramines of 2-amino- 6-pyridinecarboxylic acid, 4-amino-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid, 4-amino- 3-pyridinecarboxylic acid, 2-amino-4-pyridinecarboxylic acid, 2-amino- 5-cyano-4, 6-dimethylpyridine and their rearranged products. The compounds: 2-amino-4-pyridinecarboxylic acid, 2-amino-6-pyridinecarboxylic acid, 4-amino-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid and 4-amino-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid have been prepared by permanganate oxidation of the corresponding acetamidopicolines. Further, 2-amino-4-pyridinecarboxylic acid bas been also obtained by the reduction of 2-nitro-4-pyridinecarboxylic acid with iron powder and 20% acetic acid.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taurins, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429f219.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58ph633</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn3015202"><ual:graduationDate>1956</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The representations of particular groups</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>French, Betty.

An important case is that in which the prescribed field is the field of complex numbers. The theory was originated by Frobenius. His most important results were again found independently by Burnside who gave a number of important applications of the theory as well as its classical treatment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burrow, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860b58w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3015202</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
