Today's observers  assert that in ten years, most of the financial sector will be controlled by a small  group of huge diversified banks. By enacting the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999,  Congress repealed the depression-era "Glass-Steagall" Act of 1933 and  thereby officially removed the longstanding legal barriers that insulated banks from  securities firms and insurance companies. As promoters of financial convergence have  long been claiming that the introduction of universal banks in the United States  would produce numerous benefits for themselves, but also for the economy and for  their customers, these predictions can be assessed today in the light of empirical  analysis. Now that "financial supermarkets" are totally legal in the  United States, it is essential to assess whether they are economically and morally  viable.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scott, Stephen</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731454d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c3420</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Universal banks -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>International finance</dc:subject><dc:subject>Universal banks</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445cd76k"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The duty to treat very defective neonates as "persons" : from the legal and moral personhood of very defective neonates to their best interests in medical treatment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hurlimann, Thierry</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The dramatic improvement of neonatal intensive care has produced  vexing ethical and legal questions. One of the most striking issues is to determine  whether the most defective neonates should be provided with intensive care and to  what extent they should be treated. This thesis demonstrates that an attempt to  answer this question and an analysis of the demands and limitations of a duty to  treat defective neonates cannot properly occur without first considering the legal  concerns and ethical issues surrounding the notion of "person". The author  examines germane ethical theories and North-American jurisprudence to see what  approaches and standards commentators and courts have adopted in this respect. This  thesis demonstrates that in the context of the cessation or non-initiation of  intensive care, the legal and moral status of very defective neonates remain  ambiguous. In particular, the author suggests that a legal best interests analysis  that includes quality of life considerations may actually involve the use of  criteria similar to those supported by the authors of the controversial moral  theories that negate the personhood of seriously handicapped newborns. The author  ultimately concludes that a clear divide between the legal definition of the  "person" and the moral and social perceptions of that term is  misleading.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glass, Kathleen</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343s79w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cd76k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neonatal intensive care -- Moral and ethical aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children with disabilities -- Medical care -- Moral and ethical aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Newborn infants -- Diseases -- Treatment -- Moral and ethical aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Persons (Law)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Newborn infants -- Abnormalities -- Treatment -- Moral and ethical aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Abnormalities, Human -- Treatment -- Moral and ethical aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246s641"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Air carrier ownership and control revisited</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>HÃ¶rstke, Stefanie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As the airline industry is in the midst of an economic crisis,  air carrier ownership and control rules that have governed international air  transport relations for the last fifty years have become subject to increased  revision. Those rules impede the free flow of capital and airline consolidation  across borders. Airlines have limited opportunities to structure their operations to  serve global markets. Most importantly, the rules restrict the strategic choices  available to ailing airlines and impede the restructuring of the industry.  Particularly in the European Union, where liberalization is limited by restrictive  ownership requirements included in bilateral agreements with third countries,  airline consolidation and rationalisation through mergers and acquisitions is badly  needed. Impetus for liberalization emanates from the recent judgments of  the European Court of Justice in the "Open Skies", which created the  opportunity to revisit the entire ownership and control framework on a global scale.  The Fifth ICAO Worldwide Air Transport Conference (ATConf/5) provided States with a  forum to discuss and bring about change. Finally, the industry itself is pushing  towards the liberalization of ownership restrictions that prevent it from operating  like any other industry sector. This thesis provides a review of the recent developments in the  field of air carrier ownership and control. The focus is on a critical analysis of  the outcome of ATConf/5. In particular, it will examine the significance of ATConf/5  for the development of ownership and control issues in air transport relations  between the EU and third States and ultimately for the restructuring of the EU  airline industry.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/000000620.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246s641</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Airlines</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1z40kt41h"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Status of non-governmental entities and dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO : an analysis with special reference to amicus brief controversy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hussain, Anwaar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A central feature of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is its  Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM).

Instead, it is argued here that the  "odd differences" in the formulae employed to describe it "are merely  a matter of words". Conceptually, both legal traditions combine the subjective  element of a belief in the truth with the objective requirement of warrant for this  belief in the evidence presented. The trier's belief that a certain statement is  true has to be reasonably inferable from the evidence. In both traditions the  standard is not fixed in the sense that it depends on a variety of factors relevant  to the specific case, such as whether evidence is amply available, or whether only  testimonial evidence can be adduced. This approach to the standard of proof is also followed by the  Principles and Rules for Transnational Civil Procedure developed in 2002 by the  American Law Institute (ALI) and UNIDROIT. Their treatment of the standard of proof  appears to be a synthesis of the Common and Civil Law approaches.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Healy, Patrick</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qj266.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892b435</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Evidence (Law)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Judgments</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816n11d"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Climate change and sustainable energy in Canada and the United States : positions, policy and progress</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Carlsson, Lina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Canada and the United States are two of the most  energy-intensive countries in the world and have an immense impact upon their  surrounding environment.

Research at McGill University has led to  the development of the McGill Heat Pipe which includes an internal flow modifier.  Such a heat pipe can be operated at very high heat fluxes. This area of heat pipe  technology has potential in many applications in metallurgical  industries. This thesis describes how the McGill heat pipe was developed,  tested, modeled and applied in high heat flux situations. Until the development of  the McGill Heat Pipe, three main issues had prevented the successful use of heat  pipe technology in high heat flux applications. These relate to limitations imposed  by film boiling, dry-out, and the structure of the flow. The McGill Heat Pipe has  successfully addressed and overcome these limitations. To overcome film boiling and dry-out, a flow modifier was  developed. The structure of the flow was changed by introducing a reservoir and a  return line. This thesis describes some of the work that is being carried out to  develop and evaluate families of flow modifiers, or spiral springs. Results from a  number of high flux experiments will be detailed and the effects of the flow  modifiers for each case will be described. In addition, the velocity of the return  water was visualized with magnesium alloy chips and was measured with a video  camera. Comparisons of the operation of the heat pipe both with and without a flow  modifier are presented. This is the first study of its kind in which a transparent  glass return line and particles were used to visualize the liquid flow in the return  line of the heat pipe.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634425q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bx722</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50gw750"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Quantization noise shaping in oversampled filter banks</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Leppert, Tania</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The use of a noise-shaping system in oversampled filter banks  has been shown to improve the effective resolution of subband coders. Although the  filter banks directly determine the noise-shaping coefficients, a comparison between  theoretical and simulated results has not been done, while the effect of the  selection of the filter banks on the performance of the noise-shaping system has not  yet been evaluated. Therefore, an algorithm for the generation of cosine-modulated  perfect-reconstruction filter banks is presented, such that the generated filters  could be used as a test bed. The optimal noise-shaping coefficients are then  derived, and the noise-shaping system is inserted into the subband  coder. It is found that the theoretical results agree with the  simulations, but that the performance of the noise-shaping system is limited by  ill-conditioning at higher system orders. An increase in filter length and an  increase in the degree of overlap between neighbouring channels contribute  independently to a better performance. Also, it is seen that near-perfect  reconstruction filter banks are limited by their reconstruction error but yield good  results at low bitrates.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np1939631.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gw750</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avt150j76z"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dynamic capacity allocation for quality-of-service support in IP-based satellite networks</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Iuoras, Nicolae</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis concentrates on advanced dynamic capacity allocation  (DCA) schemes that allow an efficient and fair sharing of the BSA return channel  capacity among many user terminals (UTs), by dynamically adapting each UT's capacity  assignment to the input traffic variations, while satisfying QoS requirements. DCA  performance is evaluated with respect to satellite bandwidth utility (utilization)  and QoS performance experienced by user traffic (expressed in terms of packet delay  and loss). DCA performance is affected by various elements/parameters, some internal  to the DCA scheme and others, external. Relying on simulation, the thesis considers  the effects of these elements/parameters on performance, focusing on their  optimization in order to balance the DCA performance against the signaling overhead  and computational/algorithmic complexity of the DCA scheme. A novel DCA scheme is  proposed, capable of providing Differentiated Services (DiffServ) IP QoS support for  multimedia applications and high bandwidth utility, while maintaining reduced  signaling overhead and computational/algorithmic complexity.

Bridges built in the 1960's were designed with outdated codes  which had inadequate seismic design detailing provisions and therefore, are expected  to behave poorly during an earthquake. The existing bridge bent examined has three  major design deficiencies such as large spacing of ties in the column, total lack of  shear reinforcement in the beam, and lack of shear reinforcement in the beam-column  joint. A one-half scale model of the existing bridge bent was designed and  constructed in the laboratory. This model was tested under reversed cyclic loading  to determine the maximum applied load and failure mechanisms. The experimental  results of the specimen are then compared to the response predictions. Both the  experimental and predicted results revealed that the bridge bent is vulnerable to  shear failure in the cap beams and hence, has inadequate performance. Research  should be continued on the damaged specimen to determine the repair and retrofit  techniques.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj191.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n171p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920fx41t"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Electrical wavelength tuning in single and multi-wavelength, mode-locked semiconductor fiber ring lasers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cao, Hong, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The explosive growth in the information technology industry  requires high-performance optical sources.

Both machine learning  and database research have made major contributions to the field of data mining.  However, there is still little effort made to improve the scalability of algorithms  applied in data raining tasks. Scalability is crucial for data mining algorithms,  since they have to handle large datasets quite often. In this thesis we take a step  in this direction by extending a popular machine learning software, Weka3.4, to  handle large datasets that can not fit into main memory by relying on relational  database technology. Weka3.4-DB is implemented to store the data into and access the  data from DB2 with a loose coupling approach in general. Additionally, a semi-tight  coupling is applied to optimize the data manipulation methods by implementing core  functionalities within the database. Based on the DB2 storage implementation,  Weka3.4-DB achieves better scalability, but still provides a general interface for  developers to implement new algorithms without the need of database or SQL  knowledge.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hc77z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tf961</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av692t692k"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of DNMT1o deficiency on embryos</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Toppings, Marc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>DNA methylation constitutes an epigenetic modification of DNA  that is initiated during gametogenesis and is essential for normal development.  Methylation is postulated to be the molecular mark underlying genomic imprinting  whereby genes are differentially expressed according to parental origin. The loss of  the oocyte-derived DNMT1o maintenance methyltransferase affects the methylation  imprints during preimplantation development, producing epigenetic mosaic embryos.  Here we show that embryos that develop in the absence of DNMT1o demonstrate profound  phenotypic variation in both fetal and extraembryonic tissues, as well as severe  pregnancy loss by midgestation. Morphological assessment was complemented with  methylation analysis of fetal and extraembryonic tissues at the differentially  methylated domain (DMD) of the imprinted gene Snrpn. The general conclusion from  this study is that extragenetic programming in the embryo greatly influences  pregnancy outcome and phenotype in mouse embryos. The relevance of this work to  human imprinting disorders and cloning technologies is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719m94q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t692k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wj915"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Acquisition of haemoglobin-bound iron by Histophilus somni</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tremblay, Yannick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ovine (strains 9L and 3384Y) and bovine (strains 649, 2336 and  8025) isolates of Histophilus somni were investigated for their ability to acquire  iron from haemoglobin (Hb). Bovine isolates were capable of utilizing bovine, but  not ovine, porcine or human Hb as a source of iron. Ovine isolates could not obtain  iron from Hb. Bovine isolates bound bovine, ovine, and human Hbs by means of the  same iron-repressible receptor(s) and produced a ~120-kDa iron-repressible,  outer membrane protein. Using PCR approaches, an iron-regulated operon containing  hugX and hugZ homologues and a gene (hgbA) that encodes a TonB-dependent, Hb-binding  proteins were identified in strains 649, 9L and 3384Y. In strains 9L and 3384Y, HgbA  is truncated offering a possible explanation for their lack of utilization of Hb as  an iron source. In strains 2336 and 8025, expression of HgbA was also subject to a  form of phase variation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580n16v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wj915</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gram-negative bacteria -- Metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Histophilus somni -- Metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Iron -- Metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microbial metabolism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct48h"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification of potential new merozoite surface proteins in the Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 genome</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Santamaria, Cynthia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Here we report the identification of 15 potential MSP-like  proteins from the P. falciparum 3D7 genome using a bioinformatics-based approach.  One candidate, renamed URF1, was further characterized by cloning into the Gateway  system. We were able to demonstrate expression of URF1 during the blood stage,  especially the trophozoite, early and late schizont phases, by immunofluorescence on  infected RBC using antisera raised in mice with an URF1 DNA vaccine. URF1 expression  in the merozoite stage could not be confirmed in this study. Future co-localization  and immunosorbent electron microscopy (EM) experiments would help us determine the  exact localization of URF1 on the parasite before officially categorizing URF1 as a  merozoite surface protein. As a whole, this research project demonstrates the  success of using bioinformatics in identifying potential new MSP-like proteins found  in the malaria genome. Further characterization and sequence analysis of the other  15 candidates may reveal other novel antigens expressed during the erythrocytic  stage, especially in the merozoite stage. Such antigens may prove to be good vaccine  candidates.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415p9899.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17ct48h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Merozoite Surface Protein 1</dc:subject><dc:subject>Malaria -- Immunological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plasmodium falciparum -- Genome mapping</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924c28v"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A face to remember : an fMRI study of the effects of emotional expression on recognition memory</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sergerie, Karine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Emotion can exert a modulatory role on declarative memory.  Several studies have shown that emotional stimuli (e.g., words, pictures) are better  remembered than neutral ones. Although facial expressions are powerful emotional  stimuli and have been shown to influence perception and attention processes, little  is known about their effect on memory. We conducted an event-related fMRI study in  18 healthy individuals (9 men) to investigate the effects of expression on  recognition memory for faces. During the encoding phase, participants viewed 84  faces of different individuals, depicting happy, fearful or neutral expressions.  Subjects were asked to perform a gender discrimination task and remember the faces  for later. In the recognition part subjects performed an old/new decision task on  168 faces (84 new). Both runs were scanned. Our findings highlight the importance of  the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex on the formation and retrieval of  memories with emotional content.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s077g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924c28v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Physiological</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63sw43q"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Life history responses of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) to mass removal</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ng, Rebecca Yuen Wah, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study evaluates the life history responses of yellow perch  to mass removal and the potential for population recovery. We removed approximately  94% of a perch population from Nepawin Lake, a 35 hectare oligotrophic lake in  Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, as part of a study designed to enhance the  recruitment success of brook trout. Several response variables were examined both  before and after mass removal: (1) condition, which includes growth, diet and  overall condition responses, and (2) reproduction, which includes size at maturity  and fecundity. We examine the question of whether compensatory life history  responses in the yellow perch will overcome brook trout predation leading to a  reestablishment of a high density perch population. Results showed that prior to the  manipulation, perch exhibited a narrow size distribution, high dietary overlap, and  low condition, typifying a stunted population. After mass removal, the perch  population remained in a narrow size distribution, exhibited decreased growth rates  for older age classes, showed increased mean condition and increased consumption of  zooplankton in all size classes. Perch also exhibited increased size at maturity and  decreased fecundity immediately following the mass removal. A time lag is expected  before compensatory recruitment is possible in the population, but it is likely that  the perch will recover from the mass removal because of strong age 0+ and 1+  cohorts. However, stunting and bottlenecking may still occur in the population.  Continued monitoring and management is necessary to observe further changes to the  perch population dynamics in Nepawin Lake.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mj60r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw43q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fish populations -- Thinning -- Ontario</dc:subject><dc:subject>Yellow perch -- Ontario</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418n77q"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Investigations into Programmed Death 1, a gene implicated in lupus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nashi, Emil</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Introduction. Programmed Death 1 is a molecule that becomes  expressed on the surface of B and T cells once they are activated. Binding with its  ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 which are found on T cells, antigen-presenting cells and  peripheral tissues, causes inhibition of the PD-1-bearing cell. Knockout of the PD-1  gene in mice causes autoimmune nephritis, arthritis and cardiomyopathy. A study in  humans demonstrated that an intronic SNP, named PD-1.3, is associated with lupus in  several different populations. Studies on whether this polymorphism affects gene  expression proved inconclusive and its biologic significance remains  unknown. Methods. We began by sequencing the gene which led to the  discovery of one previously unreported SNP. Using this and twenty-six publicly  available SNPs, we genotyped ninety individuals. We measured total gene expression  by real-time PCR on cDNA from EBV-immortalized B cells. We tested for allelic  imbalance by fluorescence polarization. As a preliminary test for alternate  splicing, PCR was done on cDNA using primers that covered the exons adjacent to  PD-1.3. Results. We found five polymorphic sites in significant linkage  disequilibrium with PD-1.3. One of these SNPs, PD-1.4, had shown only weak  association with lupus in the above-mentioned study and another of the five is in  complete disequilibrium with PD-1.4. We demonstrated that PD-1.3 lies in a region of  high linkage disequilibrium. None of the twenty-seven polymorphic sites, including  PD-1.3, correlated with gene expression assayed by real-time PCR or allelic  imbalance. We did not demonstrate an association between PD-1.3 and alternate  splicing.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kg898.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418n77q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83kz900"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Comparative binding studies of PAM-2 peptides to the PABC domain, a highly specific peptide binding domain linked to ubiquitin and mRNA metabolism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lim, Shan Nadia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The (Poly(A) Binding Protein C-terminal) PABC domain is found in  the human ubiquitin E3 protein ligase, HYD, an orthologue of the Drosophila  hyperplastic disc (HYD) tumor suppressor protein. The PABC domain is also found in  the poly(A)-binding proteins (PABP), which are ubiquitous RNA binding proteins found  in all eukaryotes. PABPs are implicated in stabilizing mRNA, recruiting translation  factors, and regulating protein synthesis. Although HYD was shown previously to bind  Paip1 (PABP interacting protein 1) in vitro, the function of the PABC domain in  ubiquitin ligases remains unknown. Several PABP binding partners are predicted to  bind to the PABC domain of PABP. These potential binding partners are shown to  contain one or several PABP-interacting motif 2. The PAM-2 motif occurs in different  proteins, which often contain RNA-binding domains. The high sequence and structural  conservation in the PABC domain of hHYD and PABP proteins suggests that the binding  occurs through the residues of PABC the most conserved between the two proteins. The  focus of this study is to further understand the binding of the PABC domain found in  HYD to its interacting peptide binding partners. NMR titration experiments show that  residues A9, K28, M32 and 162 of HYD display the largest shifts upon binding to the  PAM-2 peptides. These residues are likely to be close to the peptide binding site.  ITC titration experiments indicate that hydrophobic interactions and charge  complementarity give rise to the submicromolar affinity measured for PAM-2 peptides.  The existence of different potential C-terminal PABP binding partners, suggests that  the PABC domain plays an important role in modulating the activity of HYD and PABP  by recruiting different binding partners depending on their relative affinities and  different local concentrations.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fc14j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83kz900</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tm55j"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulation of phosphorylation of protein kinace C in neurons</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lim, Travis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Aplysia, persistent increases in synaptic strength are  mediated by persistent activation of protein kinase C.

We characterized phosphorylation of PKC Apl II at a conserved  hydrophobic site, serine 729, with a phosphospecific antibody. Phosphorylation of  S729 increased and persisted 2 hours after serotonin treatment, but did not change  after phorbol ester activation. Furthermore, a serine 729 to alanine mutation  reduced the activity and stability of ApI II. We studied upstream regulation of S729  phosphorylation, and showed that it is affected by both PDK-1 and atypical PKC Apl  III in SF9 cells but not by FRAP or PtdIns3K in neurons. Finally we characterized  atypical PKC Apl III using immunoblotting, and used kinase assays to identify  isoform specific inhibitors for future studies.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r616k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tm55j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agb19f642h"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Adaptive virtual environments in modern multi-player computer games</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lanctot, Marc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most modern computer games provide a virtual environment as a  context for player interaction. Recently, many multi-player online games have  adopted the persistent-state gaming model, which provides a central virtual  environment with essentially infinite lifetime. However, a displeasing part of these  long-lasting environments is that, like their predecessors, they are still assumed  to be static, unchanging even in the long-term. In response to this fact, we  introduce the adaptive virtual environment which automatically adapts based on  activity occurring within the environment. In computer games, adaptive virtual  environments are systems that correspond to real-world physical or social systems.  These systems are computationally formalized by adhering to a generic adaptation  model containing abstract components and procedures. Herein, as a proof of concept,  we design and analyze the behavior of two adaptive versions of such systems commonly  found in persistent-state games. To achieve this, we build an implementation of an  abstract interactive simulator that applies the adaptation process to our example  systems. Each system is internally represented as a plug-in module containing  system-specific implementations of the model's abstractly-defined procedures.  Performance of the adaptation process is then evaluated using simulation data.  Finally, improvements such as optimizations and better movement models for agent  simulation are investigated, and the general usefulness and applicability of the  concepts is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s537q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f642h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
