The poems, although not a cycle, are interrelated in theme, imagery, technique and conception. The prototype of many of the poems is primitive song â€“ poems which describe, accompany, or embody a ritual. Genres include the lullaby, riddle, counting rhyme, dramatic sequence. The content and impact of the poems is as much a function of sound as of meaning; these poems are meant to be recited, chanted, or sung. Strongly rhythmic cadence and a free use of rhyme are usual; this include rhyme of entire repeated lines, and rhyme of ideas in parallel construction. Rhythmic tension is created by asymmetrical stanzas of three, five, and seven lines, used either by themselves, in in combination or alternation with symmetrical stanzas.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reichertz, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73q019p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311s480</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
