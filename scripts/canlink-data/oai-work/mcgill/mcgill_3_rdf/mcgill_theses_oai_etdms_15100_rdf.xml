Administration of a free radical scavenger ameliorates the embryotoxicity of hydroxyurea, suggesting that oxidative stress mediates this toxicity. The goal of this thesis was to test the hypothesis that superoxide, a reactive oxygen species, is involved. Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is an antioxidant enzyme that converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide. To elucidate the role of superoxide in mediating hydroxyurea teratogenicity, dams that were wildtype or hemizygous for hSOD1 were treated on gestation day 9 with saline (control) or hydroxyurea (400 or 600 mg/kg). Fetal death rate and weight were affected similarly by hydroxyurea treatment in litters from wildtype and hemizygous dams. However, fetuses from hemizygote dams exposed to 600 mg/kg hydroxyurea had fewer specific external and skeletal malformations when compared to wildtype dams. These data suggest that superoxide dismutase 1 protects fetuses against specific consequences of oxidative insult during organogenesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h301b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s379n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mice, Transgenic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental -- drug effects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Enzyme Inhibitors -- toxicity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Abnormalities, Drug-Induced -- etiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydroxyurea -- toxicity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Superoxide Dismutase -- genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b591c58d"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The cognitive profile of elderly Korsakoff's syndrome patients</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Konishi, Kyoto</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Korsakoff's syndrome (KS) is characterized by the acute onset of a severe anterograde memory impairment and a less pronounced retrograde amnesia. In addition to deficits in memory, executive function, visuo-spatial abilities, and visuo-perception are impaired. The main structures involved in the neuropathology of KS are the mammillary bodies and the thalamus. It is generally assumed that KS is a stable amnesic condition, and little research has been done in studying the effects of aging on the syndrome. A group of elderly KS patients were evaluated on a large battery of neuropsychological tests to examine general cognitive function, memory, attention, visuo-spatial ability, and executive function. Their performance was compared to age-matched Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls. Results showed that there is an interaction between age and KS, with exaggerated deficits seen in memory and executive function, as well as new deficits in semantic memory. To better understand KS, the thesis provides a review focusing on human, English language studies published between the years 1995 and 2008. Updates on the current findings of treatment and prevention, genetics and prevalence, neuropathology, and neuropsychology including memory and frontal function are provided. In addition, comparison studies of KS to other neurological disorders are summarized.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kp17r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591c58d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Korsakoff Syndrome -- psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cognition Disorders -- psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aged</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak643b460t"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The importance of the intracytoplasmic domain of CD3 epsilon in thymocyte development</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Samantha</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The development of T cells in the thymus is a tightly regulated process. Any defect in thymic differentiation could result in autoimmune disorders, inability to ward off infections or neoplasm. Early thymocyte development requires signals mediated through the preTCR complex by the associated CD3 chains (gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta). Research conducted towards this project has revealed that signaling modules within the intracytoplasmic domain of CD3epsilon is absolutely required for this process. Interestingly, our results emphasized the importance of the proline-rich sequence motif in preTCR mediated signaling events, such as the proliferation of double negative thymocytes and the regulation of TCR surface expression on double positive thymocytes in a stage-specific manner. The outcomes of this project may provide a better understanding of the mechanism of preTCR-mediated thymocyte differentiation and the role of CD3 chains in these processes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xj34d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b460t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cytoplasm -- immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice, Knockout</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thymus Gland -- cytology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antigens, CD3 -- immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cell Differentiation -- immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thymus Gland -- immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A05741w17b"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A computer-aided investigation of cultural representations in media discourse</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bouhid, Souad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this study was to explore cultural representations conveyed in the media discourse using a content-analysis software called ALCESTE.

The two corpora were submitted to ALCESTE software. Using the factorial correspondence analysis of ALCESTE, we identified four different lexical worlds in the corpora of over fifty thousand words. Those lexical worlds correspond to the different positions of the utterers vis-a-vis the issue under study. Specific vocabulary from the lexical worlds were found to convey cultural representations.

The advent of semiconductor nanoparticles known as quantum dots (QDs) has offered the possibility to use this new class of fluorescent probes with very advantageous optical properties in cell biology. The imaging of transmembrane potential and ionic currents is of significant importance for monitoring the activity of the cell. It remains possible with relatively complicated instruments and methods such as patch clamping. A complementary approach to view the dynamics of ion channels with modern and efficient fluorophores is therefore of great interest to the field of biology in general. We developed a construct based on the FRET signal between QDs and organic fluorescent dyes to monitor the conformational changes of voltage gated sodium channels. The amino acid histidine was used as a "landing platform" for QDs and the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac was chosen for testing. This study focused on the preliminary steps of the project and aimed to characterize the electrophysiological behavior of the histidine-tagged channel. The whole-cell configuration of patch clamping was the tool we used to understand the differences between the wild-type and the histidine-tagged variants of the channels. We also explore the possibility to land QDs on the histidine tag.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vv37t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js35f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sodium Channels -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Histidine</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ion Channel Gating</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer -- methods</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fluorescent Dyes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Quantum Dots</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94ht16t"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of a QCM-D based biosensor for detection of waterborne E. coli O157:H7</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poitras, Charles</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The contamination of drinking water by microbial pathogens is recognized as one of the most pressing water supply problems of our day. To minimize the impact of pathogens and parasites on the environment and public health, accurate methods are needed to evaluate their presence and concentration. Although various techniques exist to detect certain pathogens in water (e.g., immunofluorescence or PCR techniques), these are time- and labor-intensive. A direct, real-time method for detection and quantification of target organisms would thus be very useful for rapid diagnosis of water safety. A quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) based biosensor for detection of waterborne pathogens (i.e., Escherichia coli O157:H7) was developed. The detection platform is based on the immobilization of affinity purified antibodies onto gold coated QCM-D quartz crystals via a cysteamine self-assembled monolayer. The results show that the optimal sensor response is the initial slope of the dissipation shift. A highly log-log linear response is obtained for detection of E. coli O157:H7 over a broad range of cell concentration from 3 x 105 to 1 x 109 cells/mL. The prepared biosensor also exhibits a log-log linear working range from 107 to 109 cells/mL for E. coli K12 D21, a non-pathogenic model organism. The biosensor also shows satisfactory selectivity using Bacillus subtilis . To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the use of the slope of the dissipation shift as a sensor response when using QCM-D technology. </dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73q060d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94ht16t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biosensors -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Waterborne infection</dc:subject><dc:subject>Monomolecular films</dc:subject><dc:subject>Escherichia coli O157:H7</dc:subject><dc:subject>Quartz crystal microbalances</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bs88z"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A systematic approach to setting underfrequency relays in electric power systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Qadri, Syed Saadat</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Generation loss contingencies in electric power systems result in a deviation of system frequency from nominal, a condition which must be corrected promptly in order to prevent further degradation of the power system. Automatic load-shedding using underfrequency relays is one of the techniques used to correct abnormal frequency deviations and prevent the risk of uncontrolled outages. If sufficient load is shed following a contingency to preserve interconnections and keep generators on-line, the system can be restored with relative speed and ease. On the other hand, if a declining frequency condition is not dealt with adequately, a cascading disconnection of generating units may develop, leading to a possible total system blackout. This thesis develops and tests a new systematic method for setting underfrequency relays offering a number of advantages over conventional methods. A discretized swing equation model is used to evaluate the system frequency following a contingency, and the operational logic of an underfrequency relay is modeled using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. The proposed approach computes relay settings with respect to a subset of all plausible contingencies for a given system. A method for selecting the subset of contingencies for inclusion in the MILP is presented. The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate that given certain types of degrees of freedom in the relay setting problem, it is possible to obtain a set of relay settings that limits damage or disconnection of generating units for each and every possible generation loss outage in a given system, while attempting to shed the least amount of load for each contingency.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/736668199.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bs88z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Protective relays</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric power systems -- Protection -- Data processing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw66347110"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Multi-objective optimization of an interior permanent magnet motor</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ray, Subhasis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In recent years, due to growing environmental awareness regarding global warming, green cars, such as hybrid electric vehicles, have gained a lot of importance. With the decreasing cost of rare earth magnets, brushless permanent magnet motors, such as the Interior Permanent Magnet Motor, have found usage as part of the traction drive system in these types of vehicles. As a design issue, building a motor with a performance curve that suits both city and highway driving has been treated in this thesis as a multi-objective problem; matching specific points of the torque-speed curve to the desired performance output. Conventionally, this has been treated as separate problems or as a combination of several individual problems, but doing so gives little information about the trade-offs involved.

The starting constituents were placed in quartz ampoules, which were evacuated and sealed before undergoing a vertical-Bridgman growth procedure. Analysis of deposits seen on the ampoule walls and on the ingot surface after growth revealed the presence of Na, as well as various forms of the other starting elements; however, no Na was found within the crystals.

In this work, we designed a sensor system to correctly and efficiently measure plastic sheet temperature and reduce the cost of instrumentation. The thesis consists of three parts. The first part is to optimally distribute IR sensors and virtual sensors in order to minimize the number of IR sensor and keep an acceptable accuracy on estimation of virtual sensors under the design constrain. Since IR sensor measurements may be inaccurate due to physical faults during the process, the second part is the sensor faults detection and isolation (FDI) to automatically detect and isolate the faulty sensors. In most situations the faulty sensors cannot be fixed immediately during process or production. Therefore, the last part is to use virtual sensors to replace the faulty IR sensors in order to keep production going. The thesis project continues the work at the Industrial Automation Lab on sheet reheat phase in thermoforming. While the system model was changed into a larger scale, the modeling methodology and linearization assumption are the same as the previous work, which were verified. As a result, the system model and linearized model can be considered as valid. As the whole project is only based on simulation, the measurement errors may become larger for the practical application.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085p68r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214s69h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Thermoforming</dc:subject><dc:subject>Infrared detectors</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440x33b"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A comparison of permanent magnet motor structures for traction drive applications in hybrid electric vehicles</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Han, Lin, 1982-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a detailed comparison of the torque-speed characteristics of three permanent magnet synchronous machine designs based on how the magnets are mounted.

Relative strengths and limitations of different PM machine types are highlighted.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290f06g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440x33b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Permanent magnet motors -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Traction drives -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nm73t"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Coupled simulation of an indirect field oriented controlled induction motor drive</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Legesse, Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Conventionally, system simulations of induction motor drives use lumped parameters model of the motor. This approach assumes motor parameters to be constant during the entire operation of the drive. Unfortunately, these are known to vary significantly over the operating range of the motor due to factors such as magnetic saturation, skin effects, and operating temperature. The variations in motor parameters affect motor output and control parameters resulting in degraded drive performance. One way of overcoming this problem is by coupling the field model of the induction motor with the drive simulation. By replacing the lumped parameters model with the field model, the influence of different operating conditions on motor parameters can be taken into account dynamically. In this thesis such an approach is investigated by coupling the finite element analysis of an induction motor with the system simulation of the field oriented controlled drive. The results obtained for the coupled simulation are promising and possible future works to make this method of simulation more accurate and reliable are recommended.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jx95w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nm73t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electric current converters -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric motors, Induction -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric motors, Induction -- Computer simulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Finite element method</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7h149t10p"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Influence of dissolved oxygen on the physicochemical properties and migration behavior of selected bacterial pathogens</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Castro A., Felipe (Castro Arancibia), 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Protection of potable water supplies demands a better understanding of the factors controlling migration of disease causing bacteria in subsurface environments. In this study, the migration behaviour of the waterborne pathogenic microorganisms Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Yersinia enterocolitica was investigated in water saturated granular systems. Both facultative bacteria were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and further acclimatized to a microaerophilic or fully aerated environment for 21 h. Experiments were conducted using laboratory-scale packed columns over controlled extreme dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. The observed differences in the transport potential of these pathogens were found to depend strongly on the antecedent growth conditions under the tested environmental settings as well with the environmental DO in certain conditions. Further microbial characterization using cell titrations and FTIR spectroscopy gave a greater insight on the source of the surface charge that was found to dominate the attachment phenomena in sand packed columns. Techniques also revealed a probable role of other cell surface macromolecules (LPS) that could account for non-DLVO behaviour. The results illustrate the importance of considering physicochemical conditions relevant to the natural subsurface environment when designing laboratory transport experiments as evidenced by variations in microbe migration as a function of the DO under growth and acclimation.

The author herself ascribes a certain instrumental role to literature; through her fictional narratives, Agnant bears witness to the collective experiences of women in Haiti and also of female Haitian immigrants in Montreal. What, then, of the function or literary value of her work? This thesis responds to this question through the study of three works by Marie-Celie Agnant: La Dot de Sara (1995), Le Livre d'Emma (2001), and Le Silence comme le sang (1997). The analysis of the complex relationship between testimony and fiction in Agnant's writing leads to a reflection on the specific character of socially impelled female literature: women writers are driven by the imperative of memory and the desire to convey their occulted history.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kr56j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fm681</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reportage literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agnant, Marie-Célie -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50tw080"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Norm entrepreneurship : Canada's tips to tipping</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kennedy, Christine, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although the influence of normative ideas on the behaviour of states occupy an evermore significant place in political science and international relations, important questions remain with respect to how international norms come into existence. International norm scholars have been criticized for failing to demonstrate how actors might forge and change norms. How do norm entrepreneurs influence the process of norm development? Further, under what conditions are norm entrepreneurs likely to be successful in norm diffusion? To begin answering these questions, this paper draws on constructivist insights to present a model of norm evolution highlighting the role of the norm entrepreneur and conducts an interpretive case study methodology to provide an empirical illustration. It examines the evolution of the "Responsibility to Protect" (R2P) norm with particular attention to the norm entrepreneurial role of Canadian foreign policy to highlight how norm-building processes are inextricably intertwined with agents who are engaged in fostering nonnative change. The R2P is considered to be a nonnative breakthrough in international relations and has emerged as an important instrument for upholding and promoting human security. While Canada has been praised for its leadership in promulgating the R2P, there is little empirical scholarship that links the development process of the R2P norm to Canadian foreign policy. How has Canada, with no demonstrative material capability, been able to advance the R2P on the international stage? This thesis develops an understanding of how agents can shape an international norm by acting as a "tipping agent" in the process of norm creation. It concludes by identifying the possibilities and limitations of norm entrepreneurs to influence world politics.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977z497.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tw080</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social norms</dc:subject><dc:subject>Normativity (Ethics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- Foreign relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>International relations -- Moral and ethical aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Security, International</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623h063"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Italian</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Melancholy and the modern consciousness of Francesco Petrarca : a close reading of melancholy, acedia, and love-sickness in the Secretum, De Remediis Utriusque Fortunae and Canzoniere</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zampini, Tania</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The most important classical Greek heroes were believed to suffer from a physical, mental, and spiritual illness shown negatively to alter their general state of being. Attributed to an excess of black bile in the body, the earliest documented form of this ailment came to be known as "melancholy;" paramount among its effects was the emergence of a severely split being sincerely pursuing Virtue, yet markedly susceptible to the Passions that threatened to veer him off his course. In the Middle Ages, traces of melancholy are found in the sin of acedia still today considered a rather "medieval" vice. Globally defined as a state of "general apathy," acedia was believed more egregiously to affect solitary religious figures devoted to prayer. The dawn of Humanism in Western Europe, however, saw this notion extended to the more general scholar, and featured as (arguably) its first protagonist, 14 th-century humanist Francesco Petrarca. The manifestations of this malady pervade his oeuvre as a whole: repeatedly in his immense repertoire, Petrarch - at least in his proliferation of an artistic or lyrical "io" or self--surfaces as a fragmented if not strictly binary figure both tormented by his incumbent passions and resolutely determined to overcome them. Petrarch's often autobiographical figures are ruled by conflicting inner forces which leave them paralysed, indecisive, and helpless before Fortune, in a new position foreshadowing the anthropocentric and, to a degree, "bipartite" "modernity" soon to flood the continent. Through a close reading of three of his most celebrated texts - the Secretum, De Remediis Utriusque Fortunae, and the Canzoniere, this study will seek to posit Petrarch as a fundamentally melancholic and "accidioso" writer whose condition of internal and social rupture more generally speaks to the emerging "crisis of modernity" which he perhaps first sets to the center stage of his period.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b693g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623h063</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Petrarca, Francesco, 1304-1374.

I focus on the contemporary conflict between the French state, and the substantial population considered "foreign" within France. This tension has regularly exploded into physical confrontation, most notably in the fall of 2005, though violence has been a persistent feature of the urban periphery for more than two decades. Moreover, tensions within France have often been co-opted into a larger "East vs. West" discourse, and this complex relationship is folded into an international conflict to which it may not belong. With this in mind, the project undertakes a thorough analysis of these complexities as they exist in France, proposing finally a means of transforming the conflict from violent to non-violent through a new theory of mediation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483n69n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jq20n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mediation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Conflict management</dc:subject><dc:subject>France -- Ethnic relations</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278x872"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The bear at the boundary : carnival and community in Prats de Mollo</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Campbell, Jennifer, 1983-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explores the symbolic and sensory dimensions of local carnival celebrations in the southern French village of Prats de Mollo. During carnival an ideal, locally-rooted Prateen community is articulated and experienced by participants through repeated acts of commensality and physical displays of friendship that are intensified by carnival's sensual indulgences and ritual interactions in public space. The aesthetic dimensions of carnival festivities in Prats de Mollo thus reflect an enduring desire for experiences of belonging that are deeply implicated in and informed by an affective relationship between self, community, and place, but that are at the same time in dialogue with a number of wider social processes currently shaping daily life in Prats de Mollo. These include the continued urbanization of rural areas in the Pyrenees, contemporary negotiations of French and Catalan identities in France, and increasing tourism in the region.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nf61t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278x872</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste (France)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carnivals -- France -- Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35tc74d"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Un homme obscur de Marguerite Yourcenar : pour une poétique de l'effacement</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Allnutt, Vanessa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An Obscure Man by Marguerite Yourcenar is the novelist's heritage to posterity. By Yourcenar's own admission, it constitutes her spiritual and literary testament. In this novel, her poetics of self-effacement reaches its culminating point, where Nathanael is portrayed as a protagonist free of any constraints because he exhibits no desire or ambition. The author paints a character who incarnates a constant passive state. But by doing so, one could argue that it is the work of fiction itself that is put into question, as Nathanael's triviality and insignificance --- hence his exemplary conduct --- represents a great threat to the novel as an ontological entity with its own set of rules. And so we ask: for a writer whose aesthetics are closely tied to ethics, particularly to those higher values of lucidity and humility peculiar to Yourcenar's philosophy, does the novel still have a claim to existence? In other words, if there is no illusion, what is left of the novel?</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988p412.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tc74d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Yourcenar, Marguerite.

This thesis scrutinizes the causes of this popularity. After a review of the diverse existing methods in popular music research, three modes of analysis are presented. First, the study shown here describes the song through a music-theoretical approach; it observes the rules governing the voice, the melody, the rhythm, the phrases, the bass, the tonality, the chords, and the instruments used, supported by a precise transcription of the song. Then, this paper studies the musical codes that are found in "Montreal". In this section, the musical message of the piece is analyzed, while taking in consideration the sociohistorical context of the Summer of 2006, the national history that preceded the release of this piece, and the lyrics of the song. Finally, this study investigates the issue of national identity in Quebec, the place of "Montreal" into the collective imagination of Quebeckers, and the popular music tradition of the province.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd473094j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x475t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Moffatt, Ariane.

Switch design for packet-switched optical networks is particularly challenging, in part due to the lack of a practical optical memory system. As a result, optical labels and all-optical label processing have attracted much attention. This thesis examines a crucial label processing component of an optical packet switch, namely the label swapper. In this thesis, three different tabletop topologies for low-cost all-optical swapping of spectral amplitude code labels for packet-switched networks are examined in a proof-of-concept phase. The first uses cross-absorption modulation in an electro-absorption modulator within a semiconductor fiber ring laser (SFRL), the second uses cross-gain modulation (XGM) in a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) within an SFRL, and the third makes use of XGM in a SOA as well as injection locking in a Fabry-Perot laser diode for wavelength conversion. The benefits and limitations of each approach as well as future improvements are discussed. Building on these results, a high-performance integrated version of XGM swapper is designed, simulated, and masks are produced for fabrication using indium phosphide technology.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hw18j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77st55x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Packet switching (Data transmission)</dc:subject><dc:subject>MPLS standard</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer networks</dc:subject><dc:subject>Optical communications</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
