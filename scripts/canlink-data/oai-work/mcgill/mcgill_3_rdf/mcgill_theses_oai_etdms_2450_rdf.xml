Concurrent Engineering (CE), a new methodology and a systematic approach to the integrated design of products and related processes including manufacture and support is ideal, for this environment. Organizations implement CE to achieve specific goals. This thesis focuses on the goals of time, cost and quality for implementing CE. The existence of specific models or methods of implementation of CE for specific goals has been investigated and metrics for specific models classified. Case studies of organizations implementing CE are outlined and differences in implementations pointed out. Organizations focusing on time put. more emphasis on stages/activities between detailed specification and detailed design stages in a CE NPD process. Organizations focusing on quality and cost put more emphasis on the stages/activities between preliminary design and volume production. Metrics for CE processes targeting specific goals have also been classified. However, it has been found that metrics are not restricted to specific goals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thomson, Vince</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sc52t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161835r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p6887"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Monocrystalline CulnSe2 photovoltaic cells with a CdO window layer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Al-Quraini, Abdulmuti Awni</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Photovoltaic cells having the structures CuInSe2-CdO and CuInSe 2-CdS-CdO have been fabricated on a cut or cleaved p-type Bridgman-grown CuInSe2 ingot. The CdO window layer in both cases was deposited by dc reactive sputtering. In the CuInSe2-CdS-CdO structures, the CdS interlayer was deposited by a solution growth method and these cells, incorporating the CdS interlayer, yielded a conversion efficiency of about 6.9%. By comparison, the cell with the structure CuInSe2-CdO, where the lattice mismatch between the CuInSe2 and the CdO is some 23%, showed a surprising efficiency of 6.8%. This result, indicating that the defect centers at the CuInSe2-CdO interface arising from the large lattice mismatch, play a smaller role than expected, suggests that the seat of photovoltaic action may lie away from the substrate-window layer interface as a buried homojunction within the CuInSe2. While the conversion efficiencies Of the two kinds of cells were similar, there were slight differences in their other characteristics whereby the device without the CdS interlayer had a higher illuminated open circuit voltage, lower short circuit current density, higher forward ideality factor above 2 and higher internal series resistance. The acceptor concentration of the stoichiometrically-prepared CuInSe 2 was estimated to be about 1017 cm-3 in the bulk of the wafers but almost an order of magnitude smaller than this near the surface after annealing in argon. Using the photocurrent-capacitance method, minority electron diffusion lengths in the CuInSe2 were estimated to be about 3 mum for the devices made with cleaved substrates and about half this value for the cells made with abrasively-polished substrates.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Champness, C.

Although not traditionally used as a modifier, calcium also has the potential to modify the eutectic silicon in Al-Si alloys. Metallographic observation and thermal analysis studies in A357 alloy indicate that. when the cooling rate is quite low. Ca modifies the eutectic silicon. but the effect of Ca as a modifier is not as strong as is Na or Sr. When the cooling rate is high, a fully modified structure can be obtained with calcium. Recovery of Ca in the melt is high and certain. It does not fade with long holding times. Moreover, a premodified ingot can be used, and even when such all ingot is remelted repeatedly there is no calcium loss. Calcium does increase porosity in castings. In general modification treatment with Ca improves mechanical properties, especially elongation. Calcium adversely interacts with strontium and reduces the ability of strontium as a modifier. Microstructural and thermal analysis studies show that Ca has a deleterious effect on Sr-modified castings and vice versa.

Supervisor support, and the effectiveness of family-friendly work place policies were explored. All agreed, that motherhood, has had a positive impact on practice including increased empathy and understanding, for both parents and children. The following workplace initiatives were determined to be helpful: flexible and predictable work hours; part-time options; and compressed-work-week. Despite half feeling unsupported by their supervisors, the majority indicated that they are managing well primarily due to flexible work hour scheduling. The attitude of supervisors, regarding the value of parenting, appears to be the key factor relating to their level of support. There was some indication of role conflict and much evidence of accommodation, including turning down supervisory/management positions, postponing education and restricting types of practice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Davies, Linda</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t848f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vw178</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Working mothers -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Work and family -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women social workers -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405sc533"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>British alterations to the palace-complex of Shâhjahânâbâd</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mahmood, Shahid</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Built on the ruins of earlier cities, the Mughal Emperor Shahjahan founded Shahjahanabad in 1639.

Continuing the traditional relationship to the theatre as well as to the harmonic proportions of the orders although recast in terms of the century in which he wrote, Le Camus uses the paradigm of the theatre as the space of reception for his architecture. Definitively establishing the conventions and taste of the theatre in eighteenth century France, Denis Diderot's The Paradox of Acting established the role of the poetic genius in relation to his or her audience. The relationship to the audience as enabled by the conventions of good taste allows for an understanding of Le Camus' unique analogy of architecture and the sensations, giving to his architecture the ability to provide a cathartic morality as put forth by Diderot.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558j48g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zw677</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Le Camus de Mézières, Nicolas, 1721-1789</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diderot, Denis, 1713-1784</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht90v"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The relocation of squatter settlements in Brasília</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Oliveira, Marcio N.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates the causes and consequences of intra-urban relocation of squatter settlements. The process of removal and resettlement of land invasions is analyzed in the light of past and contemporary experiences within the context of the developing countries, and a theoretical background is presented as a support for the main argument of the study. The urban network of Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, was selected as case study to illustrate the use of resettlement as a planning instrument and to discuss the impact that such undertakings bring upon the relocated communities. The study demonstrates how the development style adopted by the local government, which combines clearance and relocation of squatter settlements with a strong emphasis on peripheral development, has resulted in the formation of a highly dissociating environment, in which the practice of land invasion has become the primary strategy of poor dwellers to achieve land tenure.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Vikram</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cn07s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht90v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Squatter settlements -- Brazil -- Brasília</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jr01d"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The secret mission of Noel Buxton to Bulgaria, September, 1914-January, 1915</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zienius, Charles Raymond</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is devoted to an unsuccessful mission to Sofia undertaken in the fall of 1914 by Noel Buxton, a Liberal British M.P., who aimed to win Bulgaria over to the side of the Triple Entente.

Some, like Karol Berger, have pointed to ideological influences of the Polish emigration in Paris, while others, like James Parakilas, have given credit to the generic characteristics of the European literary ballad. In my own view, however, the most salient extra-musical factor in the background to Chopin's Ballades are Ballady, a series of poems by the 19th century Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. After Chopin's death, Mickiewicz's Ballady were frequently associated with Chopin's Ballades, and in the first chapter I demonstrate this by examining the reception history of these works. In the next chapter I analyze the ideology of the Polish emigration in Paris, including prominent themes of alienation, powerlessness, morbid anxiety, pilgrimage, and nostalgia, which were used by that expatriate society to identify itself. Finally, in the third chapter, I trace analogies between these themes and their manifestations in Mickiewicz's Ballady. This analysis of Mickiewicz's poems forms the basis of my interpretation of Chopin's Second Ballade, where I discuss how certain textual and thematic features of the poems taken as a group can be mapped onto the form and musical discourse of the piano piece. In sum, although the associations between specific poems and Chopin's Ballades have been made by many authors, no one has distilled a single narrative archetype from the group of Mickiewicz's Ballady to apply to Chopin's works.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Huebner, Steven</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f574t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hm352</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chopin, Frédéric, 1810-1849.

Although he grew up in traditionalist circles, his experience studying at this institution and in Arabia, in conjunction with his wide reading on various subjects, gave him an open attitude to innovation, particularly in the field of education. The backwardness of pesantren graduates in mastering secular sciences, compared to those who graduated from the Dutch schools, inspired him to modernize the pesantren system. The introduction of the madrasah into the pesantren system, an institution designed to offer courses in the secular sciences as well as on Islam, was evidence of his progressive aim to enhance the quality of Muslim education, and the traditionalist version in particular. In the political arena, he played a significant role in the struggle for independence and the development of modern Indonesia. Known as a prominent leader who had a close contacts with kyais through the pesantren network, he was able to mobilize Indonesian Muslims against colonial rule. His moderate attitude, which colored his political behavior, was vital to efforts at achieving compromise and at bridging the differences between traditionalists on the one hand and modernists as well as secular nationalists on the other.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Federspiel, Howard M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s1618361.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354h50z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Indonesia -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islamic education -- Indonesia -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Educational change -- Indonesia -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hasyim, A.

Experimental groups (n = 62) from one urban and two suburban secondary schools participated in the four day 175 minute Looking Good...Feeling Great! program, while control groups (n = 37) from the same schools followed their regular academic schedules. All participants completed TestwellTM (National Wellness Institute, Inc., 1994), a wellness inventory for high school students, as a pretest, one week later as a posttest, and one and one half months later as a follow-up test. Student focus groups and teacher interviews were conducted after the posttest. Results showed that (a) experimental group wellness scores significantly increased from pretest to posttest (ES = .22), (b) experimental groups maintained their increased wellness levels one and one half months following completion of the program (ES = .24), and (c) there was no significant effect of gender on experimental group wellness scores, although females scored significantly higher than males overall. In general, students and teachers conveyed favourable impressions of the program. However, somewhat negative impressions of the program from the students and teacher at the urban secondary school imply that this type of school may benefit from a wellness program that better suits the needs of its constituents. The results indicate that the Looking Good...Feeling Great! program can be an effective tool in helping adolescents acquire healthy lifestyles through the enhancement of wellness levels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Downey, Margaret J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903205g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62fb563</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>High schools -- Health promotion services -- Québec (Province) -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>High school students -- Health and hygiene -- Québec (Province) -- Case studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9k41zg65k"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Bābī movement in Iran : from religious dissent to political revolt, 1844-1853</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fuad, Ahmad Nur</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a study of the development of the Babi movement and the political implications embodied in its religious teachings.

In the course of history, however, and especially after the Bab, its founder, claimed in 1848 to be the return of the Hidden Imam and proclaimed the abrogation of Qur'anic shari'a, the Babi movement showed radical tendencies, thus threatening the established religious and political authorities. This later development (1848--1853) was characterized by armed revolts by the Babis against the government troops.

Subjects were 422 male hockey players, consisting of NHL entry draft (n = 310), minor league professional (n = 59) and NHL professional (n = 53) players. Results revealed that when drafted, physiological profiles of players who reach the NHL were significantly different from non-NHL players. Players that eventually made the NHL tended to be heavier and had higher peak power (W), mean power (W), VO2max (L/min), grip strength and leg power. The fitness variables in the test battery had low predictive power to identify players who played in the NHL. Physiological profiles of forwards were significantly different from defense. Defense were taller, heavier, and fatter than forwards. Defense had higher peak power (W), grip strength and leg power compared to forwards.

Through an examination of twentieth century texts (including fiction, autobiography and Freudian case studies), I demonstrate the effects of subjective compliance with disembodied discourses. Using psychoanalytic theory, I ask: What are the ethical limits of interpretation within the psychoanalysis and literary criticism? And what alternative strategies of intersubjective exchange could we employ that would aspire to avoid instances of such hermeneutic tyranny? Further, what evidence is there that the subject, in the face of overwhelming discursive compliance, continues attempting to realize its ontological status? My hypothesis is that while theory (i.e. discourse) may prove beneficial to the subject, it should not endeavour to prevent the subject itself from Being. Taking subjective ontology, and not liberation or self-representation, as the primary goal of interpretation, I explore means by which we may provide "good enough facilitating environments" for the subject.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>De-Munchy, Marike Finlay</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b328v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301352x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Criticism (Philosophy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Discourse analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ontology in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c281q"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An examination of Bint al-Shāṭi'́s method of interpreting the Qurʾān</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Syamsuddin, Sahiron</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is devoted to the study of Bint al-Shat&amp;dotbelow;i''s method of interpreting the Qur'an. The problems of consistency in terms of her hermeneutical theory and of the application of this method represent the focus of the study. It furthermore discusses her attitude towards tendentious and i'jaz-misoriented interpretations of the Qur'an, of which both classical and modern exegetes are guilty in her eyes. Secondly, it studies how she applies her method in specific situations. The cross-referential method, and the concept of irtibat&amp;dotbelow; (interrelation between verses) are two major points to be analyzed. Finally, it also discusses her theory concerning the asbab al-nuzul (occasions of revelation), and its application. Using phenomenological, comparative and analytical methods of analysis, and by means of primary and secondary sources, the thesis concludes that Bint al-Shat&amp;dotbelow;i' in many cases is not consistent in applying the method she established.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boullata, Issa J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mf04m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c281q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bint al-Shāṭiʾ</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526f43k"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Al-Shahrastānī and the Shīʻī doctrine of Imāma : an analysis of the views expressed in his al-Milal wa al-Niḥal and Nihāyat al-Iqdām fī ʻIlm al-Kalām</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Syamsiyatun, Siti</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study seeks to analyze the views of al-Shahrastani (479/1086--548/1153) on the issue of Shi`i imama as presented in his works al-Milil wa al-Nih&amp;dotbelow;al and Nihayat al-Iqdam fi `Ilm al-Kalam. In each of these he devotes several chapters to a discussion of the leadership of the Shi`i community since the days of `Ali b. Abi T&amp;dotbelow;alib. The study shows that both books under discussion were designed by al-Shahrastani to serve different purposes and were composed according to different methodologies. He takes completely different approaches to his treatment of Shi`i doctrine in al-Milal and the Nihaya. Acting as a "historian of religion" in al-Milal, the author shows considerable objectivity and avoids passing judgement. He supports his account of Shi`ism with arguments acknowledged by the Shi`is themselves. This is because al-Shahrastani intended al-Milal as a scientific and systematic account of religions. However, as a "theologian" he held certain of his own beliefs regarding several doctrinal problems, which he also wished to make it public. It was to serve this purpose that the Nihaya was composed. Furthermore, in this work the author does not hesitate to attack opinions different from his own, including the doctrine of imama.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ormsby, Eric L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kj45m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s7526f43k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Imamate</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shahrastānī, Muḥammad ibn ʻAbd al-Karīm, 1086?-1153.

It argues that impediment intrinsic to the narrative text affects the enunciative process of the work on various levels. The workings of impediment in Vechnyi muzh are examined on the levels of theme, genre---both in universal and historical terms---and narration. Frustrated reader expectation, uncertainty, and disorientation are shown to be symptomatic of impediment due to three factors: (1) thematic ambiguity on the basis of Dostoevskii's subversion in Vechnyi muzh of the theme of adultery, and of the cuckold motif; (2) genre ambivalence arising from mixed genre signals embedded in the text; (3) inhibited narrative assessment due to restrained narrative technique, and limited narrative perspective.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bevaha, Laura</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x131d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km85g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821-1881.

Examining music scenes in Montreal as well as New Zealand music fans in North America, the following is a consideration of the construction of cultural communities across the globe it offers an analysis of the depth and scope of their interactions and how a range of cultural values and meanings are produced, distributed and consumed within those communities. Rather than seeing subcultures as geographically located in specific and discrete locales, I aim to illustrate how the various networks connecting them (whether they be affective alliances or computer-mediated communications) have in many ways realigned these communities along axes which differ from those proposed by earlier subcultural theories.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Straw, Will</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096934b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s7526f44v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rock music -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rock music -- New Zealand</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rock music -- Social aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Subculture -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rock music -- Social aspects -- New Zealand</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j333448f"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Beyond the anti-aesthetic</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Spičanović, Vladimir</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a critical examination of postmodernist pedagogy currently used in the education of visual artists. It is particularly concerned with the teaching of the traditional disciplines of painting and drawing within a postmodern context. My hypothesis is that the teaching of visual arts within a postmodern orientation more or less relies on an anti-aesthetic stance that is content-centered, with an insistence on critically and politically aware art. The overall objective of this thesis is twofold: First, to generate some questions and ideas that could be of assistance to post-secondary art instructors. Second, to establish a framework for an extended qualitative research that will address the impact of postmodernism on education of artists. The title "beyond the anti-aesthetic" does not necessarily present itself as a negation of the postmodernist paradigm. It identifies a need to revitalize visual art instruction within the postmodern model, to re-address the interplay between form and content in visual art and enhance critical thinking.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>White, Boyd</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj44k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333448f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aesthetics, Modern -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Art -- Study and teaching -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Postmodernism and education</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arb68xd91r"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Portrait de W., suivi de, L'oeuvre du souvenir</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Soucy, Linda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The first part of this M.A. thesis is composed of four stories whose common thread is memory.

This formula is analyzed with regard to the feminist critique of pornography and the assertions of gay advocates. Although the Falcon formula supports the feminist perspective with respect to the representations of sex practices, the linkage between femininity and getting fucked, as indicated by Dworkin, was not found in the selected Falcon videos. In fact, Falcon videos subvert this linkage by depicting masculine men fucking other masculine men. And, in accord with the claims of gay advocates, Falcon videos largely represent gay men having sex as opposed to straight men having homosexual sex. The Falcon formula appears to have developed not only in reaction to stigmatizing stereotypes of effeminate gay men and in reaction to the linkage between femininity and getting fucked, but also in response to the fantasy (of gay viewers) of being accepted into an exclusively male community.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rains, Prue</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tf22s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pc697</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sex in popular culture</dc:subject><dc:subject>Erotic videos</dc:subject><dc:subject>Masculinity in popular culture</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gay men -- Sexual behavior</dc:subject><dc:subject>Falcon Studios</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dh846"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A Chinese model of cognition : the Neiye, fourth century B.C.E.</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Simonis, Fabien</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This is an attempt at construing descriptions of cognitive activities found in the Neiye, an early Chinese text (fourth century BCE) preserved in the Guanzi compilation. Through the notions of metaphor and cognitive model, and by means of hermeneutic principles developed by George Lakoff and other theorists, I scrutinize the text, trying to unravel the peculiar understanding of the cognitive functioning of the body upon which it is predicated. I focus on four words: xin (heart), shen (spirit), qi (breath), and qing (emotions). As a result of this enquiry, the physicality of cognitive activities in the Neiye stands out clearly. The importance of the body in cognitive activities should appear as clearly in translations if we want to get closer to the Chinese understanding of their own writings instead of reading them through categories which only make sense in our own constructed reality, our Lebenswelt.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yates, Robin D.
