E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As war approached, Kemalist Turkey sought safety through collective security arrangements. Despite her proclamation of non-belligerency in 1939, she remained during the first phase of the world conflict a willing ally of Britain and France. In the second period she became increasingly cautious, and in the third (that of the Axis zenith) she embraced neutrality. From early in 1943 until the declaration of war, she returned to a pro-Allied partiality, although this was much complicated by Russian presence among the Allies. Indeed, throughout the war her main fear was of Soviet imperialism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Callard, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204274h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q525m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islamic Studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
