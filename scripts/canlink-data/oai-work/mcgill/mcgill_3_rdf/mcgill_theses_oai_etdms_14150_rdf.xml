Early observations of occasional "neuroparalytic" accidents following immunization with rabies vaccine containing nervous tissue antigens gave rise to speculations that immunological reactions could lead to clinical disease (Stuart, 1925). In subsequent years, neurological syndromes following inoculation of various vaccines, injections of foreign serum or associated with certain infectious diseases such as measles have become increasingly recognized (Miller, Stanton and Gibbons, 1956). These hypersensitivity reactions affect various parts of the nervous system resulting in encephalitis, myelitis or neuritis. In addition, many spontaneously occurring neurological disorders such as the Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (Melnick, 1963) and neurological complications associated with the collagen disorders are suspected of being the result of hypersensitivity reactions (Gell and Coombs, 1964).

Such variations have commonly been related to the physiochemical and cytochemical organization of the nucleolus. Specifically, the nucleolus has been considered an organelle of extreme plasticity, consisting of an apparently homogeneous ground substance (nucleolar matrix) which occasionally contains one or more vesicles (intranucleolar vacuoles or nucleolini). Relevant cytochemical and biochemical studies have indicated that these structural phases are composed of acid and basic proteins and RNA in the form of ribonucleoproteins. In brief, the classical concept of nucleolar structure recognized two intranucleolar structural phases -- nucleolar matrix and intranucleolar vacuoles -- composed of nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (reviews, Montgomery, 1898; Oates, 1942; Vincent, 1955; Stich, 1956; Hertl, 1957; Swift, 1959; Sirlin, 1962; Busch et al, 1963).

Although many studies in the past have shown that differences in environment result in differences in I.Q., as measured by conventional intelligence tests, there has been less research measuring environmental effects on learning and transfer abilities. The typical approachof studies which deal with either differences in intelligence, or in learning and transfer abilities, has been to select subjects from different environments and, by testing, demonstrate significant differences in the ability in question. Using this method, the results invariably favor subjects from whichever is the "better" environment in the study. The present study treats environment as an independant variable, holding I.Q. constant, and attempts to show differences in transfer ability, the dependent variable, under these conditions. On the basis of the theoretical considerations and empirical results reviewed below, it was hypothesized that, with I.Q. held constant,children raised in a "restricted" environment would show greater facility for transfer than children from a "free" environment.

Examples are given for the determination of large (to 2000 m2jg) and small (200 cm2/g - 1 m2/g) specific surfaces. A gravimetric McBain-Bakr micro balance is incorporated in the B.E.T. apparatus for the determination of the adsorption isotherms of hexyl mercaptan vapour on synthetic sphalerite, zinc sulphide and zinc oxide. Adsorption isotherms are given for hexyl mercaptan on synthetic sphalerite at 25¬∞C, 0.5¬∞C and 50¬∞C; on zinc sulphide at 25¬∞C and 1.5¬∞C and on zinc oxide at 25¬∞C. All these isotherms are sigmoidal with a definite change in slope at the monolayero The amount of mercaptan adsorbed after the monolayer increases almost linearly with relative pressure to P/P0 = 0.8. Above this value the amount adsorbed increases very rapidly vrith relative pressure. Hysteresis loops appear in the isotherms for all adsorption-desorption cycles. These loops are completely reversible. It is not possible to desorb the mercaptan monolayer from any of the adsorbents even at elevated temperatures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Robertson, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z4281.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97kt84v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mining Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r659x"><ual:graduationDate>1965</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Inelastic pion-nucleus scattering</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Saif-Ud-Din</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the near future it is expected that one will have large enough fluxes of charged pions such that these mesons will make good nuclear probes.

The first typical case of oesophageal atresia with tracheo-oesophageal fistula was recognized by Thomas Gibson (2) in 1697. Since then an increasing number of reports appeared. In 1861 Hirschsprung (3) presented 10 cases of oesophageal atresia in 1880 Mackenzie (4) collected 37 cases, in 1919 Plass (5) collected cases reported to that date numbering 136. Rosenthal (6) in 1931 reviewed the world literature pertaining to the subject and collected 255 cases. In the last 25 years the malformation has been recognized with increasing frequency and numerous large series have appeared in the literature. Attention has been centered not only on the correct diagnosis but also on the surgical treatment of this anomaly. Varied concepts of surgical approach and a large body of experimental work have found their way into the medical journals.

The involvement is inevitable insofar as the process of occupational choice has its roots back in childhood when the child is very much under the control and influence of the parents. The process of socialization interacts with the process of occupational choice, and it is the purpose of this study to trace some of the interconnections between the two processes. It will examine parental perceptions of the child, of the kinds of choices that should be made, of the various mechanisms available to parents as means of influencing their sons and of those means which they actually employ in order that their influence be felt.

The focal point of the analysis is an examinatian of the various Burmese societal interests and their respective foreign policy demands.1 The methodology employed defines Burma's societal interest groupings in terms of ideology, interests, and objectives, While providing a functional mode! for the understanding of Burmese political processes. Foreign policy demands are to be classified as to bilateral relations with neighbours, to the Southern Asian international system, and to the global state system. The purpose of this study is to discover the socio-political mainsprings of the foreign policy demands articulated by both incumbent and competing societal interests.
