Different types of eye movements are investigated including microsaccades, eye fixation, and eye pursuit. First, we demonstrate that microsaccades occur during pursuit and they are linked to covert attention shifts. Employing a psychophysical task that involves covert attention shifts to a peripheral square, we detect if microsaccades occur during eye pursuit, and, if so, whether, and in what way, microsaccades are related to attention shifts. Microsaccades are found to occur during pursuit and they present in similar patterns as those occurring during eye fixation. We discover that microsaccades tend to be biased towards the same direction as pursuit and the bias increases with increases of pursuit velocities. Through the analysis of microsaccade orientation and latency, we argue that microsaccades occurring during pursuit, rather than being randomly distributed, have a link with covert attention shifts. This is consistent with what has been reported for microsaccades occurring during fixation. Further analysis of microsaccade amplitude supports this argument. The potential attention mechanisms for the characteristics of microsaccades are discussed. We suggest that the attention allocation during pursuit is responsible for the characteristics of microsaccades. Our analyses of microsaccades also enforce the argument that microsaccades may be the suppressed saccades. In addition to microsaccades, the attention allocation during eye fixation and eye pursuit are considered as well. We demonstrate that, during eye fixation, the local image content around the area of a fixation point is a significant factor to influence the fixation duration. However, during pursuit, the pursuit direction, rather than image contents, is important to decide attention allocation. According to these results, a top-down attention model based on types of eye movements is built. Three types of eye movements are considered separately in the model. They are eye fixation, eye pursuit, and saccadic eye movements (including microsaccades). The model is applied to the design of an interactive 2D video game. We demonstrate that the game is successfully designed in different difficulty levels through the analysis of attention allocation by our attention model. Our results imply that the attention modeling can be used to alter the game play so as to provide varying difficulty levels and it is also promising to take advantage of eye tracking data for broader applications, such as for navigation, intelligent map searching, augmented reality, and others.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967709d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b218p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eye -- Movements</dc:subject><dc:subject>Visual perception -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Attention</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gr77j"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Terminal iterative learning for cycle-to-cycle control of industrial processes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gauthier, Guy, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to study a cycle-to-cycle control approach called Terminal Iterative Learning Control (TILC) and apply it to the process of plastic sheet heating in a thermoforming oven. Until now, adjustments to the oven heater temperature setpoints have been made manually by a human operator following a trial and error approach. This approach causes financial losses, because plastic sheets are wasted during the period of time when the adjustments are made at the beginning of a production run. Worse, the heater setpoints are subject to modification because of variation in the ambient temperature, which has an important impact on the sheet reheat process. The TILC approach is analyzed by studying the closed-loop system in the discrete cycle domain through the use of the z-transform. The system, which has dynamic behaviour in the time domain, becomes a static linear mapping in the cycle domain. One can then apply on this equivalent system a traditional control approach, while considering that the system output is sampled once at the end of the cycle. On the other hand, from the standpoint of the real system, this control approach can be viewed as cycle-to-cycle control. The stability and rate of convergence of the TILC algorithm can be analyzed through the location of the closed-loop system poles in the cycle domain. This analysis is relatively easy for a first-order TILC but becomes more complex for a higher-order TILC algorithm. The singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to simplify the convergence analysis while decoupling the system in the cycle domain. The SVD technique can be used to facilitate the design of higher-order TILC algorithms. Internal Model Control (IMC) is another approach that can make the ILC design easier, because there is only one parameter per filter to adjust. The IMC technique has an interesting feature. In the case where the system is nominal, the closed-loop transfer function of the system is the same as the IMC filter's transfer function. Therefore, the adjustment of the filter parameter allows the designer to select the desired system response. For industrial processes such as thermoforming ovens, it is important that the systems controlled by TILC algorithms are stable and have good performance. For thermoforming ovens, the terminal sheet temperature response must not be too oscillatory from cycle to cycle, since this may lead to high heater temperature setpoints. In the most serious case, high heater temperatures can cause the sheet to melt and spill on the heating elements at the bottom of the oven. The performance aspect must not be neglected, since it is important to minimize the number of wasted plastic sheets, particularly at process startup. To avoid such waste of time and material, it is necessary that the TILC algorithm converge as quickly as possible. However, the robustness and performance objectives are conflicting and an acceptable compromise must be achieved. The control engineer must define specifications to describe these two constraints. Tools such as the Hinfinity Mixed-Sensitivity Analysis and mu-Analysis can be used to check the compliance of a given TILC algorithm with the robustness and performance specifications defined before the analysis. One can therefore compare various TILC algorithms quantitatively, through a computed measure obtained with one of the two approaches. These same tools can be used for the design of TILC algorithms, using weighting functions representing the specifications. Simulation and experimental results obtained on industrial thermoforming machines show the effectiveness of the various approaches in this thesis. Many examples are also presented throughout the chapters.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj2365805.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gr77j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Iterative methods (Mathematics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Intelligent control systems</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thermoforming</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4m90dz757"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Computer-supported collaborative inquiry in remote networked schools</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Turcotte, Sandrine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study addressed computer-supported collaborative scientific inquiries in Remote Networked Schools. Three dyads of grade 5-6 classrooms from remote locations collaborated using the knowledge-buildng tool Knowledge Forum. Customized scaffold supports embedded in the online tool were used to support student understanding and practice of an authentic inquiry process. The study studied how the use of the scaffolds could help students to understand and put into practice an authentic inquiry process, how the students' collaborative problem solving could translate into a deeper understanding of the phenomena explored and if this could lead to conceptual change. Students created notes and used the scaffold supports to support their inquiry process however without sufficient direct teacher modeling, coherent use of the scaffolds stayed low across activities. Pre- and post-test results show that the students gained a better understanding of the inquiry process, but low post-test scores suggest further need for direct teacher modeling of the inquiry process during science instruction. Content analysis of the ideas expressed by the students in two of the sites showed that students were able to generate high-level ideas especially when the directives were explanation-seeking rather than fact-seeking in nature. Teacher mediation in the online discussion tended to generate longer threads than when teachers were absent from the online environment. Unless effective collaborative conversation is already a part of the classroom culture, efforts are required to generate richer student interactions and foster deeper understanding. Recurring technical and logistical difficulties in the sites prevented teachers from concentrating on the learning objectives and should be more seriously addressed by school authorities. Evidence of conceptual change was found through micro-analysis of the students' ideas about buoyancy in the pre- and post-tests as well as in their notes showing that conceptual change is possible in this innovative collaborative learning context. Further insistence for students to complete the inquiry process is needed in order to created additional opportunities for students to express their knowledge about a scientific phenomenon and promote deeper understanding through collaboration.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fq372.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dz757</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Communication in education -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer-assisted instruction -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Educational technology -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afn1072616"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Thermal stability of SrFeO3SiO2Si and SrFeO3AI2O3 thin film systems : transmission electron microscopy study of interfacial structures of the thin film systems and conductometric sensing response of SrFeO3AI2O3</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wang, Dashan, 1948-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The literature review indicates that studies on the structures and properties of perovskites materials have shown attractive applications in the fields of energy, catalysts and sensing materials for fuel cell and sensing industries. Kinetic phenomena in thin film systems, such as solid state amorphization and interface reactions due to diffusion during thin film deposition, are introduced indicating that thermal stability is a concern in thin film sensor device application. The principle of traditional methods of materials characterization is briefly discussed. Emphasis is placed on the functions of analytical transmission electron microscopy. The SrFeO3/SiO2/Si and SrFeO3/Al 2O3 thin film systems have been studied using transmission electron microscopy. The thin films of SrFeO3 were grown by pulsed laser deposition. For the SrFeO3/SiO2/Si system, TEM characterization showed that the microstructure of the film deposited at room temperature contained crystalline and amorphous layers. Silicon diffusion into SrFeO3 films occurred at the SiO2 interface. The silicon-induced interfacial reactions resulted in phase transformations and the growth of complex crystalline and amorphous phases. The principal compositions of these phases were Sr(Fe,Si)12O19, SrOx and amorphous [Sr-Fe-Si-O]. The films in the SrFeO3/Al2O3 system were deposited onto single crystal and sintered polycrystalline Al2O 3 substrates at room temperature and 700°C and subjected to annealing for various periods of time at 700-1000°C. TEM characterization showed that the morphology of the film varied with changes in deposition temperature: a columnar structure was produced at room temperature and layers containing crystalline grains were produced at 700°C. The interfacial structures of the films remained unchanged below 700°C. Interfacial reactions were observed following annealing at 850°C for 5 hours. The phase transformation at the interface was characterized for the film annealed at 1000°C for 5 hours, for which the principal phases were identified as SrAl2-xFe xO4 and SrFe12-yAlyO19. As a result, an isothermal section at 1000°C of a ternary phase diagram for SrO-Al2O3-Fe2O3 is proposed. Evaluation for thin film conductometric sensing applications indicated that the untreated films deposited at 700°C onto both single crystal and sintered Al2O3 substrates exhibited a similar temperature dependency of conductivity in air and a p-type gas sensor response to oxygen and propane at 500°C.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290f07r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn1072616</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Strontium compounds -- Electric properties</dc:subject><dc:subject>Detectors -- Materials</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thin film devices -- Materials</dc:subject><dc:subject>Perovskite -- Electric properties</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afx719q64m"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Interactions among dietary protein intake, immunopathology, and Heligmosomoides bakeri (nematode) infection in mice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tu, Tao, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research investigated the combined effects of protein deficiency (PD) and a gastrointestinal nematode infection, Heligmosomoides bakeri , on immunopathology and nutritional status in BALB/c mice. The acute phase of a primary infection reduced resting metabolic rate, but PD did not. Early challenge infection led to temporary anorexia and cessation of weight gain in both protein-sufficient (PS) and PD mice. Among PS mice, a challenge dose of 200 L3 caused more active worm expulsion than infection with 100 L3. Both serum monocyte chemotactic protein-5 and gut fluid leakage were positively correlated with worm expulsion whereas numbers of mucosal mast cells, eosinophils, goblet cells and Paneth cells were unaffected by doses. Among PD mice, worm survival was prolonged and no dose-dependent worm expulsion was observed. In addition, a wide range of Th1 inflammatory cytokines including leptin was elevated in infected PD mice suggesting (1) that PD mice are unable to mount the appropriate Th2 inflammation and (2) that infection in PD mice induces a Th1 inflammation that allows continuing persistence of the parasite. The shift to Th1 inflammatory responses in PD mice may also explain modifications in mineral distributions in tissues. Despite adequate dietary intakes of minerals in both PD and PS mice, serum iron concentrations were lower after H. bakeri challenge infection. Infection also reduced calcium and iron concentrations as well as the Ca/Zn ratio in the spleen. In contrast, PD resulted in increased iron and calcium concentrations as well as increased Ca/Zn ratio in the spleen and Fe/Zn ratio in the liver, but reduced calcium, zinc, copper and sulfur concentrations, and the Cu/Zn ratio in the liver. Re-feeding PD mice with a PS diet restored parasite expulsion, regardless of whether the PS diet was provided during the primary or challenge infection. Thus, although PD mice have suppressed Th2 responses and elevated Th1 inflammation, their response to the primary infection is sufficient to ensure that parasite expulsion occurs once protein status is restored. Together, these studies show that the shift toward Th1 inflammation plays a key role in prolonged parasite survival and mineral redistribution in protein deficient, infected mice.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720h39w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719q64m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Protein deficiency</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heligmosomatidae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Helminthiasis -- Immunological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice -- Parasites</dc:subject><dc:subject>Helminthiasis -- Nutritional aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0g354j77k"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Invariant gauge fields over non-reductive spaces and contact geometry of hyperbolic equations of generic type</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>The, Dennis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we study two problems focusing on the interplay between geometric properties of differential equations and their invariants. For the first project, we study the validity of the principle of symmetric criticality (PSC) in the context of invariant gauge fields over the four-dimensional non-reductive pseudo-Riemannian homogeneous spaces G/K recently classified by Fels &amp; Renner (2006). Given H compact semi-simple, classification results are obtained for principal H-bundles over G/K admitting: (1) a G-action (by bundle automorphisms) projecting to left multiplication on the base, and (2) at least one G-invariant connection. There are two cases which admit nontrivial examples of such bundles and all G-invariant connections on these bundles are Yang--Mills. Using the invariant criteria obtained by Anderson--Fels--Torre, the validity of PSC is investigated for the bundle of connections and is shown to fail for all but one of the Fels--Renner cases. This failure arises from degeneracy of the scalar product on pseudo-tensorial forms restricted to the space of symmetric variations of an invariant connection. In the exceptional case where PSC is valid, there is a unique G-invariant connection which is moreover universal, i.e. it is a solution of the Euler--Lagrange equations associated to any G-invariant Lagrangian on the bundle of connections. This solution is a canonical connection associated with a weaker notion of reductivity which we introduce. The second project is a study of the contact geometry of scalar second order hyperbolic equations in the plane of generic type. Following a derivation of parametrized contact-invariants to distinguish Monge--Ampere (class 6-6), Goursat (class 6-7) and generic (class 7-7) hyperbolic equations, we use Cartan's equivalence method to study the generic case. An intriguing feature of this class of equations is that every generic hyperbolic equation admits at most a nine-dimensional contact symmetry algebra. The nine-dimensional bound is sharp: normal forms for the contact-equivalence classes of these maximally symmetric equations are derived and explicit symmetry algebras are presented. Moreover, all such equations are Darboux integrable. An enumeration of several submaximally symmetric (eight and seven-dimensional) structures is also given.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dh09w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354j77k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Invariants</dc:subject><dc:subject>Riemannian manifolds</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gauge fields (Physics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exponential functions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p8307"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Region-selective effects of thiamine deficiency on cerebral metabolism in pyrithiamine-treated rats</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Navarro, Darren</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency in rats is a well-established animal model of Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE). This thesis project, submitted as four articles, presents an examination of metabolic events that contribute to the selective neuronal lesions observed in the medial thalamus (MT) of thiamine-deficient (TD) rat. In addition, the phenomenon of glucose-precipitated worsening of neurological status in WE patients (Wallis et al., 1978; Watson et al., 1981) is explored. Lactate accumulation is known to occur selectively in regions of the TD brain, which ultimately express neuronal cell death (McCandless, 1982; Munujos et al., 1996). In Article 1, the metabolic origin and cellular localization of region-selective lactate accumulation in the MT of TD rats was studied using combined 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Parallel studies were performed to examine the effects of glucose loading on regional brain lactate synthesis in TD animals. Thiamine deficiency caused focal increases in the de novo synthesis of lactate via elevated glycolytic flux in the MT, while contribution via pyruvate recycling and the periphery remained nominal. Lactate levels remained unaltered in the frontal cortex (FC), a brain region that is spared in thiamine deficiency. Administration of a glucose load intensified the selective increases in lactate de novo synthesis and accumulation in the MT of TD rats, positing a role for lactic acidosis in the glucose-precipitated worsening of neurological status in TD patients. Accordingly, Article 2 addresses the effect of glucose loading on local cerebral pH in the vulnerable MT, compared to the FC, of TD rats. Administration of a glucose load resulted in detrimental decreases in regional pH selectively in the MT, implying that alterations of brain pH contribute to the pathogenesis of thalamic neuronal damage and consequent cerebral dysfunction in WE. Region-specific alterations in the steady state levels of cerebral amino acid neurotransmitters have been well-documented in experimental animal models of thiamine deficiency (Butterworth et al., 1979; Butterworth &amp; Heroux, 1989; Gaitonde et al., 1975; Plaitakis et al., 1979); however, the dynamics of these changes have never been systematically explored. In Article 3, we examined the metabolic fluxes through thiamine-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH) using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore the cellular localization of the metabolic changes in relation to regional vulnerability to thiamine deficiency was addressed. Our studies clearly demonstrate that early decreases m metabolic flux through alpha-KGDH result in commensurate declines in aspartate concentrations in the MT of TD rats. Impairments to PDH flux manifest secondarily to the metabolic block at alpha-KGDH, likely due to depleted oxaloacetate pools. As a result of impaired pyruvate oxidation, declines in the de novo synthesis of glutamate and GABA ensue. The present findings also suggest that inhibition of flux through alpha-KGDH in TD brain occurs primarily in the neurons, while astrocytes possess compensatory mechanisms, i.e. the anaplerotic pathway, to replenish oxaloacetate concentrations via metabolic pathways that do not involve thiamine-dependent enzymes. In Article 4, we investigated the regional effects of thiamine deficiency on the activity of thiamine-dependent branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) and the resultant effects on regional cerebral branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) oxidation. Thiamine deficiency resulted in significant impairments in BCKDH activity; while parallel studies on enzyme distribution confirmed a lower oxidative capacity for BCAAs in the MT compared with the Fe. The data presented in these four articles confirm and extend findings for the region-selective impairments in thiamine-dependent metabolic processes as the foundation of vulnerability of the MT to thiamine deficiency. In addition, glucose loading of TD rats exacerbates both lactic acidosis and impaired pyruvate oxidation in this vulnerable brain region, positing a role for these processes in the glucose-precipitated worsening of neurological status in TD patients. Impaired oxidative metabolism of glucose and BCAAs in the MT leads to the accumulation of potentially harmful metabolic intermediates, contributing to the mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular energy failure and ultimately neuronal cell death observed in thiamine deficiency.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g845b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p8307</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rats, Sprague-Dawley</dc:subject><dc:subject>Frontal Lobe -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thiamine Deficiency -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ketone Oxidoreductases -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rats</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thalamus -- metabolism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afn107262g"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Adaptable stateful application server replication</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wu, Huaigu, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In recent years, multi-tier architectures have become the standard computing environment for web- and enterprise applications. The application server tier is often the heart of the system embedding the business logic. Adaptability, in particular the capability to adjust to the load submitted to the system and to handle the failure of individual components, are of outmost importance in order to provide 7/24 access and high performance. Replication is a common means to achieve these reliability and scalability requirements. With replication, the application server tier consists of several server replicas. Thus, if one replica fails, others can take over. Furthermore, the load can be distributed across the available replicas. Although many replication solutions have been proposed so far, most of them have been either developed for fault-tolerance or for scalability. Furthermore, only few have considered that the application server tier is only one tier in a multi-tier architecture, that this tier maintains state, and that execution in this environment can follow complex patterns. Thus, existing solutions often do not provide correctness beyond some basic application scenarios. In this thesis we tackle the issue of replication of the application server tier from ground off and develop a unified solution that provides both fault-tolerance and scalability. We first describe a set of execution patterns that describe how requests are typically executed in multi-tier architectures. They consider the flow of execution across client tier, application server tier, and database tier. In particular, the execution patterns describe how requests are associated with transactions, the fundamental execution units at application server and database tiers. Having these execution patterns in mind, we provide a formal definition of what it means to provide a correct execution across all tiers, even in case failures occur and the application server tier is replicated. Informally, a replicated system is correct if it behaves exactly as a non-replicated that never fails. From there, we propose a set of replication algorithms for fault-tolerance that provide correctness for the execution patterns that we have identified The main principle is to let a primary AS replica to execute all client requests, and to propagate any state changes performed by a transaction to backup replicas at transaction commit time. The challenges occur as requests can be associated in different ways with transactions. Then, we extend our fault-tolerance solution and develop a unified solution that provides both fault-tolerance and load-balancing. In this extended solution, each application server replica is able to execute client requests as a primary and at the same time serves as backup for other replicas. The framework provides a transparent, truly distributed and lightweight load distribution mechanism which takes advantage of the fault-tolerance infrastructure. Our replication tool is implemented as a plug-in of JBoss application server and the performance is carefully evaluated, comparing with JBoss' own replication solutions. The evaluation shows that our protocols have very good performance and compare favorably with existing solutions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff365859p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107262g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Internet programming</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer systems -- Reliability</dc:subject><dc:subject>Client/server computing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fault-tolerant computing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bs897"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) : regulation by signaling pathways and its role in translation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shahbazian, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Due to the high energetic expenditure for the cell, the protein biosynthesis in eukaryotes is an extensively controlled process predominantly regulated at the ribosomal biogenesis and translation initiation steps. The ribosomal biogenesis defines the global translational aptitude of the cell. It is a mainly nucleolar process which is regulated at multiple steps (e.g. transcription, rRNA processing and modification, ribosomal protein translation etc). However, the most extensively regulated and the rate limiting step of translation is the initiation. Multiple eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) function to facilitate this priming step of translation. The initial recognition of the mRNA molecule happens through the 5' cap structure found in all mRNAs of nuclear origin. This event is mediated through the recruitment of heterotrimeric complex eIF4F consisting of cap-binding protein eIF4E, scaffolding protein eIF4G and the RNA helicase eIF4A unwinding secondary structures found in 5'UTR of mRNA and thus thought to facilitate the scanning process. The helicase activity of elF4F complex or of eIF4A alone is further potentiated by eIF4B in vitro. The latter protein is at the focus of present thesis. Signal transduction regulates multiple cellular processes including mitogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis, chemotaxis etc. Signaling pathways also regulate ribosomal biogenesis to coordinate mitogenic cues, nutrient and energy availability with the translational capacity of the cells. Mounting evidence links PI3K-Akt-mTOR and Ras-MAPK cascades to the translational control. In this thesis, I show that PI3K/mTOR and MAP kinase cascades converge to phosphorylate eIF4B on Ser422. This phosphorylation results in an increased interaction with eIF3, an essential factor bridging between eIF4F and the small ribosomal subunit. Physiological significance of eIF4B phosphorylation on Ser422 has been demonstrated by the stimulatory effect of eIF4B Ser422Asp phosphomimetic mutant on cap-dependent translation. Taken together, this represents a new paradigm of translational control mechanism regulated by signaling crosstalk. The function of eIF4B in vitro is well characterized but its in vivoeffects are disputed in literature. To address this I established HeLa cell line stably expressing shRNA targeting eIF4B. eIF4B silencing inhibits proliferation rates and anchorage-independent growth. Expression of luciferase reporter gene containing 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP) is selectively repressed in eIF4B-silenced cells and can be rescued by exogenous eIF4B regardless of Ser422 phosphorylation status. Moreover, the de novo synthesis rates of endogenous ribosomal proteins in serum starved cultures recapitulate the luciferase reporter assay data. Utilizing polysomal analysis, I was able to show more significant inhibition of translation initiation in serum starved eIF4B-silenced cells. Our attempt to discover novel eIF4B-interacting proteins by Mass Spectrometry approach led to the identification of nucleolar RNA helicase DDX21. Confocal microscopy has shown partial co-localization of tagged eIF4B and DDX21 in nucleolar periphery. Pulse chase experiments metabolically labeling rRNA show an attenuated 28S rRNA production and concomitant accumulation of 36S intermediates in eIF4B-silenced cells. Since ribosomal biogenesis is highly coordinated process and requires strict stoichiometry maintenance of ribosomal components the observed inhibition of rRNA processing could be consequential to the decreased ribosomal protein expression. However, given the fact that eIF4B is associated with the nucleolar pre-ribosomal particle complexes its direct effect on rRNA processing cannot be ruled out. Regulation of ribosomal biogenesis by translation initiation factor may represent an important control mechanism allowing cells to co-ordinate these two processes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s380d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bs897</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3 -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational</dc:subject><dc:subject>1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Eukaryotic Initiation Factors -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>MAP Kinase Signaling System</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vv383"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Rough-and-tumble play and the development of externalizing behaviour</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Flanders, Joseph L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Longitudinal research on externalizing disorders has demonstrated that the signs of this form of psychopathology emerge early in life. For example, physically aggressive behaviours can be first observed as early as 18 months of age. Most preschool-aged children develop the self-regulatory abilities to inhibit these problem behaviours and express their aggressive and competitive impulses in alternative, constructive ways. Some children do not develop these abilities and chronic psychosocial difficulties typically result. Several researchers have raised the possibility that Parent-child rough-and-tumble play (RTP) interactions give parents and children an opportunity to develop the child's self-regulatory abilities. Defined here as aggressive behaviours in a play context, RTP often challenges children to modulate their behaviour to ensure their play partner continues to enjoy the activity. In the work that follows, the hypothesis that parent-child RTP can influence the development of behaviour self-regulation is tested. The first study reported here shows that the frequency of mother-child RTP in the preschool is negatively associated with physical aggression later in development, though this effect depends on the presence of a father figure in the home. The second study validates the Rough-and-Tumble Play Scales (RTPS), designed to facilitate the study of RTP and the development of self-regulation. The third study uses observational techniques to highlight the importance of a dominant father in play interactions. RTP frequency was negatively associated levels of physical aggression in dyads in which the father was relatively more dominant. The reverse was true for dyads in which the father was relatively less dominant. Finally, the fourth study showed that this interaction between father-child RTP frequency and father dominance also predict several other aspects of self-regulatory functioning 5 years later. RTP is a highly common, natural, and enjoyable activity for many parents and their children. Collectively, these studies also suggest that under the right conditions, parent-child RTP can influence the development of a child's self-regulatory abilities. While further research is needed, these results hold promise for the development of new interventions for children at risk for externalizing problems and their parents.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04ds96t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vv383</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Play assessment (Child psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self-control in children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b591c61q"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Quasi-exact solvability and Turbiner's conjecture in three dimensions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fortin Boisvert, Mélisande</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The results exhibited in this thesis are related to Schrodinger operators in three dimensions and are subdivided in two parts based on two published papers, [15] and [14]. A variant of Turbiner's conjecture is proved in the first paper while a partial classification of quasi-exactly solvable Lie algebras of first order differential operators in dimension three is exhibited in the second paper. This classification is then used to construct new quasi-exactly solvable Schrodinger operators in three dimensions. Turbiner's conjecture posits that, for a Lie algebraic Schrodinger operator in dimension two, the Schrodinger equation is separable if the underlying metric is locally flat. This conjecture is false in general. However, if the generating Lie algebra is imprimitive and if a certain compactness requirement holds, Rob Milson proved that in two dimensions, the Schrodinger equation separates in a Cartesian or polar coordinate system. In [15], the first paper included in this thesis, a similar theorem is proved in three variables. The imprimitivity and compactness hypotheses are still necessary and another condition, related to the underlying metric, must be imposed. In three dimensions, the separation is only partial and the separation will occur in either a spherical, cylindrical or Cartesian coordinate system. In the second paper [14], a partial classification of quasi-exactly solvable Lie algebras of first order differential operators is performed in three dimensions. Such a classification was known in one and two dimensions but the three dimensional case was still open before the beginning of this research. These new quasi-exactly solvable Lie algebras are used to construct new quasi-exactly solvable Schrodinger operators with the property that part of their spectrum can be explicitly determined. This classification is based on a classification of Lie algebras of vector fields in three variables due to Lie and Amaldi.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246w43w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591c61q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>SchrÜdinger operator</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lie algebras</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s1619723"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Emerging roles for the CD36 scavenger receptor in neovascular ocular disease</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mwaikambo, Bupe Rose</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ocular neovascularization (NV) associated with corneal NV, ischemic retinopathies and age-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of severe vision loss. While numerous contributing factors have been identified, the potential role of the CD36 scavenger receptor has been largely overlooked notwithstanding its crucial involvement in normal retinal function. Accordingly, the central aim of this work was to elucidate the contribution and regulation of CD36 during ocular NV using the cornea as a model. Initial work investigating the role of CD36 10 maintaining corneal avascularity, an important feature of the normal cornea, revealed that genetic ablation of CD36 elicits age-related corneal NV. Subsequent studies using a pathophysiologically relevant model of inflammatory corneal NV showed constitutive expression of CD36 in the normal cornea with marked induction in the neovascularized cornea. Importantly, activation of CD36 suppressed and induced regression of corneal NV, effects that proceeded via concerted inhibition of VEGFA, JNK-1, and cJun. Because hypoxia is a fundamental stimulus for angiogenesis, it was pertinent to explore the role and regulation of CD36 during hypoxia. We demonstrate that CD36 expression was significantly elevated in hypoxia-exposed corneal and retinal tissue and in hypoxic retinal pigment epithelial cells. Essential contributions of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 and reactive oxygen species were also established. Functional consequences were depicted by augmentations in CD36 phagocytic and anti-angiogenic activities. Collectively, data disclose CD36 as an important modulator of corneal avascularity and inflammatory corneal NV; this imparts several interesting avenues for future research on the involvement of CD36 in neovascular diseases of the eye. Novel data further identify CD36 as a hypoxia and HIF-1 regulated gene thus creating a framework for future elucidation of the regulatory aspects of this receptor.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd376115v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s1619723</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corneal Neovascularization -- pathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antigens, CD36 -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cornea -- blood supply</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neovascularization, Pathologic -- physiopathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Angiogenic Proteins -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, Scavenger</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801pk74h"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Nursing</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Making homes smoke-free : the impact of an empowerment intervention for parents</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Herbert, Rosemary, 1955-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One-third of American children under the age of 18 years and one in ten Canadian children aged 0-11 years are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) predisposing them to multiple health problems. Although several intervention strategies to reduce ETS exposure among children have been tested, to date there is not enough evidence to recommend one strategy over another. The objectives of this study were: (a) to test if parents' participation in an intervention based on an empowerment ideology and participatory experiences decreases the number of cigarettes smoked in homes; and (b) to identify barriers to making homes and vehicles smoke-free, as well as facilitators used by parents to manage these barriers. To enable informed decision-making on how to measure empowerment, a systematic review was conducted to identify questionnaires that best measure health-related empowerment among adults and in families. In a randomized controlled trial, 36 families were allocated to the intervention (n=17) or control group (n=19). The six week intervention included three, two hour group sessions, followed by three follow-up telephone calls, all at weekly intervals. Data were collected in interviewer-administered questionnaires at baseline and at six months follow-up. No significant difference was detected between the intervention and control groups in the number of cigarettes smoked in the home daily at six months follow-up. However empowerment increased and the number of cigarettes smoked in the home decreased in both the intervention and control groups from baseline (median=17) to six-month follow-up (median=5). Parents identified multiple barriers to smoke-free homes and vehicles including personal factors, factors involving others, and factors related to the physical environment. The most commonly identified barriers to smoke-free homes were personal factors, with tobacco addiction cited most often. In describing how to overcome barriers, parents identified facilitators involving other people as most effective, yet they most often relied on themselves. None ofthe parents identified a health provider as a facilitator. The multiple and complex barriers identified in this study suggest that interventions and practice guidelines should incorporate multiple strategies and individualized approaches to assist parents to make their homes and vehicles smoke-free.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rh89f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pk74h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Parents -- psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tobacco Smoke Pollution -- prevention &amp; control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Parents -- education</dc:subject><dc:subject>Smoking -- prevention &amp; control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Air Pollution, Indoor -- prevention &amp; control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Parent-Child Relations</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nf623"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The mechanisms of hydroxyurea induced developmental toxicity in the organogenesis stage mouse embryo</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yan, Jin, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hydroxyurea was used as a model teratogen to investigate the role of oxidative stress and stress-response pathways in mediating developmental toxicity. When administered to pregnant mice during early organogenesis, hydroxyurea induced fetal death and growth retardation, as well as external and skeletal malformations. The malformed fetuses displayed hindlimb, vertebral column, and tail defects. Hydroxyurea treatment enhanced the production of 4-hydroxynonenal, a lipid peroxidation end product, in malformation sensitive regions of the embryo. Depletion of glutathione, a major cellular antioxidant, specifically enhanced hydroxyurea-induced malformations and elevated the region-specific production of 4--hydroxynonenal protein adducts in the embryo, without affecting the incidence or extent of hydroxyurea-induced fetal death or growth retardation. The major proteins modified by 4-hydroxynonenal were involved in energy metabolism. Thus, oxidative stress is important in the induction of malformations by hydroxyurea. Exposure to hydroxyurea stimulated the DNA binding activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1), an early response redox-sensitive transcription factor. Activated AP-1 was composed mainly of c-Fos heterodimers. Glutathione depletion did not change the effects of hydroxyurea on AP-1/c-Fos DNA binding activities despite an augmentation of the incidence of embryo malformations. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activate AP-1 in response to stress by post-transcriptional phosphorylation of AP-1 proteins. Hydroxyurea treatment dramatically enhanced the activation of stress-responsive p38 MAPKs and JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases). Selectively blocking p38 MAPKs enhanced the incidence of fetal death, whereas selective inhibition of JNKs specifically elevated the limb defects induced by hydroxyurea. Thus, activation of stress-response pathways impacts on the response of the embryo to a teratogenic insult.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b694r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nf623</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Abnormalities, Drug-Induced -- embryology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydroxyurea -- pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Embryo, Mammalian -- drug effects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transcription Factor AP-1 -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oxidative Stress -- drug effects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988p42b"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Implication of intracellular signalling pathways in allergic asthma pathogenesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pouliot, Philippe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The regulation of systemic immune responses is dependent on individual cell responses that will concur to induce a coherent response against a stimulus. In turn, cell response is dependent on the processing of intracellular signals generated at the cell membrane and transmitted through successive protein modifications to the nucleus in order to activate gene transcription. This is referred to as intracellular signalling. Tight control of these mechanisms is required to generate an appropriate cell response to environmental stimulations and globally to establish an appropriate immune response. Among protein modifications used to transmit a signal to the nucleus, protein tyrosine phosphorylation represents a pivotal method used by immune cells to rapidly induce signalling. While protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) phosphorylate proteins, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) regulate the signalling by removing the phosphate group. The goal of this study was to better characterize intracellular signalling events involved in allergic asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease involving a Th2 immune response. In a first time, we investigated the role of PTPs in the development of asthma. We show that inhibition of global PTP activity in mice, during either the allergen sensitization or the allergen challenge phase, reduces asthma development and is linked to an increased Th1 response in the spleen and lung. Secondly, we revealed that TC-PTP inhibition reduces asthma development, while PTP-1B inhibition exacerbates inflammatory cells recruitment to the lung. Inhibition of either SHP-1 or PTP-PEST activity did not significantly modulate asthma development in our model. In a third set of experiments, we got interested in the signalling pathways triggered by the pro-inflammatory molecules myeloid-related proteins (MRPs) 8 and 14. MRPs are small cytosolic proteins recently described to have extracellular functions. MRP8 expression is resistant to corticosteroid treatment, and potentially promotes inflammation in corticosteroid-treated patients. We identified that MRPs induce signal through the action of TLR-4 and trigger the activation of MEK/ERK and JNK pathways that lead to NF-kappaB translocation. Collectively, our data provide a new characterization of signalling pathways engaged in allergic asthma. This should be helpful in the elaboration of new therapeutic approaches targeting precise pathways to inhibit mechanisms of inflammation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150n48d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988p42b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Organometallic Compounds</dc:subject><dc:subject>Th1 Cells -- immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Asthma -- immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phenanthrolines</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Asthma -- etiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj430810k"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Nursing</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of informational support in relation to health care service use among individuals newly diagnosed with cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dubois, Sylvie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background: The relationship between informational support and use of health care services among individuals newly diagnosed with cancer remains little documented despite its importance for optimal care delivery. Aim: To document the role of informational support in light of patterns of health services used by women and men newly diagnosed with cancer. Method: A sequential mixed methods approach (i.e., quantitative-qualitative) was conducted among women and men newly diagnosed with either breast or prostate cancer. First, an existing quantitative database was used to determine whether an intervention relying on multimedia tool as a complement to the provision of usual cancer informational support to patients (N = 250) would modify subsequent health care service use. A follow-up qualitative inquiry with distinct individuals also newly diagnosed (N = 20) was conducted to explore this relationship further. Next, the resulting quantitative and qualitative findings were merged and reanalyzed using a quantitative-hierarchical approach to enhance our understanding of the phenomenon. Findings: Several personal and contextual factors were found to qualify the relationship between cancer informational support and health service use. Although quantitative analyses showed no significant differences in terms of overall reliance on health care services among participants who received more intense cancer informational support as opposed to those who received care as usual, several sex differences were noted in terms of number of visits to health care professionals, time spent with nurses and satisfaction with cancer information received. Qualitative findings revealed that participants reported a variety of experiences pertaining to cancer information received (e.g., positive, unsupportive or mixed) as well as several processes at play (e.g., cancer information seen as enabling, confirming, or conflicting). These differences in informational support, in turn, influenced their subsequent service utilization (e.g., more phone calls made to health professionals, reduction in face-to-face visits, reluctance to use cancer-related services). The mixed data analysis clarified further the findings allowing a broader perspective to emerge. Conclusion: Findings underscore that the relationship between cancer information and use of services is not as straightforward as initially anticipated. These findings provide initial insights that may inform future research on the topic and assist health care providers in optimizing their cancer informational interventions to guide patients in their reliance on health care services.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000352c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430810k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neoplasms -- therapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cancer -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Information Services</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cancer -- Patients -- Services for</dc:subject><dc:subject>Professional-Patient Relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Delivery of Health Care -- utilization</dc:subject><dc:subject>Patient Education as Topic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical care -- Utilization</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neoplasms -- psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cancer -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78tg51f"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ribonucleoprotein complexes and protein arginine methylation : a role in diseases of the central nervous sytem</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chénard, Carol Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>For the past 45 years, QKI has been studied for its role in the processes of development and central nervous system myelination using the qkv mouse. The presence of a single KH domain and the recent identification of a high-affinity binding site in mRNAs, suggests that it can bind to and regulate mRNAs through processes such as stability, splicing and transport. As a member of the STAR RNA binding family of proteins the QKI isoforms may also be involved in cell signaling pathways. QKI's involvement in all of these processes, lead us to examine both the protein partners and the mRNA targets of the QKI complex in order to identify potentially new pathways regulated by QKI. In doing so, we identified a novel direct protein-protein interaction with PABP and for the first time described the relocalization of QKI to cytoplasmic granules following oxidative stress. In addition, in vivo mRNA interaction studies were performed and allowed the identification of approximately 100 new mRNA targets in human glioblastoma cells. One of the targets identified was VEGF mRNA. Another QKI target mRNA is MBP, a major protein component of the myelin sheath and the candidate auto-antigen in multiple sclerosis (MS). In vivo MBP is symmetrically dimethylated on a single arginine residue. To further establish the role of the methylation of MBP in myelination, a methyl-specific antibody and an adenovirus expressing a recombinant protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) was generated. We show that methylated MBP is found in areas of mature myelin and that overexpression of the PRTM5 blocked the differentiation of oligodendrocytes. Taken together these datas implicate QKI for the first time in the process of human cancer angiogenesis and could explain the vascularization defects observed in some of the qkI mutant mice. In addition, arginine methylation of MBP may prove to have an important role in the process of myelination and in the pathogenesis of demyelination and the autoimmune reaction in diseases such as MS.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sh092.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tg51f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Oligodendroglia -- cytology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Myelin Basic Proteins -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poly(A)-Binding Proteins -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferase -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice, Quaking</dc:subject><dc:subject>RNA-Binding Proteins -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Methylation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kk69d"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Genetic factors responsible for restless legs syndrome in the French Canadian population</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Levchenko, Anastasia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that often starts at a young age and has a chronic progression throughout life. It has a very high incidence, affecting 10% of the general population. The majority of cases are familial and the genetic nature of the disorder has been demonstrated in twin studies. RLS segregates in an autosomal dominant way in the majority of families. This data has incited a search for genetic factors responsible for RLS using linkage as the approach. Dr. Rouleau's laboratory has one of the world's largest collections of RLS pedigrees. These families are mostly of French Canadian (FC) origin. Using these families, two novel candidate loci, on chromosomes 16p and 20p, were discovered. Also, previously described candidate loci on chromosomes 9p and 14q were replicated in this cohort of families. A duplication of a large part of a functional candidate gene in the locus on chromosome 20, Signal Regulatory Protein beta 1 (SIRPB1), was discovered in individuals affected with RLS from a FC pedigree, in which linkage to this locus was described. The duplication segregates with the disease status in the family, but its role in RLS pathogenesis has yet to be demonstrated. No disease-causing mutations were discovered in the chromosome 16 locus. Analysis of several functional and positional candidate genes in previously described loci on chromosomes 12 and 14 did not reveal disease-causing mutations. A follow up of these studies is necessary in order to confirm the implication of SIRPB1 in RLS pathogenesis, and to detect novel gene(s) whose deregulation leads to this disorder.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xd181.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kk69d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Restless Legs Syndrome -- genetics -- Quebec</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jj028"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Oral health technology assessment : study of mandibular 2-implant overdentures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Esfandiari, Shahrokh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is little evidence that Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is much used in dentistry. Dental implant technology is an example of innovative oral health technology. The objectives of this research were to gather the evidence needed for the assessment of overdenture implant treatment so that both patients and dental practitioners can make informed decisions about this technology. These objectives included 1) investigating what types of dental clinicians adopt and provide dental implants 2) determining the effect of the clinicians' experience in the provision of implant supported prostheses and 3) measuring the patients' preference in provision of mandibular 2-implants overdenture technology. For the first part, a cross-sectional survey was sent to all licensed Canadian Dentists to measure the adoption and provision of implant technology. For the second part, we used the data on the first 140 edentulous elders who were enrolled in a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the effects of mandibular conventional (CD) and 2-implant overdentures (IOD) on nutrition. The change in patient ratings of satisfaction after treatment, laboratory costs and the number of unscheduled visits were compared. For the last part, edentulous elders (N=36) who were wearing maxillary dentures and either a mandibular conventional denture (CD, n=13) or a two-implant overdenture (IOD, n=23) participated in this study. Participants' preference was measured during a 20-minute interview. Multivariate regression analysis on the data from the first part of the study shows that the Dentist's gender, province of practice, specialty, and whether they practice alone or in association with other practitioners, are significantly associated with the adoption of implant technology (p&lt;0.05). It is also shown that there was no difference in satisfaction scores for either prosthesis between the groups treated by experienced specialists or new dentists. Furthermore, it is shown that IOD wearers were willing to pay three times more than the current cost of conventional dentures for implant prostheses (p&lt;0.05). Overall, the results of this study 1) inform decision makers on what types of clinicians provide implant technology and 2) suggest that, with minimal training, all dental clinicians irrespective of their specialty, can provide successful implant overdenture prostheses that edentulous patients are willing to pay for.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77st566.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jj028</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Patient Satisfaction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Denture, Overlay</dc:subject><dc:subject>Denture, Complete</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axs55mg41z"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in memory retrieval</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kostopoulos, Penelope</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although a plethora of data exists on the role of the prefrontal cortex in memory retrieval, it has been difficult to relate specific aspects of retrieval processing to the different prefrontal regions.

In contrast to automatic retrieval, active retrieval is necessary when a person retrieves based on his/her plans and intentions a specific memory amongst multiple related mnemonic traces. Previously, we had demonstrated that the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere controls active retrieval of non-verbal stimuli. More specifically, we reported activity increases within this region during the delay period that followed the presentation of a retrieval cue. We proposed that these activity increases reflect the top-down control exerted by the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to focus attention on relevant aspects of encoded memories in preparation for the decision. The first study of my thesis focuses on the behavioural correlates of this active retrieval process. The results indicate that the subjects' performance improves (i.e. becomes faster) with longer retrieval periods. Thus, some aspect of retrieval is initiated during the delay before the presentation of a test stimulus for the decision. The results, however, also indicate that retrieval continues after the presentation of the test stimulus. The three event-related fMRI studies that make up chapters three, four, and five of the thesis were designed on the basis of the results obtained in the behavioural study described in chapter two. For all three fMRI studies, we used an experimental paradigm in which the retrieval cue coincided with the test stimulus presentation. The experimental design for the three neuroimaging studies was similar but examined the retrieval of mnemonic information from different sensory modalities. A separate group of subjects was tested for each study with a common hypothesis: when subjects are performing active retrieval trials, selective activity increases will be observed within the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The study presented in chapter three examined verbal active retrieval, the study presented in chapter four examined tactile active retrieval, and the one in chapter five examined active retrieval for auditory stimuli. Selective activity increases were reported within the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the active retrieval trials in all three studies. Activity increases were stronger in the left mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex when subjects retrieved verbal information. For tactile and auditory stimuli, the activity increases were bilateral. Importantly, within the prefrontal cortex, there were no other activity increases, indicating that the role of the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in memory retrieval is specific and distinct from that of other prefrontal regions. Thus it can be concluded that, across sensory modalities, the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex plays a key role in the top-down control necessary for the disambiguation of information in memory during retrieval.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h074h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mg41z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Prefrontal cortex</dc:subject><dc:subject>Memory</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30px336"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hierarchical Anderson model</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kritchevski, Evgenij</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we study the spectral properties of the hierarchical Anderson model. This model is an approximation of the Anderson tight-binding model on Zd , with the usual discrete Laplacian replaced by a hierarchical long-range interaction operator. In the hierarchical Anderson model, we are given a countable set X endowed with a hierarchical structure. The free hierarchical Laplacian is a self-adjoint operator Delta acting on the Hilbert space l 2( X ). The spectrum of Delta consists of isolated infinitely degenerate eigenvalues. We look at small random perturbations of the operator Delta. The disorder is modeled by a random potential Vo, (Vopsi)(x) = o( x)psi(x) for psi &amp;isin; l 2( X ). The numbers o(x) are identically distributed independent random variables with a bounded density. The hierarchical Anderson model is the random self-adjoint operator Ho = Delta + Vo. We prove the following two results. If the model has a spectral dimension dsp &amp;le; 4 then, almost surely, the spectrum of Ho is dense pure-point. The second result is on eigenvalue statistics. For dsp &lt; 1, the energy levels for Ho are asymptotically a Poisson point process in the thermodynamic limit, after a proper rescaling.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w032649j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30px336</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anderson model</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah128nj26m"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Implicit memory for music : factors affecting musical priming and their time courses</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hutchins, Sean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates implicit memory for music, as measured by repetition priming: a processing benefit for previously encountered items. Although repetition priming has been documented in many domains, including language, visual perception, and environmental sounds, it has not yet been demonstrated in music, a domain replete with pitch repetition. A novel methodology is presented in which participants sang back the final tone of a short melody. Experiments presented in Chapter 2 show that participants were faster to sing back a target tone when it was a repetition of a previous melodic tone than when it was not, and this effect was greatest when the repetition was closest to the target. These studies also showed a benefit for expected tonic tones, which were manipulated independently of the repetition effect. Chapter 3 presents a new analysis method for measuring response latencies in sung tones. A time-frequency representation that optimizes the tradeoff between time and frequency for each point in time yielded a measurement of singers' time to reach a target frequency, which takes into account both speed and accuracy of the vocal productions. The time-frequency measurement, applied to the data presented in Chapter 2, showed longer times to reach target frequency for higher pitches, as well as larger effects of tonal priming than were attained through traditional response latency measures. The experiments in Chapter 4 examine the time course of the effects of repetition and tonality. The singing-back paradigm used in Chapter 2 also was used with the additional manipulation of stimulus tempo. These studies implicated interference rather than decay as the cause of the decreased repetition priming effect. Stimulus tempo manipulations showed separate time courses for repetition and tonal priming. Together, these studies provide the first evidence of repetition priming in music, document its interaction with other factors including tonality and pitch height, and describe its time course. The findings are discussed in terms of sensory and cognitive theories of priming.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qw290.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nj26m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Memory</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225f59w"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Genetic investigation of inflammatory bowel disease and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome : the contribution of innate immunity candidate risk variants</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Villani, Alexandra-Chloé</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The gastro-intestinal (GI) tract represents the largest surface of the body and is continuously exposed to the microbial environment. In such anatomy, the survival of the host requires that the intestinal microbial flora be contained without excessive immune-reactivity to commensal bacteria while retaining the ability to respond to episodic pathogens. The discriminative recognition between beneficial commensal bacteria and potentially harmful pathogens demands an accurate interpretation by the GI mucosal immune system. Any defects in the processes of innate immune recognition and killing may lead to the development and perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation, namely inflammatory bowel disease (i.e. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)) and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). The aim of ours studies was to evaluate the contribution of candidate genes, involved in the homeostasis and regulation of the intestinal innate immune response, to the susceptibility to CD, DC, and PI-IBS. In the first phase, we describe functional and genetic association results supporting NLRP3, encoding NALP3/cryopyrin, as a novel CD susceptibility gene. We subsequently report that the MEFV gene, encoding pyrin, known to interact with and be involved in the same pathway as NALP3/cryopyrin, does not contribute to CD and DC susceptibility. No CD or DC additional associations were observed upon NLRP3-MEFV gene-gene interaction analyses. In the third phase, we report the first association study evaluating genetic determinants for PI-IBS, using the well-characterized Walkerton population cohort. We uncovered variants in the TLR9, CDH1, and IL6 regions associated with PI-IBS susceptibility. These results are in keeping with the pathophysiologic changes observed in patients with PI-IBS, which include increased intestinal permeability and intestinal immune activation. Overall, these results contribute to a better understanding of the genetic susceptibility to CD, DC and PI-IBS and shed light on new pathogenic signaling pathways in the development of these diseases.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cv24c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225f59w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Crohn Disease -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Colitis, Ulcerative -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Irritable Bowel Syndrome -- genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nm743"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Tactile display for mobile interaction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pasquero, Jerome</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Interaction with mobile devices suffers from a number of shortcomings, most of which are linked to the small size of screens. Artificial tactile feedback promises to be particularly well suited to the mobile interaction context. To be practical, tactile transducers for mobile devices must be small and light, and yet be capable of displaying a rich set of expressive stimuli. This thesis introduces a tactile transducer for mobile interaction that is capable of distributed skin stimulation on the fingertip. The transducer works on a principle that was first investigated because of its potential application to the display of Braille. A preliminary study was conducted on an earlier version of the transducer. It concluded that subjects were able to identify simple Braille characters with a high rate of success. Then, a complete re-design of the transducer addressed the goal of integration in a handheld prototype for mobile interaction. The resulting device comprises a liquid crystal graphic display co-located with the miniature, low-power, distributed tactile transducer. Next, it was needed to measure the perceptual differences between the stimuli that the device could display. Our experiences with one evaluation approach raised questions relating to the methodology for data collection. Therefore, an analysis of the process was carried out using a stimulus set obtained with the device. By means of multidimensional scaling analysis, both the perceptual parameters forming the stimuli space and the evaluation technique were validated. Finally, two experiments were carried out with the objective to develop new mobile interactions paradigms that combined visual and tactile feedback. Both experiments modeled a list scrolling task on the device. The first experiment found a marginal improvement in performance when tactile feedback was employed. It also came at a higher attentional cost dedicated to operating the device. For the second experiment, the scrolling paradigm and the tactile feedback were improved. This lead to a decrease in the reliance on vision when tactile feedback was enabled. Results showed a 28% decrease in the number of key presses that controlled the visibility state of the scroll list.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430811v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nm743</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Haptic devices -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mobile communication systems -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mobile computing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liquid crystal displays</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924g17z"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dynamics modelling and analysis of impact in multibody systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Modarres Najafabadi, Seyed Ali</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we discuss a novel approach to the dynamics modelling and analysis of impact in unilaterally constrained multibody systems. This approach is based on an analysis of energy absorption and restitution during impact, using a decomposition technique, which decouples the kinetic energy associated with the spaces of admissible and constrained motions of unilateral contacts. This is done based on the decomposition of the tangent space of the configuration manifold at the pre-impact instant. The decomposition of the kinetic energy can provide a picture of how the energy absorption and dissipation during impact is related to the variation of the generalized velocities and the configuration of multibody systems. Further, based on the above analysis approach, we introduce a new interpretation of the energetic coefficient of restitution, specially applicable to contact involving multibody systems. This interpretation generalizes the concept of the energetic coefficient of restitution and allows for consideration of simultaneous multiple-point contact scenarios. Moreover, based on the concept of the generalized energetic coefficient of restitution, the contact modes and the post-impact state of planar single-point impact are determined. Further, the problem of simultaneous multiple-point impact is considered, where it is shown that our approach can also be advantageous to characterize the dynamics of interaction in such systems. The use and applicability of the approach reported are further investigated by conducting an experimental study on a robotic testbed. The open architecture of the testbed allows us to perform various contact experiments, such as single- and multiple-point impact scenarios, with different pre-impact configurations and velocities. The kinematic and dynamic models of the system have been developed and implemented for real-time analysis. It is shown that impact between multibody systems is considerably affected by not only the local dynamics characteristics of the interacting bodies, but also the (global) configuration of the interacting multibody systems. The reported results suggest that the material presented herein offers a useful means to characterize impact in complex systems.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jj03j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924g17z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Contact mechanics -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
