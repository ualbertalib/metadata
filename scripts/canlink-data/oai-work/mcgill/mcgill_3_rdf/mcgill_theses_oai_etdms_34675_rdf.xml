BP has been shown to induce mammary carcinomas in laboratory animals, and can accumulate in lipid stores such as the mammary fat pad. In the process of converting BP to a more water-soluble and excretable form, highly mutagenic intermediates are formed. BP can enhance expression of the metabolizing enzymes involved in this process by binding to a ligand-activated transcription factor known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). In its native state, cytosolic AhR is found in association with a dimer of 90 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP90) and an immunophilin-like protein. Ligand binding causes loss of accessory proteins and translocation to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with the Arnt protein. The AhR/Arnt complex modulates gene expression by binding to cognate DNA sequences in the promoter region of Ah-responsive genes. Two approaches were utilized to determine the effects of BP on human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Firstly, spontaneously immortalized nontransformed HMEC were subjected to multiple rounds of BP exposure and in vitro transformed clones were isolated based on a loss of contact inhibition and altered morphology. Unlike parental cells, the BP-transformed clones were found to possess chromosomal alterations that frequently occur in human breast cancer, including an isochromosome 8q. Secondly, the mechanism of resistance was investigated in a HMEC tumor cell line selected for growth in BP. AhR mRNA expression was significantly reduced in the BP-resistant cells, which led to decreased AhR protein and DNA-binding activity. Additionally, HSP90 was investigated for its ability to regulate AhR activity in vivo in HMEC tumor cell lines.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Batist, Gerald</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892c555.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq247</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62fb032"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of cytokines in host defence against Entamoeba histolytica</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Campbell, John Darren</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite and the causative agent of amoebiasis. While infection is associated with suppression of cell-mediated, immunity, drug-cured patients are resistant to reinvasion by amoebae. Macrophages are the principal effector cells in host defence against E. histolytica via production of nitric oxide which is cytotoxic for the parasite. The objective of this study was to determine the T cell cytokine responses associated with host defence against E. histolytica . A mixed Th1/Th2 (Th0) response predominated at days 5--10 of amoebic liver abscess development in gerbils, as indicated by spleen and hepatic lymph node cell IL-2 (Th1 marker) and IL-4 (Th2 marker) production. However, T cell responses were profoundly suppressed at day 20 of infection. Serum collected at day 20, but not at other times, markedly suppressed T cell proliferative responses by inhibiting IL-2 production. A switch to a Th1 response occurred after day 20 of infection. Following drug-abbreviation of infection at day 20, animals were completely resistant to challenge infection in the liver and demonstrated a Th1 response. The Gal-lectin 170-kDa heavy subunit of E. histolytica is a protective antigen in gerbils and a potential subunit vaccine candidate. We determined which region of the Gal-lectin stimulates IL-12 production, as IL-12 is key to inducing Th1 cytokine responses. Native Gal-lectin plus interferon-gamma stimulated IL-12 p40 and p35 gene transcription and IL-12 p70 protein production in human macrophages. Using a panel of anti-170-kDa subunit monoclonal antibodies in inhibition studies, aa 596--998 was identified as the IL-12-inducing domain. These results suggest that this portion of the Gal-lectin has potential for use as a subunit vaccine to induce Th1-mediated immunity against E. histolytica .</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chadee, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d165r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62fb032</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Entamoeba histolytica</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amebiasis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cytokines</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655j31j"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Wear and lubrication of metal-metal bearings for total hip arthroplasty</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chan, Frankie W., 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A major current concern in total hip arthroplasty is the generation of polyethylene wear particles at the articulating surfaces and resulting macrophage-mediated, periimplant osteolysis. There has been revived interest in metal-metal bearings for hip implants because of their potential for improved wear performance. Cobalt chromium molybdenum metal-metal hip implants of two materials (alloy types) and two carbon content levels were custom-manufactured and tested in a hip simulator under various loading conditions. In general, accelerated wear occurred within the first million cycles of testing followed by a decrease in wear rate to low steady-state values. The volumetric wear at three million cycles was up to several orders of magnitude less than the wear of conventional metal-polyethylene hip implants. Increased head-cup clearance and surface roughness resulted in increased wear. Independent effects on wear of material and carbon content were not identified. The low wear may be related to fluid film lubrication at the bearing surfaces. A time-varying elastohydrodynamic lubrication model was developed to predict fluid film thickness for the experimental metal-metal hip implants during simulator testing. Decreased clearance, increased lubricant viscosity, and increased cycle frequency resulted in increased film thickness. A strong independent effect on film thickness of load magnitude was not found. The lambda ratio (of film thickness to combined surface roughness) was used to indicate the extent of fluid film lubrication. For the experimental implants, total wear decreased with increasing lambda ratio. These studies provided important new information on the design and testing parameters that control wear performance and lubrication of metal-metal bearings for hip implants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Medley, J.

In medicine, considerable study has focused on diagnostic reasoning, however the role of expertise in coping with decision complexity has remained to be more fully explored. In this thesis three groups of subjects, consisting of medical students (novices), residents (intermediates) and intensive care experts were each presented with complex cases of intensive care problems containing varying levels of uncertain and conflicting evidence. The subjects were asked to think-aloud as they worked through the problems and provided a management and treatment plan for each case. The audiotaped protocols were coded for key process variables in decision making and problem solving. The results indicate that the strategies used by novices, intermediates and experts for dealing with complex cases containing ambiguous information varied considerably. When faced with anomalous evidence, expert physicians were found to disregard the anomalous evidence and focus on the patient's overall clinical condition. In contrast, non-experts used the anomalous evidence to evaluate diagnostic hypotheses and drive the decision making process. Expert physicians were also found to focus on situational aspects of the patient's condition to a greater extent than non-experts, occasionally employing recognitional strategies. Strategies for processing anomalous evidence were shown to relate to level of confidence in decision making. The research has a number of important theoretical implications for the study of decision making and expertise in general and medical decision making in particular. A theoretical account of the role of expertise in complex decision making is provided which emphasizes the interaction between situation assessment and evaluative reasoning processes in the decision making of experts. In addition, the thesis provides empirical support for aspects of several emerging naturalistic models of decision making, and extends them to include greater consideration of processes involved in evaluation of evidence. Implications for education and design of decision support are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Patel, Vimla</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d1661.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612q353</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Cognitive</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Industrial</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atd96k4340"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the MAIDS defective virus target cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Klein, Steven J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Murine acquired immune deficiency syndrome (MAIDS) shares several common characteristics with human AIDS, including immunodeficiency, hypergammaglobulinemia, susceptibility to infection, both B and T cell dysfunctions, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and aberrant cytokine production. The etiologic agent of MAIDS has been identified as a defective retrovirus which contains major deletions in its pol and env regions but has largely maintained its gag region. The only gene product of this virus is a 60 kDa gag fusion protein, Pr60 gag, which is necessary and sufficient to induce MAIDS in susceptible mouse strains. The target cells of the MAIDS defective virus have been identified as belonging to the B cell lineage. Infection of these target cells with the MAIDS defective virus leads to their proliferation, which is required for the full development of the disease. We undertook several approaches in order to more clearly understand the role of the MAIDS defective virus target B cell population in the development of this disease. Studies using SCID, CD4 knockout, and nude mutant mice revealed that a relatively mature B cell population is the target of the MAIDS defective virus, and that these cells can be infected in the absence of CD4+ T cells. Our knowledge of the nature of the MAIDS defective virus target B cells was furthered by the derivation of two independent MAIDS defective virus-infected B cell lines which have characteristics of both mature and immature B cells. These B cell lines were used to demonstrate an in vivo association between Pr60gag and c-Abl. Additional exploration of the Pr60gag-c-Abl interaction revealed that Pr60gag could induce a CD8+ T cell-dependant rejection of v-Abl-transformed pre-B cell lines, and increase the tumor latency of mice inoculated with Pr60 gag-expressing B16F1 melanoma cells. Taken together, these results enhance our knowledge of the identity and role of the MAIDS defective virus target cells in the pathogenesis of this disease and propose a possible mechanism by which Pr60gag activates the disease process. As well as inducing MAIDS, Pr60 gag may also have potential positive use in cancer therapy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jolicoeur, Paul</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xk332.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k4340</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612q34t"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Doing business with the state : explaining business lobbying in the Arab world</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Moore, Pete Watson</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation addresses a basic question of nonviolent, state-society interaction in the developing world: under what conditions do nascent civil associations in non-democratic or semi-democratic contexts successfully lobby the state yet maintain their autonomy and avoid cooptation? To address this question, the study compares how the Chambers of Commerce in Kuwait and Jordan have lobbied their respective states. The approach involves a comparison within and between each country, dividing each case into four general time periods so that there is sufficient variation in political, economic, and social conditions. The problem of the study is that despite similar political, economic, and social factors, Kuwait's Chamber of Commerce has been more successful in affecting national economic policy than Jordan's Chamber. Why? This dissertation demonstrates that current theories privileging either, state-centric, structural-economic, or society-centric variables fail to account fully for the observed outcomes. Each offers insight but none satisfy. Instead, this thesis argues that two levels of factors, macro economic and institutional organization, combine to account for patterns of business lobbying. The first independent variable is sectoral differentiation of the private economy. For each country, different types of exogenous finances help shape different sectoral attributes within each economy. The degree of sectoral differentiation (whether it is high or low) determines the contours and divisions of the private sector in which the business association is embedded. Membership drawn from the private sector helps shape the broad constraints on the business, association. Two secondary variables at the association level---membership qualifications and voting rules---in turn determine the degree to which the rank and file can affect the association's leadership coherence.

Theories of spoken word representation and cognitive control were examined to explore the respective roles of linguistic and cognitive factors in the development of PA following debate in the research literature regarding the linguistic versus cognitive basis of PA. Pre-literate, kindergarten children were administered tasks assessing PA, spoken word representation in long-term memory, phonological encoding in working memory, and cognitive control at the beginning and end of the kindergarten year. At the end of grade one, the same children were administered tasks of reading in order to investigate the roles of PA and each of the linguistic and cognitive factors in the development of reading skills. While the ability to phonologically encode spoken words in working memory was a significant predictor of PA, spoken word representation in long-term memory and cognitive control were not causally related to PA. PA was the best predictor of the development of word identification skills in children; however, spoken word representation in long-term memory may play a role in the development of reading comprehension skills. These findings refute the theory of spoken word representation in long-term memory proposed by Walley (1993) and Fowler (1991) and suggest that the causal relationship between cognitive control and PA obtained by Tunmer et al. (1988) may be due to methodological shortcomings in their investigation. Finally, the theory that awareness of an awareness of phonemes arises from the acquisition of reading skills is challenged with the findings that pre-literate phoneme awareness is a significant predictor of reading ability approximately 18 months later. The implications of these findings for the diagnosis of reading disability and reading remediation are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Genesee, Fred</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988m75g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612q33j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reading readiness</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language awareness in children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hh24h"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Multinuclear solid-state and hyperpolarized Xenon-129 NMR studies of organic surfaces</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dickinson, Lucy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>While solid state NMR spectroscopy represents a versatile and widely applicable probe of molecular structure and behavior, the highly desirable goal of utilizing it to study surfaces of both bulk materials and thin films has, until recently, been limited by the insensitivity inherent to the procedure. This work examines and seeks to combine two approaches with which to overcome the problems arising from the physical restrictions of the Boltzmann distribution, which governs the NMR experiment. In the first part the bonding and dynamic properties of the highly popular self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are examined by multinuclear cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR, as well as a variety of more complex two dimensional experiments. In the past, many investigations of the three most widely studied SAMs, (alkylsilanes on silica, alkylphosphonates on metal oxides and alkanethiols on gold) have been carried out on monolayers synthesized on planar substrates. While such systems have been extensively examined by vibrational spectroscopy, ellipsometry and, electron scanning techniques, many fundamental issues have remained unresolved. The use of higher surface area metal oxide particles and gold colloids as substrates for the same self-assembled layers allows the use of NMR, which is shown to be a very good tool with which to gain molecular level information. This section addresses the validity of comparing SAMs on planar and particulate surfaces and expounds upon the wide range of experiments made possible by this methodology. The NMR study of surfaces of bulk materials such as polymers is precluded by the difficulty of distinguishing between bulk and surface nuclei as well as the relatively low concentration of surface species compared with bulk nuclei. The probe nucleus 129Xe has previously proved useful in the study of high surface area porous structures. Xenon is a large inert nucleus, which exhibits a wide chemical shift range on interaction with surfaces, allowing even weak Van der Waal forces to be observed. Its use has been restricted to porous materials and amorphous polymers and has typically required long acquisition times and high pressures of gas (a factor which complicates sample preparation). Recent advances have coupled the process of optical pumping of xenon via rubidium with the NMR experiment, leading to production of hyperpolarized xenon, which in turn yields a huge signal enhancement. In the second part the practical details of this experiment are presented. Initial work on bulk polypropylene and some polyalkylmethacrylates is described, the spectra above and below the glass transition temperatures are discussed in terms of chain dynamics. Finally the 129Xe probe is applied to a variety of SAM system as well as a polymer costing. The potential utility of the experiment as a complimentary tool for examining chain behavior is assessed along with the drawbacks and possible limitations of the current experimental set-up.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reven, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z948q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hh24h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Physical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881n75m"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Optimization of highly uncertain feedback in H [infinity]</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Djouadi, Mohamed Seddik</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation presents a new mathematical framework to optimize performance of multi-input multi-output feedback systems subject to large dynamical uncertainty. Optimal performance is represented by two-disc type optimization problems defined in appropriate function spaces. These optimizations are interpreted as shortest distance minimizations in special vector valued Hinfinity spaces. Characterization of various predual and dual maximizations shows existence of optimal solutions. Alignment conditions are exploited to show that the optimal solution is flat or "allpass", therefore generalizing a result obtained previously for single-input single-output systems. Detailed analysis gave further quantitative results, in particular absolute continuity of extremal measures is proven. This lead to extremal identities which provide a test of optimality. A novel operator theoretic framework is next developed. Key multiplication operators acting on particular vector-valued Hardy spaces are introduced. Subsequently, the optimizations are shown to be equal to the induced norms of specific operators. The latter are Banach space projections of multiplication operators, therefore analogous to the Sarason operator well known in the standard Hinfinity theory. Further computations show that these operators are in fact combinations of multiplication and Toepltiz operators. Explicit formulas for the optimal controllers are provided through existence of maximal vectors. Then "infinite matrix" representation with respect to a canonical basis is given, and the norms of the relevant operators are approximated by special matrix norms. These results are further generalized to unstable systems using coprime factorization techniques with similar conclusions. Relation to the standard two-block Hinfinity problem is investigated in the context of duality and operator theory. The optimal solution is then shown to be flat, implying that a well known Hankel-Toeplitz operator achieves its norm on its discrete spectrum for (possibly) infinite dimensional systems. Finally, the optimal robust disturbance attenuation problem for continuous time-varying plants subject to continuous time-varying uncertainty, is shown to reduce to finding the smallest fixed point of a two-disc type optimization problem under continuous time-varying control laws. Duality is then applied in the context of nest algebra of causal stable systems, and shows existence of optimal continuous time-varying controllers. It is also shown that for time-invariant nominal plants under time-varying uncertainty, continuous time-varying control laws offer no advantage over time-invariant ones.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Charalambous, Charalambos</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Caines, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k8889.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881n75m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awd375z08v"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin receptor traffic and signal transduction in rat liver</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Di Guglielmo, Gianni M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous studies have demonstrated that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) use common intracellular signal transduction pathways. This is remarkable due to the divergent cellular responses elicited from different RTKs. The insulin receptor (IR) is involved in blood glucose homeostasis whereas the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been linked to liver regeneration. We therefore used rat liver, an organ enriched in both EGF and insulin receptors, to study the specificity of signal transduction in vivo. Upon EGF administration, the EGFR at the plasma membrane (PM) was tyrosine phosphorylated on the major in vivo activation site, Y 1173, and recruited the adaptor proteins SHC and GRB2. Following ligand-mediated endocytosis, the activated EGFR was associated on endosomal membranes with the signaling complex SHC/GRB2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS. EGF administration also led to tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytosolic proteins focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and SHC. These observations were associated with increased MAP kinase activity and the transcription of c-myc, c-fos and c-jun. In response to insulin, IR kinase activity and autophosphorylation was observed at the PM but not after IR internalization into endosomes. This is postulated to be due to rapid degradation of insulin in the endosomal lumen allowing for the dephosphorylation of the IR by protein tyrosine phosphatase(s). To evaluate the role of endosomal degradation in IR signaling, an insulin analog, termed H2, was characterized for its clearance and processing in liver. Although liver uptake of H2 was similar to that of insulin, its clearance was slower. This correlated with reduced ligand dissociation from internalized IR as well as slower degradation kinetics. In response to H2, IR traffic was delayed in the endosomal apparatus. This occurred with increased IR autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity in this compartment. H2 but not insulin induced JNK activity and c-jun transcription. Insulin stimulated MAP kinase and glycogen synthase (GS) activities in rat liver. H2, however, was less efficient in inducing MAP kinase activity than insulin and GS activity was not observed. Impaired GS activity in response to H2 correlated with increased PKC activity. The above observations of insulin and H2 were not due to changes in SHC nor IRS-1 signaling. These studies indicate that the modification of RTKs at the level of the endosome alters receptor traffic and specificity of signal transduction pathways and support the hypothesis that RTK endocytosis plays a role in the regulation of RTK signaling.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bergeron, John J.

Directed flow of protons, deuterons, pi+/-, K+/- and antiprotons is presented as a function of transverse momentum for different particle rapidities and collision centralities. Directed flow of protons and that of deuterons are well described by a simple sideward moving and radially expanding thermal source model; the observed behavior of the directed flow of pi+/- indicates the interplay between shadowing and expansion; direct flow of K + and K- is observed to be anti-correlated to that of protons at low pt, implying that the role of absorption and rescattering is significant for kaons in the dense nuclear medium; the first observation of a large "antiflow" signal for antiprotons suggests that a strong annihilation process occurs in heavy-ion collisions at the AGS.

Then the model is tested with empirical data from the Fars Province of Iran. The survey data were collected in 1991--92 in five counties of Fars. It consisted of 10665 interviews and covered 67 villages 14 towns and one city. Three sampling techniques were employed: (1) proportional stratified sampling; (2) cluster sampling; and (3) simple random sampling. Three levels of analysis were carried out in this thesis: individual, societal and contextual. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were done for subsets of variables based on the child mortality model that were identified to be good predictors of child mortality and which were also identified theoretically as proximate and intervening variables. The individual level analysis reveals that place of residence, education of the mother, and occupation of the father from the socio-economic, factors; and age of marriage of mothers, pregnancy order, and pregnancy age from demographic factors; and visiting doctors during pregnancy, type of delivery, pregnancy duration, birth weight, and vaccination from the health status factors; and housing quality are the important determinants of child mortality in Fars. At the societal level, rural setting, the literacy rate of the villages and assets indexed by sheep per capita are the important determinants of child mortality. Also child mortality rate differentials were found to be compatible with that of additive developmental index of regions (counties). Contextual analysis shows that birth weight, pregnancy duration, pregnancy order, and house facilities are, in Iran, significant predictors of child mortality. Among all the variables, these variables appear to be the most proximate variables and the other variables, including socio-economic and demographic variables, significant intervening variables. The results of this dissertation support the claim that child mortality can be a sensitive indicator of human development and quality of life both at the individual and societal levels. Most significantly it appears to be prerequisite to fertility decline. The most important finding from these analyses is that child mortality is influenced both by the individual's characteristics as well as by community characteristics. In better words, social organisation as proposed in the child mortality model matters.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Masi, Antony</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mp014.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623f311</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children -- Iran -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children -- Iran -- Social conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children -- Mortality -- Iran</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vv945"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Optimal designs for change point problems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhou, Xiaojie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates Bayesian optimal design for change-point problems. While there is a large optimal design literature for linear and some non-linear problems, this is the first time optimality has been addressed for change-point problems. In designing a longitudinal study, the decision as to when to collect data can have a large impact on the quality of the final inferences. If a change may occur in the distribution of one or more variables under study, the timing of observations can greatly influence the chances of detecting any effects. Two classes of problems are considered. First, optimal design for the mixture of densities is investigated. Here, a finite sequence of random variables is available for observation. Each observation may come from one of two distributions with a given probability, which may differ from observation to observation. Such a problem may also be regarded as an application of the multi-path change point problem. Assume subjects may each undergo a single change at random change points with common before and after change point distributions, and at any instant a known proportion of the ensemble of paths will have changed. In either case, the goal is to select which data points to observe, in order to provide the most accurate estimates of the means of both distributions. Second, we study optimal designs for more classical change point problems. We consider three cases: (i) when only the means of the before and after change point distributions are of interest, (ii) when only the location of the change point is of interest, and (iii) when both the change point and the means of the before and after change point distribution are of interest. In addressing these problems, both analytic closed form solutions and modern statistical computing algorithms such as Monte Carlo integration and simulated an nealing are used to find the optimal designs. Examples that concern human growth patterns and changes in CFC-12 concentrations in the atmosphere are used to illustrate the methods.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wolfson, D.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Joseph, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qr35w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vv945</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Statistics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Applied Mechanics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n501j"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Age differences in the experience of pain in humans and animals</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gagliese, Lucia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The studies in this dissertation asses age differences in the experience of pain in humans and animals and the appropriateness of pain assessment tools across the adult life-span. Chapter I reviews age differences in experimental, acute and chronic pain in humans. Chapter 2 reviews age differences in the outcome of psychological treatments for chronic pain. It is concluded do there are age differences in each type of pain and that the elderly appear to benefit from psychological treatments as much as younger groups. Several experiments were conducted to examine the concepts that the elderly believe that pain is an inevitable part of aging and are not distressed by it, and that they experience less interim pain than younger patients. However, Chapter 3 presents two studies which find no age differences in pain beliefs. Furthermore, the studies described in Chapters 4 and 5 suggest that there may be age differences in the perceived qualities of chronic pain, measured with the short and full form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), but no age differences in pain intensity measured with single-item scales The data from Chapters 3, 4 and 5 suggest that the affective and cognitive components of chronic pain do not differ among age groups. Analysis of the psychometric properties of the pain measures suggests that verbal descriptor scales of pain intensity and both forms of the MPQ may be appropriate for use across the adult life-span. However, visual analog scales may not be appropriate for use with the elderly. To further elucidate the effects of aging on pain, Chapter 6 reviews age differences in nociceptive responsivity and pain behaviours in the rat. This review suggests that reflexive responses to nociceptive stimuli may not be age dependent although sensitivity on tests of more highly organized behaviours may decrease with age.

The operation principle of the axial field quadrupole ion beam guide is similar to the quadrupole mass filter operating in AC only mode but the rods were segmented and differential DC biases were applied to produce the axial field. It was operated in buffer gas. A Monte Carlo simulation was developed and the simulation results were compared with the experimental results. The beam distribution in a thermal equilibrium was assumed as the thermal equilibrium distribution in a simple harmonic motion with rf distortion and the assumption was confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulation. The temperature of the cooled beam was measured with a beam profile, measurement system which consists of a miniature quadrupole ion beam guide aid a rotating semi-circular Faraday plate. The temperature of the cooled beam was measured to be 0.0424 +/- 0.0026 eV in the experiment while that of the simulated beam was 0.0372 +/- 0.0009 eV. The variation of beam temperature with beam current was 0.0153 +/- 0.0026 eV/nA. The maximum achieved ion transmission was 80%. The transmitted ion beam's energy spread was measured with a retarding potential energy analyzer to be less than 0.1 eV. The cooling time was 0.7 ms with 1V/ cm axial field and was observed to be very dependent on the ion current when there was no axial field.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Moore, R.

However, it is apparent that the growth rate of an individual droplet is a function of the temperature and the vapor pressure in its immediate environment. These quantities vary from droplet to droplet and with time in a turbulent medium such as a cumulus cloud. In most theoretical and numerical studies of clouds, the hypothesis is made that these variations are unimportant when calculating the growth of an ensemble of droplets. The objective of this work is to determine the validity of this hypothesis. In order to do so we use a 3D turbulence model coupled with a cloud droplet growth model which solves for the trajectories and growth of several tens of thousands of individual droplets as a function of their local conditions (microscopic approach). A series of experiments with various initial size distributions were conducted using no turbulent flow conditions or one of three turbulent flows with increasing eddy dissipation rate. The results show that in the absence of any turbulent flow or sedimentation of droplets, the non-uniform distribution of cloud droplets in space results in significant variance of the distribution of the supersaturation perturbation over all droplets (DSP) and the distribution of the degree of growth (DDG), defined as the Lagrangian integral of the supersaturation perturbation along each droplet's trajectory. The variance of the DDG is directly responsible for the broadening of the microscopic size distribution relative to the macroscopic size distribution. However, in the presence of turbulence and sedimentation of droplets, the variance of the DSP is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the average, over all droplets, of the decorrelation time of the supersaturation perturbation decreases as a function of increasing level of turbulence. Consequently, the variance of the DDG is significantly reduced compared to the no turbulence and no sedimentation experiments and furthermore, it decreases as a function of increasing level of turbulence. We have found that for the typical levels of turbulence found in adiabatic cloud cores, the spatial distribution of the larger cloud droplets can significantly deviate from a Poisson distribution. The increasing preferential concentration as a function of increasing level of turbulence does contribute to an increase in the DSP as a function of increasing level of turbulence. However, the DDG decreases as a function of increasing level of turbulence. These results are at odds with those in the idealized studies of Pinsky et al. (1996) and Shaw et al. (1998). These authors specified and maintained very significant preferential concentration artificially rather than obtaining it by solving explicitly the trajectories of the droplets. Comparison of our results with the observations of Brenguier and Chaumat (096) made in adiabatic cloud cores lead us to the conclusion that the microscopic approach, even under the most favorable condition of no turbulence, produces too little broadening to explain the observations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yau, M.

(Dale Antony), 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation attempts to show that Aboriginal peoples' ways of thinking have not been recognized by early colonial European political thinkers. I begin with an examination of Kymlicka's political theory of minority rights and show that, although Kymlicka is a strong advocate of the right of Aboriginal self-government in Canada, he fails to consider Aboriginal ways of thinking within his own political system. From an Aboriginal perspective this is not surprising. However, I claim that Kymlicka opens the conceptual space for the inclusion of Aboriginal voices. The notion of "incorporation" means that Aboriginal peoples became included in the Canadian state and in this process their Aboriginal sovereignty was extinguished. Aboriginal peoples question the legitimacy of such a claim. A consequence of the Canadian government unilaterally asserting its sovereignty over Aboriginal peoples is that Aboriginal ways of thinking are not recognized as valuable within the legal and political discourse of sovereignty. In chapters two through five, respectively, I examine the Valladolid debate of 1550 between the Spanish monk Bartolome de Las Casas and Juan Sepulveda, The Great Law of Peace of the Iroquois Confederacy, Thomas Hobbes's distinction between the state of nature and a civil society, and Alexis de Tocqueville's account of democracy in America. Each of the examples, except for The Great Law of Peace, generate a philosophical dialogue that includes judgments about Aboriginal peoples. However, none of these European thinkers considers the possibility that Aboriginal voices could play a valuable role in shaping their political thought. To show the value of an Aboriginal exemplar of political thinking I consider the Iroquois Great Law of Peace. The Iroquois view of political sovereignty respects the diversity of voices found within a political relationship.

We shall see that the everlasting translation debate opposing faithfulness to betrayal can only find its resolution through a fresh interrogation of the notion of meaning, which is too often viewed as determined and translatable, thereby constraining the literary work. Thus, we found it necessary to return to the experience of reading as a pursuit of a meaning that is multiple and in movement. To better understand what this reading experience means, we turned to that special reader the writer-translator is, for he is involved both in the reading and in the writing of the literary work. In the intimate movement which leads from reading to writing, the writer-translator need not be faithful to the source language or to the target language, but faithful to what is revealed between the two, to what eludes them both. In this manner, translation becomes the pursuit of a third language, which would be as close as possible to the literary absolute of which all works, whether written by the writer-translator or by the author he translates, are translations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rivard, Yvon</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rg209.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816p23d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Language, Rhetoric and Composition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Literature, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v4733"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On-chip characterization of charge-pump phase-locked loops</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Veillette, Benoît R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An all-digital technique for the measurement of the jitter transfer function of charge-pump phase-locked loops is introduced. Input jitter may be generated using one of three methods. They allow trade-offs between test clock frequency, hardware requirements and accuracy. All the methods rely on delta-sigma modulation to shape the unavoidable jitter quantization noise at high frequencies. This jitter noise is filtered by the lowpass characteristic of the device-under-test and has a minimal impact on the test results. For response measurement, the phase of the output signal is compared against a jitter threshold. As the stimulus generation and output analysis circuits are digital and do not require calibration, this jitter transfer function measurement scheme is highly amenable to built-in self-test. The technique can also be used to adaptively tune a PLL after fabrication. The validity of the scheme was verified experimentally with off-the-shelf components.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roberts, Gordon W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bn475.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v4733</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qn73x"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The idea structure of students' written stories in grades 3, 4, and 5</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Senecal, Lynn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explored the development of students' written story structure over a three-year period. Twenty longitudinal writing files, each containing three science fiction stories written at the end of students' grade 3, 4, and 5 years, were studied. The idea development of these sixty stories (20 written at each grade-level) was examined through the use of two methodologies, a genre-independent Idea Analysis, and a genre-specific Narrative Analysis. These analyses were used to explore three aspects of idea structure: (a) idea production, (b) idea elaboration, and (c) narrative structure {i.e., setting, character, and plot development}. In the area of idea production, the following trends were identified: (a) significant growth from grades 3 to 5 in the number of idea units in students' stories, with a sharp increase in idea-unit production from grades 4 to 5, (b) steady growth in the proportion of embedded {i.e., complex} idea units in students' stories, and (c) steady growth in the proportion of Internal -State units {i.e., descriptions of story-characters' thoughts and feelings}. In the area of idea elaboration, proportions of both Descriptor- and Constraint-use remained stable across grades; in contrast, proportions of Rationale-use (a more specialized form of idea elaboration) increased steadily from grade to grade. Description was the highest-frequency of these three forms of idea elaboration, and the only one used universally by students. In the area of narrative structure, the number of setting elements in students' story openings increased steadily from grade to grade, with particularly strong emphasis on delivery of setting information in grade 5. Character description and narrative goal-setting means also increased steadily from grade to grade; however, within-grade variability was noted. The possibility that dialogue-use mediates growth in these two areas was explored informally. The developmental and instructional implications of these findings were discussed, and recommendations made for future study.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bracewell, Robert J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395w9214.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qn73x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Composition (Language arts)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m8365"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The geometry of Gaussian rotation space random fields</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shafie H., Khalil</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In recent years, very detailed images of the brain, produced by modern sensor technologies, have given the neuroscientist the opportunity to study the functional activation of the brain under different conditions. The main statistical problem is to locate the isolated regions of the brain where activation has occurred (the signal), and separate them from the rest of the brain where no activation can be detected (the noise). To do this the images are often spatially smoothed before analysis by convolution with a filter f&amp;thinsp;(t) to enhance the signal to noise ratio, where t is a location vector in N dimensional space. The motivation for this comes from the Matched Filter Theorem of signal processing, which states that signal added to white noise is best detected by smoothing with a filter whose shape matches that of the signal. The problem is that the scale of the signal is usually unknown. It is natural to consider searching over filter scale as well as location, that is, to use a filter s-N/2ft/s with scale s varying over a predetermined interval [ s1,s2 ]. This adds an extra dimension to the search space, called scale space (see Poline and Mazoyer, 1994). Siegmund and Worsley (1995) establish the relation between searching over scale space with the problem of testing for a signal with unknown location and scale and find the approximate P-value of the maximum of the scale-space filtered image using the expected Euler characteristic of the excursion set. In this thesis we study the extension of the scale space result to rotating filters of the form | S|--1/4f&amp;thinsp;(S --1/2t), where S is now an N x N positive definite symmetric matrix that rotates and scales the axes of the filter.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Worsley, K.

While Senlis has been studied in relation to the major late Gothic cathedrals of northern France, it has not been discussed in a broader context. This study, therefore, begins by examining the historical and political period prior to, and during the monument's reconstruction, the involvement of the monarch, Francois I (1515--1547), in the appointment of bishops to Senlis, and finally the procuring of funds for the rebuilding of the cathedral. The early building history of Notre-Dame at Senlis is, then, presented as a foil to the later rebuilding. Likewise, the late medieval building activity in Senlis proceeds a formal analysis of the cathedral and its symbolism. By focusing on the iconographic details, this study establishes the wealth of emblematic representation incorporated in the rebuilding of the cathedral and relates this aspect to contemporary royal building activity in France and abroad. As an important example of the increasingly politicized nature of ecclesiastical architecture prior to the outbreak of the Wars of Religion, the cathedral of Notre-Dame at Senlis affords a new perspective on the architecture of the late Gothic/Renaissance period.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boker, Hans J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708z47q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z9031635</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Church architecture -- France -- Senlis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cathédrale Notre-Dame (Senlis, France)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture and state -- France -- Senlis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zw189"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Enhancement of efficiency and accuracy of near-field measurements</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Séguin, Guy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the possibility of increasing the speed of Near-Field measurement of an Antenna, by reducing the number of measurement points and by determining the degree of truncation permissible while maintaining a prescribed degree of precision of the reconstructed far-field. The mathematical formulation leading to the near-field to far-field transform is presented in a novel and simpler form to use. Relations are established between the selected area and sampling rate of Near-Field measurement and the accuracy of the Far-Field of an Antenna. The spectral domain of the field is analysed in each case and parametric curves are derived. Correction of the spectral domain can significantly improve the accuracy of the Far-Field while using the same amount of Near-Field data. A new concept, described as the Signature Function, is presented, analysed and tested. This new concept offers the possibility of conducting a highly reduced set of measurements while producing accurate results for antennas whose "Signature Function" is previously determined or can be estimated. The simulated Near-Field of a radiating array is analysed in depth. A formulation and a procedure to correct the spectral domain of the field are established.

This approximation, valid for materials with large dielectric constants, can introduce a significant error in the simulation of piezoelectric crystals whose permittivity is comparable with that of free space. Because models that take into account the electric flux leakage are virtually non-existent, the objective of this thesis is to develop a solution of the three-dimensional piezoelectric problem which is referred to, by analogy with electromagnetics, as electrically unbounded. To begin with, the general piezoelectric boundary-value problem with open electric boundaries is stated in the form of differential, variational, and projective equations. The latter formulation serves to construct the finite element solution of the system of piezoelectric equations. Tetrahedral elements of high order, assembled by means of universal matrices, are used to approximate the coupled mechanical and electric fields in the interior region. The exterior infinitely extending electric field is modeled by a single 'superelement', obtained by the ballooning method, and automatically compatible with the interior finite element discretization. After imposing electrical, static or homogeneous, boundary conditions on the matrix equations, the associated deterministic problem is solved for the full piezoelectric static capacitance using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, while the eigenvalue problems are solved for the two resonant frequencies by a variant of the Lanczos method. Convergence and computer implementation of both methods, as well as of the associated data structures are described in detail. The effect of the external electric field on static and motional parameters is studied for various types of rectangular piezoelectric vibrators. Illustrative examples involving different geometries, materials, electrode shapes and modes show that the leakage field increases the static capacitance, reduces the effective piezoelectric coupling and the spacing between the two resonant frequencies, and activates many spurious modes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webb, J.

The proposition, which is expressed in a theory of community emancipation, is that human rights hold the key to the attainment of sustainable holistic development. The theory of community emancipation represents the Akan notion of rights which speak to the lived experiences (traditional, colonial and post-colonial) of Akan peoples. It is offered as a contribution to the evolution of distinct African notions of rights. The Akan perspective on rights aims at making human rights a more accessible concept that people can relate to and to use as an effective tool to attain development. The theory is used in a general context to analyse Western development foreign policies implemented in post-colonial Africa with the active collaboration of African leaders. It concludes that these policies "failed" due to the lack of attention to human rights. Consequent to this is the creation of a culture of rights abuse in Africa and the unfounded claim propagated by African leaders that human rights does not matter for Africans, and is not part of the African culture. The work also examines Western development policies in the post-Cold War era and concludes that in general the development NGO concept is not conducive to the promotion of sustainable holistic development in Africa. The solution, among others, lies in local human rights NGOs collaborating in a new relationship with their foreign counterparts; and both given a more prominent role to play in the political, as well as the economic liberalisation processes. The significant contribution of the work, inter alia, is linking the discourses in African philosophy and African notions of rights, which had hitherto gone their separate ways, through the theory of community emancipation. This results in the construction of new paradigm for examining rights in Africa from a developmental context. It is expected that this contribution could help enrich the international human rights discourse, contribute to plugging the loopholes and make the implementation of human rights more relevant and effective in Africa.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Toope, Stephen</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m3491.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117q64g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human rights -- Africa</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human rights -- Ghana</dc:subject><dc:subject>Philosophy, Akan</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
