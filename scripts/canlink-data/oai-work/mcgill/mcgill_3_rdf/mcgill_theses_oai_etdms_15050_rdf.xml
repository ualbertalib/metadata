A hospital-based case-control study of small-for-gestational age (SGA) newborns (birth weight below the 10th percentile, according national standards for gestational age and sex) was conducted in Montreal between 1998 and 2000. Controls were born at the same hospital and during the same period with birth weight at or above the 10th percentile. This analysis aims at investigating the effect of low alcohol consumption (0.25 to 3 alcoholic drinks weekly) during pregnancy on the risk of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth. Independent effects of wine, beer and spirits and of paternal alcohol consumption before conception were also assessed. The logistic regression analysis showed no significant effect of light maternal drinking during pregnancy on the risk of SGA birth. The association was also studied separately for consumption of wine, beer and spirits, and likewise for paternal alcohol consumption, with similarly negative results.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z875p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b217d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Infant, Newborn</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects -- chemically induced</dc:subject><dc:subject>Infant, Small for Gestational Age</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alcoholic Beverages -- adverse effects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fetal Growth Retardation -- chemically induced</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap5547v969"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The characterization of the cytoskeleton and associated proteins in the formation of wound-induced contractile arrays</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stromme, Adrianna</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The cytoskeleton is an intrinsic aspect of all cells, and is essential for many cellular events including cell motility, endocytosis, cell division and wound healing. Remodeling of the cytoskeleton in response to these cellular activities leads to significant alterations in the morphology of the cell. One such alteration is the formation of an actomyosin contractile array required for cytokinesis, wound healing and embryonic development. Cellular structure and shape depends upon tensional prestress brought about by the organization of cytoskeletal components. Using the Xenopus laevis oocyte wound healing model, it is first described how diminished cellular tension affects the balance of the Rho family of GTPases, and subsequently prevents the formation of actomyosin contractile arrays. This suggests that cellular tension in the cell is not created at the level of the cytoskeletal elements but rather via the upstream signaling molecules: RhoA and Cdc42. The role of N-WASP (Neural-Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome Protein), a mediator of Arp2/3 based actin polymerization, is next examined for its putative role in cellular wound healing. Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with mutant N-WASP constructs reveals in vivo evidence that functional N-WASP is required for appropriate contractile array formation and wound closure. Lastly, it is revealed that the cellular structures involved with single cell wound healing in other model systems are also important for the initial repair of severed muscle cells. Actin, non-muscle myosin-II, microtubules, sarcomeric myosin and Cdc42 are all recruited and reorganized at the edge of damaged C2C12 myotubes. This data promotes the possibility that an actomyosin array may be established in injured muscle cells as well.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jv658.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547v969</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Actomyosin -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein, Neuronal -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wound Healing -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Xenopus laevis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Contractile Proteins -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oocytes -- physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720h38m"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Kinetics of siderophore production by a marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sijerčić, Ada</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Siderophores are secreted by marine bacteria to increase Fe uptake when Fe is limiting but are not produced when sufficient Fe is present to saturate growth. These results are well established in laboratory batch cultures of a number of isolates obtained from the open sea. Little is known, however, regarding the kinetics of siderophore secretion by heterotrophic bacteria in response to transients in Fe deprivation and resupply. We examined growth, hydroxamate siderophore concentration, and electron transport chain activity (a biochemical measure of Fe nutritional state) of Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, a representative gamma-proteobacterium from the Fe deficient region of the subarctic Pacific Ocean. Hydroxamate concentration was roughly 5-fold higher in batch cultures grown in low than in high Fe medium. Iron injection to the low Fe cultures repressed hydroxamic acid production and increased growth and ETC activity. Steady-state hydroxamate concentration in the chemostat increased 5-fold as Fe-limited growth rate declined from 9.8 to 2.8 d -1. This increase compounded to a 2.8-fold change in hydroxamates cell-1 reflecting the greater costs of growth at low Fe. Three types of Fe perturbation were made to Fe-limited chemostat cultures: 1) A switch perturbation that decreased the dilution rate of the chemostat-by ~3-fold caused a transient increase in cell density that subsequently declined to a new steady state level. Hydroxamate concentration increased linearly over the same time. 2) A transient addition of dissolved Fe increased the total hydroxamate concentration in the chemostat within 1-3 hours which was followed by a decrease and then subsequent increase as the cells re-entered Fe-limitation. Dilution rate affected the response. Normalized to bacteria density, hydroxamate concentration remained constant for the first 2 hours after the Fe addition and then declined and returned to pre-infusion levels. Thus, Fe addition stimulated siderophore production by increasing the density of bacteria, which continued to secrete hydroxamates at a Fe-limited rate. 3) A continuous addition of low levels of dissolved Fe increased bacteria density and siderophore concentration. The net secretion rate of siderophores was proportional to the increase in Fe supply rate to the chemostat. At high Fe concentration, hydroxamate concentration declined to undetectable levels as the bacteria became Fe-sufficient and C-limited. Siderophore secretion by Fe-limited P. haloplanktis was repressed after 2 hours (corresponding roughly to 1-2 cell generations) following Fe re-supply.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930c175p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720h38m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Siderophores</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pseudoalteromonas</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marine bacteria</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r667m"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>DNA methylation of two milk protein genes in lactating and non-lactating bovine mammary gland tissues</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wang, Xiaoliang, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is well known that DNA methylation in gene promoter regions inhibits gene transcription and that tissue-specific gene expression is partially under the control of this transcription regulatory mechanism. In this study, bovine mammary gland tissues were collected from individual animals in lactating and non-lactating stages to investigate the DNA methylation patterns in the kappa-casein gene and alpha-lactalbumin gene core promoter regions using the bisulphite treatment in combination with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing. Different methylation status of each sample was classified into three categories, namely methylation at known transcription factor binding domains, methylation at core promoter non-binding domains and the absence of cytosine methylation. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify the transcription levels of the kappa-casein and alpha-lactalbumin genes from the collected samples. A comparative method was used and fold-change values were calculated based on the comparison of the normalized threshold values of samples from different physiological stages as well as on various methylation patterns observed in their core promoter regions. Statistical analyses showed that the expressions of the kappa-casein and alpha-lactalbumin genes were significantly different in lactating and non-lactating mammary gland tissues. The methylation observed in the core promoter region of bovine alpha-lactalbumin gene was found to be associated with its gene expression. On the other hand, the methylation found in the core promoter region of bovine kappa-casein gene did not have any effect on its gene transcript levels.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v6264.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r667m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lactalbumin</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetic regulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Casein</dc:subject><dc:subject>DNA -- Methylation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lactation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj6731753r"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evidence for the physical interaction of endosomes with mitochondria in erythroid cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kahawita, Tanya</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Utilization of iron by hemoglobin-producing cells is highly efficient. The acquisition of iron from plasma requires the binding of diferric transferrin (Tf) to its cognate receptor (Tf-R) on the erythroid cell membrane, followed by internalization of the Tf - Tf-R complexes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Through a poorly understood mechanism, iron is targeted to mitochondria, the site of heme biosynthesis. We believe that a direct interaction between iron-containing endosomes and mitochondria is essential for iron transfer to mitochondria and its efficient incorporation into heme. In order to illustrate the interaction between endosomes and mitochondria, we have employed flow cytometry. Flow cytometry analysis of reticulocytes (erythrocyte precursors which still synthesize hemoglobin) stained with fluorescent dyes specific to mitochondria and endosomes revealed three distinct populations: mitochondria, endosomes and a population labeled with both dyes. This double-labeled population suggests a population composed of endosomes associated with mitochondria. Using non-fluorescent diferric-Tf, we were able to remove the double population, leaving only the endosomal and the mitochondrial population. This finding has confirmed that the double population is the result of the interaction between the two organelles. Additionally, we established a cell-free assay consisting of fluorescent mitochondria and endosomes isolated from erythroid cells. Using confocal microscopy, we demonstrated a colocalization between the two organelles. We repeated the assay using fluorescent mitochondria and endosomes isolated from HeLa spinner cells. Using the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP, we were able to significantly reduce the colocalization between the two organelles, indicating that the interaction between the organelles is specific and that the mitochondrial potential is a requirement for organellar interaction. Based on our results from flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, we conclude that a specific and direct interaction exists between the two organelles.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xz583.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j6731753r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mitochondria -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heme -- biosynthesis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Iron -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Endosomes -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reticulocytes -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Erythroid Progenitor Cells -- metabolism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g607s"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Investigation of temporal scour development and flow dynamics around submerged deflectors in a laboratory flume</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rodrigue-Gervais, Karen, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although flow deflectors are routinely placed in streams to create fish pool habitat, there is dissent in the literature as to what constitutes for them an appropriate design height to ensure their success. Our objectives were to (1) examine the temporal evolution of bed topography around submerged deflectors in a laboratory flume, for different deflector heights and discharge; and (2) quantify the flow dynamics in their vicinity. Results indicate that, all else being equal, higher deflectors (characterized by less overtopping) produce a greater volume of fish pools. In contrast, over a fixed deflector design, a higher discharge (synonymous with greater overtopping) results in larger pools, because flow velocities are then faster. We also observed differences in the temporal behaviour of scour: that next to high and medium height deflectors is self-similar, but not that for the shorter model. Our results challenge the notion that low deflectors are ineffective, provide information on the development of scour next to submerged structures, and reveal key differences between the geometry of the scour holes engendered by the different deflector height models.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999b13h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g607s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fish habitat improvement</dc:subject><dc:subject>Groins (Shore protection)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fluid dynamics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Scour (Hydraulic engineering)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903346x"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Role of oxidative stress in the regulation of iron regulatory protein 2</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lee, Julie, 1983-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Iron homeostasis is regulated by iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, which bind to iron responsive elements (IRE) in the mRNA of proteins of iron metabolism such as ferritin (iron storage). IRP2 undergoes iron-mediated degradation, and this pathway shares notable similarities with that of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). It has been reported that oxidative stress marked by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal HIF-1 stabilization in hypoxia. The role of ROS in IRP2 regulation is not well-established. We show that the degree of hypoxia induces differential effects on iron-mediated degradation of IRP2, such that IRP2 levels are 3-fold higher when exposed to 0.1% O 2 compared to 3% O2 after 4 hours of iron treatment. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) affects IRP2 by inducing IRE-binding activity after 12 hours, which is accompanied by decreased ferritin levels. Furthermore, the ability of H2O2 to protect IRP2 against iron-dependent degradation is similar to that of hypoxia. Finally, both intracellular and extracellular sources of oxidative stress protect IRP2 from ascorbate-mediated degradation. Taken together, these results support a role of ROS in protecting IRP2 against iron-mediated degradation and indicate that oxidative stress modulates downstream effects of IRP2.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82kb90r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903346x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Iron -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oxidative Stress -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Iron Regulatory Protein 2 -- chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mj92k"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Assessing the potential of carboxylic acids as inhibitors of glycation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gao, Hong Ying, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Glycation is a series of chemical interactions occurring in food and biological systems between reducing sugars and proteins leading to the formation of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs). Ingestion of dietary AGEs and/or their formation in-vivo are mainly associated with cardiovascular and other age-related diseases and complications of long term diabetes. Potential strategies to prevent AGE formation can help to reduce risk factors associated with thermal processing of many foods. The overall objective of this research was focused on the identification of potential AGE inhibitors and investigation of their activity in glucose and ribose-based model systems containing lysozyme. The carboxylic acid functional group was chosen as a potential candidate based on their ability to interact with Schiff bases in addition to their ability to form amide bonds and carboxylate salts with the lysine side chains of proteins. The model systems were incubated with and without selected carboxylic acids (maleic, acetic, oxalic and citraconic) at 50°C for 12, 24 and 48h at pH 6.5. The effect of carboxylic acids on the glycation of lysozyme was studied by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The experimental results showed that none of the carboxylic acids were able to form amide linkages with lysozyme under the experimental conditions and only maleic acid was able to form carboxylate salts, however, oxalic acid was the only acid able to interact with the Schiff base and form 1,3-oxazolidine-4,5-dione intermediate and thus hinder its rearrangement into Amadori product and consequently inhibit glycation. As a result the percentage of free or unreacted lysozyme was the highest in oxalic acid model systems (9.4% in the case of glucose, 7.1% in the case of ribose system) and was even higher than the control systems (6.0% in the case of glucose, 1.2% in the case of ribose system) of both glucose and ribose. In addition, all carboxylic acids were able to modify the relative distribution of different glycoforms generated during the incubation period however oxalic acid was the most efficient in shifting the distribution of glycoforms to lower molecular weight clusters which can additionally contribute to its anti-glycation activity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214s67z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mj92k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Carboxylic acids</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lysozyme</dc:subject><dc:subject>Maillard reaction -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Glycosylation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gx22r"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of a mesoscale radiometer for weather research</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Meunier, Véronique Marcelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A new microwave radiometer, the Mesoradiometer, was constructed and the meteorological information contained in its data were examined.

A global defensive alliance in a graph is a dominating set S with the property that every vertex in S has in its closed neighborhood at least as many vertices in S as in V -- S. A global offensive alliance in a graph is a dominating set S with the property that every vertex in V -- S has in its closed neighborhood at least as many vertices in S as in V -- S. We first study alliances in graphs. There are many results in this area. For example, it is known that every connected n-vertex graph G has a global offensive alliance of size at most 2n/3. Another result is that any global defensive alliance in G has size at least ( 4n+1 - 1)/2. Our study focuses particularly on trees and algorithms for finding alliances in trees. We find the cardinality of a minimum global offensive alliance for complete k-ary trees and the minimum cardinality global defensive alliance for complete binary and ternary trees. Also, we present a linear time algorithm for finding the minimum global offensive alliance in a tree. Additionally, for a general graph, an upper bound is given on the size of a minimum global offensive alliance in terms its degree sequence. The methods that we use in this part of the thesis are mainly algorithmic and deterministic. Then we study independent dominating sets in graphs. An independent dominating set is a set of mutually nonadjacent vertices which is also a dominating set. This is a well-studied topic (see Haynes, Hedetniemi and Slater [22]). Our main result is to show that every d-regular graph of order n with girth at least 5 and satisfying d = o(1) and d2(log d)3/2 = o(n) contains an independent dominating set of size at most (1 + o(1)) nlogdd . This generalizes the results of Duckworth and Wormald [15] for random regular graphs. We construct the independent dominating set using recent probabilistic methods which resemble Rodl's semi-random method (see for example Alon and Spencer [1]).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311s95c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jf655</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Graph theory</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw3763b36m"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Biological markers of weight loss and muscle protein metabolism in early non-small cell lung cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mehrfar, Parisa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The loss of muscle mass leading to cachexia is rarely identified in early lung cancer. Fasting blood and muscle biopsy were collected in 59 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 16 non-cancer patients, at the beginning of thoracic surgery. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-6 were higher in NSCLC. In weight-losing NSCLC, food intake and serum albumin were lower, CRP, and TNF-alpha were higher. Although the expression of genes of the ubiquitin-proteasome system was not different, ubiquitinated-protein levels were lower and negatively correlated with ph-FOX01 in weight-losing patients. This would suggest lower muscle proteolytic rates in the early stages of NSCLC. Ph-FOXO1 also related to the degree of weight loss and stage of NSCLC. These data suggest that in early stages of the disease, weight and muscle loss could be mainly due to reduced food intake, rather than accelerated proteolysis, which reinforces the potential for successful dietary interventions to prevent or delay the onset of cachexia.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655k96k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763b36m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lungs -- Cancer -- Nutritional aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Weight loss</dc:subject><dc:subject>Muscle proteins -- Metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cachexia -- Molecular diagnosis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0g354j769"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Macula : for 10 instruments</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hindman, Heather</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Macula is a two-movement piece of music written for a mixed ensemble often instruments.

Through textual hermeneutics, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews with faculty members, I argue that WPC is constructing its own worldview and normative framework. It does this by selectively drawing from the religious traditions of ancient Greece, Buddhism, and Christianity, interpreting these selections in terms of Jungian psychology, and sometimes secularizing them.

It has been correctly proposed that deregulation of imprinted genes, expressed in a parent-of-origin specific pattern, leads to this pathology due to the fact that biparental and androgenetic HMs are indistinguishable at the phenotypic level. To determine the extent of the abnormal DNA methylation in two biparental moles from a family with a mutation in NALP7, we assessed long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), inactive X-linked genes and three tumour suppressor genes and demonstrated their normal levels of methylation. Since the identification of the NALP7 as the causative gene of recurrent HMs, the role of inflammation and immunity has come into light as a possible cause of this disease. Due to the known role of NALP7 in cytokine processing, we addressed the ability of the patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to secrete cytokines in response to stimulation with various antigenic molecules. We found a reduced level of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha secretion by the patients' PBMCs suggesting that abnormal processing of several cytokines may underlie this disease.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s596g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72pb86x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>DNA Methylation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydatidiform Mole -- genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahq37vs05p"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Genetic variability of growth curves in dairy heifers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yeboah, Charles Asomaning</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this study was to evaluate the variability of growth curves of dairy heifers and estimate genetic parameters. 15066 records taken from birth until 26 months (808 days) on 2754 heifers of Quebec were considered. The pedigree file comprised 10123 animals. The Mixed procedure of SAS with ordinary polynomials was used for simple phenotypic analyses, fitting fixed linear, quadratic and cubic regressions of body weight (in kilograms) on age (in months) as well as random intercept, and random linear and quadratic regressions for each animal. The Wombat program (Meyer, 2007), with Legendre polynomials was used to estimate the genetic parameters by fitting fixed herd-year-season of birth and quartic regression of body weight on age in days, as well as random regressions for quadratic additive genetic and cubic permanent environmental effects. Heritability estimates of body weight ranged from 0.22 at around 70 days to 0.45 at around 210 days. Heritabilities of body weight at birth and 808 days were 0.35 and 0.32, respectively. The additive genetic correlations between body weights at different ages ranged from -0.37 to 1.00. In general, the genetic correlations were higher than the permanent environmental and phenotypic correlations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zr96p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vs05p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Holstein-Friesian cattle -- Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Holstein-Friesian cattle -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heifers -- Growth</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pr29d"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Retailer compliance with youth access statutes and regulatory policies for lottery products and alcohol : evaluating the role of gender and vendor age</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>St-Pierre, Renee, 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite the implementation of legal prohibitions and regulatory policies to limit the commercial availability of lottery products to minors, published research continues to document a high prevalence of participation in and ease of access to lottery playing amongst adolescents. This study systematically investigated the influence of individual-level factors in vendor compliance with youth access statutes and policies for lottery and alcohol products. Six underage youths each attempted to purchase a lottery ticket, a beer, or both products together in the same 313 convenience stores, for a total of 1,219 purchase attempts. The results revealed that only a moderate proportion of vendors surveyed in this study were compliant with existing statutes and policies, and that gender and vendor age variables playa significant role in youth purchasing of lottery tickets and alcohol. These findings were interpreted in terms of their implications for strengthening regulatory policies and future research.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77st54n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pr29d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Alcohol -- Law and legislation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gambling -- Law and legislation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Retail trade -- Law and legislation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Teenage gamblers -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Youth -- Alcohol use -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agt54kr558"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Assessment of new iron chelating agents for treatment of iron-overload</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sarmento, Carlos V., 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Patients with acquired iron overload require chelation therapy using either Desferal or Exjade. Iron in excess may promote free radical formation in the Fenton reaction resulting in severe injuries of heart, liver and endocrine organs. Che1ators that bind ferric iron (Fe+3) in a 1:1 complex (Desferal) sequester it more efficiently than those che1ators that form 2:1 (Exjade) complexes. We initiated synthesis of new chelators derived from the tridentate chelator pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) and its analogs. The aim of the synthesis was to generate chelators that bind iron in a 1:1 complex, which was confirmed for 8LK02, 10LK02, 11LK02 and 15LK03 by spectrophotometry. All novel chelators mobilized iron more efficiently compared to Desferal and Exjade from murine reticulocytes and human myeloid leukemia cells (K562). Additionally, aforementioned four chelators were also more efficient than PIH and were found to be less or equally toxic as Desferal and Exjade.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290f056.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kr558</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Iron Chelating Agents -- therapeutic use</dc:subject><dc:subject>Iron Overload -- drug therapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524js345"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Traditional food consumption, anthropometry, nutrient intake and the emerging relationship between Inuit youth and traditional knowledge in a Baffin Island community</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yohannes, Sennait</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In 2006 a youth health survey was conducted in Pangnirtung, Nunavut as part of a community collaboration. The survey assessed food use, nutrient status and anthropometry. Thirty four percent of youth were above healthy weight; soft drink consumption averaged 1 litre per day; and nutrient intake distributions showed likelihood of inadequacies in the diet. Traditional food (TF) consumption, however, had a beneficial effect on nutrient status as iron, vitamin A and protein intake was significantly higher among those who consumed TF. Elder stories about TF were used as a pilot intervention aimed to promote TF by increasing traditional knowledge (TK) to community youth. Stories were played on a DVD and pre/post questionnaires were administered; independent and paired t-tests revealed a significant transfer of TK to youth. Qualitative analysis further revealed deep respect for TK, indicating that future initiatives should consider incorporating TK in health promotion strategies.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827g244.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js345</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teenagers -- Nunavut -- Pangnirtung -- Nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diet -- Nunavut -- Pangnirtung</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inuit -- Nunavut -- Pangnirtung -- Nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inuit -- Food -- Nunavut -- Pangnirtung</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avt150n474"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The competitiveness of Ontario dairy farms : a farm level analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Xu, Qing Yun</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Canadian supply managed dairy sector is likely to face more competitive pressure from challenges through the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the changing global trade environment. Therefore, it is highly prudent for Canadian dairy producers to focus their concern on their level of competitiveness and how to improve it. This study investigated the competitiveness of Ontario dairy sector based on a sample of farm level data with a Box-Cox transformed econometric cost model. The data were gathered by the Ontario Dairy Farm Accounting Project, for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007. The impacts of output, yield per cow and several farm-specific characteristics on the average cost of milk production were examined. Results support the presence of significant size economies and yield economies within Ontario milk production. Minimum costs were achieved for farms with approximately 125 cows. The results also indicated that some farm-specific characteristics, breed and region, also had significant impacts on the cost of Ontario milk production. However, it appears that Ontario farms may find it difficult to survive if they are forced to face international competition. Even at their minimum, average costs were above an indicator international dairy price.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pv12k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150n474</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dairy farming -- Economic aspects -- Ontario</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition -- Ontario</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy farms -- Ontario</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mj93v"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Socio-economic and physical development influences on water use in Barbados</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Suchorski, Alicia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Water scarcity has gained increasing awareness globally, and the small island developing states of the Caribbean, including Barbados, are not exempt from this global crisis. There is a large amount of variation to be found between Barbados' 11 parishes demographically, economically, and socially, with tourism encapsulating an especially significant sector for both the economy and water use, emphasized in certain parishes most prevalently. Surveys were carried out in four coastal parishes and respondents were asked various water-related questions for their household. The survey addressed a myriad of issues such as water availability, quality, categorizing responsibilities of water-related tasks, as well as a number of other topics. The number of surveys conducted was equivalent to one per cent of each parish population. The chi-square test for the analysis of a two-way contingency table was conducted to determine the influence of development and gender on parish households in differential water use, access, and perceptions of water. Surveys were completed to provide clarity to the objectives of the research which were twofold: to determine whether the amount of economic, social, and physical development of a parish influences the access and distribution of domestic water to households; and to uncover gender perceptions related to water use and determine how water use patterns and water consumption vary between genders in households. Parish development was a much stronger indicator for water usage and distribution rather than gender. All questions compared across parishes yielded at least one statistically significant response with the exception of determining whether water shortages affected lifestyles. Parish water use was highest in St. Philip (898.1 L/week/capita) and lowest in St. Lucy, (729.9 L/week/capita). The gender analysis provided statistically insignificant results except for the total respondents' water quality, and a household's satisfaction with their water situation, which were only significant for the total population and St. Lucy categories. Regarding division of labour within households, women still occupy the majority of tasks relating to water by spending on average 12.6 hrs/week on water-related domestic tasks; while males and children spend almost 5.6 hrs/week and 1.70 hrs/week respectively.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161971t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mj93v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Residential water consumption -- Barbados</dc:subject><dc:subject>Barbados -- Economic conditions -- 21st century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v627d"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification of a potent anti-invasive molecule through mixed targeting design</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Saade, Khalil</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The altered protein expression and activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (TK) are implicated in the progression of various types of cancers. One such dysfunction is the overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that correlates with aggressive tumor progression and poor prognosis. On the other hand, c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed and activated in a large number of human malignancies and has been strongly linked to progression to distant metastases. c-Src-induced phosphorylation of EGFR is required for EGF-mediated mitogenesis, tumorigenesis and tumour invasiveness. Thus we surmised that molecules termed "combi-molecules" designed to block both EGFR and c-Src should not only possess significant growth inhibitory potency but also strong anti-invasive properties. In this thesis, we utilized molecular modeling to design molecules containing two moieties: one that straddles the structure of the known Src inhibitor PP2 and the other that mimics the backbone of Iressa, a potent EGFR inhibitor. Of all the molecules synthesized, only SB163 containing the longest spacer between the two moieties was capable of inducing a dose dependent inhibition of both Src and EGFR. More importantly, SB163 blocked cell motility in the wound healing assay and showed significantly greater anti-invasive activity than a PP2+Iressa combination. The observation that SB163 was a less potent EGFR or Src inhibitor than Iressa and PP2 suggests that its superior potency when compared with the PP2+ Iressa combination may be at least partially attributed to mechanisms other than EGFR or Src blockade. This was also corroborated by the fact that SB163, despite its significant bulkiness (&gt;700) could induce dose dependent inhibition of other kinase such PDFGR and Abl. The results in toto suggest that conferring multiple kinase targeting properties to single molecules can lead to highly anti-proliferative and anti-invasive agents. Traditionally, multi-kinase targeted molecules were discovered serendipitously through multi-kinase testing. Here we initiated a more rational approach to the design of single multi-targeted molecules. Cancer being a complex disease driven by tumours characterized by multiple disordered signaling pathways, this approach may well represent a novel avenue in the therapy of refractory malignancies.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/028710534.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v627d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>src-Family Kinases -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src) -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antineoplastic Agents -- pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mn38v"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Parental involvement in private violin lessons : survey of teacher attitudes and practices</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kalverboer, Kenda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The primary research question of this paper examines teachers' philosophies concerning parental involvement and pedagogical practices. Specifically, what are violin teachers' attitudes and practices concerning parental involvement? Secondary research questions were formulated as a result of major topics arising from the review of literature and focused on how and why teachers formed their personal philosophies towards parental involvement. The following research is unique in that it defines the concept of parental involvement directly from the perspective of the teacher. Because anyone teacher oversees the development of many violin students, he/she is in an extraordinary position to comment on factors, conditions and behaviours across a large sample of students with differing types and degrees of parental involvement. Specifically, this study investigates factors of parental involvement that violin teachers believe to have a positive impact on student success.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv9356412.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mn38v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music -- Instruction and study -- Parent participation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education -- Parent participation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Violin -- Instruction and study</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505393h"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La mise en scène de l'interaction dans l'œuvre de Jacques Poulin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bujold, Marie-France</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Everyone would agree that there is little action in Jacques Poulin's works.

Before 1829, the Classic movement forbade spectacles of violence in the major theatres. However, with the production of the first Romantic play, Henri III et sa cour, the stage was transformed into a space of murder, physical brutality and suicide. In this study, we will interrogate the reasons for which violent acts reappear on the French stage. The influence of the guillotine will be examined as well as the sublime and grotesque nature of murder. The theories of Christine Marcandier-Colard, which explore the supreme beauty of criminality, will lead us to determine which ideologies are communicated through the depictions of death. We will also analyze the reaction of the public in regard to brutality in the theatre, as well as the role that violence plays in the development of a new society. Although violence inherently possesses a destructive value, its aesthetic value in the theatre advocates a veritable evolution of the French society towards democracy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gr768.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97kt897</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Violence in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>French fiction -- 19th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apn89d9973"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>--then time killed the wind-- : for percussion quartet and live electronics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tan, Anthony</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>...then time killed the wind... is an original musical composition scored for percussion quartet and electronics with a duration of fourteen minutes.
