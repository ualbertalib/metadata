The Preface reviews relevant anthropological literature in order to construct the theoretical context of the thesis. The Introduction then elaborates on the various voices embodied in the text, each of which expresses different types of cultural and critical information. Part 1 (Chapters 1-4), comments on Grace Ellison's stay in Istanbul harems in 1914, as described in An Englishwoman in a Turkish Harem. Part 2 (Chapters 5-7), engages in a dialogue with Pierre Loti as a representative of Orientalist discourse and comments on Zeyneb Hanoum's A Turkish Woman's European Impressions. Zeyneb Hanoum's experiences in Europe are then compared with Grace Ellison's stay in Turkey. The Conclusion offers a discussion and critique of feminism and representative writing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qj43v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w2985</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ellison, Grace.

(Caroline Eleanor)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum contains a novel cAMP-binding protein, CABPl, that is composed of two subunits. Anti-CABPl monoclonal antibodies were used to isolate a cDNA from a $ lambda$gtll expression library. In hybrid selection experiments, this cDNA was found to be complementary to mRNAs encoding both CABPl subunits and also to share some homology with two polypeptides, p34 and p31, that copurify with CABPl. Further analysis showed that the two CABPl polypeptides are identical except for an additional 37 amino acids present in the larger polypeptide. Both polypeptides are encoded by a single gene and the production of the two CABPl mRNAs is accomplished by an unusual splicing event. The p34 and p31 polypeptides are smaller but highly homologous to the two CABPl polypeptides and are probably produced in a similar fashion. The carboxyl halves of the four polypeptides show a 50% similarity to two polypeptides of a tellurium anion resistance determinant encoded on a bacterial plasmid.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79407z008.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042t719</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dictyostelium discoideum</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetic regulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cyclic adenylic acid</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881m680"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of particulate filler on molecular orientation in molten polyethylene</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mijangos-Santiago, Faustino</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research involves the study of the effects of the presence of a calcium carbonate filler, with particle sizes smaller than 1 $ mu$m, in the matrix of a medium density polyethylene on: (a) extrudate swell, (b) the relaxation expectrum, and (c) mechanical properties such as the Young's modulus and the yield strength. It was found that: (a) the Young's modulus and the yield strength are improved most when untreated filler particles are used, (b) the relaxation spectrum is shifted the most to longer times when untreated filler particles are used, and (c) extrudate swell is reduced by the presence of filler particles, due to some sort of interaction between them and the polymer molecules, and not by a simple substitution of polymer molecules by filler particles. Filled polymers were used to produce tubular extrudates in an attempt to use the long relaxation times to delay swell and thus maintain the anisotropy generated by flow through a die having an expanding channel. It was found that the storage modulus of samples taken along the hoop direction was not different from that of samples taken along the axial direction. This lack of anisotropy was attributed to the low shear rate in the die and to competition between extensional flow that tends to orient polymer molecules in the hoop direction and shear flow that tends to orient polymer molecules in the axial direction. It is concluded that it is not possible to obtain significant differences in the loss modulus between the axial and hoop directions, i.e., measurable anisotropy, unless one of these processes becomes predominant. The last part of the research involved a study of the role of uniaxial extension in promoting orientation. Molten strips were stretched at different strain rates, and it was found that molecular orientation in the stretching direction levels off at a particular strain rate. The maximum orientation depends on the treatment of the filler particles and on the additives used. This finding points to the possibility of using the total energy used to deform the molten strips as a criterion for obtaining the maximum molecular orientation in the direction of stretching.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225b708.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881m680</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78tc75d"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Three-dimensional analysis of digital subtraction angiograms for stereotactic neurosurgery planning</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mawko, G. M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Geometric and tomographic methods of reconstructing three-dimensional cerebral blood vessels from two-dimensional digital subtraction angiograms are studied experimentally. Three-dimensional vessel geometry is reconstructed from center-line coordinates of corresponding vessel branches in both stereo and biplane angiogram pairs. The problem associated with finding corresponding vessel branches in biplane images was shown to be reduced by re-projection of stereoscopically reconstructed vessels. Results indicate that the limiting factor in reconstruction accuracy is the degree of vessel foreshortening in biplane image pairs. An iterative algorithm ('Clean') is adapted to tomographic reconstruction of vessel cross-sections from a small number of views. Star-pattern artifacts in images initially formed by back-projection are removed by iterative deconvolution guided by 'a priori' object knowledge. This procedure is repeated for a set of two-dimensional sections that describe the three-dimensional vascular structure. Results show that there is sufficient detail in reconstructed sections to determine the location of vascular structures.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv273.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tc75d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36tz26s"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A controlled study of effectiveness and patient suitability for short-term group psychotherapy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McCallum, Mary</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A controlled, clinical trial investigation of short-term psychoanalytically oriented group psychotherapy (STG) was conducted which included eight psychotherapy groups led by experienced therapists. Patient psychological mindedness (PM) was investigated as a selection criterion and prognostic variable. Seventy-nine psychiatric outpatients experiencing prolonged or delayed grief reactions were matched for level of PM and then randomly assigned to STG or to a wait list. There was repeated measurement of several areas and sources of outcome. Results indicated a strong main effect for STG but not for PM on outcome, and some evidence of an interaction effect. Benefits were maintained at six-month follow-up. Psychological mindedness emerged as highly predictive of attrition and moderately predictive of psychodynamic work. Psychodynamic work was monitored by process analysis ratings and was modestly related to outcome. Methodological limitations, clinical significance, clinical implications, and suggestions for future research are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rm03n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz26s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s161688c"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the frontal lobe syndrome</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shue, Karen L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The usefulness of frontal lobe (FL) dysfunction as a conceptual model for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was investigated. Twenty-four ADHD and 24 normal control (NC) children were tested using tasks sensitive to FL deficits in motor control and problem solving skills and memory tasks sensitive to temporal lobe (TL) dysfunction. ADHD children differed significantly from NCs on measures of FL function, but not on tests of TL functions. Wherever norms were available for normal children on the same FL tests, ADHD subjects performed like 6 to 7 year olds, in spite of their mean age of 10 years and minimum age of 8 years. The differential performance of ADHD children on tasks sensitive to FL and TL damage supports the conceptualization of ADHD deficits as analogous to FL dysfunction and implies that deficits are not explained by reference to generalized impairment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq47q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161688c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hyperkinesia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Minimal brain dysfunction in children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak643b200z"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Avantages comparés, specialisation internationale intra-industrie et achats publics : aspects conceptuels, quantitatifs et institutionnels au Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Maschino, Denis</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924c49m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b200z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Natural resources -- Canada -- International cooperation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Industries -- Size -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Barriers to entry (Industrial organization) -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Industrial policy -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diversification in industry -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8623hz451"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>"It's a workin' man's town" : class and culture in Northwestern Ontario</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dunk, Thomas W.
