It is based on the premise that TDF are nothing but the rendering of a service product, whether final or intermediate, across national borders. Recognizing that international trade has become increasingly dependent on information exchange systems, the thesis asks whether or not NAFTA provides a solid legal framework to deal with discriminatory regulations, conflicting technical standards and protectionist measures that hamper the flow of information within the North American territory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glenn, H.

This thesis describes an online trajectory planner--a geometric controller--which evaluates a nonlinear memoryless function to map the current object position and velocity into a desired robot pose. If the robot tracks these set points, it is guaranteed to match the object's velocity and acceleration on a specified grasp surface. A planar simulation demonstrates that this paradigm performs favorably when compared with the traditional planning approach. Since it does not depend on future state predictions, no object model is required. Without trajectory prediction, the computational effort is drastically reduced, allowing for higher controller speed and tracking feedback gains. The geometric controller has been successfully implemented on the 7 dof Sarcos Dextrous Arm. In order to provide the critical local sensing just before robot-environment contract, this thesis reports on work in progress toward the development of a proximity sensing network, located in a robot's multi-fingered gripper. This network will form an integral part of a multistage sensing system with vision and tactile sensor pads. Sensing information is passed on to geometric controller which provides a framework for general sensor-based control of robotic tasks.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Buehler, Martin</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w450d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq646</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zd236"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Electrical behaviour of bismuth and platinum contacts to crystallized selenium</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Xu, Zhihong, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Diode structures have been fabricated involving a thin film of bismuth or platinum deposited on a layer of polycrystalline trigonal selenium, itself deposited on a substrate of either bismuth or platinum. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements on the diodes indicate that the Se-Bi and Se-Pt contacts are basically Schottky junctions with low barrier heights. Despite these barriers, near-ohmic contacts were obtained with bismuth or platinum layers thicker than about one micrometer, due to junction shunting. The barrier height for the Se-Pt contact was estimated to be about 0.3 volt below that of the Se-Bi contact. Negative capacitance, at a frequency of 100 Hz or less, was observed with forward bias on some of the Se-Bi diodes, with electrical characteristics similar to those reported earlier for Se-Tl. It was shown experimentally that the negative capacitance did not come from inductance sources external to the sample. An aging effect was observed whereby a sample, where originally the capacitance was entirely positive, showed negative capacitance after a storage period of about ten months. Negative capacitance was created in Se-Bi diodes by incorporating a thin high resistance layer of CdO into the devices during fabrication. Furthermore, a decrease of negative capacitance was found with increasing the counter electrode area. Negative capacitance was also observed in diodes fabricated using CuInSe$ sb2$. To explain the main electrical characteristics, an equivalent circuit model is proposed, involving a fixed inductive element L, arising from carrier transit delays in the junction during high level injection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Champness, C.

The MWD affects both the processing and solid state performance properties of polymeric materials. Currently the analytical method for evaluating MWD involves the use of gel permeation chromatography (GPC). This is a labor and time intensive procedure, with the accuracy of the results depending strongly on the skill and experience of the equipment operator. Furthermore, GPC is not sensitive to small amounts of high molecular weight material that can have an important effect on processing and product properties. Thus GPC is far from ideal as a tool for industrial quality control. It is known that the rheological properties depend on the MWD, and it has been proposed that complex viscosity data be used to infer the MWD for commercial polymers. There has been some degree of controversy as to whether this is feasible, but recent results of Shaw, Tuminello and their coworkers indicate that for linear polymers this is, in theory, possible. However limitations in the accessible range of frequency, as well as inevitable experimental errors pose serious barriers to the use of such a procedure. We have investigated the severity of these baniers and have shown that within certain, reasonable constraints complex viscosity data can be used to infer a realistic MWD and that this procedure could be used for routine quality control in a production facility.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dealy, John</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214r27s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75df638</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plastics Technology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r074x28j"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Parametric study of vapor explosions using flash x-rays</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Watts, Philip</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of fluid properties on the fragmentation behavior of a single molten metal drop interacting explosively with coolant has been investigated experimentally with high-speed regular photography and flash x-ray radiography to visualize the bubble dynamics and drop fragmentation, respectively.

(James Patrick)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The neuromuscular system interacts with the environment by generating forces that cause motion about joints. The study of this interaction is termed joint dynamics. If the environment is controlled, as it is in experimental situations, then it is possible to draw conclusions concerning the nature of the intact neuromuscular system by studying the nature of environmental interactions; i.e., by studying joint dynamics. The properties of the neuromuscular system, as manifested by the dynamic properties of joints, vary through time as a result of variations in the state of the physiological structures involved. Identifying the time-varying dynamics of joints under controlled circumstances is an important step in the development of a comprehensive model of the neuromuscular system. This thesis presents the results of applying a method of nonparametric time-varying linear system identification to study the dynamics of the ankle joint as they vary during a single twitch of the triceps surae muscle group. In accord with previous time-invariant, and time-varying studies, the nonparametric results were characterized using a second-order model. Past studies have found that second-order models successfully characterize joint dynamics under time-invariant conditions. Time-varying studies have, however, found that second order models do not adequately characterize time-varying joint dynamics. The results presented here confirm that. Furthermore, examination of the reasons for this failure leads, with tentative analytic corroboration, to the conclusion that a fourth order linear model is required to characterize the time-varying dynamics of joints.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kearney, R.

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix in each equation are derived and their significance to the nature and existence of load flow solutions is discussed. An experimental study is also done on the load flow feasibility region which is defined, in the space of net real and reactive powers as well as the voltage magnitudes squared, for a general power network. The network is assumed to consist of a slack bus, voltage control buses and load buses.

The starting point is a comparison of the performance of three widely used methods (i.e., Jameson's, MacCormack's and Godunov's) in several rather difficult test problems, characterized by the existence of flow discontinuities or strong nonlinearities. This indicates that the best solutions for such flows are obtained when the numerical method is closely related to the physical behaviour of the fluid, as is the case with Godunov's method, in contrast with the other two methods, which need a special treatment of the discontinuities, and are very prone to numerically induced oscillations. Therefore, a first scheme, which improves the way Jameson's method computes the flux-node variables in that it treats in a more realistic manner the physics of signal propagation in both subsonic and supersonic flow, is developed. The numerical experiments with this scheme suggest that it converges more rapidly and does not need the dissipation terms, thus leading to computer efficiency and a gain in accuracy. The second method is a linear hybrid, in conservative form, between MacCormack's and Godunov's methods, which is shown to keep the best features of both the methods: second order accuracy in smooth regions of the flow and lack of oscillations near discontinuities, where it behaves locally like a first-order monotone scheme.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>D., Mateescu</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881p143.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w451p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qr65m"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Minimum cross-entropy tomographic image reconstruction from sparse projections</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sigurdsson, Helgi Grétar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis considers two-dimensional tomographic image reconstruction from sparse projections using the minimum cross-entropy principle. Given a finite set of projections of a two-dimensional function with compact support, an estimate is obtained of the function in an iterative manner. The image support region is discretized into nonoverlapping square pixels and three different methods are derived to model the projection measurements and the associated pixel contributions. Two new iterative reconstruction algorithms are presented. The first algorithm uses the Lagrange method to minimize the cross-entropy criterion, where the Lagrange multipliers are iteratively found. The second algorithm uses a simple penalty method, where a quadratic penalty function is used along with the gradient descent method. The two algorithms are compared and examined using computer-generated projections. Their performance is analysed under three different projection path models for both parallel and divergent data collection and different types of a priori information and the results are reported.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morgera, S.

There are more and more applications for which the cleanliness of the liquid metals has to be qualified that the number and size of inclusions must be controlled below some acceptable limits. Such demands for quality have resulted in the development of measuring systems that can count the number and size distribution of inclusions. One such device, the so-called LiMCA (Liquid Metal Cleanliness Analyzer), which was developed at McGill University, measures inclusions in liquid metals and has been successfully used in the aluminum industry for years. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technology has been successfully applied to upgrade the LiMCA system. With this technology, the DSP-based LiMCA system is able to describe each LiMCA transient by a group of seven parameters, and with the help of them, classify it into a certain category. Moreover, it simultaneously counts the classified peaks based on their height and their time of occurrence.

A reduced gravity environment assisted in the generation of a quiescent, uniform dust suspension of known concentration, by allowing time for the decay of dispersion turbulence in the absence of gravity sedimentation. The difference between the theoretical and experimental maximum explosion pressures was systematically studied. Heat loss mechanisms, conduction and radiation, were evaluated in order to determine their contribution to the experimental pressure deficit. Gaseous explosions were also studied to validate the method of analysis and to provide a basis for comparison. It was found that conduction plays a negligible role in reducing the maximum explosion pressure in both gaseous and dust combustion until the flame is within one flame thickness from the vessel wall, causing flame quenching. The most significant factor in reducing the maximum explosion pressure was found to be flame quenching by the chamber wall in both the dust and gas flames, however radiative heat loss was found to contribute up to 10% of the experimental pressure deficit in the highly luminous aluminum dust flames.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lee, John H.

These interest points will be used by a robot-mounted camera to focus its attention. The camera output has a nonuniform sampling resolution, modeled after the primate visual system. It provides a central high resolution foveal region surrounded by a much coarser peripheral region. The objective is to continuously position the camera so that the interesting areas in the scene lie within the foveal region. To this end, a computational model of visual attention has been developed and implemented in this thesis. The algorithm is based on psychophysical experiments of human gaze fixation. Using context-free edge information as input, interest points are defined as centres of regions surrounded by edges. This is shown to be equivalent to defining interest points as the points of intersection of lines of symmetry between edges in an image. By adopting a symmetry measure based on the loci of centres of cocircular edges, a novel, real-time method for computing these interest points is proposed. The algorithm has been implemented on a parallel network of Texas Instruments TMS320C40 (C40) processors. With this configuration, processing rates can exceed ten frames per second, depending on the algorithm parameters. The thesis also shows results of the algorithm applied to a wide range of real-world images, both foveal and peripheral, as well as an analysis of parameter sensitivity, and system throughput and latency.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cevine, M.

The presence of stress singularities at the ply interfaces along the free edges is studied. The importance of determining all terms, including interlaminar stresses, in investigating the failure of composite plates is also shown. The simple composite plate, the pin-loaded composite plate, and the bolt-loaded composite plate are analyzed three-dimensionally. A new "slice" model is developed to simulate the simple composite plate. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is performed with the "slice" model to verify the accuracy of the 20 node isoparametric element. The same stress analysis technique is subsequently performed to study the more complex pin- and bolt-loaded laminate problems. This method determines the entire stress state for each of the three problems. A failure initiation model is developed and used to predict the failure initiation of the pin- and bolt-loaded composite plates. The model is used to determine the failure initiation modes: Matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. Experiments are undertaken for comparison with predicted results. Excellent correlation is achieved between predicted results and experimental data. The effect of geometric parameters is also studied. The investigation provides a method to predict all failure modes by taking into account stress singularities at the free edge, using three-dimensional finite element analysis, and applying a proper failure analysis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lessard, L.

To take full advantage of the benefits of these materials, it is essential to be able to predict their behavior under impact. The continuum damage model by Nemes and Randles attempts to answer that need. For a complete formulation, the rate dependence of the material under the different modes of damage has to be quantified. Experiments, where the modes of damage are isolated from each other are therefore needed. A punching experiment was chosen to isolate the transverse shear response of the composites. The tests were conducted on a 24 ply graphite/epoxy AS4/3501-6 quasi-isotropic lay-up over a wide range of loading rates. Low and medium rate experiments are performed using a hydraulic testing machine with a specially designed punch shear fixture to obtain load versus displacement results. High rate experiments (in the order of 10$ sp3$) are performed using a punch shear version of the split Hopkinson bar apparatus, which was developed as part of this project. For both kinds of tests, load versus displacement curves were obtained at different loading rates. The specimens were x-rayed to evaluate the damage inflicted to the specimen. Optical microscopy of sectioned samples of partially punched specimens was used to construct a sequence of the damage process. Cracking initiates in the shear zone of the specimen side contacted by the punch bar. This is followed by delamination in the lower part of the plug. Finally, after significant rotation of the material, tensile failure occurs. The plug can then be pushed out.

A two-dimensional heat transfer model was constructed utilizing the explicit finite difference method. This heat transfer analysis is then used to calculate, in detail, the temperature distribution within the cross-sectional area of the product, during interstand cooling and in the roll gap. Radiation and convection from the surface, when the material is between stands, and conduction to the rolls and deformational heating, when the material is in the roll gap, are the effects taken into account. A strong emphasis was put on the construction of a user-friendly, graphical interface to encourage use of the model. It was constructed to run as a Microsoft Windows$ rm sp{TM}$ application, and much of the data is represented with colour schematics and the usual graphical output. The results of validating the model against different sources have been documented and are shown to agree favourably with predictions of another model (FASTP) and the measured data, thus confirming the integrity and accuracy of the algorithms used. Due to the geometry of the nodal elements used, it was shown that the model is limited to a width-to-height (or height-to-width) ratio, of less than 2.5 in order for the isotherms to appear 'normal'. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the coefficient for heat transfer from the surface of the product to the surface of the rolls is one of the variables which greatly influences the final temperature predictions. The model was also relatively sensitive to the initial temperature and rolling speed, but these can be measured with reasonable accuracy. In contrast, the coefficient for heat transfer between surfaces cannot be measured with much certainty nor calculated easily.

The log-domain filter is a novel form of continuous-time filter which shows promise in this area. Based on the translinear principle, log-domain filters are simple in structure, fast and easily tunable. This thesis will present a technique for the design of log-domain filters which is based on the operational simulation of LC ladders. The technique is demonstrated through the complete design of a fifth-order Chebyshev log-domain filter, as well as the design of elliptic and bandpass filters. The filters were fabricated using the Gennum GA911 bipolar transistor array technology. HSPICE simulation and experimental results are shown with emphasis on frequency behavior and linearity. The filters showed good correlation between the measured response and the original specifications. They were tunable over two decades and could be operated up to 1 MHz or 1/10th of the $f sb{T}$ of the slowest transistor. Total harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion was measured with results ranging from $-$45 dB to $-$70 dB.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roberts, Gordon W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gg09w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881p15c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9w032507t"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An expert system for EEG monitoring in the pediatric ICU</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pasupathy, Anitha K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A knowledge-based expert system was developed to assess the level of abnormality in the brain electrical activity of pediatric patients monitored in the intensive care unit. Six hours of an 8-channel EEG record serves as the input to the monitoring device based on which the brain activity is classified as being normal, mildly abnormal, moderately abnormal or severely abnormal. Spectral band activity is computed for each channel for every 30-second epoch. Artifact rejection is accomplished by a median filter with a hard-limiter thresholder. Quantitative variables reflecting possible abnormality: a measure of amplitude depression, a measure of assymmetry, a measure of anterio-posterior differentiation and a measure of EEG variability over time are extracted from each EEG record. Statistical distributions of these measures are established for a control "normal" population of about ten patients so classified by a neurologist on visual interpretation. New EEGs to be analysed are statistically compared with the control population and a probability measures of normality for the various measures are determined. The expert system learns from prior examples of classification done by the neurologist by a technique of inductive machine learning. The monitor is trained and tested using sixty examples using the rotation method of error estimation. The monitor had a tendency to classify the EEGs with a higher level of abnormality than the expert. Possible reasons and potential solutions are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161829m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032507t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wj107"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study on the time warp synchronization mechanism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pang, Albert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we present a brief introduction to distributed systems and highlight the issue of synchronization among processors in such a system. Traditionally, synchronization among processors in a multiprocessor system is achieved by conservative methods, based on block-resume mechanisms. Recently, an optimistic approach based on the virtual time paradigm, more commonly known as the time warp mechanism, has received a great deal of attention. In recent years, considerable work has been published describing how these systems are implemented, however, the performance analyses of such systems are lacking. In this thesis, we present several performance analyses which include, the analytical solution of a simple two processor system and the analysis of a homogeneous multiprocessor system. We also present performance analysis of a simple heterogeneous, multiprocessor time warp system, by simulations. In general, we find that the overall performance degrades as the system becomes more and more heterogeneous.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morgera, S.

This requires the generation of a spatial grid over which the problem is discretized. The grid generation process adds to the complexity to the problem being solved, especially in the case of complex body-shapes with flow discontinuities, such as shock waves and sliplines. ALso, the Euler formulation is difficult to use for the aerodynamic problems of unspecified geometry. A Lagrangian formulation permits to avoid the complexity of a grid generation while making it possible to obtain very accurate results. This Lagrangian formulation use the stream function and Lagrangian distance to represent the flow instead of the Cartesian coordinates. Thus, the streamlines become coordinate lines in the Lagrangian formulation, which can easily represent complex body-shapes and sliplines, and is also more suitable to solve complex problems involving bodies of unspecified geometry. This method was tested and validated against several test problems of specified geometry, including the supersonic flows with shock waves in a duct with a circular arc bump and past airfoils, as well as the flow in a nozzle. The solutions obtained with this Lagrangian method were found to be very accurate, displaying a high at a computational efficiency (actually providing second-order accuracy at a computational load of a first order solution). Then, this Lagrangian method has been used to solve several aerodynamic problems with geometrically-unspecified body-shape, such as (i) the determination of the geometry of a bump corresponding to a specified pressure distribution in supersonic flow, and (ii) the design of the geometry of a supersonic nozzle, based on the reflection-suppression condition, for a specified uniform flow at exit.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mateescu, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vw11m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g228z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nk28s"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification and control of the redundant linear drives of two anthropomorphic robots</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nahvi, Ali</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a step towards the model-based control of two redundant robots. In the first part of the thesis, a method is presented for autonomous kinematic calibration of a 3-DOF redundant parallel robot. Multiple closed loops are used in a least squares optimization method. Some numerical methods such as column scaling of the gradient matrix and observability indices for the best pose set of robot calibration configurations are discussed. Four observability indices are considered analytically, geometrically, and experimentally. Two of these indices are presented for the first time. The fourth observability index is proved to be the unique criterion for the best pose set in robot calibration. Experimental results are compared with the results obtained using an external calibration device. In the second part of the thesis, dynamics and friction modeling of the Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand is sought. These models along with actuator model are used in a low level model based force control. It is shown that tendon dynamics does not affect the control performance. On the other hand, it is shown that friction is a major factor which should not be neglected in the force control. The improvements achieved by the feed-forward terms are illustrated. Actuator saturation is rigorously investigated. It is shown that the maximum force bandwidth before the occurrence of saturation is 10 Hz.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hollerbach, John M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p682k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nk28s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8623j1033"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Measurement of residence time distribution by laser absorption spectroscopy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nadeau, Patrice</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The residence time distribution was measured at ambient temperature and pressure in a tubular reactor with radial injection at very short space times (0.04-0.7 s).

These compression test were performed at a constant strain rate of $1.8 times10 rm sp{-4}s sp{-1}$ over a 600$ sp circ$C temperature range (i.c. from 1200$ sp circ$C- 600$ sp circ$C) at four different cooling rates (0.25, 0.5. 1.0 and 2.0$ sp circ$C/sec). The reheating temperature and time were varied and the effect of this on precipitation is discussed. The analysis of the CCC test results, and the optical microscopy observations, indicated that neither solute drag nor phase transformation is responsible for the deviations observed in these flow curves. TEM bright field images were used to verify the presence of precipitates, and to calculate the strengthening influence of these particles on the flow curve. It is shown that, in the niobium bearing materials, the precipitation of carbonitrides is responsible for the increase in flow stress. Conversely, in the titanium bearing materials, the titanium carbonitride precipitates were determined to have no effect on the flow stress. It was discovered that increasing the solution temperature and time resulted in the occurrence of precipitation at higher temperatures, and that these precipitates were coarsened to a greater extent. Also, when the holding temperature and/or the holding time was decreased, the amount of niobium put into solution decreased, which led to precipitation starting at lower temperatures. A method was developed for determining the precipitation start and finish temperatures from the CCC results. These temperatures were converted to precipitation start and finish times for each of the four cooling rates. This revealed that the precipitation start and finish times increase with decreasing cooling rate in both the 0.2% Nb and 0.1% Nb + 0.1% Ti stainless steels. Finally, a continuous cooling precipitation diagram was constructed for the two niobium bearing materials using these start and finish times.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jonas, John J.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Yue, Steve</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237ht80m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848s61b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z9032003"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Compliant articulated robot leg with antagonistic LADD actuation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mennitto, Giuseppe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis describes a new Compliant Articulated Robot Leg (CARL) which is a prototype leg for an autonomous quadruped robot.

We also address scan conversion from interlaced to progressive formats, also known as deinterlacing. For this purpose we examine adaptive weighted and switched techniques based on spatial and motion-compensated deinterlacing. We introduce a motion-adaptive frame rate conversion based on motion-compensated and temporal interpolation. When motion is relatively low at a pixel neighborhood, temporal interpolation will be carried out, otherwise motion-compensated interpolation will be performed. Indeed when motion is relatively high, temporal frame rate conversion causes repetition of contours and jerkiness. We develop and use a Maximally Flat Digital Filter for generating the samples that will be used in temporal interpolation, and this to improve the quality of this interpolation. We compare motion adaptive frame rate conversion with MPEG-2 conversion, using both visual and PSNR criteria. We also propose a new scheme that achieves multiscale spatial conversion: pattern motion-compensated interpolation. For this we develop a least square solution using Cauchy steepest descent. We further prove the existence and uniqueness of such solution. This method gives better visual quality images than cubic, MPEG-2 and pattern interpolation. Finally we analyze the impact that different interpolation algorithms have on MPEG-2 scalable video coding. We present a new down conversion that replaces the MPEG-2 one and removes the aliasing introduced by this method.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dubois, Eric</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p683v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k7219</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
