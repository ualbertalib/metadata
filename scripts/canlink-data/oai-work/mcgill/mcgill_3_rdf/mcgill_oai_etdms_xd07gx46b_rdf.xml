Donald</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The realization that electricity was closely associated to living matter was reported in 1773 when Hunter (21) described the electrical potentials of the Torpedo fish. A few years later Galvani (17) produced a muscle contraction in the frog with a zinc-copper couple. Further research showed that electrical currents were associated not only with animal life but also with plant life. Plants have a potential which is most marked in the growing parts, as near a root tip. [...] </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morton, H.
