It discusses linguistic and psycholinguistic perspectives of the mental lexicon and the role of compound recognition data in the formulation of hypotheses about lexical access and representations. In a series of three experiments it was found that existing compounds such as "warehouse" appear to be represented in the mental lexicon as morphologically-complex full forms. On the other hand, novel compounds such as "winehouse" appear to be decomposed into their constituent morphemes in the process of word recognition. It was also found that the constraints of English orthography play a significant role in the interpretation of novel compounds. The locus of the orthographic effect, however, appears to be post-lexical. The results of this study of compound recognition are consistent with a view of the lexicon as a self-reorganizing store of knowledge, which is characterized by cost-free storage and access.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fc37v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sh06p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Morphemics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Morphemics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811kk34s"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Catecholamine uptake and release in chromaffin cell cultures : a possible role for calmodulin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kenigsberg, Rhoda Leah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In view of calmodulin's widespread role in calcium-regulated processes, together with the requirement of Ca('2+) for chromaffin cell secretion, a possible role for calmodulin in translating the Ca('2+) signal for secretion is suggested. Isolated bovine adrenal medullary cells were maintained in monolayer culture and their morphological and functional characteristics examined. The cultured chromaffin cell was found capable of accumulating exogenous amines via a high affinity uptake(,1)-like process which closely simulated the neuronal process in many respects but demonstrated neither stereo- nor structural selectivity. The accumulated amines appeared to be uniformly distributed within the chromaffin cell as they were released in parallel with and in equal proportion to the endogenous chromaffin cell catecholamines. This finding proved invaluable in designing a rapid reproducible method for assaying for catecholamine release from the chromaffin cells in culture. Catecholamine secretion from the chromaffin cells in response to stimulation with either acetylcholine or a depolarizing concentration of K('+) is a Ca('2+)-dependent event. The stimulation-induced amine release was reduced in the presence of trifluoperazine, an antipsychotic agent and potent calmodulin antagonist. However, trifluoperazine blocked catecholamine release from the cultured chromaffin cells at a step distal from Ca('2+) entry, thus providing indirect evidence for a role for calmodulin in the secretory process. More direct evidence for a role for calmodulin in the process of secretion was provided with the use of antibodies raised against calmodulin. In this regard, erythrocyte ghost-mediated microinjection of calmodulin antibodies into viable cell cultures inhibited stimulus-evoked catecholamine secretion from the cultured cells without affecting amine accumulation into these cells. These findings support the hypothesis that calmodulin is important in translating the calcium signal for chromaffin cell secretion. On the other hand, calmodulin appears not to be involved in the catecholamine uptake process in these cells.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247ds826.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kk34s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap5547s20j"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Direct and correlated responses to selection for weight gain in mice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Urrutia, Maria Soledad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Direct and correlated responses to selection for weight gain were investigated after nine generations of within family selection. Four selection criteria were used: gain between 28 and 38 or 48 and 58 days of age, and under two feeding regimes, ad libitum consumption or restricted to 80% of control lines. Two lines consisting each of twenty pair matings were selected under each of these criteria. Two unselected control lines were kept. Carcass composition analyses were performed in generation nine at the beginning and end of each selection period and at 100 days of age. Direct responses to selection in the first period were greater in the ad libitum lines while in the second period direct responses were greater in the restricted lines. Direct responses and realized heritability estimates were significantly different between the sexes; males had greater direct responses and higher heritabilities in all selected lines. Body weights before the selection periods decreased in all lines as a result of selection. Body weights after the selection period were not different from controls in the ad libitum lines while restricted lines remained smaller animals. Correlated responses in feed efficiency and feed consumption in the ad libitum lines were positive in the first period and negative in the second period. Restricted lines had a positive response in feed efficiency and negative response in consumption in both periods of selection. Changes in body composition in the first period reflected the changes in body weights through a lower crude protein percentage at the start of the period and a lower ash percentage at the end of the period. Body composition at the start of the second period was not altered by selection, while at the end of the selection period ad libitum lines had higher dry matter percentages and restricted lines had lower fat percentages. Body composition at 100 days of age was not affected by selection except for dry matter percent, that was lower in the restricted lines. Correlated response in fitness was evaluated through litter size. In the first period lines selected under ad libitum feeding were not affected by selection for increased weight gain while selection for weight gain under restricted feeding caused a significant decrease in litter size.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88ch29h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547s20j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body weight</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice -- Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adf65v862k"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the specificity of Pisum glycosyltransferases towards polyprenyl acceptors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Torossian, Krikor</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Total polyprenols prepared from Pisum stem and analyzed by HPLC, possessed chain-lengths equivalent to 15-17 isoprene units and were (alpha)-saturated. Pea membranes were supplied with GDP- ('14)C mannose, UDP- ('14)C GlcNAc and UDP- ('14)C glucose as substrates for glycosyltransfer in the presence or absence of added polyprenyl phosphates. Mono- and pyro-phosphorylated fractions were characterized using chromatographic and hydrolytic criteria. Glucosyl and mannosyl transfer took place to form endogenous polyprenyl-P-saccharide. Dolichyl-P was the only added polyprenyl phosphate which acted as an acceptor for these transferases. In contrast, incorporation of all the supplied sugars into polyprenyl-PP-saccharide was stimulated greatly in the presence of relatively short (alpha)-saturated polyprenyl phosphates, e.g., dihydro-heptaprenyl phosphate (7HP). A major product was 7H-PP-monosaccharide. Oligosaccharide-lipids were also synthesized, all of which could be digested by treatment with endo H, indicating the presence of chitobiose. When UDP- ('14)C GlcNAc was used as substrate in the presence of dolP, labelled dol-PP-chitobiose was formed and then lengthened in the presence of unlabelled GDP-mannose. The same oligosaccharides were formed in experiments where the label was present in mannose. Evidence is presented for the further addition of terminal glucose to form "G" oligosaccharide. Endogenous levels of polyprenyl phosphates clearly limited the activities of pea transglycosylases, which were capable of recognizing isoprenoids of particular chain lengths and saturation patterns.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hw111.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v862k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Saccharides</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peas</dc:subject><dc:subject>Glycosyltransferases</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plant membranes</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b6873"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The function of tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates with formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Paquin, Joanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Formiminotransferase (EC 2.1.2.5)-cyclodeaminase (EC 4.3.1.4) catalyzes two sequential H(,4)folate-dependent reactions. With derivatives of the H(,4)folate substrate having 4,5, or 6 glutamyl residues, the formiminoH(,4)pteroylpolyglutamate formed by the transferase activity is preferentially transferred (channeled) to the deaminase site rather than released into the solution. This channeling is essentially complete with the pentaglutamate derivative. The enzyme has highest affinity for the hexaglutamate as measured by K(,d) and K(,m), but does not show specificity for a given polyglutamate as measured by V(,m)/K(,m). The results indicate that steric length of the polyglutamate chain, not simply affinity, is critical for optimal channeling. Binding studies demonstrate four sites for the binding of H(,4)pteroylpolyglutamates to the native octamer, suggesting the formation of sites between subunits. The transferase and deaminase sites are kinetically independent, but share a common polyglutamate subsite. The results support the concept that the polyglutamate chain anchors the H(,4)folate molecule during its transfer between active sites.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jc148.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b6873</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A474299958"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La sexualité dans l'oeuvre d'Yves Thériault</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Benson, Mark, 1951-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A defining element of Yves Theriault's work, sexuality has frequently been perceived by various critics as a motif which serves to reinforce other, often extraliterary readings. It is my intention on the other hand to study this phenomenon from the viewpoint of its fundamental importance as the primary theme in order to delimit its significance on the structural level. I mean to accentuate not only the principal parameters of the sexual identity of Theriault's characters but also the environment which oversees and influences the origins and the development of their sexuality. It follows from this that nature in his novels and short stories shows itself to be a highly eroticised presence which serves as a model for man in his perpetual struggle for the key to a harmonious relationship with woman. I begin by giving an overview of Theriault's erotic universe before going on to study in greater depth the specificity of the sexual exchange between man and woman. This leads us to the formulation of a more precise idea of the sexual centre of his work. My conclusion takes us inexorably back to the outset of the study, for it underlines the essential contribution of an eroticised nature to the development of a healthy sexual and emotional relationship within the couple. The general direction of this procedure reflects to no small degree the cyclical, never-ending quest of a writer who is continually striving for the salvation of mankind through his art.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xm551.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/474299958</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sex in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thériault, Yves -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jf55p"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ion interaction liquid chromatography : energetics, mechanism and gradient design considerations for the assay of serum thyroid hormones</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bedard, Pierre R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The competition between two molecules of similar polarity for adsorption sites on the stationary phase is discussed in light of rapid kinetics of adsorption and desorption, and of the effects of temperature, acetonitrile, surfactant (cyclohexylaminopropane sulfonic acid, CAPS) and salt concentrations on the retention of the thyroid hormones (3,5-diiodothyronine, T2; 3,3',5-triiodothyronine, T3 and thyroxine, T4).

Part I of the paper attempts to determine as precisely as possible what bioethics is, particularly Judeo-Christian bioethics. After comparing the latter to the Hippocratic tradition and to secular bioethics, the distinctive characteristics and potential contribution of theological bioethics are identified. The policies then examined in Part II are: medical policies formulated by physicians, bioethical policies proposed by bioethicists and legal policies enunciated by court decisions and legal writers. In each case they are evaluated in the light of a number of specific ethical tests proposed as central to Judeo-Christian bioethics. The paper concludes that Judeo-Christian bioethics has not been particularly influential in our pluralist society. A final section proposes a model treatment policy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sd47v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j180w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children -- Hospital care -- Moral and ethical aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bioethics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Newborn infants</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical ethics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247ds84r"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The size dependence of radiophosphorus bioaccumulation in the freshwater plankton</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vézina, Alain</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Body size influences virtually all aspects of the autecology of material flow by organisms. Thus, size classes may be considered as alternatives to grouping by trophic level, function or taxonomy to describe the structure and function of communities. The general intent of this thesis is to assess the role of body size in the dynamics of radiophosphorus in the freshwater plankton. To calculate a priori estimates of the fluxes of phosphorus through size classes of plankton, the rates of assimilation and excretion of laboratory cultures of algae and cladocerans were measured, and regressed on body mass (W). In both groups, assimilation increased as W('0.75). The turnover of body phosphorus was described as a two-compartment system. The turnover rates of the small (2-5% of body P) fast turnover pool, the large (95-98%) slow turnover pool, and that of the body phosphorus fell proportionately to W('- 1/4) in algae and W('- 1/2) in zooplankton. Field tests of allometric models of radiophosphorus flow were conducted by following the redistribution of radioactivity among 11 size fractions of enclosed epilimnetic assemblages over 5 to 6 days. Concentration of the tracer in the biomass declined with size soon after addition and gradually shifted to a uniform distribution within 3 days. A model that makes no a priori assumptions as to the trophic structure of the system, i.e. all size classes are at the same trophic level, predicted these dynamics better than one that assumes trophic position to increase with size. Further analyses indicated that explicit treatment of the physiological allometry and size distribution of broad functional groups of plankton are needed to improve the descriptive power of the model further.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r647k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247ds84r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Body size</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freshwater plankton -- Size</dc:subject><dc:subject>Radioactive tracers in freshwater biology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gp022"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Real time steady state security assessment in electric power systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rodolakis, Anthony J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present thesis tackles the problem of on-line steady state security assessment in electric power transmission networks. The contingencies examined include generation shift as well as line (transformer) outages. The methodology developed is Pattern Recognition-motivated although not entirely within the frame of traditional statistical Pattern Recognition. Due to the fact that training samples are rather expensive to obtain in electric power engineering, our first concern was to develop and implement algorithms carrying out the task of intelligently acquiring training points. It is found that these algorithms, permit to substantially reduce the amount of off-line computational effort while, at the same time, the coherency and impartiality of the information contained in the training sets is enhanced. A new scheme for security assessment (equally applicable for real time security screening) was developed based on the concept of the hyperellipsoids of confidence. It is shown that by proper utilization of the hyperellipsoids of confidence, uncertainty in real time decision making (directly related to the misclassification error) is circumvented. The results of the new methodology were verified by full scale ac simulations. Finally, the usefulness and potential applicability of the new scheme is demonstrated for EHV equivalents. Its merits are simplicity and reliability in real time environment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mv95m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gp022</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electric power systems</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric power systems -- Protection</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric power system stability</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hq45n"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>General tightness conditions and weak convergence of point processes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Schiopu-Kratina, I.

We then discuss the predictability of the limit of a sequence of predictable processes (chapters 4-6).

Dietary studies showed consistent use of corn during their 6-9 month residency in these regions, and during winter months. A positive correlation was found between independent estimates of the density of males and counts of red-wings obtained from the North American breeding bird survey (BBS). Density of males was a useful indicator of the number of red-wings in an area, whereas the BBS was a useful indicator of change in regional population level. Historical increases in populations of red-wings in these regions were correlated with increases in waste grain (corn) following harvest. Greater rates of population increase in Quebec (compared with Ontario) corresponded to higher rates of increase in waste corn abundance and landscape heterogeneity. In Quebec, cultivation (mainly corn) was the most important habitat influencing density of males. Wetland and hay field abundance were also important. Heterogeneous landscapes incorporating crops, wetlands and hay fields attracted the most male red-wings regardless of population level, and breeding males preferred wetlands and hay fields for territory establishment. Fields were used in proportion to abundance, whereas forest, crops and areas of human occupation were avoided. At high population density, proportionately more males settled in areas of human occupation and in fields; these habitats were less suitable than wetlands or hay fields. Packing of males into a preferred hay field habitat occurred. Overwinter mortality did not favor small body size in male red-wings but evidence of stabilizing selection on female body size was found. Sexual dimorphism was slightly more pronounced in spring than in fall. Historical changes in the body size of red-wings were not clearly related to increasing abundance of food (corn). If population size tracks increases in food abundance, then inter-male competition for breeding space may intensity; thus, large size may be limited by energy contraints imposed on males by sexual selection pressure regardless of food availability.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053g840.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537199n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Red-winged blackbird -- Habitat</dc:subject><dc:subject>Birds -- Canada -- Geographical distribution</dc:subject><dc:subject>Land use -- Environmental aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53ww62p"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Simulation of soil moisture migration from a point source</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khatri, Krishanlal C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A computer model simulating moisture migration in soil from a drip source considering root water extraction (RWE) was developed. The model was formulated using Continuous System Modeling Program (CSMP). A two-dimensional non-linear unsaturated transient flow equation was solved using the principle of mass conservation and Darcy's law on soils of dwarf-apple orchards located in southwestern Quebec. A finite axisymmetric cylinder with homogeneous, isotropic and non-swelling soil was considered for the simulations. No flow conditions across the boundaries of the cylinder were fixed. The initial soil moisture contents in the soil profile observed in the field were input for the simulations. The macroscopic approach was used to compute RWE as a function of (THETA), Z and t. The RWE was assumed to be equal to evapotranspiration (EP) which was estimated using temperatures and the solar radiation index of the location. The moisture contents in the soil profile observed at the termination of emitter discharge were in close agreement with the simulated values. The soil moisture distribution was found to depend on the amount of water remaining in the soil and soil moisture retention characteristics. It is independent of the rate of emitter discharge, the depth of root zone and method of application.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zb85s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53ww62p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Groundwater flow -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Irrigation -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soil moisture -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b5919199"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Religion and society in Arab Sind</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Maclean, Derryl N.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Arabs exercised authority in Sind for over three centuries (93-416/711-1025), first as governors appointed directly by the Umayyads and ('c)Abbasids and then, from around 240/854, as independent rulers from the Quraysh tribes of Habbar b. al-Aswad and Samah b.

This dissertation is concerned with four major topics in the religious history of the period: the identification of the non-Muslim religions and sects at the time of the Arab conquest; the mechanisms encouraging or impeding collaboration and conversion; the prosopography of the Sind(')i Muslim population; and the rise of the Isma('c('))il(')i state at Multan toward the end of the period. Correlations between religious and social factors are examined in two general areas: the observed differential between Buddhist and Hindu collaboration and conversion, and the decline in the recruitment, replication, and circulation of the Muslim religious elite.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rx41s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b5919199</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sindh (Pakistan) -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sindh (Pakistan) -- Religion -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arabs -- Pakistan -- Sindh -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>India -- History -- 324 B.C.-1000 A.D</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c126f"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hodge decompositions and computational electromagnetics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kotiuga, Peter Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The handling of topological aspects in boundary value problems of engineering electromagnetics is often considered to be an engineer's art and not a science. This thesis is an attempt to show that the opposite is true. Through the use of differential forms and rudimentary concepts from homology theory a paradigm variational boundary value problem is formulated and investigated. It is seen that reasoning in terms of the Tonti diagram for this problem may lead to false conclusions if cohomology groups are ignored. As a prelude to this investigation, a suitable orthogonal decomposition of differential forms is derived and the roles played by the long exact homology sequence and topological duality theorems for compact orientable manifolds with boundary are considered in detail.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579t01f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c126f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Boundary value problems</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electromagnetism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Homology theory</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784m56z"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>End stage renal disease (ESRD) and the marital dyad</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chowanec, Gregory D.

The responses of patients and spouses from five groups of couples--illustrating different points in the progression and treatment of ESRD--were compared both across ESRD groups and between patients and spouses. It was hypothesized that those ESRD groups with the highest levels of illness/treatment intrusiveness, i.e. the two dialysis groups, would exhibit the highest levels of marital role strain and concomitantly the lowest levels of psychological well-being. Despite the fact that the ESRD groups did reflect differences in perceived illness/treatment intrusiveness, no significant differences were found between the ESRD groups, or between patients and spouses, in either marital relations or psychological well-being. However, multiple regression analyses did indicate that marital role strain was a significant predictor of psychological well-being. It explained psychological well-being variance above and beyond demographic, physical health, ESRD group membership and psychological defensiveness considerations. Also, the two dialysis groups evidenced significantly greater correlations between marital role strain and psychological distress than the nondialysis groups. These findings were interpreted as being consistent with a General Systems Theory approach to the conceptualization and treatment of chronic illness.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nb93g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784m56z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Married people -- Psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chronic renal failure -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arx913q69g"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Test design for computer network protocols</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sarikaya, Behcet</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Communication protocol testing can be done with a test architecture consisting of remote Tester and local Responder processes. By ignoring interaction primitive parameters and additional state variables, it is possible to adapt test sequence generation techniques for finite state machines (FSM) to generate sequences for protocols specified as incomplete finite state machines. For real protocols, tests can be designed based on the formal specification of the protocol which uses an extended FSM model in specifying the transition types. The transition types are transformed into a simpler form called normal form transitions which can be modelled by a control and a data flow graph. Furthermore, the data flow graph is partitioned to obtain disjoint blocks representing the different functions of the protocol. Tests are designed by considering parameter variations of the input primitives of each data flow function and determining the expected outputs. This methodology gives complete test coverage of all data flow functions and tests for unspecified cases can be designed using the control and data flow graphs. The methodology is applied to two real protocols: Transport protocols Classes 0 and 2.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p538t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913q69g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer network protocols</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zp16b"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Expression of maternal and zygotic genes during sea urchin embryogenesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tufaro, Francis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Eggs of many organisms contain a store of mRNA which supports protein synthesis during early embryonic development and various regions of the egg cytoplasm are not identical with respect to developmental potential. I investigated the extent to which sea urchin embryogenesis results from a progression of developmental events directed by the embryo, or an expression of a pre-formed maternal program. By the use of two-dimensional electrophoresis I demonstrated that cellular determination during embryonic development at the 16-cell stage is not accompanied by qualitative changes in the distribution within the embryo of abundantly-synthesized proteins, virtually all of which are coded by sequences present in the egg. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, nucleic acid hybridization and molecular cloning, I demonstrated that there is restricted expression of paternal gene mRNA sequences in interspecies hybrid embryos. In some cases, this is due to a posttranscriptional perturbation of gene expression in the hybrid embryos.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483k077.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp16b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Echinodermata</dc:subject><dc:subject>Embryology -- Echinodermata</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sea urchins -- Embryos</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proteins -- Synthesis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8336h269j"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Death in the novels of George Eliot</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Emmanuel-Chopra, Carol</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although rejecting Christian dogma, George Eliot retained, throughout her life, a strong sympathy for the humanitarian aspects of Christianity, which finds expression in her humane and moral philosophy, and especially in the value she attaches to right conduct.

Given the interrelationship between individuals in society, the awesome reality of this law of consequences, demonstrating the ramifications of human error, makes it incumbent on man to avoid selfish choices.

Recently available instrumentation and analytic techniques, yielding new types of data and new approaches to longstanding problems, are demonstrated in this analysis of terrain conditions and vegetation distributions in the Caribou Hills, N.W.T. The analysis of landform was based on field data, image interpretation and photogrammetric elevation model data. Slope angles and aspects were computed and trend surfaces, residuals and contour maps produced for model areas. Within sampled areas, surface roughness, the degree of dissection and the apparent dominance of either fluvial or mass wasting processes were found to be controlled by slope aspect, snow drifting patterns and the nival melt schedule. Patterns of active layer depth and details of surface materials, morphology and processes were derived from stereoscopic analysis of photographs through linkages with plant associations. Twelve plant associations, defined by field survey, provided a basis for differentiating photographic signatures and vegetation mapping classes. The character and separability of the spectral signatures were reviewed using ratioed and clustered optical film density data. The major advantages of remote sensing as an analytic tool were demonstrated. Remote sensing provides a vast array of geographic data and a unique synthesis of terrain and vegetation conditions offering the researcher key information that is otherwise unavailable.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816n29v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hc94m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Remote sensing -- Northwest Territories -- Caribou Hills</dc:subject><dc:subject>Photographic interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vegetation surveys -- Northwest Territories -- Caribou Hills -- Remote sensing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aerial photogrammetry -- Northwest Territories -- Caribou Hills</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rv215"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Spectroscopic studies of alkali halide single crystals doped with lead : KCI:Pb"+, KBr:Pb"+, and KI:Pb"+</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kang, Jun-gill</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A detailed study is made on the luminescence of Pb('2+) ions in alkali halide single crystals. The emission spectra of KX:Pb('2+) (X = Cl, Br, I) excited in the A-absortpion band at various temperatures are reported. In addition, the excitation spectra of the A-band emission measured at 4.2 and 78 K are also given. The temperature dependence and the effect of an external magnetic field on the decay time of the A-band emission from KX:Pb('2+) is also investigated. The results are interpreted in terms of a model that includes the Jahn-Teller effect, the spin-orbit interaction and an additional perturbation caused by the charge compensating cation vacancy (CV, v(,c)('-)). In this model, the Jahn-Teller effect is much smaller than the spin-orbit interaction and the CV is smaller still. The experimental results for KX:Pb('2+) are well in accord with this model. The angular dependence of the polarization of the A-band emission from KX:Pb('2+) confirms that the Pb('2+) - v(,c)('-) pair is located on the C(,4) crystallographic axis. The temperature dependence of the polarization is treated within the framework of the above model in terms of the nonradiative processes between the relaxed excited states.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343s958.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rv215</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Crystals -- Spectra -- Measurement</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jahn-Teller effect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spectrum analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Luminescence spectroscopy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p793q"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of right and left hemisphere damage on the comprehension of stress and intonation in English</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Johnson-Weiner, Karen Marie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Normal Language requires the integration of formal, conceptual, and pragmatic knowledge.

To study hemisphere involvement in language processing, patients with unilateral right or left hemisphere lesions and a matched neurologically normal control group were tested on their ability to perceive stress and intonation contrasts in words and phrases of varying length. The results suggest that both hemispheres are involved in normal language processing, each in a qualitatively different way. Whereas the left hemisphere appears to work from the bottom up, analyzing information sequentially and arriving at the overall pattern, the right hemisphere works from the top down, beginning with the overall pattern and working to fill in the details. Moreover, the importance of each hemisphere's participation may change in response to different grammatical and contexual variables.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rp394.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p793q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Intonation (Phonetics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Accents and accentuation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language disorders</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cerebral hemispheres</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tq14p"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies toward the total syntheses of heterocyclic analogues of adriamycin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Honek, John Frank</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The design and synthesis of two heterocyclic thioanalogues of 7-deoxy daunomycinone, 9-acetyl-6,9,11-trihydroxythioxantho{2,3-g}- and -{3,2-g}tetralin, was accomplished.
