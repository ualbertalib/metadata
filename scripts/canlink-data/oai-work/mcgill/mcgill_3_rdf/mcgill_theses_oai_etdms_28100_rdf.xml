Dietary data were collected using three repeated non-consecutive 24-hour recalls and sociodemographic, physical, physiological and psychosocial characteristics were measured. Factor and cluster analyses were used to define food patterns. Due to the homogeneous dietary patterns of this population, neither the five factors nor six clusters formed were distinct. There were few dietary predictors of nutrient intake as mean intakes of energy, folacin, calcium, vitamin D and zinc by subjects in all clusters were inadequate. Protein intakes were also marginal. Eating beef predicted higher intakes of protein, niacin and zinc for women. Smoking predicted both poorer food choices and nutrient intake. A diagnosis of emphysema predicted higher food intakes. Recommended dietary changes for this population include increased consumption of dairy products and other protein sources as well as energy-dense foods in order to increase micronutrient intake and prevent weight loss in some individuals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gray-Donald, Katherine</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sh54b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773w96w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Older people -- Health and hygiene</dc:subject><dc:subject>Older people -- Nutrition</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax346d550p"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Synaptogenesis between identified neurons</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ching, Shim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Serotonergic Retzius (R) neurons of the leech Hirudo medicinalis in culture reform inhibitory synapses with pressure sensitive (P) neurons while selectively reducing an extrasynaptic, depolarizing response to serotonin (5-HT) in the P neuron. We have examined if the selection of 5-HT responses is restricted to sites of contact between processes and growth cones of these cells. As measured by intracellular recording at the soma, focal application of 5-HT depolarized uncontacted P cell bodies, neurites and growth cones but not processes contacted by R cells. In patch clamp recordings of the depolarizing channels, application of 5-HT modulated channel activity in uncontacted but not in contacted growth cones. The selection of transmitter responses during synaptogenesis is therefore localized to discrete sites of contact specifically between synaptic partners. Prior experiments have shown that tyrosine kinases play a crucial part in the selection of responses to 5-HT that occurs in the P cell (Catarsi and Drapeau, 1993). To further examine the mechanism responsible for this change in transmitter responses, we have utilized a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine to determine if tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected in P and R cell pairs placed in contact. Our results revealed bright, punctate cytoplasmic staining in P cells paired with R cells. Embryonic leeches were used to examine how R to P synaptogenesis proceeds in vivo. By filling the R and P neurons with different fluorescent dyes (Lucifer Yellow and Rhodamine-Dextran), confocal microscopy established that putative contact between neuropilar processes were made as early as 11 days of development. Spontaneous, chloride-dependent synaptic potentials in embryonic P cells similar to those seen in adult P cells were observed as early as day 10 of development.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>apeau, P.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752h93k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d550p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Synapses</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hirudo medicinalis -- Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Leeches -- Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neurons -- Growth</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f2516"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A goto-elimination method and its implementation for the McCAT C compiler</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Erosa, Ana Maria</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In designing optimizing and parallelizing compilers, it is often simpler and more efficient to deal with programs that have structured control flow. Although most programmers naturally program in a structured fashion, there remain many important programs and benchmarks that include some number of goto statements, thus rendering the entire program unstructured. Such unstructured programs cannot be handled with compilers built with analyses and transformations for structured programs. In this thesis we present a straight-forward algorithm to structure C programs by eliminating all goto statements. The method works directly on a high-level abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the program and could easily be integrated into any compiler that uses an AST-based intermediate representation. The actual algorithm proceeds by eliminating each goto by first applying a sequence of goto-movement transformations followed by the appropriate goto-elimination transformation. Our McCAT (McGill Compiler Architecture Testbed) optimizing/parallelizing C compiler is based on a compositional representation of the program, and hence does not support unrestricted use of gotos directly. We have implemented the method within the framework of the McCat compiler. We present some experimental results and study the cost of structuring. The results show that applying a small number of simple transformations eliminates all the goto statements, usually with a minimal effect on the execution speed. Thus, we can exploit structured representations for designing compilers, while paying a minimal penalty due to structuring.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendren, Laurie</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988m27t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f2516</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wp08g"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Radical critique and eschatology : the chronicle of a sixteenth-century Peruvian Indian</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nash, Mark G.

My analysis focuses on the mode of communication used by Guaman Poma, his use of Renaissance Iberian discursive and visual codes, to articulate his radical views of Spanish rule in Peru. His views, I argue, although articulated in a foreign language and media, express a fundamentally Andean understanding of the world. The conquest and the Spanish people are woven into the Andean mythological order. Andean and Spanish worlds are made to conform to a common temporal and spatial model in the author's attempt to make sense of the apocalyptic consequences of the arrival the Spanish.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Szanto, George</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qd390.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wp08g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Incas -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peru -- History -- Conquest, 1522-1548</dc:subject><dc:subject>Guamán Poma de Ayala, Felipe, fl. 1613</dc:subject><dc:subject>Guamán Poma de Ayala, Felipe, fl. 1613.

The primary objective of this study was to look for any important differences in the rate of postpartum weight loss in the first 9 months postpartum according to method of infant feeding. Two hundred thirty-six women attending two public health clinics in Montreal were weighed in one to four encounters occurring at different stages of the postpartum period but no later than the 9th month postpartum. A questionnaire assessing the method of infant feeding (predominantly breastfeeding, mixed feeding or predominantly bottlefeeding) and potential confounders was administered by telephone after each weighing. An unbalanced multivariate repeated measures analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in the rate of weight loss by category of infant feeding. Gestational weight gain, postpartum smoking and maternal birthplace were important predictors of postpartum weight change.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kramer, Michael</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fq24r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913r097</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mw539"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A method for aircraft icing diagnosis in precipitation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Turcotte, François A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A study of feasibility is performed for the development of a nowcasting method of aircraft icing conditions. The supercooled cloud water content is a key parameter for the determination of hazardous regions. The production of supercooled water in clouds is possible only where sufficiently strong updraft produces supersaturation with respect to water. However, to maintain the presence of supercooled droplets, the generation of moisture excess during the air uplift must exceed the rate of vapor deposition on snow and the rate of snow riming. The "storm of the century" (March 13-14, 1993) has been chosen as a good case of stratiform precipitation event and its microphysics was simulated using a high resolution three-dimensional kinematic cloud model with a full microphysical scheme. The winds driving the development of hydrometeors are obtained by a three-dimensional wind retrieval technique applied to single Doppler radar data. The output of the cloud model provides the field of supercooled (since T $&lt;$ 0$ sp circ$C) cloud water. In this way a potentially operational method for detection of icing conditions is suggested. Once implemented, the method was used on a second case (October 21, 1993), where aircraft observations provided a mean of evaluating its performance. The comparison of retrieved cloud liquid water with in situ measurements, shows a good potential for the retrieval method.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zawadzki, Isztar</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x5215.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mw539</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A05741t054"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Can scale invariance be realized as a quantum symmetry?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tremblay, Luc, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The theoretical prediction of the value of the cosmological constant is far from being in accord with observations.
