Such a review of cerebral cicatrixin its manifold forms and causations should help in an understanding of the histological processes involved. Furthermore, careful analysis and theapplication of experimental methods should help to differentiate and to identity the late changes which follow cerebral insults of one form oranother. Finally, a clearer understanding of the mechanism of production of the various end results of cerebral insults may guide the way toimprovement in therapeutic measures, both medical and surgical. The work included in this report has been carried on over a period of five years.At the outset the attack was made upon the isolated problem of post-traumatic cerebral cicatrix and an effort was made to deter.mine. what factorsgoverned healing, so that one might employ methods of scar excision which would permit of the surgeon leaving less soar than the one which he wasremoving in the effort to cure the patient of his posttraumatic epilepsy.

Low concentrations of oxygen (l percent) increased the output of carbon dioxide of apples; when these fruits werereturned to air the rate of oxygen uptake was found to be lower than in those fruits stored continuously in air. Fruits which had been stored in 5percent and 10 percent carbon dioxide at 3-5 C for several months and removed to 21 C were observed to respire more rapidly than the controls storedin air.

Theeffect of stannous chloride and the rate of the reaction have been defined much more accurately than before. It has been shown that the maximumcolor intensity is developed at about 5 minutes after the addition of the reducing agent. Both ferric and ferrous iron have been shown to interferewith the reaction; ferric iron causes rapid fading at concentrations exceeding 6-10 p.p.m.; ferrous iron diminishes the color development if thestannous chloride reagent is not added immediately after the acid molybdate reagent. The use of light of a definite portion of the spectrum,approximating monochromatic light, has shown that Beer's law is followed by the reaction, both in pure solutions and in soil extracts.

The lipid groups isolated included theneutral fats and nonsaponifiable fraction, phospho-lipids, glrcolipids, sterols, carotenoid pigments and miscellaneous fractions. Wherever advisablethese were analyzed for nitrogen, phosphorus and sugar. The pigments were examined spectrographically. Apart from the relatively large pigmentcontent of the anterior pituitary, the lipids of the pituitary do not appear to differ radically from those of other tissues.

In their comments the accent of the eighteenth century is heard plainly, and through these letters we are givenan opportunity of meeting the people of a past age. The three ladies may speak in different tones, uut it blends into,one striking picture.Mrs.Montagu is the best observer of political events. Even as a young girl she shovve.d her aptitude for writing news letters, and as a maturematron, living in London, she made an excellent reporter. Her interest in her husband's business sharpened her powers of observation to a morethan feminine acuteness. Mrs. Thrale does not show as much interest in this aspect of her 'world: she does not mention politics as often in herletters, and her references do not have such detailed information or show such command of the subject. Fanny Burney is the poorest politicalreporter of all. Politics did not often appeal to her imagination; she seldom mentions finy public events unless they affected those dear to her.Mrs Montagu' s letters show the state of public feeling in London on many of the most important questions of the day.

A consideration of thedomestic scene and long-term views have been signally lacking. If anything is being pointed out, it is that not just an adjustment of thebalance-of-payments is desired, but one that is accomplished without strain or hindrance on economic prosperity and progress. The story of thebalance-of-payments shows that in the early period a heavy foreign debt was piled up. It was assumed that the automatic functioning of theeconomic system would enable this to be borne without strain, (or the matter was neglected altogether). Such has not been the case. Thefluctuating nature of the Canadian economy and the vulnerability of the Canadian export trade to external price and market disturbancesmake this debt and its service charges singularly burdensome. Flexibility and easy adjustment are prime objectives in balance-of paymentsoperations. Obviously, a simple solution cannot be expected. A planning authority can hope to mitigate this by seeking to introduce a measureof stability and internal economic adjustment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marsh, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623g50f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085p20k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Balance of payments -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kk242"><ual:graduationDate>1938</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Botany</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of factors affecting stomatal movement in the dark</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Whyte, James Howden</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In all experiments carried out in relation to temperature there is an acceleration in the rate of opening of stomata with an increase in temperature.At temperatures about 23°C there is a period of slow opening which lasts from 8 to 16 hours.

In the normal species the phenotype is conditioned bya balance between the speltoid determiners and the counteracting inhibitors. The latter are borne on the major arm of the C-chromosome,the former elsewhere in the complement. On the one hand, a deficiency for these inhibitors upsets the balance and allows development toproceed in the speltoid direction; on the other, a reduplication modifies development so that the compactoid phenotype is manifested.The extreme mutant types resemble superficially the species T. spelta and £. cormoacturn respectively. Both the deficiencies andthe reduplications may involve either toe whole or simply a part of the C-chromosome.

While the organic structure of cellulose is important, this physico-chemical investigation deals with the physical structure of cellulose and the influence of water upon it. When it is considered how much of the nature of cellulose is bound up in its fibrous structure, its tensile strength, and the swelling behavior that it exhibits, it is seen how inadequate are formulae which explain only its chemical reactions and leave its physical properties untouched untouched. From an academic standpoint the interest is that concerned with the properties of a swelling gel that is, with the chemistry and physics of surfaces involving the interplay of surface forces, cohesion, of structural units, adhesion to foreign materials, adsorption, swelling, and the  like.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maass, O.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913s794.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k1081</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cellulose</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atb09j8404"><ual:graduationDate>1938</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation on the acinous and island tissue of the pancreatic gland</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sergeyeva, Maria A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present investigation deals with the microscopic changes which occur in the pancreatic gland of the cat, when this animal issubjected to parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation.

Hence a deal of space is devoted to outliningthe development from early humanist paedagogy of the ideals of educational dramatics. This part of the work I have hadto restrict more or less to the English field, but within its limits it is, I believe, sufficiently comprehensive.Moreover, so far as I can ascertain, it has never hitherto been attempted. The remainder of the Thesis is concernedwith the dramatists who wrote for academic production. The intention here was, in the main, to trace the influenceof educational dramatics upon the professional theatre of the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
