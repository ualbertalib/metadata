Theories have been developed, and the concept of arousal has become quite popular in a number of fields of psychology. There are, however, not many behavioural experiments directly dealing with this system, in spite of its theoretical importance. In this thesis, an attempt will be made to reveal the role of the mesencephalic reticular formation, which constitutes a part of the activating system, in some aspects of behaviour. A series of experiments, in which the method of intracranial injection was used, will be reported after a review of the present knowledge about the reticular system and an account of methodological development.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milner, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fq41n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042x61p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vm52k"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Study of a new type of bi-directional amplifier for use in telephone networks</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nador, Peter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Telephone repeaters are bi-directional amplifiers which are inserted in a transmission line to compensate for losses. Because of their bi-directional nature special care must be taken to match these amplifiers to the line in order to assure stability and to limit the echo signal. The two basic types of repeaters presently in use are the hybrid and the negative impedance repeaters. In this study a new arrangement, called the bridge compensated repeater, is suggested and analyzed. After developing an analytical method by which the performance of repeaters of various types can be compared, the three systems are analyzed and it is proved that the bridge compensated system possesses some desirable properties as compared to existing systems. The basic problem in designing a bridge compensated system is the design of a two-port network which must satisfy a specification related to its real and imaginary parts simultaneously. A computer method for designing such networks is developed and some results are presented. A circuit for the bridge compensated repeater is described and measuring techniques are developed to compare the accuracy of calculated and measured values. This technique is demonstrated on a simple system in which case the agreement between measured and calculated values is found to be very good.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Farnell, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000356g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vm52k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electrical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17cx769"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The binding of hyperons in light hypernuclei</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Murphy, Joseph</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Strange particles are members of a class of unstable elementary particles whose masses lie somewhere between those of the neutron and the deuteron (exclusive of both) and which have the property that no member of this class is ever produced alone.

From the nature of the process, which involved a coulombic repulsion between two fragments of high nuclear charge, it could be simultaneously deduced that fission would be accompanied by the liberation of a large amount of energy. This fact could also be predicted from the large difference between the mass of the fissioning nuclide and the sum of the masses of the product nuclides. Frisch first demonstrated this by measuring the ionization pulses produced by the fission fragments, and almost simultaneously Joliot proved it from the measurement of the fragment ranges.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yaffe, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h3070.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xw48q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45qd266"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Some aspects of balanced economic development</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mubarak, Nasreldin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is often lamented that in spite of the flow of recent literature, economies has not produced a real theory of development.

Alter removal of the lignin, fractional extractions and precipitations with aqueous alkali gave an arabinoglucuronoxylan (8% of the wood), a galactoglucomannan (2%) and a glucomannan (8%). Their structure was determined by the classical methylation method, by oxidation with periodate and by identification of the oligosaccharides obtained on partial acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharides. The xylan consisted of B-(1--&gt;4)-linked D-xylose residues carrying a-(1--&gt;2) linked 4-0-ethylglucuronic acid and a-(1--&gt;3)-linked L-arabinofuranose side chains. The two hexosans contained a framework of B-(1--&gt;4)-linked D-glucose and D-mannose residues to which were attached a-(1--&gt;6)-linked D-galactopyranose residues. Both hemicelluloses contained glucose and mannose in a ratio of 1:3 but the galactoglucomannan possessed ten times more galactose side chains than the glucomannan. An oligosaccharide giving equimolar amounts of galactose, glucose, and mannose on hydrolysis was obtained from the galactoglucomannan. This constituted the first unequivocal evidence for the triheteropolymer nature of this type of wood polysaccharide.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Timell, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zs002.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gh360</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kf20f"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Solutions to problems in plane elasticity expressed by means of singular integral equations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Miller, Harry.

In fact we seldom use the word “motive" in everyday discourse.

The investigator, through observation of high schools and related institutions, attempted to ascertain the structure, organisation and method of geographic education.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Overing, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612s13g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60d110d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j4512"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics and Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the effectiveness of Canadian monetary policy, 1945-60</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McLeod, Donald</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Authority for the establishment of a central bank in Canada was first conveyed by the Bank of Canada Act of 1934. Central banking operations commenced in the following year. From 1935 monetary management, in the modern sense of a central bank playing a key role in the financial affairs of a country, has characterized Canadian economic development. It has been argued that the Bank of Canada in the early years of its existence did not at all times function at that high level of performance that is generally expected of institutions of that sort. But it would not be unreasonable to associate the early deficiencies of Canadian central banking with the growing pains of a fledgling institution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levitt, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720h43g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j4512</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics and Political Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn3014923"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Reproduction of barren ground caribou Rangifer Tarandus Groenlandicus (Linnaeus) with relation to migration</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McEwan, Eoin. H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a study of the seasonal reproduction and movements of the barren ground caribou, Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus (Linnaeus), it has been shown that cemental annuli, formed in the incisor teeth, are reliable indicators of age. The males are sexually mature at 17 to 18 months of age; the first conception in the majority of females occurs during the third and fourth breeding season after birth. Mature bulls are in breeding condition from mid-September until early December. The rutting period extends from mid-October to the first week in November, mainly from October 20 to 25. The blastocyst implants about 27 to 29 days after mating. The corpus luteum attains its maximum size and vascularity at the time of implantation; retrogressive changes commence about 2 months prepartum.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dunbar, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fc80c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3014923</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zoology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462877v"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An ideology for Pakistan: a study of the works of Ghulam Ahmad Parwez</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McDonough, Sheila.

This quotation is taken from the journal published by the supporters of Parwêz, but it is a reference to the point of view of his opponents. The statement represents an attitude that is meaningful both to the supporters, and to the opponents of Parwêz. The term I have translated as 'mischief', fitnah, has connotations of fatal attractiveness, of seduction, and of sedition.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Berkes, N.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064935q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462877v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islamic Studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mj987"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Energy of a dense electron gas in a strong magnetic field</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Matz, Detlef</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Increasing attention has been paid in recent years to the problem of electron interactions in solids because of their significant effects on various physical properties of solids, as for example the transport properties and the electronic specific heat. The problem has been idealized to an interacting electron gas imbedded in a uniform background of positive charge, the lattice of positive ions. The whole system is then neutral. For most metals this is fairly representative of the actual situation. As early as 1934, Wigner suggested the importance of the "correlation energy", a term introduced by him.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wallace, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zs01b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mj987</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73q0637"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Exercise and the cardiorespiratory system of thyrotoxicosis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Massey, Douglas.

Despite the prominence of these manifestations the underlying physiology is poorly understood. Probably the major reason for this is lack of data. Stein, et al.,(l961) have recorded a relatively comprehensive study of pulmonary function on thirteen patients at rest and on exercise. Their findings are discussed later but they, in common with all other investigators, did not report on the exercise diffusing capacity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Christie, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cx77k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73q0637</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43p1708"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agriculture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the Mesostigmata and Trombidiformes (Acarina) of two Quebec woodland humus forms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marshall, Valin.

The problems relative to the study of the soil fauna are complex, requiring at the very outset, not only familiarity with the soil itself but also some knowledge of the many diverse groups of animals encountered. The aid of specialists for the difficult task of identifying the animals normally round in the soil, also, is almost indispensable (Alvarado and Selga, 1962). The project here discussed is limited to the study of two suborders of Acarina, the Mesostigmata and Trombidiformes of two Quebec woodland humus forms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kevan, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935646f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43p1708</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agronomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
