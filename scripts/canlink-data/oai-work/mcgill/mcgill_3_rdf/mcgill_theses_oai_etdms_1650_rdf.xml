The environmental movement was one of the myriad of new social movements that arose in the 1960s and '70's in western nations. Although it transcended national boundaries, development of environmental movements in Europe and North America differed, just as they did at more regional levels, depending on cultural distinctions, the structures of opportunity, and the amount of available resources, among other things. With its Quiet Revolution, Quebec society gained a new pluralism, secularism, and liberalism that gave the rising middle class and the large proportion of educated youth a greater say in decisions and fostered the development of public interest groups, such as environmental groups. These were aided by government grants that became available after the October Crisis in 1970. Between 1970 and 1980, environmentalism in Quebec became a legitimate societal concern as various associations and individuals began working separately and together on urban air and water pollution problems, recycling projects, and transportation and energy issues, among others. The impetus to act on behalf of the province's environment was due in part to the severity and distribution of pollution problems and to the moral and ideological convictions of group leaders and core members of environmental groups. Informal social and communication networks, such as the counterculture, the antinuclear movement, and health-food coops provided the burgeoning environmental movement with ideologies, members, and solidarity. Unlike its parallel in the United States, Quebec's movement had few historical or ideological links with efforts to preserve wilderness and it developed social- rather than nature-protection principles.

The tension among the models and the leading theorists arises from the divergent understanding of the relationship of religion to education as well as the concept of personhood. The transcendent nature of persons is argued from both a psychological and philosophical perspective. The nature of the religious experience as well as religious development is examined in both adults and adolescents. Given the transcendent dimension of human nature, as witnessed through the religious response, it is argued that the first order activity of religious education should be the development of adolescent spirituality.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Francoeur, Tom</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r312p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j3334432</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Religious education</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religious education of teenagers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m162d"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Medical and popular attitudes toward female sexuality in late seventeenth century England (1660-1696)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Baird, J. Aileen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an analysis of medical and popular views toward female sexuality in late seventeenth century England (1660-1696), based on the study of learned vernacular medical texts, personal sources and popular literature. In that period, women's subordinate social status to men was largely determined by their 'inferior' biology; "female illnesses" were considered to be a product of women's innate physiological 'weakness' as defined by humoral medical theory, and their reproductive organs were linked to their less restrained (than men's) sexual desires. This research examines those medical and social ideas that defined the female sex in late seventeenth century England, in conjunction with women's own records of their experiences; it is argued that while their physiology was used to justify their inferior social status, women's degree of self-autonomy in early modern England--particularly in the area of pregnancy and childbirth--was probably far greater than would be thought from an examination of the contemporary printed sources. This thesis also demonstrates how medical and social attitudes toward women mutually reinforced the secondary position of women in that society.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maxwell, Michael P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gv77x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m162d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- Sexual behavior -- Great Britain -- History -- 17th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Sexual behavior -- History -- 17th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247dv250"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>spa</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Hispanic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dorotea y Fortunata, dos creaciones semejantes en dos √©pocas distintas</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Asimakopoulos, Vasilik√≠</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The following study is an analysis of the initial steps of the process of characterization of Dorotea and Fortunata. This comparative study will illustrate the similarities in the techniques both Cervantes and Galdos employ to create two female characters who, although begin as irrelevant secondary characters, end as protagonists and heroines of their respective story. The first chapter is dedicated to the two male characters, Cardenio and Juanito. Both authors begin each story with a male character and lead the reader to believe falsely that they will be the protagonists. We conclude that these false protagonists only serve as contrasts to the female characters they introduce. The second and third chapters deal with the first appearance of Dorotea and Fortunata. We begin with a detailed description and analysis of their physical appearance and the literary techniques used. We discover that both authors achieve the same goal of creating a sensual scene in which they offer a minute description of the female characters in question. Finally, we come to know these two female characters through an analysis of their discourses and language. The characterization process is realized thanks to the interaction between characters and the thinking process. We come to the conclusion that, although separated by approximately three centuries, both authors employ similar techniques and succeed in creating two female characters that excel in their respective lives.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Magallon, Jesus Perez</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117q99k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247dv250</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cervantes Saavedra, Miguel de, 1547-1616.

His argument rests on the notion that the Qur'an was only utilized as a secondary source in legal matters, and the Prophet's works were out of legal context. Thus, Muslims at that time mostly relied on customary law which was practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia. Consequently, he claims that Islamic law began to develop at the end of the first century of the Hijra, as a result of the measures taken by the Umayyad Caliphs and their Governors. Contrary to this thesis, some scholars have shown some evidence to argue that Islamic law did exist during the life time of the Prophet. The Qur'an has played a significant role in formulating law as well as solving legal problems in the very beginning of the period. The key figure to apply such law is the Prophet himself and his companions, who, after him, acted as muftis. Moreover, all the Prophet's action including those related to legal matters had been transmitted orally and recorded in a written form. This transmission is owed to the isnad system which was introduced since the life time of the Prophet. After the Prophet's death, his companions pursued these legal activities by issuing legal decision which subsequently developed and became a model of Islamic law.

The classical controversy on universals is baseless if we do not consider different kinds of universal concepts. In this thesis, universal concepts are examined as classified into three groups: first intentions, logical second intentions and philosophical second intentions. We elaborate these three kinds of concepts from two perspectives. First, we have a journey in the history of Islamic philosophy from Farabi to contemporary philosophers in order to see what they mentioned in this regard. We found that the origin of the distinction between first and second intentions in Ibn Sina; however, he does not mention the philosophical second intentions, rather this kind of intentions is added sometime after Suhrawardi and Tusi We also examined William of Ockham's theory for the purposes of a comparative approach.

A host of examples are provided to show how translation is severely limited and at times nonsensical when cultural factors are ignored. Intercultural communications is also discussed in detail to shed light on what is involved. The resulting arguments pertaining to the limitations inherent in translation and intercultural communication are then put into the context of refugee hearings in order to provide some practical applications and point to areas where communication may be deficient.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h6578.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m163p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Court interpreting and translating -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Refugees -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Intercultural communication</dc:subject><dc:subject>Translating and interpreting</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wp86v"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Toward a natural history of architecture : the vegetal culture of Viel de Saint-Maux</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Winterton, David E. (David Edward)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis reflects on the Lettres sur l'Architechure of Viel de Saint-Maux, published in Paris in 1787. This period represents a crisis point at which classical architechure and a traditional means of relating-to-the-world had exhausted themselves. In the Lettres, St.-Maux privileges original agrarian societies who worship the natural force of fecundity and the agricultural bounty that results from it. He claims that this worship supplied the radical base for their iconographic and symbolic forms as applied to architecture. Viel de St.-Maux's privileging of the generative forces of nature as a site for sacred imagining and ritual constructions of the agricultural environment belie a relation to the methodology and epistemology of Natural History as formulated by the Comte de Buffon. Viel de Saint-Maux sought to resist the threat of an overweening rationality by valuing the wonderment cast by the discoveries of Science. He put his faith in natural science and applied this same compulsion to the ancient primitives who, he believed, knew divinely how to propitiate Nature and its fecundity. Fecundity and Agriculture become metaphors for cultural harmony, enlightenment and a re-fusion of the mystery of vitality into everyday life.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sf70v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wp86v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Viel de Saint-Maux, Charles Fran√ßois, 1745-1819 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- Early works to 1800</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246v083"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Stars, stones and architecture : an episode in John Dee's natural philosophy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wagler, Brent M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The work of John Dee (1527-1608) posits an approach to architecture based upon the concept of wonder. Sympathetic correspondences permeate Dee's disparate practical activities and architectural discourse. His contributions to astronomy, alchemy, cartography and navigation are grounded in the intersubjective cosmology of the Renaissance. It is in Dee's Mathematicall Praeface (1570), which promotes mathematics as a natural philosophy, that the architect's metier is aligned with the marvellous and established as an art encompassing numerous disciplines. Dee's syncretic formulation of architecture is distinctly attuned to the alchemical and magical discourses pervading the Renaissance and established in relation to his hieroglyphic "Monas" symbol. This emblematic device, discussed in the Monas Hieroglyphica (1564), exemplifies the link between architecture and writing. The Monas symbol permits the architect-as-alchemist to contemplate marvels and effect them in practice. In addition to positioning wonder in human activity, as a navigational beacon guiding the work of the architect, Dee signals the possibility of restoring conjuring-the dangerous and denigrated art of sixteenth century England--into architectural practice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97ks556.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246v083</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dee, John, 1527-1608 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rn42j"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Community development for effective slum upgrading : case study: Indore habitat project, Indore, India</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sinha, Abhijat</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Community participation has become an integral part of housing strategy for low income populations of the developing world. In the last three decades, it has gone beyond community involvement in cost recovery, sweat equity or participation in planning, to encompass a large agenda seeking simultaneous social, economic and physical community development. Upgrading settlements of low income urban populations by in-situ infrastructure provision is aimed at bettering access to basic amenities and creation of sustainable living environments. However, evaluations of implemented projects indicate vast gaps between project aims and results, especially with regards to those components that are sensitive to local socioeconomic and political contexts, like community development. Bearing this is in mind, an upgrading project in Indore, India, with a strong community development component was taken up for research. The study evaluated the effectiveness of community development in the improvement of living environments, by comparing project objectives with outcomes. Eight slums covered under the project were surveyed to determine community response to upgrading. The results indicated that inadequate attention was given to community development, despite its potential in improving living conditions in human settlements. Suggestions for improvement of future implementation and areas for further research have been identified.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Vikram</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d632z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rn42j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Community development -- India -- Indore</dc:subject><dc:subject>Slums -- India -- Indore</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azw12z750m"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ecology and community design : with special reference to Northern European ecological communities</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Saunders, Todd D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I write this thesis based on the premise that many environmental problems are the result of conventional community design. I argue that conventional community designs are "anti-ecological" because they consume too much energy, produce an extraordinary amount of waste, are car-oriented, ignore any relationship with the natural environment, and reflect the irresponsible attitude of man conquering nature. However, I suggest that ecologically responsible community design alternatives do exist. I refer to these alternatives as "ecological communities". These communities attempt to function as ecosystems that conserve natural resources, are self-regulating, and produce little waste. I present the central principles of ecological communities, and then explore the validity of these assertions. Using five ecological communities from Northern Europe, I examine the following principles: (1) alternative energy systems at the community-scale, (2) wastewater treatment and water reclamation, (3) waste management in the community, (4) ecologically sustainable landscapes, and (5) environmentally responsible housing. Finally, I present my observations and conclusions. The observations are intended to help community designers to understand the characteristics of ecological communities, and perhaps some of the conditions necessary for these communities to exist. The hope is that these observations may assist community designers avoid common mistakes on similar projects. The observations may shorten the time designers require to transfer their ideas from theory into practice. I conclude that when compared with conventional communities--not with perfection or the utopian dream--ecological communities and what they represent can provide designers with viable development alternatives.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sheppard, Adrian</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000218v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z750m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Urban ecology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Urban ecology -- Europe, Northern</dc:subject><dc:subject>City planning -- Environmental aspects -- Europe, Northern</dc:subject><dc:subject>City planning -- Environmental aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544br556"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Of substantiating nature : the elements of architecture explained in eighteenth century interpretations, retold by Fra Barlo Lodoli</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Paul, Joanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Fra Carlo Lodoli (1690-1761) was a priest and teacher with the Franciscans in Venice. His work encompassed a range of ideas concerning politics, history and architecture. Although he did not personally record his philosophy, his teachings became extremely influential to the period through the writings of his disciples: Memmo, Algarotti, and Milizia. His work was to question the codification of architectural theory as implemented in building. This was done through a critical investigation of the dynamic relationship between nature and human nature. Lodoli's architectural elements were created by a process of substitution which recognized the physical properties of materials and their adaptation into form through the course of culture. Echoing Vico's notion of the poetic, Lodoli used storytelling to express his idea. For Lodoli imagination was fundamental to the integration of program and built form. This role of imagination remains an important synthetic element in the formation of culture, linking memory, invention and making.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237ht84q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544br556</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lodoli, Carlo, 1690-1761</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture, Modern -- 18th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cn02d"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Understanding rural building systems in India</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Niazi, Zeenat</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Building practices in rural areas have developed in response to a variety of interrelated factors like climate, local physiography and socio-cultural traditions. The rural house is as much an agrarian product as the crops and livestock depending on a balanced eco-system. It is characterised by a dependence on the immediate natural environment for materials, high labour and low energy inputs in construction. Unfortunately, depletion of natural resources, changes in resource management structures and rapid monetisation of the rural economy have had abrupt and often detrimental effects on the condition of rural shelter. This research attempts to understand the characteristics of rural building systems in order to identify the nature of interventions required to facilitate the process of shelter upgrading. From a study of six villages in Jhansi district of Bundelkand region, the study demonstrates that indigenous building practices and delivery processes can form effective links in the process mentioned. Local building materials, techniques of construction, service transaction, and methods of skill and information transfer are studied to analyse the factors which influence appropriation of available options by users. This study indicates that effective and sustainable interventions in resources, technologies and delivery processes in rural India will need to utilise the potential offered by the 'network nature' of rural building systems. Any new or improved systems of construction will have to be supplemented by increasing users' access to them and will need to pass through the tests of: (1) Enlarging the range of available options, (2) Augmenting (at least not limiting) the variety and flexibility in delivery options and, (3) Increasing the level of local control in construction and management.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Vikram</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dv268.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cn02d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Housing -- India -- Bundelkhand</dc:subject><dc:subject>Building -- India -- Bundelkhand</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arb68xd81h"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Allegory and the architecture of Francesco Borromini</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacElwee, Andrea L. (Andrea Laurel)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis relates the aspirations (examined in political treatises, literary programs and scientific treaties) of Pope Urban VIIIth with the allegorical spaciality of the architecture of Francesco Borromini. The projects initiated under the patronage of the Pope are particularly related to the Pope's election. Urban's personal impressa, the Angelic Sun is an emblem of this election, a reborn sun, a second personal birth and the elevation of the Angelic Pope (the leader of the age of the Holy Spirit). This is allegorically a metamorphosis like the re-birth of Daphne into Laurel; the Tree of Aeneas and Rome and the principal Barberini impressa. As a dynastic emblem the Laurel unites the cosmic territories of the sun and the moon, the traditional emblems of cosmic kingship and world domination. The metaphysical marriage to Rome (coronation and marriage are ritually linked, like the union of the sun and the moon) metaphorically appropriates the capacity of giving birth through construction, to a new city, an intellectual city in the image of Urban, the threshold for spirit. The architecture 'contains' this intellectual body (city), a dynastic emblem of the Angelic Pope.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870z03j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xd81h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture, Renaissance -- Italy -- Rome</dc:subject><dc:subject>Symbolism in architecture</dc:subject><dc:subject>Borromini, Francesco, 1599-1667 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sf714"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Advanced energy efficient upgrading for affordable homes in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lee, R. Kevin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To what extent can the application of R-2000 and Advanced House energy standards to affordable housing be cost effective, and what are the most appropriate technologies for attaining this goal? While the technology to construct energy efficient houses exists, whether or not this is economically feasible at the affordable housing level remains undetermined. The current lack of knowledge of the issues related to energy efficiency in lower cost housing is a significant barrier to change. The study provides a survey of some of the potential upgrades available on the Canadian market and reviews the incremental cost, performance and potential for acceptance of various options. While varying fuel prices and economic conditions across the country result in equally variant levels of cost effectiveness, it is found that the R-2000 preferred packages, when combined with an energy efficient mortgage (EEM) discount or 1/4 percent, are cost effective in all but one case investigated. Without an EEM, R-2000 upgrading is not cost effective in regions with low fuel prices. Incremental costs for meeting the Advanced House standard are relatively high, but upgrading to this level is found to be cost effective in Halifax (even without an EEM) and in Toronto and Vancouver with an EEM. R-2000 packages should prove acceptable to both builders and buyers, while Advanced House performance requires more significant changes in current practice but could be popular where it is cost effective. Energy efficient upgrading for affordable housing does not appear to be prohibitively expensive in Canada and an opportunity exists to make a significant impact on residential energy consumption.

This is a way to explore the expression of individuality both incorporated in, and invoked by the middle-class single family home, particularly for women. The theme, "the temple within," is intended to create a conceptual framework for the identification of activities which give the elements of the house meaning for the occupants. The elements of house, garden, hearth, entrance, windows, attic/stair/cellar, and walls and spaces, are identified through the analysis of primary sources. These are the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Competition Series stock plans from 1947 to 1963, as well as two suburban homes from the Carlington neighbourhood in Ottawa, Ontario. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the appropriateness of these symbols of home as a vehicle for women's identity of self.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Adams, Annmarie</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Sheppard, Adrian</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cn03p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892d02b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture and women -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture, Domestic -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- Canada -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Housing, Single family -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p096929g"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of medium-rise high-density housing : Beijing, 1979-1990</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Du, Wei, 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In China, huge population and limited arable land resources constitute one of the basic contradictions in urban mass housing design. As a stereotype, medium-rise apartment buildings were constructed to attain high densities all over the country during the 1980s. The extensive use of the housing typologies caused problems in many aspects. This reflects the poverty of architectural solutions and the consequences of the socio-economic systems of the country. Focusing on the aspects of single building design and site planning, this thesis analyses the methods to reach high building densities in medium-rise mass housing design in Beijing from 1979 to 1990. The study is conducted through the review of the socio-economic issues and the introduction of mass housing design of the country. It intends to see the interrelationships between ways to attain high building densities and the socio-economic backgrounds. The research indicates that methods to reach high building densities are many. Ways used in Beijing during 1980s were based on the socio-economic system at the time being. These ways are not appropriate in terms of the unique urban context of the city and could be thus replaced by others.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Vikram</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fr00c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096929g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture -- China -- Beijing -- Designs and plans</dc:subject><dc:subject>Housing -- China -- Beijing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public housing -- China -- Beijing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s161831n"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Courtyard housing : a typological analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Amadouni, Zareh S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the forthcoming decades housing will be facing major controversial issues such as those of achieving higher densities, obtaining socio-cultural acceptance through the retention of the inherent qualities of low rise, low density dwellings, and that of attaining sustainability. Courtyard housing addresses these issues fairly effectively with at least one individual courtyard allocated to every single dwelling unit. Apart from achieving higher densities, it possesses qualities such as ground relatedness, security, territoriality, dwelling identifiability, image of home, personalization, adaptability to alternative lifestyles, the provision of private outdoor space, and child surveillance possibility. These are qualities seldom found in other housing typologies with similar densities and are almost non existent in high-rise, high density projects. Sustainability is achieved through economies in land, infrastructure, building materials, energy, as well as socio-cultural stability. This study investigates the courtyard, the house, the neighborhood, the city and how these relate to the qualities mentioned above. A comprehensive and exhaustive review is also made of courtyard housing projects published since 1960. These are compared and analysed in order to derive possible improvements and suggest alternative solutions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Castro, Ricardo</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c9526.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161831n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Courtyard houses</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87ps66g"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cultural approaches to native Canadian housing : an evaluation of existing housing projects in Cree communities in Northern Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Afshari-Mirak, Ghader</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines social and cultural influences on housing and community planning in the native reserves of Canada. Architects and planners have tended to ignore the socio-cultural legacy of native people for a variety of unjustified reasons: insufficient local research and study, lack of understanding or appreciation, and the iniability to successfully accommodate ancient experience in the problem-solving process; approaches and techniques which may well be adapted to the contemporary context are typically overlooked. Where reference is made in housing and planning reports to socio-cultural issues, no recommendations are given as to how to interpret or apply them. The study bases its analysis on three key terms: culture, community, and living patterns. These concepts are examined in a case study of Cree natives living on four Quebec reserves: Chisasibi, Mistissini, Nemaska, and Waswanipi. The thesis describes indigenous Cree housing; evaluates the existing housing projects built recently by the government and Cree Housing Corporation; details housing and planning problems; and presents conclusions and recommendations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Covo, David</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/000002194.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87ps66g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Indians of North America -- Housing -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cree Indians -- Housing -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Housing -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Housing -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A736666757"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Edifice : op.4, no.2</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Schultz, Arlan N. (Arlan Nelson)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>"EDIFICE" Opus 4. No. 2, is a composition scored for double, mixed chorus, soprano and baritone soli, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in Bb, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in C, 2 trombones, and bass trombone. The piece is based on the poem EDIFICE, by Tean E. Schultz, which was written at the request of the composer. The philosophical impetus of this work stems from the process of perspectival redefinition, the resultant alteration in perceptual space being of primary importance. This could be viewed as the meta-text of the poem and forms the basis for an iconic realization of this concept in "EDIFICE". The work is characterized by the unusual spatial disposition of its constituent ensembles. Specifically, the two mixed choirs are antiphonally situated, one on either side of the audience, with the wood winds and brass set in two concentric circles between the two choirs. The wood winds and bass trombone are enclosed by the remaining brass. This arrangement of the instruments relates directly to the imagery implicit in the third segment of the poem; " ... I will not listen, My self is pouring Outside me; Like a cast of metal Covers me ... ". In terms of compositional designs the work explores such techniques as cyclical permutation of phonemic units derived through the phonetic fragmentation of text segments; phonemic manipulation in a multi-layered texture for the purpose of timbral variation; inexact rhythmic imitation, termed "quasi cannon"; serialized and "eroded" breathing rhythms; continuous redisposition of semi-chromatic pitch cells as foundational harmonic structures; and textural "cross-fading" within the antiphonal distribution of forces.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cherney, Brian</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mm010.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/736666757</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Choruses, Secular (Mixed voices) with instrumental ensemble -- Scores</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar494vn06d"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A mass for mixed voices, winds and percussion</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mullin, Stephen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A Mass for Mixed Voices, Winds and Percussion is a twenty minute composition for chamber choir (SSAATTBB), wind ensemble and percussion.
