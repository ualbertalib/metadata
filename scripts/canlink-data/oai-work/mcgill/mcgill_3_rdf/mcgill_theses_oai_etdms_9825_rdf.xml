It has at last been recognized that our diet affects significantly our physical as well as our psychological well being. Although a great deal of work has been done on diets from the physiological standpoint, very few investigations have been concerned specifically with a psychological approach. The present experiment is designed to study an aspect of the Science of Nutrition from the psyohological approach. While this undertaking was not concerned specifically with either the sciences of Psychology or Nutrition, it was an attempt to experiment in that region where the two disciplines overlap. It was an attempt to associate the two sciences. For it is on the overlapping areas of scientific disciplines that there remains much ignorance, and where research is needed. The object of this experiment is to investigate the effect of a diet deficient in vitamin B on learning ability in rats. Further details will be given in the following chapters. The writer of this thesis does not make claim to much originality. It was rather his attempt to verify the conclusions and to refine and improve the techniques of other workers. The work was begun on December 26,1939. It was concluded about August 24, l940. The writer designed and constructed 25 rat cages, 3 Carr Mazes and 3 galvanized tin tanks.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kellogg, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rp385.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d5700685</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>PSYCHOLOGY -- MENTAL TESTS</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychophysiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vitamin B1</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644v79w"><ual:graduationDate>1939</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Entomology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The standardization of a method for utilizing Drosophila Melanogaster as a test animal for toxicity experiments with nicotine</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cannon, Frederick Merriet</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A considerable amount of work has been done on toxicity by various workers but no definite, satisfactory method of expressing a definition has yet been devised. That an insecticide should be efficient in killing the insects against which it is used goes without saying, but it is difficult to frame a satisfactory definition of toxicity, which, in the case of a contact poison, is concerned with the inherent killing value of the poison as it comes in contact with the exterior of the insect's body. The chief object of these experiments is to develop a simple method of comparing contact insecticides, so that a number of insects can be treated in a reasonable amount of time, and to provide results that can be reproduced by further tests, within the range of experimental error. The method consists of measuring the concentration of nicotine in the form of a sulphate that will give 50 per cent kill, and to use that as a standard. Then the ratio of this amount to the amount of another substance giving the same mortality may be regarded as an insecticidal index for that substance. [...] The action of a contact insecticide [...] may be brought about by an interference with insect respiration caused by mechanical plugging of the spiracles, or by an actual process of tissue alteration or destruction caused by the poison [...] The toxic action of nicotine is that of a fumigant, dependant upon the passage of the vapor into the tracheal system of the insect.

This, and the fact that the genus Salmonella has undergone radical change through the newer methods of antigenic analysis stimulated particularly by White and Kauffmann, seemed to warrant a reinvestigation of the fermentation and agglutination reactions of Salmonella pullorum. As the historical resume will indicate, much of the work done on this organism has aimed at amplifying into species rank minute differences between this organism and the closely similar gallinarum. A discussion on the validity of this species differentiation is included in this thesis as a natural corollary of the main purpose which is to define the criteria by which Salmonella pullorum may be recognized. [...] The existence of cholera-like or typhoid-like epidemics in domestic birds has been known for many years. However, careful bacteriological study has been carried on only since the latter part of the nineteenth century.

But the alkaline earth metals [...] also show a falling off of the photoelectric effect in the ultra-violet (at about 2200 A for barium). Hence one would expect a region of transparency for barium films around that wave-length. It was to check this prediction of theory that the following investigation was carried out. [...] It may be pointed out that expectations based on the conception of free electrons in a metal are less likely to be applicable for divalent metals than for monovalent.

During this period a vast amount of experimental work was undertaken and a more extensive search was made for molybdenum deposits.

The concluding portion is a statistical summary of trade value fluctuations of certain selected commodities, followed by an evaluation of the role of tariff manipulation in evolving these changes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hemmeon, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d9620.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bf77q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>United States -- Commerce -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- Commerce -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pd66m"><ual:graduationDate>1940</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Physical properties and chemical reactions of hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid mixtures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hughes, Robert E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Much work on organic peracids had been done in these laboratories: as a continuation of this work, Hatcher and MacLauchlan measured the conductivity of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide mixtures.

W. Jolliffe, have been engaged in mapping the geology of the area immediately north of Great Slave lake, adjacent to Yellowknife bay and the Yellowknife river. The writer was a student-assistant on these field parties during the summers of 1937, 1938, and 1939. One of the most interesting rock units encountered during this mapping is a basic intrusive sheet which outcrops a short distance east of Yellowknife bay. This gabbroic body is the subject of this thesis.

This conclusion arises from the idea that a gas possesses no structure but a purely chaotic and random distribution and that, in the liquid, the molecules are merely under greater attractive forces due to their closer proximity. Accordingly the transition from the liquid to the gaseous state at the critical temperature should be smooth and the density of the system should be everywhere the same in the system after the critical temperature has been passed.

The investigations of the chemical reactions of the compounds of carbon have shown, in many cases, that rearrangements of the molecular structures concerned might occur either by the simple readjustment of the atoms already present, or as a result of an addition to, or a remova1 from the original molecule of certain atoms or groups of atoms. Since the molecular structure of an organic compound is its fundamental characteristic, the study of these rearrangement processes has become of prime importance.

However, long before this time chemists knew that gold was soluble in aqueous cyanide solutions. In 1805 Hagen stated that "gold was dissolved by a solution of prussiate of potash"(l). The Elkingtons obtained a patent in 1840 for gold plating electrolitically, using as an electrolyte a solution of gold dissolved in potassium cyanide (2). The first scientific literature on the subject was published in 1843 by Prince Bagration (1) who stated "it is certain that in the future, cyanides of potassium must be reckoned as a solvent of gold".

Such fruit is unsuitable for consumption.
