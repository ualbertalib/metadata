Three minutes of the pretreatment caused a reduction of the glycolytic activity to 37%, while twenty minutes decreased it to 11-12%.

Indeed, the negative sequence current can become so high as to produce excessive heating, if the capacity is not kept below certain limits. The necessity of taking a low capacity, however, results in a low starting torque. Furthermore, it is possible to design the auxiliary circuit (effective turn ratio and capacity) to give balanced operation at full load, but such a design reduces the starting torque considerably.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schippel, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g6499.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cv75v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electrical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722hd812"><ual:graduationDate>1955</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Study of short-lived proton induced activities</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cloutier, Roland</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work is concerned with the study of new short-lived activities induced by proton bombardment in the McGill 100 Mev. synchro-cyclotron.

While it has been suggested throughout the literature that this is a learned condition developed during childhood, its appearances in younger children have not yet been studied. The purpose of this study was to document the performance experiences of very young children with respect to performance anxiety.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ryan, Charlene</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j506f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43p215d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anxiety in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music -- Performance -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r7195"><ual:graduationDate>1955</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of Hydrogen Cyanide on the Reaction of Active Nitrogen with Methyl Chloride</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brody, Harry</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Much progress has been made in the study of chemical kinetics on the basis that many reaction mechanisms involve the participation of 'free radicals'. In such mechanisms the overall reaction is assumed to consist of a recurring series, or 'chain', of elementary reactions which can be initiated and propagated by stable but very reactive fragments of molecules, or radicals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.
