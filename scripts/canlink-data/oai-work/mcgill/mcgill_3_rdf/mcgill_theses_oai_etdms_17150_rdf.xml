Among them, Bmal1 is a critical clock gene in generating and maintaining circadian rhythms. Moreover, orphan nuclear receptors REV-ERBs and RORs were known to respectively repress and activate Bmal1 transcription. In our study, we further demonstrated that: (1) REV-ERBalpha might be the main regulator in maintaining Bmal1 oscillation in thymus. (2) Rorgamma mRNA is constant in muscle and testis, and rhythmic in liver, while Rorgammat mRNA is only expressed in thymus, at constant levels. Moreover, the expressions of these two Rorgamma isoforms are affected in Clock mutant mice in a distinct way. (3) RORgamma and RORgammat can activate Bmal1 transcription at a similar level. (4) Rorgamma is a clock-controlled gene. Altogether, our results suggest that the crucial role of REV-ERBs and RORs in peripheral clocks.

Human mutations in the gene encoding PCSK9 lead to either familial hyper- or hypocholesterolemia, resulting from a gain or loss of function, respectively. Mice lacking PCSK9 are viable and show a 42% decrease in plasma cholesterol levels. The enzyme triggers the degradation of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) through a partially unknown mechanism. PCSK9 is very abundant in the liver and intestine during development and adulthood. Hepatocytes have a capacity to reproduce themselves and, upon injury, can repopulate the liver. For a better understanding of the role of PCSK9 in the liver, partial hepatectomy was performed on Pcsk9 +/+, Pcsk9+/- and Pcsk9-/- mice. The absence of PCSK9 resulted in defective liver regeneration, while wild type (WT) and heterozygous mice had no phenotype. Regeneration defects could be prevented by a high cholesterol diet. PCSK9 deficiency, by contributing to maintaining low circulating cholesterol levels may thus hamper liver regeneration. This knowledge is critical for the analysis of future PCSK9 inhibitors expected to be developed in the near future. Key words.

Seven genes with differential expression patterns in the tumor samples compared to the NOSE samples were identified as candidates for further analysis, starting with ARPC4, SRGAP3 and ATP2B2. Although none of the candidates had been previously studied in ovarian cancer, several had either family or pathway members that had. Expression patterns seemed unaffected by either tumor histopathological subtype or the allelic imbalances observed with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis.

Recent studies indicate that metabolic activation of 1,25(OH) 2D3 also occurs in cancer cells such as breast cancer. Consequently, the major objective of this project was to determine if tumoral 25OHD 3-1alphahydroxylase modulates any or all of the stages of breast tumor progression without inducing the hypercalcemic side effects of 1,25(OH) 2D3. For this purpose we used the PyVMT breast cancer mouse model in which the oncoprotein, polyomamiddle T antigen (PyMT) is under the control of mouse mammary tumor virus LTR (MMTV LTR). Mice exhibited tumors restricted to the mammary epithelium progressing to the various stages of breast cancer. Animals were treated with either vehicle, 25OHD3 (2000 pM/24h) or 1,25(OH)2D3 (12pM/24h). Mice treated with the vitamin D precursor, 25OHD3, exhibited a marked reduction in tumor onset and growth comparable to the 1,25(OH)2D3 treated group. Furthermore, biomarkers of tumor progression were markedly reduced in 25OHD3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 animals as compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, mean circulating calcium concentrations remained unchanged in 25OHD3 treated animals but increased significantly in 1,25(OH)2D3 treated animals as compared to controls. Tumoral levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 in mice treated with 25OHD3 were increased 79% in comparison to vehicle control mice. Additionally, 25OHD3 and 1,25(OH)2D 3 treated animals had a significant decrease in the mean number of lung metastases per animal as compared to vehicle treated control animals. This study therefore suggests an important autocrine role of 1alphaOHase expression in breast tumor cells. Furthermore, accumulation of intra-tumoral 1,25(OH) 2D3 in response to 25OHD3 administration strongly suggests that locally produced 1,25(OH)2D3 plays a significant role in restraining tumor growth without inducing the hypercalcemic side effects associated with 1,25(OH)2D3.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386p25j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558h82k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lung Neoplasms -- secondary</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cell Transformation, Neoplastic -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adenocarcinoma</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hyperplasia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Calcitriol -- pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vx63k"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Translation, cultural adaptation and revalidation of the Reintegration to Normal Living (RNL)-Index for use in Spain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rodríguez, Ana María</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The "International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health" (ICF) is a model that classifies health and health-related function. Of the ICF domains, least is known about participation. Although a few measures have been developed in English that tap the construct "Participation", none exist in Spanish. The Reintegration to Normal Living (RNL)-Index is the measure of reference to evaluate participation. The general objective of the present study was to translate, culturally adapt, and assess the psychometric properties the RNL-Index in Spanish for use in Spain. The translation and the cultural adaptation of the RNL-Index consisted of a five-step process, leading to the Spanish version of the RNL-Index (SRNL-Index). Psychometric evaluation consisted of a cross-sectional study design, with a longitudinal design used for test-retest evaluation. Thirty-two subjects with stroke and 36 with total knee arthroplasty completed the SRNL-Index twice, as well as the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT), the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), and for stroke subjects, the Barthel Index (BI). Descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance and post-hoc t tests were calculated, as well as Cronbach's alpha, Pearson's, and Intraclass correlation coefficients. The SRNL-Index was found to be internally consistent. Test-retest reliability was quite poor, being moderately low for the TKA sample and moderate for the stroke sample. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by the correlations between the SRNL-Index's Perception of Self and Daily Activity subscales with the Mental and Physical Component Summary scores of the SF-36. The SRNL-Index has convergent validity as shown by the high correlations between of the SRNL-Index and the 6MWT. Known-groups validity was shown in people with stroke grouped by Barthel Index scores, and in both samples when grouped according to gait speed. The SRNL-Index demonstrated acceptable validity and internal reliability for subjects with stroke and total knee arthroplasty. However, further studies are needed to reassess external validity, reliability, and responsiveness in other populations and other Spanish-speaking countries.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x493r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vx63k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee -- rehabilitation -- Spain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Activities of Daily Living -- Spain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Patient Satisfaction -- Spain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self Concept -- Spain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cerebrovascular Accident -- rehabilitation -- Spain</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278x979"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification and characterization of TMEM 85, a novel suppressor of bax-mediated cell death in yeast</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ring, Giselle Natasha</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The ability to evade apoptosis is an acquired characteristic associated with many normal and pathophysiological processes. TMEM 85 represents a novel transmembrane domain containing human protein isolated in our previous screen for Bax suppressors, but whose function is currently unknown. Using viability and growth assays, we confirmed that TMEM 85 is anti-apoptotic. Four unique human cDNA sequences containing regions distinct from and of perfect identity to our cDNA were present in the database. Analysis of TMEM 85 suggests that it consists of five exons, alternatively spliced to produce at least four different mRNA's and proteins (TMEM 85v1-v4). RT-PCR analysis using RNA isolated from mice and humane tissues show that all transcripts are expressed. Yeast contain an orthologue of the human TMEM 85v1 protein, YGL213C. Surprisingly, the viability assay indicated that mutants lacking YGL231c do not show a hyper-responsive apoptotic phenotype, however its overexpression shows that it is nevertheless anti-apoptotic. Using a yeast strain expressing chromosomally TAP-tagged YGL231c, we found no up-regulation of the endogenous gene due to stress. The deletion mutant is also known to expresses a synthetically lethal phenotype in the presence of alpha-synuclein. While expression of alpha-synuclein caused significant death in both the wild type and deletion mutants, TMEM 85v2 was unable to exhibit a protective role. These findings demonstrate the complexity of the TMEM 85 gene and its anti-apoptotic function in both yeast and human.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mg605.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278x979</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Apoptosis -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>bcl-2-Associated X Protein -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Membrane Proteins -- metabolism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930c192b"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A role for high-risk HPV type 16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins in colorecteral carcinogenesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ricciardi, Riccardo Pietro, 1985-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections play a crucial role in human carcinogenesis. Greater than 96% of all cervical carcinomas are positive for high-risk HPV infections; especially types 16 and 18. High-risk HPV onco-proteins, E6 and E7, are consistently expressed in such cancers and function by inactivating p53 and pRb tumor suppressors, respectively. The presence of high-risk HPVs is also correlated with anogenital cancers. In this study, we examined the effect of high-risk HPV type 16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins in two normal human colorectal epithelial cell lines, NCE1 and NCE5. We report that the expression of E6/E7 proteins, alone, induced cellular transformation of both cell lines; consequently, NCE1-E6/E7 and NCE5-E6/E7 form colonies in soft agar with respect to their wild type cells. This is accompanied by cell cycle deregulation, as is demonstrated by the over-expression of cyclin dependant kinases (cdks) and their respective cyclins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E6/E7 oncoprotein transduction induces migration of colorectal epithelial cells. More still, well analyzed Id gene expression, a family member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors involved in the regulation of cell invasion and metastasis of human cancer cells. In parallel, using tissue microarray analysis we found that the four members of the Id protein family are correlated with the presence of HPV type 16 and 18 in human colon cancer tissues. Our data suggests that high-risk HPV infections are sufficient to induce cellular transformation of normal human colorectal cells, in vitro. Furthermore, the correlation with the Id family of proteins may present a novel set of markers associated with HPV induced colorectal carcinogenesis. Our results may suggest a new approach to detect and prevent colorectal cancer.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf268892g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c192b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Colorectal Neoplasms -- etiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oncogene Proteins, Viral</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axw42nc52q"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Saccharomyces sensu stricto as a model system in ecology and evolution</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Replansky, Taissa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a well-studied model system in genetics and molecular biology.

Growth-arrest specific 6 (gas6) is a novel vitamin-K dependent protein whose role in venous thromboembolism was recently characterized in murine models. Gas6 is suggested to be a prothrombotic protein capable of mediating thrombus stability. However, the association between gas6 and venous thromboembolism has yet to be elucidated in humans. The present work aims to delineate the existence of such an association in humans and propose a mechanism by which gas6 expression is related to venous thromboembolic disease. Methods. To analyze the association between gas6 and venous thromboembolism, a highly specific ELISA method was used to measure plasma gas6 levels in 306 patients with a history of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and 89 control volunteers. Medication history, comorbid conditions and DVT characteristics were documented for the purposes of statistical analyses. Median gas6 levels were compared between the subgroups, and prevalence rate ratios were calculated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to measure the effect of gas6 treatment on the expression of various mediators of coagulation. Murine thrombosis models were developed to serve as in vivo models for thrombosis. Results. The median levels of gas6 were 28.21 ng/ml in patients compared to 26.15 ng/ml in controls (p=0.01). After adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity and medications, DVT patients had a PRR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.36 to 4.61, p=0.003) compared with controls. Within the DVT subgroup, median gas6 levels were significantly higher in those with cancer-associated (vs. unprovoked or secondary) DVT (p&lt;0.001) and in those with more extensive DVT (p=0.037), while levels were significantly lower in those taking warfarin (vs. no warfarin) (p=0.03). Preliminary results with endothelial cell cultures are inconclusive with regards to the effect of gas6 on endothelium derived mediators of coagulation. Conclusions. Elevated plasma gas6 is associated with venous thromboembolism. The etiology of the clot influences detected levels of gas6, with the highest levels seen in cancer-patients. Furthermore, increasing clot burden correlates with elevated levels of gas6. A mechanistic explanation for how gas6 modulates this association is in its preliminary stages, and is worth pursuing.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rs554.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k604p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Venous Thrombosis -- etiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m760j"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Importance of diabetes as a risk factor for fractures after solid organ transplantation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Räkel, Agnès</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. Diabetes seems to be associated with an increased risk of fractures in the general population. We aimed to determine whether pre-transplant diabetes increases the risk of fractures among patients receiving solid organ transplantation. Methods. We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of subjects 18 years and older who received a first solid organ transplantation in Quebec between January 1st 1986 and July 31st 2005, and who were covered by the RAMQ drug plan at least 1 year before the transplantation and 3 months after the date of discharge from the transplantation hospitalization. Cases were subjects from the cohort who had sustained a fracture between the date of discharge from the hospitalization for transplantation and the end of the study period or the patient's death. The fracture date was the case index date. All incidental fractures were included except fractures of the skull, phalanges of the hand and foot, multiple fractures and pathological fractures, and were identified by medical service claims. Controls were matched to cases on the type of organ transplanted and on the date of the transplantation (+/- 3 months). Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were obtained with univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression models. Results. The study included 238 cases and 873 controls. Pre-transplant diabetes was present in 30% of the cases and 22% of the controls (crude OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.7--2.8). After adjusting for potential confounders, pre-transplantation diabetes remained a significant risk factor for fractures (adjusted OR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.5--2.6). Conclusion.

Thus preliminary results suggest that protein consumption at 35% of energy has a positive effect on body weight and does not hinder the mechanical abilities of bone.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kx482.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g867c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bones -- Composition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body composition</dc:subject><dc:subject>High-protein diet</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body weight</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hg77k"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Head &amp; neck circumference ratio and body mass index as possible risk factors for concussions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Puni, Vishal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two anthropometric measurements were evaluated as possible risk factors for concussions among university contact-sport athletes: head and neck circumference ratio (HNCR) and body mass index (BMI). Athletes (N=575) competing in intercollegiate football, hockey, and soccer were followed prospectively for concussions over a 4-year period. A total of 86 concussions occurred, with a higher incidence among the female athletes. For HNCR, there was no consistent association observed with the exception of female hockey players. For BMI, there was no consistent association observed with the exception of male soccer players. Linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant inverse association between HNCR and BMI among concussed athletes for both genders (p&lt;0.001). In conclusion, the novel HNCR was found to be a valid and reliable measurement ratio that may have potential clinical applications in predicting the risk of sustaining a concussion among contact-sport athletes.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd473108p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hg77k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Risk Factors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body Mass Index</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain Concussion</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rm87x"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Raman and near infrared spectroscopic analysis of amniotic fluid : metabolomics of maternal and fetal health indicators</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Power, Kristin Marie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents quantitative tools for the metabolomic analysis of amniotic fluid (AF) using vibrational spectroscopy. A total of 300 AF samples were collected for this retrospective cohort study and both Raman and near infrared (NIR) spectra were measured. Spectral data was compressed using a Haar wavelet transform and stage-wise multilinear regression (MLR). Calibration models were calculated for glucose, lactate and uric acid concentrations in AF. Birth weight, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and gestational age were classified with the resulting compressed Raman and NIR spectra, using a genetic algorithm (GA) and a cross-validation approach. Results show that both Raman and NIR spectra of AF were not able to estimate the concentrations of glucose, lactate or uric acid with high precision. However, metabolomic analysis of AF Raman and NIR spectra was capable of estimating the development of GDM, abnormal birth weights as well as gestational ages with sensitivities &gt;75% and specificities &gt;77%. In addition, Raman and NIR metabolomic profiles showed a statistical difference in patients delivering preterm. Of the two spectroscopic analyses studied, NIR spectroscopy of AF has the potential to become a robust and non-invasive diagnostic tool for maternal and fetal health.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s615g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rm87x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Amniotic liquid -- Analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diabetes in pregnancy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fetus -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Near infrared spectroscopy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Birth weight</dc:subject><dc:subject>Raman spectroscopy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A47429f066"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Environmental niche partitioning among riparian sedges (Carex, Cyperaceae) in the St. Lawrence Valley, Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Plourde, Laura</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To understand maintenance of the within-habitat diversity of closely related species, I investigated 11 Carex species growing along rivers in the south-western St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec.

Species appear to fall into groups based on their tolerance of flooding and are secondarily differentiated on other environmental gradients such as insolation, soil pH and soil organic matter. Several traits were related to the environments that species inhabit: diaspore weight, diaspore floating duration, and root aerenchyma. The absence of any phylogenetic trend in niche differences for pairs of species supports the idea that evolutionary differentiation of the alpha-niche is the basis for coexistence of congeners.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jq340.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429f066</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Carex -- Habitat -- Saint Lawrence River Valley</dc:subject><dc:subject>Habitat partitioning (Ecology) -- Saint Lawrence River Valley</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579w96d"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Linear stability of coaxial jets with application to aeroacoustics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Perrault-Joncas, Dominique C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Motivated by a practical interest in noise generated by turbofan engine, this thesis studies the stability of parallel coaxial jets with velocity and temperature profiles characteristic of the exhaust region of the engine. Because the bypass stream mixes with both the exhaust and the ambient air, these profiles contain thin layers in which the velocity and temperature may vary rapidly. As a consequence, multiple instability modes are possible. In accordance with Rayleigh's theorem for axisymmetric incompressible shear flows, it follows that there are three possible modes, only two of which are unstable. To complement the study of parallel flow stability, this thesis also includes the derivation of the amplitude evolution equation for slowly varying axisymmetric incompressible flows.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj2365937.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579w96d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Jets -- Fluid dynamics -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aerodynamic noise -- Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35tc87g"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Investigating a role for the ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1 during synaptic remodeling in the adult mouse</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pearson, Vanessa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Glial-derived lipoparticles facilitate the transport of cholesterol and lipids between cells within the CNS and have been shown to support neuronal growth and synaptogenesis. Partial deafferentation of the hippocampus by unilateral entorhinal cortex lesioning (uECL) induces well-described cytoarchitectural reorganisation and reactive sprouting in the dentate gyrus (DG). Previous studies have demonstrated a dynamic regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in the hippocampus following deafferentation, and suggest that mechanisms facilitating cholesterol transport are important during reinnervation. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that statins, a family of cholesterol-lowering drugs which inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA-R), may confer neuroprotection following trauma. The ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC) A1 and G1 assist the generation of lipoparticles by mediating cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to extracellular apolipoprotein E (APOE), the brain's primary lipoprotein. To examine a role for these transporters in the regulation of cholesterol efflux during synaptic remodelling, and the effects of low-dose pravastatin (a potent HMGCoA-R inhibitor) on such intercellular transport mechanisms, we measured the expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, APOE, apoE(LDL)R and HMGCoA-R in the hippocampus of saline and pravastatin treated mice over time following uECL. It is shown here that ABCA1 and not ABCG1 is up-regulated at the level of mRNA and protein expression, along with APOE, in the hippocampus during active regeneration (14DPL) as determined by histochemical analysis of acetylcholinesterase staining density in the DG. While pravastatin treatment was observed to differentially influence the expression of ABCA1 mRNA and protein over time, no effects on APOE or ABCG1 mRNA expression were observed following uECL. Additionally, HMGCoA-R mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated at 21 DPL in the deafferented hippocampus in pravastatin-treated animals. While the low-dose pravastatin treatment applied here was sufficient to inhibit HMGCoA-R activity in the liver, enzymatic activity was unaffected in the cortex. These findings suggest that ABCA1 and not ABCG1 may be important in the APOE-mediated cholesterol recycling observed during the active phase of neural reinnervation in response to uECL. In addition, the results presented here suggest that the administration of clinically-relevant statin therapy may be sufficient to influence the regulation of cerebral cholesterol homeostasis following trauma in the adult mouse brain.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752m54h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tc87g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Homeostasis -- drug effects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cholesterol -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pravastatin -- therapeutic use</dc:subject><dc:subject>ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain Injuries -- drug therapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881q726"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Augmented aortic atherosclerosis in ApoE deficient mice with targeted overexpression of urotensin-II receptor</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Papadopoulos, Panayiota</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Urotensin-II (U-II) and its receptor UT are upregulated in the pathological setting of various cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis. However, their exact role in atherosclerosis remains to be determined. In the present study, we hypothesized that selective overexpression of UT in an SMC-specific fashion would increase atherosclerotic lesion formation in a hypercholesterolemic mouse model. The objectives were to demonstrate the role of UT in this mouse model of atherosclerosis, and to elucidate some of the mechanism involved in the process. We used four strains of mice; wildtype (WT), UT+ (a transgenic strain expressing human UT driven by the alpha-SM22 promoter), ApoE knockout (ko), and UT+/ApoE ko. All animals were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in UT expression in UT+ and ApoE ko mice (P&lt;0.05). Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly increased in ApoE ko and in UT+/ApoE ko but not in UT + mice when compared to wild type mice (P&lt;0.0001). Analysis of aortas showed a significant increase in atherosclerotic lesion in the UT +, ApoE ko and UT+/ApoE ko compared to WT mice (P&lt;0.05). Oral administration of the UT receptor antagonist SB-657510A for 10 weeks in a group of ApoE ko mice fed a high fat diet resulted in a significant reduction of lesion (P&lt;0.001). Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of strong expression of UT and U-II proteins in the atheroma of UT+, ApoE ko and UT+/ApoE ko mice, particularly in foam cells. SB-657510A also significantly reduced ACAT-1 protein expression in the atherosclerotic lesion of ApoE ko mice (P&lt;0.05). The present findings suggest that the use of UT receptor antagonists may reduce lesion formation through reduced foam cell formation and lipid uptake, demonstrating an important role for UT in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65vc24s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881q726</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Diet, Atherogenic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atherosclerosis -- physiopathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Urotensins -- physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Apolipoproteins E -- genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h323c"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Security aspects of zero knowledge identification schemes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Panait, Andreea Mihaela</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis we follow two directions: Zero Knowledge Protocols and the Discrete Logarithm Problem.

Bach and their influence on Mozart</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Goodchild, Meghan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During his lifetime, Johann Christian Bach (1739--1782) was considered the most famous musician of the Bach family throughout England and Europe. Although his music was highly regarded in the eighteenth century, little scholarly work has been undertaken on the historical and analytical aspects of his compositions. His keyboard compositions are valuable in tracing his musical development since this was the only genre that he wrote throughout his career in Berlin, Milan and London. Previous analyses of Bach's keyboard music have mainly focused on stylistic development, thus neglecting the importance of phrase and larger formal functions. I adopt William Caplin's theory of formal functions to analyze Bach's solo keyboard sonatas: the Solo in A minor from Berlin (1750--55), three sonatas from the Milan collection (1755), six sonatas from London Op. 5 (1767), and six sonatas from London Op. 17 (1773--4). I demonstrate that Bach gradually refines phrase and thematic functions of the exposition of first-movement sonatas. I examine Bach's use of core technique and subordinate theme-like units in development sections and discuss the reasoning behind different recapitulation strategies. I also compare the sonata forms of the first movement to the second and third movements, and discuss other types of large-scale formal design (theme and variations, minuet and trio, and rondo). Many sources indicate that Mozart was greatly influenced by Bach, but they remain vague in describing the type and extent of this influence. Building on previous melodic, motivic and stylistic studies, I draw important phrase-structural connections between the music of Bach and Mozart. I discuss the construction of Mozart's early piano pieces (KV 6 through K 284) and demonstrate that he adopts particular phrase-structural and thematic designs similar to pieces from Bach's Op. 5 and 17 collections. Through form functional analysis, I illustrate Bach's development of phrase and thematic structures and provide important phrase-structural evidence of his influence on the music of Mozart.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tz93x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579w97p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bach, Johann .Christian.

During this time, sugar played a vital role to the lives of both European and non-Europeans as it was a source of great wealth for many and became transformed into one of the most demanded and widely consumed commodity. From the earliest days of British colonization, the cultivation and production of sugar in the Caribbean has been inextricably linked with the trade in African slaves to provide free labor for plantation owners and planters. This thesis considers how European artists visually represented sugar in its various forms---as an object for botanical study, as landscape and as consumable commodity---and in so doing, constructed specific ideas about the African slave body and the use of African slave labor that reflected personal and imperial agendas and ideologies.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623j2616.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jz066</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sugar trade -- West Indies -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plantations -- West Indies -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Beverages -- Great Britain -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sugar -- Great Britain -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Slaves -- West Indies -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445ch901"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Non-democratic peace in South America : comparing the Beagle Channel Crisis (1977-1978) and the Cenepa Crisis (1994-1995)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Francisco Ferrada, Mila</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The following study develops a structured focused comparison of two South American territorial crises: the Beagle Channel Crisis between Argentina and Chile (1977--1978) and the Cenepa Crisis between Ecuador and Peru (1994--1995). From a conventional perspective, the Beagle Channel Crisis should have escalated to war because it was a fully militarized inter-state crisis carried out by a military dyad. In contrast, the Cenepa Crisis should not have ended in war because it was a democratic dyad and the dissatisfied state was the weaker power. Yet the opposite happened in both cases: in the Beagle Channel Crisis the escalation process was contained, whereas in the Cenepa Crisis the situation escalated into an intensive war. Based on a comparison of these two dyads, this study argues that deterrence strategy alone is not sufficient to prevent war. Only an interaction of deterrence strategy and third party involvement can contain an escalatory process, constituting a tool for strengthening deterrence.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tc88r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445ch901</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Deterrence (Strategy) -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Boundary disputes</dc:subject><dc:subject>South America -- Politics and government -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c4237"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A conversation among equals : courts, legislatures and the notwithstanding clause</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Forrest, Christopher</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Dialogue between courts and legislatures can occur where legislatures reverse, modify or avoid judicial decisions. With two exceptions, however, legislatures have only reversed the Supreme Court on three occasions. Defiant legislative responses enacted without the notwithstanding clause undermine the Charter and the courts, and are an inappropriate means of expressing institutional disagreement. However, based on a model of coordinate constitutionalism, recourse to the override constitutes a legitimate means for legislatures to advance alternate interpretations of Charter rights. Furthermore, section 33's value lies in the opportunity it creates for public deliberation regarding issues of national importance. Its relative disuse can be attributed to a combination of factors including its legislative history, the influence of American constitutionalism and an executive-dominated parliamentary process. Recognizing the legitimacy of section 33 would contribute to a greater respect for the roles and responsibilities of all three branches of government under a system of constitutional supremacy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397c85t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c4237</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Constitutional law -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada.

As a result, this piece of legislation fails to recognize and respect the jurisdictional authority of First Nations over their own internal socio-political structures and systems. The FNGA is therefore a colonial assault on First Nations' jurisdiction in the realm of governance undermining the right to self-government and self-determination of First Nations. I demonstrate this by examining three major issues dealt with in the FNGA: the status of historical and modern Canada-First Nations treaties, the jurisdiction of First Nations governance authority as well as control over band membership and Indian status classification systems.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483n826.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t296q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Indians of North America -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indians of North America -- Canada -- Government relations -- 1951-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indians of North America -- Canada -- Politics and government</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajw827g48q"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Intercollegiate coaches' perceptions of the knowledge and strategies used with elite culturally diverse athletes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Duchesne, Catherine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to identify the knowledge and successful strategies utilized by intercollegiate team sport coaches who have worked with a large number of international athletes. Six head coaches were selected to participate in a semi-structured open-ended interview. At the time of data collection, each participant was coaching a Division I NCAA university female soccer team and had coached at least two international athletes per season in the last five years or at least 10 international student athletes throughout their head coaching careers. An interview guide was created exclusively for this study. The analysis of the data was based on the tenets of grounded theory and followed an inductive process of theory development (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990). Using the CM and the MML as frameworks, a modified model was designed to portray the cultural perspective of the coaching process. Seven categories indicated the coaches' knowledge of cultural diversity on both athlete development and team success. The categories were called International Athlete Development and International Athlete Performance and Satisfaction, which revealed the coaches' perceptions on international athlete and personal development; (3) Environmental Context, which discussed the American dimension of coaching intercollegiate female soccer athletes; (4) Social and Team Structure, which was the implementation of cultural coaching knowledge, and the following categories; (5) Coach Philosophies and Experiences; (6) International Athlete Individual Aspects and (7) Game Preparation and Game Day, which defined coaches cultural understanding as it relates to aspects of training and competition. This study provided a deeper understanding of cultural coaching competence, leading to the recommendation of effective strategies and interventions for coaching culturally diverse teams and athletes.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hp11w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827g48q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Coaching (Athletics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multicultural education</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
