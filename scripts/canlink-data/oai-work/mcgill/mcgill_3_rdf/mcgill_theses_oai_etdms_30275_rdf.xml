sertão</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dayrell Porto, Sergio</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to reveal communication as an interpretive process, as a symbolic form capable of reproducing reality, and finally, as a model of social and dramatic production of meaning. Just as religion, science, myth, philosophy, politics and technology have intimate contact with reality and reproduce specific ways of interpreting it, communication, by its necessary use of language and discourse is another specific way of knowing and interpreting reality. By producting texts which mimetize reality, communication reproduces life symbolically and historically. Message in communication is usually sent by means of a medium and this process of transmission and reception is only possible through the intervention of language. But all language is a paradox: at the same time, it unites and separates men as they are engaged in the process of apprehending reality. It draws the subject closer to reality as it also distanciates, being based on the sign which both hides and reveals reality. It is concretized in texts, works, and discourse, which are both close and far from reality by their objective tendency which characterizes them as things. Thus, the discourse of reality, which is what communication purports to be, is both true and false, close and far. In this way, communication unites and separates men, parodoxically. Joao Guimaraes Rosa reiterates in his novel 'Grande Sertao: Veredas' that 'life is dangerous and telling a story is difficult.' In another analogy, communication is problematic with regard to a reality which is always both easily and difficultly accessible. 'Events' are more than simple occurances: they gain 'meaning' as mimetic discourse extends and amplifies their significance and as communication places them within a specific culture, giving them at the same time comparative relief by confronting them with meanings from other cultures. The test which follows tends to justify communication as one of the viable models for apprehending and interpreting reality. Literary discourse was chosen to demonstrate, onto-logically and dramatically, that reality is close and far from us at the same time.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440v01n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r259c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mass Communications</dc:subject><dc:subject>Communication</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rosa, João Guimarães, 1908-1967.

A detailed analysis of cognitive and behavioral data on the resource management of Waswanipi Cree hunters shows how religious beliefs incorporate both cultural logics and realistic models of environmental relationships; and, how action informed by those beliefs can effectively manage hunting, animal populations, human population distributions, and subsistence. Beliefs are formulated as recipes that apply to diverse situations so that actions informed by these are responsive to changing conditions. Decisions concerning alternative goals, situations and strategies are shown to be socially located with the men who are the "owners" of hunting territories. </dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g60r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jh343t725</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anthropology, Cultural</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cree Indians -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human ecology -- Québec (Province) -- Waswanipi River Region</dc:subject><dc:subject>Waswanipi River Region, Québec -- Economic conditions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m812k"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Geology of the Kiglapait layered intrusion, coast of Labrador, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Morse, Stearns A.

The coating properties are closely related to the microstructure of deposit. Among them, texture is a key factor which influences the coating properties. This study demonstrates the microstructure and corrosion behaviors of the electrodeposited zinc, zinc-iron, and zinc-nickel coatings on steel sheet deposited at different current density, pH and coating thicknesses. The evolution of the coating microstructure--texture, surface morphology, interplanar spacings, microstress, alloy content, and phase composition--is investigated in various deposition conditions. This work also demonstrates the influence of the coating microstructure upon corrosion behavior. In addition, the early stage of deposition behavior is observed in order to demonstrate the growth mechanism of deposits. The surface morphology and texture of coatings are investigated using AFM (Atomic Force Microscope), SEM and x-ray diffractometers. Corrosion behaviors are analyzed by the Tafel extrapolation method from the potentiodynamic polarization curves as well as by the electrochemical noise tests. It is found that the zinc based coatings show a significant variation in texture with the change of deposition parameters. The present work suggests that the transformation of texture is closely related to the evolution of coating morphology and the change of alloy content in the deposit as well as phase composition. This work also demonstrates that there is a correlation between morphology and the texture of coatings. The morphology of hexagonal platelets represents the basal $ {0001 }$ fiber texture. The morphology of hexagonal ridges represents the pyramidal non-fiber texture and the morphology of triangular-based pyramids represents the pyramidal $ {$101X$ }$ fiber texture. From the corrosion test, it is found that the texture of coatings strongly influences corrosion resistance. The coatings with strong $ {0001 }$ texture have better corrosion resistance than the coatings with weak $ {0001 }$ texture or a $ {$101X$ }$ fiber texture component. The influence of alloy content and phase composition upon corrosion behavior is also discussed. Consequently, it is proposed how to optimize the deposition process to obtain the desirable texture, morphology and alloy content of the deposit for better corrosion resistance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Szpunar, J.

To illuminate the right hemisphere's role in prosodic processing, and to explore the interaction between linguistic and emotional suprasegmental cues in speech production and perception, two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, utterances conveying three prosodic distinctions (emphatic stress, sentence modality, emotional tone) were elicited from normal (NC) and right-hemisphere-damaged (RHD) adults and then subjected to acoustic analysis. Results indicated that the intonation patterns produced by RHD patients were relatively normal in overall shape, but significantly restricted in fundamental frequency (F$ sb0$) variation relative to those produced by normal subjects. The RHD speakers also supplied fewer duration and F$ sb0$ cues to emphatic stress, and demonstrated aberrant control of speech rate and mean F$ sb0$ in expressing discrete emotions relative to the NC speakers. In Experiment 2, six receptive tasks in which the F$ sb0$ or duration parameters of prosodic stimuli were systematically altered, were presented to NC, RHD, and left-hemisphere-damaged (LHD) adults for linguistic or emotional identification. Results obtained for this experiment revealed that both the RHD and LHD patients were impaired in the recognition of emotional prosody, but that only the LHD patients were disturbed in perceiving linguistic specifications via prosodic cues. The outcome of both experiments is discussed with respect to current theories of the lateralization of prosodic processing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baum, Shari R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zq01x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472x99b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Speech Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7h149r133"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the reconfiguration and reachability of chains</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pei, Naixun</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A chain is a sequence of rigid rods or links consecutively connected at their endjoints, about which they may rotate freely. A planar chain is a chain whose links lie in the plane, with links allowed to cross over one another. For a chain $ Gamma$ constrained to lie in a confining region P, the reachability problem for $ Gamma$ is to determine, given a point $p in P$ and an initial configuration of $ Gamma$ inside P, whether $ Gamma$ can be moved within P so that the endjoint of $ Gamma$ reaches p, and if so, how this can be done. This thesis solves the reachability problem of a planar chain $ Gamma$ confined within a convex obtuse polygon P, a convex polygon whose interior angles each measure $ pi$/2 or more. In particular, we propose a uniform approach in which the geometry of $ Gamma$ and its confining region P are studied together. We use this to obtain a family of pairs $( Gamma, P),$ which is largest possible in some sense, so that the reachability problem for each pair in the family can be solved quickly. We also examine the properties of the reachable region of $ Gamma$ in such a pair. This thesis also presents reconfiguration results for an n-link planar chain $ Gamma$ inside a circle. We show that if each link of $ Gamma$ is less than the radius of its confining circle, then $ Gamma$ can be moved between any of its configurations inside the circle in $O(n sp2)$ time. Our results demonstrate how to design short link chains within a given confining environment in order to ensure fast reconfiguration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Whitesides, Sue H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mr400.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149r133</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A707959262"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Consequences of constraint ranking</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pater, Joseph Vernon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993) makes the claim that well-formedness constraints are ranked and minimally violable.

Inoculum density, dew period, and plant height are factors influencing biocontrol of S. zeylanica with this indigenous pathogen. Significantly higher percent reductions in plant height and dry weight were obtained and all plants were killed at higher inoculum concentrations with 8 h of dew. The number, germination, and virulence of conidia were significantly affected by production techniques, temperature, light condition, and incubation period. Exposure to continuous near-ultraviolet (NUV) light at 28$ sp circ$C stimulated sporulation on agar media and on solid substrates. Overall, the best production technique was the use of sorghum seeds using an equal quantity of sorghum seeds and water (w/v) incubated for four weeks. Another conidia production method using the sporulation medium (S-medium) technique was evaluated with the addition of 20 g L$ sp{-1}$ of calcium carbonate (CaCO$ sb3)$ and 2 ml of sterile distilled water. Primary 1/2 PDA at 18$ sp circ$C in the dark produced the most virulent conidia. This technique produced conidia relatively rapid, but was labour intensive. Host range studies using 49 plant species in 40 genera representing 20 families, selected by using a modified centrifugal phylogenetic and variety strategy indicated that only S. zeylanica was susceptible in the absence and presence of supplemental dew. On the basis of morphological and cultural characteristics, pathogenicity on the host, host specificity, and the absence of a previous record of this fungal pathogen on S. zeylanica, the binomial A. alternata f. sp. sphenocleae is proposed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Paulitz, Timothy C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zz086.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d1351</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sphenoclea -- Biological control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alternaria diseases</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z708z22v"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Judgement and choice : politics and ideology in early eighteenth-century masques</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McLeod, Kenneth A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The faculty of judgment, whether aesthetic, political, or moral, held a central position in the life of eighteenth-century England. This dissertation reveals the political ideologies underlying the aesthetic judgments (made by composers, audiences, and characters) in a repertoire of masque settings of William Congreve's libretto, The Judgment of Paris from 1701 to 1742. Chapter One provides an introduction to English political history in the early to mid-eighteenth century, in particular the Parliamentary strife which existed between the Whig and Tory parties, and documents the influence of politics on cultural production and aesthetic ideology. Chapter Two outlines the events surrounding the "The Prize Musick" competition including the circumstances of its inception, sponsors, competitors, and outcome. This chapter also discusses Congreve's ties to the Whig party and the structure and content of his libretto. Chapter Three analyses and compares the settings of the original extant settings from the competition by Daniel Purcell, John Weldon, and John Eccles with emphasis on their relative strengths of orchestration, harmonic structure, and motivic content. In Chapter Four new settings of Congreve's libretto, dating from the 1740s, by Giuseppe Sammartini and Thomas Arne are analysed and compared, both to each other and to the earlier "Prize" settings. This chapter also discusses the rise of other dramatic works based on similar "judgment" or "choice" plots such as Handel's The Choice of Hercules. Finally, Chapter Five outlines the historical function of music and aesthetic judgment in maintaining an orderly society and the role of The Judgment of Paris settings in fulfilling this function.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cumming, Julie E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h609m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708z22v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music -- England -- 18th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Masques with music -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Congreve, William, 1670-1729.

Microinjections of the local anaesthetic lidocaine were made into the medial or lateral thalamic nuclei. The results indicate that the medial thalamic nuclei mediate the expression of pain behavior after peripheral injury, whereas the lateral thalamic nuclei influence phasic withdrawal responses, but are not critical for injury-induced pain responses. Electrolytic lesions made in the lateral thalamus verified this latter finding. Intracranial microinjections of the NMDA antagonist AP5 were used to determine if NMDA receptors in the forebrain participate in pain-related central processing. The intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the striatum and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation were indicated as forebrain sites where antagonism of NMDA-sensitive neural mechanisms significantly reduced the expression of pain-related behavior in the formalin test.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Melzack, Ronald</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182m78t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h335x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Methyl aspartate</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pain -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lidocaine -- Physiological effect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Analgesia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246t515"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Preferences of consumers age 50+ for typography of product instruction labels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Metz, Marilyn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Fifty well-educated consumers over 50 years of age selected print variables within the safety zone for optimal print presentation. A Typography Variable Score (TVScore) matrix based on deviations from optimal print was developed in order to provide a means of assessing consumer product instruction labels. There was a significant correlation between the TVScore and participants' ratings of ease of reading and attractiveness of 40 product instruction labels presented. A modified Miscue Analysis procedure was developed and used to assess the influence of typography on the ease of reading of labels with different typography and TVScores.

C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I investigated the desensitization mechanisms of the serotonin 1A (5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$) and 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1B}$ receptors at the molecular level. Receptor phosphorylation by second messenger kinases and G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRK) is an initial step in the functional desensitization of G-protein coupled receptor receptors (GPCRs). Evidence suggested that PKC preactivation desensitizes the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptor. In Ltk-cells, PKC preactivation is pathway-selective, blocks receptor-mediated calcium mobilization but not cAMP inhibition. My first objective was to identify if the prime phosphorylation target of PKC was the receptor itself. Four PKC phosphorylation sites on the 5-HT1A receptor were eliminated using site-directed mutagenesis. The signalling profile of single mutants, and third loop double and triple mutants were examined in Ltk-cells. I determined that the prime target of PKC was the receptor since multiple PKC phosphorylation sites in the third loop mediated pathway-selective uncoupling of the receptor from the calcium mobilization pathway and not the adenylyl cyclase. The PKC site in the second loop of the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptor was shown to be a critical G-protein-contact site in both neuroendocrine and mesenchymal cells. My second objective was to investigate if GRK-mediated phosphorylation could enhance homologous desensitization of the endogenously expressed 5-H$ sb{ rm 1B}$ receptor in the opossum kidney (OK) cell line. To define the role of endogenous GRK in desensitization, I cloned the OK-GRK$ sb2$ from the OK cell Line and generated a kinase inactive mutant. The GRK$ sb2$ was shown to phosphorylate an epitope tagged 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1B}$ receptor in vitro. However, in intact cells the OK-GRK$ sb2$ did not enhance agonist-induced desensitization of the 5-HT1B receptor, but enhanced the desensitization of the $ alpha$2C receptor. The kinase-inactive mutant or reduction in OK-GRK2 protein levels using antisense GRK2 cDNA both attenuated the desensitization of the $ alpha$2C receptor but not the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1B}$ receptor. These results suggest that phosphorylation mediated by GRKs in vitro may not mimic in vivo receptor desensitization. Processes other than those mediated by GRKs may be more important for the desensitization of the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1B}$ receptor in the OK cells. In conclusion, I have identified two possible mechanisms by which two related receptors, 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ and 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1B}$ receptors, are regulated by protein kinases: receptor phosphorylation by PKC and GRK. My results suggest that receptor phosphorylation by PKC plays a role in pathway selective desensitization of the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptor, while phosphorylation the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1B}$ receptor by GRK, observed in vitro, does not play an important role in the homologous desensitization of the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1B}$ receptor.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Albert, P.

Prolidase deficiency (PD) (McKusick no. 170100) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a highly variable clinical phenotype. Mutation analysis was performed on a panel of 10 PD cell lines. Single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) analysis on four overlapping cDNA-PCR products covering the entire coding region of the prolidase gene revealed seven novel mutations: G $ to$ A,551 (R184Q); G $ to$ A,833 (G278D); G $ to$ A, 1342 (G448R); G $ to$ A, 1354 (E452K); delGAG, 1354-1356 (delE452); a deletion of exon 5; and a deletion of exon 7. We used inverse PCR to clone intronic regions flanking exons 5 and 7 and designed primers for conventional PCR of these regions of the genome in patients expressing mRNAs with deleted exons. Two splice acceptor site mutations were identified: a G $ to$ C, nt $-$1 of intron 4 and an A $ to$ G, nt $-$2 of intron 6. To assess the biochemical phenotypes of four of these mutations (R184Q, G278D, G448R, and delE452), we have designed a transient expression system for prolidase in COS-1 cells. The enzyme was expressed as a fusion protein carrying the HA1 epitope of influenza hemagglutinin, allowing its immunological discrimination from the endogenous enzyme. Expression of the R184Q mutation produced 7.4% of control enzymatic activity while the expression of the G278D, G448R and delE452 produced inactive enzymes. Western analysis of the R184Q, G278D and G448R prolidases revealed stable immunoreactive material whereas the delE452 prolidase was not detectable. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the delE452 mutant protein was synthesized but unstable. The R184Q allele is carried by an asymptomatic individual, suggesting that its residual activity may be sufficient to prevent the development of symptoms. The other alleles, G278D, G448R, and delE452 which completely abolish enzyme activity associate with the symptomatic form of the disorder. Interestingly, these substitutions are all located at or very close to the putative metal binding residues of prolidase. We have cloned and sequenced the mouse prolidase cDNA. We have cloned a genomic DNA fragment which carries exons 2, 3, and 4 of the mouse prolidase gene. We constructed a vector for the targeted disruption of the prolidase gene in mouse embryonic stem cells, to create a mouse model for prolidase deficiency.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hechtman, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78td62j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r001v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Prolidase deficiency</dc:subject><dc:subject>Molecular genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182m793"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Narrative strategies and Debussy's late style</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Leydon, Rebecca Victoria</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Many music scholars share a belief in a deep-seated connection between music and language. This belief underlies the exploration of homologies between musical and linguistic structures that have been an important area of study within our field. In recent years, however, a number of scholars have been considering larger units of musical structure, taking as their model not the syntactic structure of the sentence, but rather the organizational structure of whole narrative texts. One goal of narratology is to investigate the ways that events experienced separately are comprehended as a unified whole. Because of its attention to the interplay of schema-driven and data-driven perception, narrative theory is suggestive of an approach to the study of the early post-tonal repertoire, music that involves both tonal configurations and atonal, "intra-opus" processes. Debussy's late works, which include the Etudes and the three Sonatas, exhibit a distinct style which combines elements of late nineteenth-century chromaticism with atonal features, innovative formal structures and new pitch resources. This study begins with the assumption that the large-scale tonal structure of most nineteenth-century instrumental music is analogous to the "plot" of a classical narrative text; in contrast, Debussy's quasi-tonal structures represent alternatives to that classical narrative syntax. I view Debussy's innovative musical language as a departure from a prevailing "narrative code," which is embodied in the works of composers like Wagner, and dominated by notions of tension and resolution, tonal departure and return, and monumental formal structures. In contrast to this tonal idiom, Debussy's late works exhibit other modes of organization which can be more accurately modeled using alternative story-types. The alternative narrative models I invoke come out of two main research areas: studies on the development of story-telling ability in children, and studies of the spatial and temporal relationships exhibited in the early silent cinema. Throughout this study I attempt to contextualize the array of narrative strategies manifested in Debussy's music within the general cultural reorientations of the early twentieth century that we identify as Modernism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alegant, Brian</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p8636.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182m793</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Debussy, Claude, 1862-1918 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music and language</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A44558f79v"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La résistance dans le cinéma français de fiction (1944-1994)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Langlois, Suzanne, 1954-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The subject of this doctoral dissertation is a thematic study of the representation of the Resistance in French fiction films since 1944. This work encompasses the larger fields of history and memory of the Resistance and the Second World War. It is a cinematographic historiography which explores 50 years of film production about the French Resistance. It analyzes the historical choices put forward by film, the censorship which had to be overcome, as well as the sources it used. It also examines how film contributes to the formation of historical consciousness. These developments are compared with the written history of the Resistance. The sources for this work include both visual and written materials: films, preliminary documents, censorship files, and film criticism. Nine interviews provide an additional aspect to this corpus. The parallel drawn between the historiography of the Resistance and the films allowed for a better understanding of the fluctuating relationship between film and historical studies. Also, the examination of this filmography from the perspective of women resisters permitted filmic analysis to move beyond the traditional and politically oriented evaluations of films based on Gaullist or communist memory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hellman, John</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79407z75b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558f79v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- Motion pictures and the war</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motion pictures -- France -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- Underground movements -- France</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801ph832"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evidence implicating the natriuretic peptide system in the antihypertensive effect of moderate ethanol consumption</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guillaume, Pascal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Chronic moderate ethanol (ETOH) consumption prevents the development of the age-dependent increase in blood pressure (BP) in both humans and experimental animals. In the present studies, we proposed that the natriuretic peptide family may be partially responsible for this antihypertensive effect of ETOH. The natriuretic system consists of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), the C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and the natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs). The major function of the natriuretic system is to decrease BP. Thus, the main objective of the present studies was to investigate the interactions of acute and chronic ETOH administration with various components of the natriuretic system. Acute studies. The injection of 1 and 2 g of ETOH/kg B.W. in Sprague-Dawley rats and 0.25 and 0.50 g of ETOH/kg B.W. in humans resulted in a rapid transient increase of circulating ANP levels. In the rats, this increase in plasma ANP levels was associated with a rapid decrease of atrial ANP content and with a delayed increase in ventricular ANP levels. Chronic studies. A 20% v/v solution of alcohol was given to spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats for 8 months. In both SHR and WKY rats, chronic ETOH treatment decreased the BP. This lower BP in ETOH-treated animals was associated with lower circulating ANP and BNP levels, whereas ETOH treatment increased atrial ANP and BNP tissue contents, but not ANP and BNP mRNA. Furthermore, chronic ETOH treatment reduced heart ventricular ANP content and ANP mRNA while it increased ventricular BNP content and BNP mRNA in SHR, but not in WKY rats. Chronic ETOH reduced total natriuretic peptide binding sites (NPR-A and NPR-C) in the renal glomeruli. Quantification of the receptor subtypes demonstrated that this decrease was due to the down-regulation of NPR-C. In the renal papilla, chronic ETOH treatment increased natriuretic peptide binding sites (NPR-A). In addition to its effects on the peripheral natriuretic system, chronic ETOH treatment altered the activity of the natriuretic system at the level of the brain. Thus, chronic ETOH increased ANP and CNP levels in the hypothalamus, pons and medulla of SHR rats. In WKY rats, ETOH had no effect on brain ANP levels, but enhanced the concentration of CNP in the hypothalamus and medulla. Chronic ETOH treatment also decreased the affinity of NPR-C in some of the circumventricular organs of the brain, in the subfornical organ and choroid plexus, but not in the area postrema. These results demonstrate that both acute and chronic moderate ETOH administration alters the activity of various components of the natriuretic system. Therefore, these ETOH-induced modifications in cardiac, renal and brain natriuretic peptides and receptors may contribute to the antihypertensive effect of chronic moderate ETOH drinking.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Giaroulakis, C.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Gutkowska, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107060h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801ph832</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj2363676"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>SiC-reinforced A12O3metal composites by directed metal oxidation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guermazi, Mohamed</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A new process, the DIMOX$ rm sp{TM}$ Process, for making ceramic matrix and metal matrix composites was developed and commercialized by Lanxide Corporation. This technology is based on the use of a unique directed-metal oxidation process to grow ceramic matrices around pre-placed composite fillers or reinforcements. This thesis attempts to offer a good understanding of the mechanism of the process, as well as the effects of the processing parameters on the process, especially in the presence of a reinforcing material. Metal-ceramic matrix composites were grown into four different SiC powders by the directed oxidation of aluminum alloys in air at various temperatures. Microstructure, microstructural evolution, and growth kinetic studies were performed on these composites as a function of alloy compositions, processing temperature, and preform size. The results are then compared to those of composites processed without SiC-reinforcing particles. The microstructure of the resulting composites consists of three phases: the SiC preform, a continuous $ alpha$-$ rm Al sb2O sb3$ matrix, and a network of unoxidized metal. The microstructural evolution for composites without SiC starts with an incubation period of variable length. The incubation time decreases with increase in the processing temperature and with increase in the alloy silicon content. The addition of silicon in the alloy decrease the viscosity of the melt and therefore increases the rate of metal supply to the reaction front. However increasing the magnesium content resulted only in a slight decrease of the length of the incubation period. For composites processed with SiC particles, the growth started immediately after introducing the alloy into the hot zone of the furnace. The incubation time was very short and was not sensitive to changes in either temperatures or alloy composition. The preform does not show any evidence of degradation by the molten alloy, however the growth front tends to climb up the surface of the particles. The composite growth rate increased with decreasing in the preform particle size. The oxidative formation of $ rm Al sb2O sb3$ matrix composites using Al-Mg and Al-Mg-Si alloys exhibits a linear type of kinetics in both the presence and absence of SiC preforms with an activation energy of 224 kJ/mol.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>ew, Robin A.

The test specimens had details typical of bridges designed and built in Montreal in the 1960's. These tests highlighted the design and detailing deficiencies and demonstrated the poor seismic performance of the "as-built" structural elements. Procedures and guidelines for retrofitting were developed for moderate seismic regions and were applied to the test specimens. The reversed cyclic loading responses of these retrofit specimens demonstrated the improved strength, ductility and energy dissipation of the retrofits. Analytical techniques are described which result in accurate response predictions for both the "as-built" and the retrofit elements. A series of compression tests on concrete hinges permitted the development of a model to assess the influence of confinement on the stress-strain characteristics of the hinge region concrete. The response predictions included the effects of confinement of concrete hinges, bond slip, shear distress, presence of lap splices and poor anchorage details. Static analyses were performed according to the 1996 Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) to determine the seismic responses of prototype structures and to determine if retrofit is required. Non-linear dynamic analyses were performed with three input ground motions to predict the responses of the "as-built" structures and to assess the performance of the retrofit structures. These analyses identified the deficient structural systems and demonstrated that the retrofit techniques developed were effective in significantly improving the seismic responses.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, Denis</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w54p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qd68f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55z939r"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Assembly pathways of outer mitochondrial membrane proteins</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Millar, Douglas G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The pathway of membrane insertion and assembly of a signal anchor sequence specific for the outer mitochondrial membrane has been investigated.
