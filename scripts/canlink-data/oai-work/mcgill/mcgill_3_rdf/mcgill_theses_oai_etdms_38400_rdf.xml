A review of the rise of postmodern critique, particularly as expressed through digital technologies, demonstrates how cultural shifts and developing communications technologies work in tandem to influence the emergence of visual systems. By revealing several underlying premises of modernity, it is shown that the linearity of modern design is a biased and limited theory of vision. This argument is reinforced by contrasting the modern conception of direct communication with alternative design practices that encourage readers to play a more active role in the interpretation of a message. However, the thesis ultimately returns to the fundamental principles of modernism to suggest that certain tenets of modernist thought should not be jettisoned so quickly, simply because digitization encourages open-ended viewing experiences.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Straw, Will</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k913f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x326p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Graphic design (Typography)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75df45b"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Robust image segementation towards an action recognition algorithm</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Arseneau, Shawn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To facilitate proper recognition of a human's action from a video sequence, several key features must first be determined. Initially, the person performing the action must be isolated from the background scene. This information is then used to decipher pertinent action attributes that may include the center of mass, contours, and regions of motion. It is these characteristics that will become the feature elements in the recognition of a person's actions. This thesis will investigate the various image processing tools available to obtain the aforementioned action attributes. The applicability of filters, background removal techniques, skin-tone matching, and contouring schemes will all be investigated. A thorough comparison with both existing and novel approaches to action recognition is then discussed. Overall, the temporal based algorithm is best suited for an action recognition application as the spatially based approaches rely too heavily on a priori knowledge of the background scene.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooperstock, Jeremy</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s664t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75df45b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azc77sr882"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Risk-taking behaviour and acculturation among adolescent refugees from Southeast Asia and Central America and their Quebec peers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rotsztein, Brian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Adolescent refugees struggle to find an identity among conflicts between traditional values and beliefs that are taught at home and those of the new, larger society. Engaging in risk-taking behaviours that are not traditionally done in their country of origin is a possible consequence of the refugees' process of acculturation. The type and amount of risk-taking behaviours and level of acculturation among adolescent refugees from Southeast Asia (N = 76), Central America (N = 82), and their Quebec peers (N = 67) in grades 7 and 8, were examined. The Quebec group displayed the highest rates of alcohol and drug use, stealing, and violence. Central Americans had the highest rates of gang membership. Southeast Asians displayed the lowest total amount of risk-taking behaviours. Distinct profiles of the adolescents in each group emerged. Acculturation had no effect on the refugees' risk-taking activities. Family environment was a key determinant of risk-taking activities among Central American and Quebec adolescents. Socioeconomic status had a minor effect on risk-taking behaviours. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rousseau, Cecile</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Cartwright, Glenn</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m865m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sr882</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Risk-taking (Psychology) in adolescence -- Qu√©bec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Refugees -- Psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Acculturation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv935485q"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>1 February - 12 March 1789 : an annotated selection from the journals of Frances Burney (1752-1840)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Saroli, Lisa Ann</ual:dissertant><ual:dissertant>Burney, Fanny, 1752-1840</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>From the age of fifteen until her death, the British female novelist Frances Burney (1752--1840) kept a detailed journal.

Prior to RAAM, cycling economy was measured at 100 and 150 watts. During RAAM, the following measurements were continuously recorded: heart rate, power output, nutritional intake, and body mass. Power output was recorded using a hub dynamometer (4 strain gauges, PowerTap). The subject completed RAAM in 10.1 days and spent 18.6 h/day cycling. Mean cycling values for power output, mechanical energy and heart rate were: 97 watts, 6676 kjoules and 99 b/min. Daily cycling energy expenditure was 7,946 +/- 1435 kcal/day. Energy intake averaged 6,812 +/- 914 kcal/day with 67% CHO, 24% fat, and 9% protein.

Fourteen music specialists completed a checklist in order to determine what Canadian materials are being used in the classroom. Follow-up interviews were conducted with three teachers to further explore the selection of teaching materials. An official from a local school board and a participant in the development of music curriculum documents were also interviewed to ascertain the value placed on Canadian music by local school boards and the Ministry of Education. Findings identified a need for increased Canadian content in all facets of post-secondary teacher training in order to expose secondary music specialists to available Canadian resources.

This book is a free literary recreation of the life of some of the artists and intellectuals, in particular Virginia Woolf, who made up the Bloomsbury Group. This translation is meant to be more source-oriented than target-oriented; however, even though it is rather true to the source text, our priority consists above all in creating a translation possessed of its own literary unicity. In this way, we attempt to show that the translated work is another work, autonomous and separated from the original version, but still linked to the latter by means of their respective literary unicity, rendering the fundamental signifiers of the original in the translation. In recognizing the literary unicity of both authors and in receiving inspiration from the thoughts of Octavio Paz and Antoine Berman, we try to bring the literary unicity of our translation to light, and at the same time, to experience an open-mindedness towards that which is "other".

His works on philosophy and theology have had a profound influence on both Jewish and Christian religious thought. The purpose of this thesis is to examine Buber's biblical scholarship in the context of his philosophical and theological writings in order to assess how his approach to biblical hermeneutics is connected to the rest of his thinking. It is demonstrated that Buber's philosophy of I and Thou has a profound role in his understanding of the Bible and the nature of interpretation itself as a dialogue between reader and text in a way that anticipates certain post-modern notions of literary theory. In particular, Buber's dramatic work, Elijah, a Mystery Play is examined in order to evaluate Buber's hermeneutical method as it is displayed in a specific example of artistic exegesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levy, B.

Inspired by people's social and family situations, these short stories try to render the conflict that structures these situations and gives life to characters. In general, this conflict always takes place between real and imaginary worlds. The second part of this thesis is an analysis of two Stefan Zweig short stories. In my analysis, I try to determine at which moment a character passes from being simply a character on paper to a "living" character. Thereby, I hope to disprove Florence Goyet's theory that a short story character is merely subjugated to a structure.

Two particular perspectives are used here. First, an analysis of the narrator and the narrative structure is made in which the contribution of the narrative strategies present in the text are explored. To do this, the methodological framework of literary carnivalization offered by the Russian critic Mijail Bajtin has been used, foregrounding his basic argument that carnival, as a social practice, is intrinsically subversive since it abolishes all forms of hierarchy and convention present in society during non-carnival time. By extending his theory to those genres of literature in which the elements of carnival are transcribed, Bajtin insists that carnival and carnivalized literature are potentially subversive since they contest conventional structures and frameworks. The narratological models and categories outlined by Gerard Genette and Mieke Bal allow consideration of the variety of pronouns through which the story is narrated and text's representation of the various speech acts. Unlike traditional narratives which are based on the use of a single pronoun, narration in this text is conducted through continual and abruptly shifting changes of pronoun. Such a technique disrupts the stability afforded by a single narrative voice and a narrative function based on ambivalence and plurality becomes evident. Secondly, the carnival theme and its relationship to the Bajtin's theory of the carnivalesque is examined. It is the contention here that "Confabulacion de la arana" may be read as a satire of contemporary Cuban society. Through the process of the continual debasement of the main character, the representative here of authority in Cuba, the story critiques the social and political values in force in Cuba today.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sibbald, K.

The circumstances surrounding the creation of the series provide a foundation and a framework for exploring its meaning and purpose. Though inspired by an earlier Constantine suite of tapestries designed by Rubens, the "Cortona" panels should be read as an independent entity, the significance of which can only be fully appreciated within the context of the gran salone of the Palazzo Barberini, which I propose was their intended destination. This conclusion is supported by the many links between the tapestries and Barberini ideology, papal politics, the palace and the ceiling fresco in the Salone. Like the Divine Providence fresco, the "Cortona" series is a summa of the virtues and religious, political, intellectual and social initiatives of the family. The series emerges finally as a promotionally Italian endeavour, a showcase of Italian art and culture.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glen, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g86w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zd058</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Palazzo Barberini (Rome, Italy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pietro, da Cortona, 1596-1669 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tapestry, Flemish -- Italy -- Rome</dc:subject><dc:subject>Constantine I, Emperor of Rome, d. 337 -- Art</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j302x"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ger</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sprechakte - Sprachspiel - Szenisches Spiel : zur pragmatischen Begr√ºndung des Fremdsprachenunterrichts</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fischaess, Frank</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The following work is based on the proposition that foreign languages are primarily acquired for the purpose of communication in a multicultural context.

This leads me to the examination whether such language games can be realized through applying action-orientated teaching methods to teach foreign languages.

The SLBP is a five-week residential total second language immersion characterized by its intensity. In individual interviews, the informants were encouraged to explore whether and to what extent they had perceived changes in themselves as a result of their participation in the immersion program. These changes were not related to target-language proficiency. Rather, they focused primarily on aspects of the informants' self-perceived or other-perceived identities, which are conceived of as contextual, multiple, fluid and dynamic. Analysis of these observations indicates that changes to identity may indeed be an important byproduct of intensive second language immersion. Elements of such personal growth include perceived increases in participants' senses of resourcefulness, self-confidence, wanderlust, autonomy, open-mindedness, and sociability. Informants also enumerate the SLBP's unique factors which promote changes in self-perception. Changes in participants' perspectives on identity are not viewed simply as incidental immersion outcomes. Rather, they are viewed as components of 'personal competence', both as factors in and results of successful participation in residential total second language immersion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maguire, Mary</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m5914.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d6116</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Self-perception</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Immersion method</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870x76v"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Negotiating health : the meanings and implications of "building a healthy community" in Igloolik, Nunavut</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Allen, Kristiann</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>At the intersection of institutional, local and personal perspectives, this thesis explores what it means to build a Healthy Community in the Canadian Arctic hamlet of Igloolik, Nunavut. It observes that neither the dominant concepts of critical theory nor those of institutional health promotion can sufficiently account for the ways in which Healthy Community discourse and values are adopted and engaged locally. Contextual semantic analysis is used to examine the health promotion values of 'community,' 'participation' and 'empowerment' in the narratives of Inuit interview participants. Along with historical and ethnographic data, these narratives suggest the ways in which health promotion and wellness values are variously adopted, redirected or infused with particular meaning in the context of both personal and political experience. By destabilizing the consensus implied by institutional health promotion discourse and by recognizing the multiplicity of meanings and practices surrounding the Healthy Community, it can continue to inspire innovation in healthcare strategies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Corin, Ellen</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Kirmayer, Laurence</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xn557.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870x76v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Community health services -- Nunavut -- Igloolik</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inuit -- Nunavut -- Igloolik -- Social conditions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m590v"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>D√©partement de langue et litt√©rature fran√ßaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Circulation des discours dans Le Moyen de parvenir de B. de Verville</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Baillargeon, Philippe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this research paper is to study the circulation of discourses in Le Moyen de parvenir. To do so, we will consider two types of circulation in Beroalde de Verville's book. The first type of circulation that we will study is the generic circulation. In the first part of our study, we will try to seize this circulation by identifying all the different genres that appear in Le Moyen de parvenir. Through this analysis, we will see that the book contains a multiplicity of genres which are sometimes in contradiction. Furthermore, we will establish that Beroalde de Verville's work doesn't belong to any defined genre and this is why it is so ambiguous from a generic point of view. The second type of circulation, the circulation of enounciation, will be approached through Bakhtin's theory of dialogism and Gerard Genette's notion of transtextuality. By analysing this mode of circulation, it will be possible to see that this type of circularity corresponds aesthetically and epistemologically to a plurivocal awareness which corroborates the generic ambiguity noticed in the first part of our text.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bk062.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m590v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>B√©roalde de Verville, b. 1556 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p901d"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Affinity to infinity : the endlessness, correalism, and galaxies of Frederick Kiesler</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wilk, Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Frederick Kiesler's Endless House was a response to the principles of functionalism that dominated architectural theory during his lifetime. The house was developed from his philosophy of correalism and his galaxial art. Correalism explains his understanding of the universe as correlating proposing an integration of technology into architecture, and galaxial art is a method for producing art based upon his idea of art as ritual. Kiesler attempted to apply his new awareness to the Endless House design. In many ways, he was successful in uniting theory and design, but the house was never built. While highlighting the work's deficiencies this fact distracts his critics causing them to overlook his actual accomplishments.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pp949.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p901d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kiesler, Frederick</dc:subject><dc:subject>Art, Modern -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture, Modern -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture, Domestic -- Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290c39m"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>North Eros : the Temple of Love at Gennevilliers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Boyle, Catherine Sheryl</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In 1750, the architect Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni built a Temple of Love in Gennevilliers, just north of Paris for the notorious libertine, the Duc de Richelieu. The new social freedom gained by the decline of the ancien regime gave birth to a democratic space that first appeared in the theatre and a personal freedom which changed the currents of thought on love. Servandoni's work as a painter, theatre designer and engineer of spectacles are promoted in the theory of Jacques-Francois Blondel and later Nicolas Le Camus de Mezieres as prime examples of architecture in their theories of sensation. Libertine love, read through the literature of the time, clearly understands the limit of sensation and the "terrible state/loss of freedom" produced by real love. By general consensus an agreement to operate within the realm of sensation governs the ethics of libertine love and architecture. Servandoni's Temple of Love provides an ironic statement on love in the eighteenth century.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000201p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290c39m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Follies (Architecture) -- France</dc:subject><dc:subject>Libertinism -- France -- History -- 18th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hannetaire, Jean-Nicolas d', 1718-1780</dc:subject><dc:subject>Richelieu, Louis Fran√ßois Armand Du Plessis, duc de, 1696-1788 -- Homes and haunts</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mk80f"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Surgical placement of intra-oral implants as a clinical pain model</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Villarroel, Antonio A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A prospective study was carried out on 48 male and female patients aged 33 to 63 years to evaluate which factors have an effect on postoperative pain after placement of two implants in the anterior mandible. The factors considered were: (1) age, (2) sex, (3) duration of surgery, (4) length of implant, (5) expertise of surgeon and (6) body size. Length of implant and expertise of surgeon were found to be significant predictors of pain intensity and unpleasantness (P &lt; 0.05). Implant surgery has qualities that complement the current oral surgery pain model, third molar extraction. For example, the surgical procedures involved in oral implant placement are more controlled and standardized. Furthermore, oral implants are most often used in older populations, whereas third molars are generally extracted in young adults. The results of this study will provide insight into the use of oral implant placement as a clinical acute pain model.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Feine, J.

The Act purports to provide the United Kingdom with a bill of rights by incorporation of the European Convention for Protection of Rights and Freedoms. However, the substantive guarantees offered by the European Convention, and the Human Rights Act, are insufficient to effectively protect the wide variety of circumstances in which individual rights can be violated in a modern democracy. Further, the procedural and remedial framework created by the Human Rights Act cannot adequately enforce human rights protection. Accordingly, the Human Rights Act represents a good starting point in the British bill of rights debate, but an insufficient conclusion. Rather, a novel, uniquely British bill of rights would have been the most appropriate approach.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Toope, Stephen</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r506p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qr497</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wp64t"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Il Sacro bosco d'amore : communication through desire</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Althoff, Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Il Sacro Bosco in Bomarzo is an experience in Lessons on Love.

My assumption is that racism and stress are intertwined. The purpose of this research is to explore the narratives of Black social service workers who are working in mainstream social service agencies. I will explore whether, and how, they experience racism and how their experiences might result in a range of stressors in the workplace. This paper is based on the premise that the amount of stress Black social workers are subjected to is directly related to the social and structural forces within the agencies, in terms of racism, sexism and domination. In particular, I am arguing that it is stressful for Black social workers to work in an agency that perpetuates and condones racism and this may bring about added tension to the working environment. By focusing on everyday forms of racism and its' impact on the mental health of Black social workers, the analysis will also reflect my experiences of personal and institutional racism, the effects of internalized racism and coping strategies aimed at retaining a mental stability and competency on the job. Exploratory interviews were conducted with six social workers, five of whom were front-line workers and one manager, in three social services agencies in Canada, to examine their experiences of racism, their responses and coping strategies which they have adopted to deal with the day-to-day stressors in their jobs. In addition, an examination of current policies, practices and procedures will be interpreted within the organizational structure of the agencies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leonard, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gf872.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zs57n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Burn out (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social workers -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Racism -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b794q"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Burnout and lack of agency structure : a study of the clubhouse model of psychosocial rehabilitation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Barkley, Tammy Lynn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Clubhouse model of psycho-social rehabilitation is a growing movement providing non-traditional mental health services worldwide. Little research has been done on how working in such an un-structured environment affects burnout levels among staff. The study sample was chosen by categorizing the Clubhouses by city size, and selecting 14 American and six Canadian Clubs at random with a total of 149 staff, of whom 97 responded, including both frontline staff and executive directors. Respondents completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and a questionnaire which was designed for this study, to measure work-related, worker-related, and client-related predictors of burnout. Burnout scores for this sample matched the scores for Maslach's postsecondary education subgroup most closely and were lower than the scores for her mental health subgroup. No significant differences were found between the Canadian and American samples, and supervisory role appeared to be a significant predictor of burnout levels among staff. These findings suggest that the International Centre for Clubhouse Development should examine how effectively supervisors support their staff, how the model itself may be inhibiting supervisors from doing so, and that staff needs should be incorporated into Clubhouse standards.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duder, Sydney</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qb74f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b794q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Burn out (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rehabilitation centers -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rehabilitation centers -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78td98x"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Youth delinquency, family intervention treatment and recidivism : a meta-analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Latimer, Jeff, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explored the relationship between youth delinquency, family intervention treatment and recidivism through a meta-analysis of existing literature. Fifty individual effect size estimates were derived from thirty-five experimental research studies examining the impact of involving families in the treatment of young offenders. Initially, family intervention treatment was found to significantly reduce the recidivism of young offenders compared to non-familial responses to youth crime. Methodology, however, was found to be a crucial determinant of the reported effects of treatment; studies using less rigorous methods tended to produce significantly higher rates of success than studies using more rigorous methods. In terms of treatment characteristics, programs treating younger offenders and programs with voluntary participation displayed significantly lower levels of reported recidivism. The results suggested the need to develop more rigorous methods and reporting practices and to target younger offenders with voluntary family-based interventions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duder, Sydney</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408008v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78td98x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Recidivism -- Prevention -- Evaluation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Juvenile delinquency -- Prevention -- Evaluation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Juvenile recidivists</dc:subject><dc:subject>Juvenile delinquents -- Family relationships</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
