For low melting point additives such as aluminum (for steel deoxidation) or magnesium (for hot metal desulphurization), it is found that a solid shell of the melt material will tend to fuse onto the object. Very often, the encasing shell will delay the rapid dispersion of the additive. Two industrial methods which can be used to improve additive dispersion are the wire feeding and bullet shooting techniques. A thermal analysis of these two processes was carried out in the present study. Aluminum wires of 6.4 to 15.9 mm in diameter were fed into steel melts while their 'apparent' weights were monitored with a novel piece of equipment. It was determined that the maximum depth of penetration of an aluminum wire fed into molten steel can be expressed as: (DIAGRAM, TABLE OR GRAPHIC OMITTED...PLEASE SEE DAI) The thermal aspects of the bullet shooting method were also simulated with the above-mentioned apparatus. It was found that the aluminum was only dispersed when the shell in the vicinity of the ends of a bullet had melted back. Since the time required to melt back the shell is inversely proportional to the superheat of the melt, molten aluminum cores encased in solid shells will resurface if the superheat is too low. It was shown that by selectively applying an appropriate thermal resistance onto the surface of a bullet, this problem can be eliminated.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j1637.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jr829</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Steel

business presence in Russia from the late 19th Century to the early Soviet period, focuses on more than twenty individual firms that operated there or otherwise conducted business with Russia. They are presented as primary and secondary case studies in three distinct groups: financial industries, manufacturing industries, and sales, services and light manufacturing industries. The primary cases, American Express, Case and Vacuum Oil Company, offer a detailed insight into: motives for opening installations in Russia, daily operations, the effects of war, revolution and nationalization as well as business relations under the early Soviet government. The secondary case studies include, Citibank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Morgan Guaranty and New York Life Insurance Company in the financial group; Western Electric, Westinghouse Airbrake and General Electric in the manufacturing group; and United Shoe, Otis, Moline Plow, Kodak, Parke, Davis &amp; Co., Chesebrough-Pond's and Continental Gin in the sales, services and light manufacturing group. Collectively these firms present a comprehensive account of the largely neglected and misunderstood role of private American business in Russia. The experiences of these companies help dispel conventional notions of U.S. commercial interests in Russia and place American involvement in proper perspective.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612p26x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s545d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Investments, American -- Russia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Industries -- Russia -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Business enterprises, Foreign -- Russia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Russia -- Foreign economic relations -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>United States -- Foreign economic relations -- Russia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w792p"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>D√©partement de langue et litt√©rature fran√ßaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>L'inscription de la parole dans le r√©cit litt√©raire vers une th√©orie de la repr√©sentation du verbal</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Belli-Bivar, Gillian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To date, semiotics has not concerned itself with a systematic theorization of dialogue structures within narrative prose. Per- ceived as microtextual phenomena, deprived, therefore, of their own particular structure and function on the underlying syntactico-semantic structure of narrative logic, the linguistic activities of characters have generally been considered as more or less perfect copies of real speech, responsible for elements of characterization, pittoresque and narrative detente. In this paper, an attempt is made to reinstate narrative dialogue within the problematic relations to which it gives rise, that is, the relations it maintains with real speech and with other narrative components, so as to discern not only its specific written structure, which leads to numerous mimetic effects, but also its differential structures, distributions and functions within the narrative framework, which corroborate its specificity as a text- ual sign and confirm its semiotic status.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xs34r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w792p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Semiotics and literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Direct discourse in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj96021302"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le (La) metteur(e) en sc√®ne de th√©√¢tre : un(e) gestionnaire</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lapierre, Laurent, 1940-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this research, following Mintzberg (1979 a), the structuring mode of these small enterprises, which are the theatrical production compagnies, has been named rudimentary adhocracy. In postulating the essential importance of the product itself in the management of these enterprises, the subject of this research is the praxis of the theatre director while structuring the project by which the theatrical representation happens. In this research we have identified three types of praxis of directing: the first one is characterized by a search for the effectiveness of dramatic representation, the second one by a search for interiority and the third one by a search for new theatrality and theatralization. The first type, which is related to the &gt; action, is characterized by an objective mode of conception of theatrical imaginary, a proactive mode of elaboration of the product within time and an autocratic mode of control in interpersonal relations. The two other types, which are variants of the &gt; action, are characterized by a subjective mode of conception, a reactive mode of elaboration of the product and an allocratic mode of control. These three types of praxis are manifestations of the personal mode of structuring which we have identified as typical of rudimentary adhocracy. In inverting the title: &gt;, this research leads to the application of the particular case of directing to the general one of management in rudimentary adhocracy. The objects of praxis are seen as being at the same time objects of affection and objects of knowledge, and the praxis of management is reconceptualised in the same way as is praxis of directing, in terms of the affective and cognitive dimensions underlying the manager's vision of the end product, the tight interrelation between that vision and its operationalization, and the influence of the internal and external realities of the manager as much as of the enterprise. This exploratory research has been conducted within an holistic perspective, i.e., considering the praxis of directing as a total fact. Participant observation and guided interview has been used to collect the material upon which the discussion is based.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440t05j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j96021302</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Management</dc:subject><dc:subject>Theater management</dc:subject><dc:subject>Theater -- Production and direction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abr86b412v"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of ammonia on hippocampal formation : an electrophysiological study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Th√©√¥ret, Yves</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effects of ammonia in pathophysiological concentrations were studied on the electrophysiology of putative glutamatergic synapses in the rat hippocampal formation; experiments were done in vitro and in vivo. Exposure of hippocampal slices to 5 mM ammonium chloride reduced the orthodromic population spike evoked in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layer and in granule cell layer, following stimulation of their respective main afferent system. However, antidromic responses evoked in these groups of neurons were not affected by ammonia. In vitro, measures of the spike integral gave a better estimate of the extent of neuronal firing than did measures of the amplitude of the spikes. In vivo, perfusing the ventricular space with higher concentrations of ammonium salts (10 to 30 mM) produced similar effects to those shown in vitro on synaptic and non-synaptic responses in CA1 and CA3 regions. The sensitivity of pyramidal neurons to iontophoretic application of glutamate, aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid was not changed by ammonia. Experiments that used a paired pulse test showed an early effect of ammonia to cause disinhibition; this was attributed to a depression of the excitatory synapses on the inhibitory interneurons. It is concluded that hyperammonemia interferes with the release of glutamate, probably because ammonia inhibits glutaminase activity. The results suggest a deficiency of excitatory transmission as a possible mechanism in the development of the encephalopathy due to ammonia intoxication and the encephalopathies associated with hyperammonemia, e.g. hepatic encephalopathy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tg07b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b412v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zh47k"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The fracture toughness of plain carbon and low alloy steel castings</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Barnhurst, Robert James</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The development of precise data for the effect of chemistry and processing variables on the fracture toughness of low to medium carbon cast steels, is paramount to an increased understanding of the fracture behaviour of these important engineering materials. This knowledge would, in itself, lead to improvements in alloy development/selection rationale and increased cast steel usage, particularly in critical areas. Toward this end, an investigation into the influence of Cr, Mn and Ni additions on the room temperature fracture toughness and flow properties of 0.30, 0.40 and 0.55 wt% C cast alloys was conducted. In order to avoid the chemical and processing complexity normally associated with commercial castings, the study was undertaken on heavy section castings produced in the laboratory from melts composed of commercial purity ingredients. Measurements were conducted on three-point bend test pieces machined from heat-treated castings. The fracture toughness techniques used included LEFM (K(,IC)), J integral and COD ((delta)(,c)). A potential drop method was employed to record crack initiation. Very high room temperature fracture toughnesses were achieved in the majority of the alloys examined, with only three alloys having K(,IC) values of less than 150 MN.m('-3/2) or COD, (delta)(,c), values of less than 0.1 mm. Further, yield stress ((sigma)(,ys)) values were found to lie within 80-105% of those recorded for commercial castings of comparative composition. At the 0.30 and 0.40 wt% C levels it was found that the room temperature fracture toughness of the alloys was relatively independent of the microstructure as well as the amount and particular addition element employed, although variations in the tensile properties were noted. At the 0.55 wt% C level significant differences in the fracture behaviour were caused by the individual element additions. Manganese was found to improve the toughness of the high carbon alloys, while nickel produced little change and chromium had a negative effect on toughness. In each case the influence of these elements was manifested in microstructural differences. The results of this study are reviewed in the light of the limited data available from commercial cast steels and the need for improved toughness performance without undue loss of yield strength and other properties. When both toughness and yield strength are combined, the laboratory steels showed superior performance to commercial plain carbon and low alloy cast steels of comparable composition, with the best combination of properties displayed by the 0.40 wt% C alloys containing 0.30 and 0.90wt% Cr respectively. Interestingly, the 0.50 wt% C-0.90 wt% Mn alloy showed equivalent or superior performance to that of the lower carbon alloys. Several theoretical and empirical models, which attempt to relate the fracture toughness to the flow properties, fracture process and/or microstructure, are critically examined in reference to the present study.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579s87t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zh47k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Steel
