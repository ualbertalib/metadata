Despite her proclamation of non-belligerency in 1939, she remained during the first phase of the world conflict a willing ally of Britain and France. In the second period she became increasingly cautious, and in the third (that of the Axis zenith) she embraced neutrality. From early in 1943 until the declaration of war, she returned to a pro-Allied partiality, although this was much complicated by Russian presence among the Allies. Indeed, throughout the war her main fear was of Soviet imperialism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Callard, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204274h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q525m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islamic Studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m7623"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The results of treatment of haemorrhagic shock on survival, blood volumes and metabolism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Richards, Terence.

J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Present knowledge of the fundamental function of the nephron and its role in urine formation and elimination is still incomplete. The nephron bas been subdivided into a standard pattern of segments on the basis of its morphology, and various functions were ascribed to each of the segments through the results of physiological experiments (Richards, 1929). The modern expanded knowledge in the fields of physiology and biochemistry has made it apparent that the conventional segments are further subdivided into zones which divide the labour of urine formation, reabsorption and excretion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ali, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mr11s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bn081</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zoology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524js54n"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Al-Madrasah Al-Mushtansiriyah in Baghdad: a study of Muslim educational institutions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nashshabah, Hisam.

Its infective larva occurs in a variety of ground fish in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the seals become infected by eating the infected fish. As the incomplete knowledge of this nematode has caused considerable confusion over its nomenclature and relationships, it is proposed to make it the type species of the new genus Phocanema.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cameron, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b241g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698c292</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Parasitology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m763c"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Oxidation of xanthate methyl esters of glucose derivatives</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Muller, Thomas.

Though these industrial processes are well developed, the chemistry involved is still not fully understood, despite the considerable time and effort spent to solve this problem.
