Conversion efficiencies of more than or near 10% were routinely obtained on cells with an active area of up to 8 mm$ sp2$ and without the use of an antireflection coating. The highest conversion efficiency of 11.5% was obtained on a cell with an active area of 4 mm$ sp2$. This cell is comparable in conversion efficiency to the highest value of 12% (1) reported in the literature for monocrystalline CuInSe$ sb2$ cells but has an active area of more than five times larger. The CuInSe$ sb2$ single crystals were grown by a horizontal Bridgman method. Adhesion of the CuInSe$ sb2$ ingot to the inner wall of the quartz ampoule was observed in earlier experiments. This problem was later overcome by the inclusion of a getter, such as a thick layer of carbon or a piece of solid graphite, into the ampoule. Using this method, uniform p-type CuInSe$ sb2$ single crystals of up to 2 cm on a side were obtained. A thin layer of high-resistivity CdS was deposited onto the mechanical-polished CuInSe$ sb2$ substrate as the buffer layer. The CdS layer was deposited by a chemical-bath method and was about 300 to 500 A thick. A low-resistivity ZnO window layer of about 1 $ mu$m thick was then deposited on top of the CdS by r.f. magnetron sputtering. An annealing of the CuInSe$ sb2$ substrate before the CdS deposition was found to be essential in obtaining high photovoltaic performance. The optimal annealing condition was 350$ sp circ$C in argon for 2 hours. The annealing was able to reduce the large density of defect states on the mechanical-polished CuInSe$ sb2$ surface and led to a substantial decrease of the dark junction current. Both the open-circuit voltage and fill factor were significantly improved by the substrate annealing. Temperature-dependent I-V measurements showed that the current transport of the ZnO/CdS/CuInSe$ sb2$ cells was governed by a tunneling/recombination mechanism. Capacitance-voltage measurements showed the presence of interface states and deep levels. The buried homojunction observed in some CdS/CuIn/Se$ sb2$ cells (2) was not detected by electron-beam-induced-current (EBIC) measurements in the ZnO/CdS/CuInSe$ sb2$ cells. The diffusion lengths of the CuInSe$ sb2$ substrates were also determined by EBIC and were estimated to be about 4 to 6 $ mu$m. A deep level at about 0.23 eV from the valence band edge was identified in most of the CuInSe$ sb2$ crystals by deep-level transient spectroscopy. The density of this deep level was about 10$ sp{13}$ to 10$ sp{14}$ cm$ sp{-3}$. A shallower deep level was also observed in some of the samples. ftn(1) J. L. Shay, S. Wagner and H. M. Kasper, Appl.

GVHD was induced in unirradiated F1 hybrid mice by an intravenous injection of parental lymphoid cells. Our results demonstrated that the secretion of glucocorticoids during GVHD was independent of pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). However, adrenal hyperactivity was associated with increased expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA in the adrenal glands of GVHD mice. Expression of adrenal POMC transcripts was not due to mononuclear infiltrates. The transcripts for interleukin-12, a cytokine produced by activated macrophages, were also upregulated in GVHD adrenals. Since macrophages have been shown to reside in the adrenal glands and produce ACTH, it appeared that resident adrenal macrophages were activated during GVHD to produce local ACTH that stimulated the secretion of glucocorticoids, independent of pituitary ACTH. We next investigated the role of endogenous glucocorticoids on the outcome of GVHD by adrenalectomizing the F1 recipient mice before GVHD induction in order to deplete the source of glucocorticoids. Our results showed that adrenalectomized (ADX), but not non-ADX, F1 recipients injected with parental lymphoid cells recovered rapidly from symptoms characteristic of GVHD, after a two week manifestation of the disease. Recovery from GVHD was attributed to the induction of a glucocorticoid sensitive, asialoGM1$ sp+$ and/or CD8$ sp+$, but not NK1.1$ sp+$, F1-anti-parental effector cell that rejected or eliminated the parental graft, after an initial period of engraftment. In addition, the effector was not dependent on a mature thymus and was not renewed after anti-asialoGM1 treatment, but was renewed after glucocorticoid treatment. We further demonstrated that high levels of glucocorticoids during GVHD caused severe deficiency of host T cell populations in the lymph nodes and contributed to the suppression of lymph nodes T cells. Taken together these studies suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids play a central role in the pathogenesis of GVHD.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lapp, Wayne S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935458t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k676p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612q221"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Biological control of Echinochloa species with pathogenic fungi</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Wenming</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Six pathogenic fungal species were isolated from naturally-infected Echinochloa species and evaluated as biological control agents for E. crus-galli, E. colona, and E. glabrescens in rice. Bipolaris sacchari, Curvularia geniculata, and Exserohilum monoceras were non-pathogenic to rice and caused high mortality of Echinochloa species. E. monoceras was selected for further study. Under regulated greenhouse conditions, an inoculum dose of 2.5 $ times$ 10$ sp7$ conidia/m$ sp2$ killed E. crus-galli and E. glabrescens seedlings while 5.0 $ times$ 10$ sp7$ conidia/m$ sp2$ caused 100% mortality of E. colona seedlings. The 1.5-leaf stage was the most susceptible growth stage for all three Echinochloa species. E. glabrescens was most susceptible to E. monoceras infection, E. crus-galli had an intermediate susceptibility, and E. colona was least susceptible. The optimum temperature for 100% mortality was between 20 and 30 C for all Echinochloa species, whereas the minimum dew period for 100% mortality was 16 h for E. colona, 12 h for E. crus-galli, and 8 h for E. glabrescens. Under screenhouse conditions and in the absence of an artificial dew period, over 90% of Echinochloa seedlings were killed when inoculum was sprayed in an oil emulsion or when applied as a dry powder to the water surface of a simulated paddy field. Maximum conidia production occurred on V-8 juice agar or centrifuged V-8 juice agar, at 28 C in the dark. No conidia were produced in liquid media. Of various agricultural products tested as solid substrates, the highest sporulation (1.81 $ times$ 10$ sp6$ conidia/g dry weight) occurred on corn leaves. Host range tests on 54 plant species in 43 genera and 19 families showed that Rottboellia cochinchinensis, was also highly susceptible to this fungus.

This type of fill with closely controlled specifications is employed for subsequent pillar recovery and improved ground support. The goal of this study is to improve consolidated rockfill design for bulk mining methods, with Kidd Creek Mines, KCM, as a case study, from a functional and cost point of views. Cemented rockfill at KCM represents approximately 20% of the total extraction costs. Cost cutting initiatives however have to be mindful of the negative if not disastrous effects on grade, recovery, and ground stability that a decline in fill quality can produce. This dictates that any attempt to cut operational costs should be approached in a scientific and orderly fashion. This thesis describes consolidated rockfill improvement steps taken at Kidd Creek to obtain the highest quality fill at the lowest possible cost. The main trust and achievements in this thesis include: (1) Extensive site investigation and mapping in drift driven through backfill have resulted establishment of four distinct zones in a typical rockfill mass. Structural rockfill design steps using the information obtained from field mapping are then established and implemented at KCM with great success which will be described during this thesis. (2) The main body of this thesis contains significant amounts of laboratory test work, 1750 test specimen, on lower cost binder alternatives. Some of the results obtained from the test work have been implemented at Kidd Creek since late 1992 and have resulted in considerable savings and improved dilution control. (3) Quality control measures and techniques in three main stages, surface plant, during transportation, and most importantly during placement are also established. (4) CRF structural design optimization steps are identified through extensive site observation and consultation with other operations. This covers all the steps that should be taken from start to finish to achieve the highest quality rockfill at the lowest possible cost. (5) Extensive field experiments are also carried out to obtain in situ mechanical and dynamical properties of a typical rockfill mass. This work is based upon field and laboratory studies undertaken within the KCM over a 5 year period. The work has resulted in establishing quality control measures, mix design improvement, and structural design implementation at KCM to achieve the required physical characteristics at the lower operational cost. The in situ and laboratory test resulted in 35% unit cost reduction for KCM rockfill system within last 3 years and a saving of around $4 million on binder cost alone at a rate of $1.3 million/year. The total unit cost has dropped from $12/tonne in 1991 to around $7/tonne in 1995.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hassani, F.

Shannon rate-distortion-function (RDF) provides the unbeatable lower bound for a source coder's performance with an arbitrary complexity. In theory, for most cases of interest, the RDF is only achievable in the limit of infinite delay. Practical communication systems impose constraints on the maximum coding delay and complexity. Hence the objective of source coding is to achieve performance closest to the RDF bound for a given delay and complexity. The fact that real-world input sources are usually nonstationary and have memory may make the achievement of the above objective more difficult. Vector quantization (VQ) is known to provide performance close to the RDF, given sufficient delay and complexity. Such high VQ performance can become available through the entropy constraint VQ (EC-VQ) strategy. To overcome the problem of impractical delay and complexity of EC-VQ, we propose a new EC design techniques which combines the merits of EC design with the benefits of recursive and adaptive VQ. For historical reasons, we will refer to this new scheme as EC code-excited linear predictive (EC-CELP) quantization and will demonstrate that it has an excellent potential in accomplishing the aforementioned source coding objective. In comparison with other schemes, it achieves the closest performance to the rate-distortion bound for a given VQ dimension (delay) and with a relatively low complexity. To quantify the EC-CELP's superior performance we provide new analysis for various EC quantizers which also includes the effects of quantization noise at low bitrates. New formulations for the maximum available entropy-coded quantization gains are developed which incorporate rate-distortion theoretic limitations at low bitrates. In the video coding portion of this thesis we propose a recursive and multi-frame video coding system using EC-CELP quantization in the temporal domain. This new video coding configuration is designed to overcome the performance limitations of the commonly used differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) temporal video coding. Its recursive nature sets this new technique apart among other recent non-recursive multi-frame techniques which can not provide similar high temporal video compression with minimal delay (few frames). A suitable motion estimation and coding configuration is also suggested. Within the scope of this thesis, some of the problems and issues pertinent to the proposed coding system are addressed. Significant bitrates reduction can be obtained by using the proposed temporal quantizer over the conventional scheme.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dubois, Eric</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731555w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jw250</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2227mr49g"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cognitive multi-tasking in situated medical reasoning</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Farand, Lambert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study evaluates the hypothesis that medical reasoning in real clinical situations involves multiple cognitive tasks whose complex interactions are coordinated in an opportunistic manner. A problem-solving architecture originating from research in artificial intelligence, the blackboard model, is proposed as an integrative framework for representing these characteristics of situated medical reasoning and for reconciling different theoretical perspectives about medical reasoning. A naturalistic clinical situation, involving the manipulation of the patient record by an internist while managing a case, provides the empirical data for this in depth qualitative case study. The video recording of the subject's record manipulation behavior allows the cueing of retrospective think-aloud verbalizations and the preservation of the real-time aspects of problem solving. The association of theory-driven task analysis using the blackboard model with data-driven propositional analysis confirm that medical reasoning in this situation indeed comprises a variety of cognitive tasks, which are described. Also, the opportunistic character of control knowledge and the complex interactions between control strategies and cognitive tasks are confirmed and described. The blackboard model allows the principled representation of these characteristics of situated medical reasoning, thus supporting its integrative character. However, certain aspects of the data, mostly related to the ambivalence of several concepts that are used by the subject during the course of problem-solving, are not explained in the most parsimonious manner by the blackboard model, nor by symbolic cognitive architectures in general. A connectionist alternative is proposed which seems to better account for these phenomena. Finally, a tentative neurophysiological interpretation of the blackboard framework is offered for integrating the symbolic and connectionist perspectives.

Literature on oil spill evaporation shows that most workers use boundary-layer equations adapted from water evaporation work. These equations predict a constant evaporation mass-transfer rate, dependent on scale size and wind speed. Evaporation was studied further by measuring evaporation of commercial oil products. An experimental apparatus for the study of evaporation was developed. Evaporation was determined by weight loss measured on a balance and recorded constantly on a computer. Examination of the data shows that most oil and petroleum products evaporate at a logarithmic rate with respect to time. This is attributed to the overall logarithmic appearance of many components evaporating at different linear rates. Petroleum products with fewer chemical components such as diesel fuel, evaporate at a rate which is square root with respect to time. The particular behaviour is shown to be a result of the number of components evaporating. Oils with greater than seven to ten components can be predicted with logarithmic equations, those with three to seven components, with square root equations. Evaporation of oils and petroleum products is not strictly boundary-layer regulated. This is largely a result of the high saturation concentrations of oil components in air, which is associated with a high boundary-layer regulated rate. Typical oil evaporation rates do not exceed that of molecular-diffusion, and thus turbulent diffusion does not increase the evaporation rates. Some volatile oils and petroleum products show some effect of boundary-layer regulation at the start of the evaporation process, but after several minutes, evaporation slows because of the loss of the more volatile components, at which point evaporation ceases to be boundary-layer regulated. Overall, boundary-layer regulation can be ignored in the prediction of oil and petroleum evaporation.

Na$ sp+$/H$ sp+$ exchangers are plasma membrane transporters catalyzing the electroneutral exchange of 1 H$ sp+$ for 1 Na$ sp+.$ Several mammalian isoforms of NHE have been so far identified with each mediating a variety of specific functions. Parathyroid hormone, playing an essential role in the physiology of blood Ca$ sp{2+}$ and phosphate homeostasis, inhibits renal proximal tubular bicarbonate reabsorption by inhibiting the apically located Na$ sp+$/H$ sp+$ exchanger. However, which specific isoform of NHE mediated this effect and the specific signaling components involved were unknown. In our studies we determined that Na$ sp+$/H$ sp+$ exchanger NHE-3 isoform is expressed in the renal proximal tubule OK cells and that N-terminal PTH and PTHRP analogues upon binding to their receptor stimulate both the PKA and the PKC pathways, each of which can independently lead to inhibition of this exchanger activity. NHEs also play an important role in the regulation of intracellular pH which is subject to fluctuation occurring during the process of hormone stimulated bone formation and bone remodeling. Again the specific NHE isoform(s) mediating this effect and the signaling pathways involved were unidentified. It is determined by our studies that NHE type 1 is expressed in osteoblastic cell line, UMR-106 cells, and that PTH and PTHRP stimulate this exchanger via a cAMP-dependent pathway exclusively. It was believed that motivation of NHE-1 in the UMR-106 cells and inhibition of NHE-3 in the OK cells by N-terminal analogues of PTH and PTHRP involves binding of these analogues to a common G protein-coupled receptor called the "classical" PTH/PTHRP receptor.

Artifacts and limitations inherent to these techniques in the study of microfibrils, pulp fibres and paper are discussed. AFM images of the surface of the highly crystalline cellulose microfibrils, Ventricaria and M.d., were obtained at molecular resolution under ambient conditions; the molecular images showed periodicities along the microfibril axis that correspond to those of the fibre and glucose unit repeat distances of cellulose, respectively. Images of the section surface of Black Spruce (Picea mariana) wood clearly show features of the underlying cell wall structure. The apparent lamellation, with periodicities from tens or nanometers down to 15 nm, were observed in radial sections of the middle secondary wall (S2). However, transverse sections of the same S2 layer did not show a lamellation independent of the knife direction. AFM images of unbeaten and beaten unbleached kraft pulp fibre surfaces indicate the orientation of the component microfibrils; fibrillar material attached to the surface of the beaten fibres was readily observed. Images from the scale of the fibre web down to the microfibril level in air and water show the dimensional changes of the paper surface and fibres. However, little or no change was seen at the microfibril level. The dimensions of the lamella in wood sections and the size of the microfibrils at both the surface of pulp fibres and the fibrillated material indicate that microfibrils as small as 1.5 nm across are present.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gray, D.

Phenomenologists (e.g. Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Dreyfus) argue that the scope of cognitivism is not as vast as its proponents suppose. They claim that perceptual-motor skills are non-representational and thus fall beyond the purview of cognitivism. I argue that this debate can be resolved in favour of the phenomenologists by citing the neuroscientific evidence for the claim that there are two distinct neural memory systems: (1) a hippocampal system which operates over neurally realized Fodorian representations and subserves rational thought and action and (2) a non-representational striatal system which subserves perceptual-motor skills.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taylor, Charles</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Davies, David</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kp70z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hd78f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Memory</dc:subject><dc:subject>Representation (Philosophy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cognitive psychology -- Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A707959351"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Morphology, physical and tensile properties of quench-cooled isotactic polypropylene films and spunbonded fabrics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Caldas, Victor</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The room temperature morphology of quench-cooled isotactic polypropylene (iPP) films and its development were investigated by scanning transmittance electron microscopy (STEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). STEM dark field images revealed that within an amorphous matrix there exist microcrystalline regions, 160 A in size on the average, having the $ alpha$-monoclinic crystal form. Regions of lower crystalline order were also observed which have an $ alpha$-monoclinic crystal form that has a substantially longer b crystallographic axis. DSC studies indicate that during quench-cooling to the glassy state iPP samples attain a low degree of crystalline order to an extent that depends on sample mass. Upon heating from the glassy state, an exothermic transition is observed following the glass transition temperature which corresponds to the formation of the room temperature morphology. Cross polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to monitor morphological changes in the purely crystalline phase of quench-cooled iPP films and spunbonded fabrics during annealing. The spectra were obtained using a pulse sequence that incorporates a delay period with a reduced spin locking field prior to cross polarization. Morphological changes occurring within the purely crystalline phase of iPP were related to observations made by DSC. Upon annealing, the CP/MAS NMR spectrum of the purely crystalline phase of both iPP samples changed by a redistribution in the intensity of the various peaks within a given carbon resonance. This redistribution of intensity was found to reflect the conversion from the $ alpha sb1$ to the $ alpha sb2$ monoclinic crystal forms. It is shown that the double melting endotherm observed by DSC for the spunbonded fabrics is due to the exothermicity which is associated with this conversion. It is concentrated in the temperature region between 156 and 163$ sp circ$C. The tensile properties of the spunbonded iPP fabrics and fibers were enhanced by the dispersion of a silica/silicone additive and by changing the resin characteristics. This additive acts as a nucleating agent for iPP under isothermal crystallization conditions. This nucleating ability manifests itself in smaller crystal sizes and higher nucleation densities in the iPP fibers and bond points. The improved tensile properties are attributed to the smaller crystal sizes which form a more homogeneously dispersed crystalline phase in the amorphous phase as well as to increase the number of load-bearing tie molecules.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brown, G.

Statistics were obtained using a new unfolding scheme based on the existence of a local stationary property for fluctuations of the energy spectra. Two different models were used in the study with particular emphasis on the relevance to the physics of nanoscale devices. Thus, a quantum billiard model composed of a quasi-two-dimensional tight-binding atomic lattice was introduced. The results of the statistical analysis of the spectra of the models were compared throughout the thesis with Random Matrix Theory (RMT). The applicability of RMT and the universality predicted by RMT were verified. The statistical behavior of energy levels for systems in the crossover region between regular and chaotic behavior was studied in all three regimes. Gradual transitions were observed for both ballistic and mesoscopic systems, and found to be similar in the cases. For systems in the insulating regime, the statistical behavior of levels was found to be of Poisson type. The transition from GOE to Poisson behavior when the system is changed from the mesoscopic to the insulating regime was also studied, a spectral dependence of the local fluctuations of energy levels was found, indicating the break-down of translation invariance of the local fluctuations. The transition due to time reversal invariant symmetry breaking was studied by applying a uniform magnetic field to systems constructed by using a tight-binding model with non-zero off-diagonal interactions. By rescaling the transition control parameter, it was found that for both ballistic and mesoscopic systems the transition behavior can be well described by RMT. For closed systems the transition is complete when the effective area of the system encloses a flux greater than one flux quantum.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Harris, Richard</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qk343.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zs38f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25xb073"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Y-branch optical wavelength multidemultiplexers by ion-exchange in glass</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Xiang, Feng</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A simple and accurate multisheet Brewster angle measurement technique has been developed to measure substrate indices.

An explicit and stable finite-difference vector beam propagation method has also been developed for efficient numerical simulations of the guided-wave optical devices. A modified Y-branch wavelength multi/demultiplexer (abbreviated as WDM) for $ lambda=1.31$ and 1.55 $ mu m$ was designed and optimized by the beam propagation method (abbreviated as BPM).

The measured results of over 20db extinction ratio agree well with the BPM design simulations. A new Y-branch WDM made by K$ sp+$ and Ag$ sp+$ ion-exchanges was proposed and fabricated. It eliminates a difficult fabrication process, involving an Al$ rm sb2O sb3$ strip waveguide, and still provides the other merits of the first device.

I begin with a presentation of past attempts to grapple with the links that exist between tourism and the development process. It is shown that the theoretical approaches which dominated the tourism literature in the late 1970s and 1980s are unable to cope with the rapid changes occurring in the industry. In particular, these theories struggle to acknowledge and explain the growth of alternative forms of tourism. I then turn to new theoretical approaches epitomized by the work of Aulianna Poon. I argue that these new political economy approaches offer the best (though still far from perfect) way to understand the rise of alternative tourism and the complex interaction of global and local forces that characterize most forms of tourism development. In its empirical analysis of Grenada's tourism industry, the thesis focuses on market demand, economic impacts and environmental issues. The results reveal that visitors to Grenada can be divided into three separate and distinct market segments: (i) rest and relaxation; (ii) active-water based; and (iii) new-age, soft-adventure types. While the vast majority of visitors come to Grenada for an active water-oriented vacation, the fastest growing segment is the soft-adventurers. The economic impact study shows that only about 29 cents in every dollar spent by the "average" tourists became direct local income in 1992. However, it is clear that tourist using medium-sized or small hotel accommodation consistently generate higher direct levels of income than those using other accommodation types. This thesis introduces a mixture of innovative and more traditional techniques to analyze the sustainability of different forms of tourism development. The integrated approach also incorporates a Discrete Choice Experiment (market analysis) and then uses Arc/Info GIS to study water demand and pollution issues associated with different forms of tourism development in the Grand Anse beach area. Consistent with the results of the market segmentation analysis, the results of the discrete choice experiment further highlight the importance of the beach-front accommodation located within a semi-isolated setting. The results of the water impact assessment suggest that tourists demand twice as much domestic water per person/day as the local residents. In conclusion, I discuss the applicability of my theoretical approach and examine the implications of the findings for Grenada's tourism development. It is clear that most tourism theory cannot adequately explain the shifts toward 'non-traditional' forms of tourism development. Since the empirical results indicate that this type of tourism development is best suited to Grenada's needs, it is important to seek alternative theoretical explanations. The empirical analysis reveals that traditional mass tourism development is likely to be the most environmentally damaging and economically disadvantageous tourism option to pursue on the island. The results show that low density, high quality accommodation is both in demand by tourists and is also associated with greater economic linkages and potentially less environmental damage. I conclude with a series of recommendations regarding the island's future tourism development efforts.

The process of multisegmental skill acquisition was studied using performance production measures as a window to explore stable and transient changes in the movement control process. Bernstein's principles of exploitation of motion dependent torques, and the minimization of the degree of freedom were tested. Twenty male subjects performed a total of 240 trials, as fast and accurate as possible, over 4 sessions for two tasks with different level of complexity (10 subjects per task). Kinematic and EMG data were acquired for a two segment model of the arm using a lightweight, adjustable manipulandum, and surface EMG for the PDL, PEC, TRI, and BIC muscles. Movement organization characteristics were revealed by wave pattern analyses performed with a phase breakdown technique, CCCF on torque partitioning components, and the CFs on the muscle activation waveforms. The experimental protocol allowed enough practice for the tasks to be learned resulting in PT decrease. Consistent adaptations in movement organization were revealed by all three levels of analysis. Improvement in the performance production measures were in the same direction for both learning conditions, and the rate of change within experimental sessions decreased over time. The significant adaptations in movement organization occurred at the critical phases of each task (i.e. the power absorption--phase simple task, and the reversal phase--complex task). The EMG and joint torque components demonstrated significant amplitude and profile changes particularly during the critical phases. The subjects learned to perform the tasks faster by compensating the motion dependent torques components with the muscle torques in time and amplitude. This finding was consistent with the principle of exploitation of motion dependent torques which was enhanced with learning. Significant task specific motor program adaptations were revealed by the SVD analysis. The minimization of the degree of freedom hypothesis is consistent with the increasing covariation observed over learning between the antagonists PEC and BIC in the simple task, and for both the agonists PDL and TRI and antagonists PEC and BIC in the complex task. In addition the results justified the use of waveform analysis on performance production measures, as a method that can reveal important adaptation details in the underlying control mechanisms for gross motor skill.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hoshizaki, Blaine</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n954v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128c50r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Motor learning</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electromyography</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human mechanics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arm -- Movements</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apv63g185c"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Relationships between environmental risk factors, parasitic infections and health outcomes in an urban African setting</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tshikuka Mulumba, Jose-Gaby</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The relationships between parasitic infections, environmental and living conditions, and health outcomes were studied in subdivisions of lower (LSES) and higher (HSES) socio-economic status Lubumbashi, Zaire. The two LSES subdivisions had higher prevalences of Plasmodium infection and higher rates of stunting, abdominal pain and low packed cell volume (PCV) than the HSES subdivision. The prevalence and intensity of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura was not associated with socio-economic status. Maternal education was a significant predictor of A. lumbricoides intensity in both LSES and HSES subdivisions. Factors related to poor sanitation were risk factors for A. lumbricoides in LSES subdivisions, whereas a high ratio of relatives to immediate family members per household predicted high intensity infection in the HSES subdivision. The risk of stunting was higher in children with A. lumbricoides, that of wasting was higher in children with A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura whereas the risk of kwashiorkor was high with T. trichiura but very reduced in those with A. lumbricoides. The four most common clinical conditions were diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and low PCV. Hookworm infection, T. trichiura infection, young age and residence in LSES subdivisions were determinants of diarrhea. T. trichiura infection, young age and living in a LSES subdivision were risk factors for abdominal pain. Plasmodium infection and young age were associated with fever. LSES was predictive of low PCV. No combination of parasites had antagonistic or synergistic effects on clinical indicators examined. Based on this study, it is suggested that one parasite will increase the risk of infection with another. Although maternal education should be improved in all subdivisions, attention to sanitation, crowding and diet in the LSES subdivisions, and to the role of relatives and visitors in parasite transmission in the HSES subdivision should be priorities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scott, M.

Many more patients have been described since Mesulam's description was published: 171 published contacts with 112 patients diagnosed with the syndrome are reviewed in this thesis. However, the published literature is both unsystematic and incomplete, making it difficult to place the findings into a coherent theoretical framework. In addition, no previous work has specifically attempted to specify the difference between PPA and dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), although the two disorders are easily confused since many language deficits can masquerade as memory or cognitive deficits. This thesis is an attempt to remedy these short-comings. Using a serial case study approach, the linguistic deficits of 11 PPA patients are analyzed in a cognitive neuropsychological framework, and contrasted with the linguistic deficits of a group of 11 DAT patients. Several tools were developed or refined specifically to manage the details of such an analysis. These include a production system designed to infer functional dissociations in the language system from an analysis of patient performance on a computerized version of the Psycholinguistic Assessment Battery (Caplan &amp; Bub, 1990). Although the results suggest that there is great heterogeneity of symptoms within the PPA population, several deficits which may prove useful in making the differential diagnosis are examined closely, including deficits in reading, abstract word comprehension, auditory comprehension, affixed word processing, and semantic access. Implications of the findings for current models of language processing are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bub, Daniel</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wf369.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515p90q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aphasia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405sb880"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nonlinear finite element analysis of normal and high strength concrete structures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shayanfar, Mohsen Ali</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a new hypoelasticity model which was implemented in nonlinear finite formulation to analyze normal and high strength reinforced concrete structures under both monotonically increasing and reversed cyclic loadings. The model includes a new hypoelasticity constitutive relationship utilizing the rotations of material axis through subsequent iterations, employment of both fixed and rotating crack models, compressive strength degradation in post-cracking regime, new uniaxial stress-strain relationships for concrete under monotonically increasing and reversed cyclic loadings, accounting for mesh sensitivity, and utilizing the tensile strength degradation due to extensive internal microcracking of the concrete. The model can account for high nonlinearity of the stress-strain behaviour of concrete in the pre-peak regime, the softening behaviour of concrete in the post-peak regime, the stiffness degradation caused by the extension of microcracks during subsequent unloadings and reloadings and the irrecoverable volume dilatation at high levels of compressive load. The effect of element size on different behavioural aspects of reinforced concrete elements including the load-displacement and load-strain characteristics, crack pattern and ultimate load are discussed along with a comparison with the experimental data where available. Various analyses indicated that the length of the descending branch of the tensile stress-strain curve of concrete defined by the value of the ultimate tensile strain, $ varepsilon sb{ rm tu}$, has a significant effect on the computed results. If the value of $ varepsilon sb{ rm tu}$ is adjusted appropriately according to the element size, it can help eliminate the mesh sensitivity drawback. To adjust an appropriate value for $ varepsilon sb{ rm tu}$, two models have been used: (a) crack band model, as a function of the fracture energy, mesh size and tensile strength of concrete, and (b) a new proposed model as a function of only the element size. The analytical results obtained using the different models are compared with the experimental results; the proposed model gives good agreement. The proposed formula is very simple and can be used for both square and non-square elements. The effect of steel reinforcement details on the general behaviour of the structure and its mode of failure, the criterion for using the rotating crack model versus the fixed crack model, and the importance of compressive strength degradation in the post-crack regime are established using detailed analysis of five shear panels tested by Vecchio and Collins (1982). The effect of a sudden drop of the stress after the tensile strength of concrete has been exceeded on the load-deflection response, the ductility ratio and the crack pattern for two high strength concrete beams are also examined. Further analyses of a squat shear wall and a shear panel are carried out to examine the reliability of the computer program HODA developed in this study for analysis of concrete structures under both monotonic and reversed cyclic loads. Complete response of three structural walls in a low-rise building is studied under monotonically increasing loads until failure using the nonlinear finite elements program HODA. The influence of the tension-stiffening, steel strain-hardening on the load-deflection response and the ultimate load are studied for the case of the rectangular wall.

A 1-dimensional particle cycle model with two particle size classes has been developed and coupled to the physical model as well. The ocean model (Zhang et al., 1992) is based on the planetary geostrophic equations in spherical coordinates. The model equations include the full prognostic temperature and salinity equations. The momentum equations are diagnostic and include geostrophic balance, and a linear friction term in order to provide a western boundary current. The wind stress is applied at the top level of the model. The temperature and salinity distributions used in the surface boundary restoring condition are taken from climatological data. The model domain consists of a flat-bottomed box of 60$ sp circ$ longitude extending between 5$ sp circ$N and 65$ sp circ$N. The horizontal resolution is 2.3$ sp circ$ in both latitude and longitude with 14 levels in the vertical. The physical model is first coupled to a biological model where new production is given by a restoring condition of surface nitrate towards its observed concentration. The coupled model is used to examine Martin et al.'s (1987) hypothesis that lateral transport and decomposition of slow or non-sinking organic matter can cause a non-local balance between the remineralization rate and the overlying new production rate in open ocean regions. The role of the Gulf Stream in nutrient transport is examined. The model results agree well with the North Atlantic nutrient transport calculated from observed nutrients and hydrographic data. The model results suggest that the thermohaline overturning circulation and the Gulf Stream horizontal recirculation play an important role in the North Atlantic nutrient distribution. The physical model is then tested in the seasonal mode, and coupled with a biological model which is based on nitrate limiting the rate of new production. The model simulated seasonal oxygen cycle agrees well with the results of observational studies and 1-dimensional model simulations. The oxygen utilization rate below the euphotic zone provides a useful estimate of new production. A 1-dimensional time dependent particle cycling model with two particle size classes based on Clegg and Whitfield (1990) is then developed. The simulated total organic carbon concentration and large particle flux are consistent with observations and other 1-dimensional model simulations. The downward transport of organic carbon is mainly accomplished by the fast sinking large particles, which comprise a small fraction of the total particulate mass. The steady state version of the particle model is also coupled with the 3-dimensional physical model. The magnitudes of simulated organic carbon flux and total organic matter concentration are comparable with observations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lin, C.

A critical approach to these writers that ignores the epistemic dimension in their works opens itself to the charge of misunderstanding their artistic goals and aspirations. In my dissertation I thus define, justify, and conduct an interdisciplinary study of Poe and Lem's works. My project is underwritten by the epistemological assumption that literary works, and notably works of fiction, can make a contribution to knowledge that can be assessed in terms of interdisciplinary criteria. In the first chapter, where I discuss literature and knowledge within the interdisciplinary context, I examine various epistemological arguments in light of my central assertion. Next I examine the concepts involved in the discussion of literary works. Following the pragmatic re-orientation in literary and philosophical aesthetics, many fundamental concepts we take for granted--artworks, fictions, and texts among them--require exact re-examination and definition. Consequently, in Chapters Two and Three I review and refine the recent theories concerning the nature of works of art, the specificity of literary fictions, and the problem of literary interpretations. My subsequent discussion of Poe and Lem is built on the theoretical base of (literary) epistemology and analytical aesthetics. I study Poe and Lem's literary fictions and theoretical essays, and the contributions they make to various fields of inquiry. In the process I critique, and sometimes refine, the explicit and implicit hypotheses articulated in their works. Specifically In Chapters Four and Five I discuss strategic and game theoretic models in the interpretation of fiction, including the concepts of communication and rationality. In Chapter Six, completing the epistemological circle inaugurated in Chapter One, I discuss the epistemological and cosmological theories proposed in Poe's "Eureka".</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Livingston, Paisley</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k74m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wk882</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Interdisciplinary approach to knowledge</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lem, Stanisław</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poe, Edgar Allan, 1809-1849</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881n554"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of pressure on the wall slip of linear polyethylene</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sentmanat, Martin Lamar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Experiments were performed on a slit die rheometer to determine the effect of pressure on the wall slip of linear polyethylene. A novel shear stress transducer was developed to measure local wall shear stress at several locations along the die. It was found that above the critical shear stress for the onset of slip, the shear stress distribution along the die was nonuniform. Furthermore, it was discovered that the local wall shear stress near the exit of the die was greater than the nominal, or length-averaged, shear stress within the die as calculated from the pressure drop. Teflon$ sp circler$ wall coatings were used to promote slip by lowering the critical shear stress for the onset of slip. Relative local slip velocities were calculated and found to be a function of pressure and wall shear stress. A new semi-empirical model for the pressure dependence of slip was developed based on the effect of pressure on the work of adhesion and the work needed for flow. The new model indicates that pressure can both suppress and promote slip depending on the level of stress involved. At low pressures, and for a given shear stress, slip is markedly suppressed due to the increase in the work of adhesion. As pressure increases, however, the work needed for flow overcomes the work of adhesion, and slip dramatically increases. However, at higher pressure, the effect of pressure on slip becomes weaker. Numerical simulation results with the new model predict the existence of a local maximum in the shear stress distribution along the die for flow with slip.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dealy, John M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jg46x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881n554</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plastics Technology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655j219"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structure and function of the protein products encoded by the measles virus P cistron</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liston, Peter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research work presented in this thesis involved an examination of the structure and function of the protein products of the measles virus (MV) P cistron. At least three protein products of the P cistron have been identified in MV infected cells. The largest of these is the P protein, which is translated in a canonical manner from genome faithful transcripts. The V protein is translated from a secondary population of edited mRNAs, and the C protein is generated via alternative translational initiation from both P- and V-specific mRNAs. Previous work in our laboratory had identified and characterized the cellular distribution of the MV C and V proteins in infected cells, but any insight into the function of these proteins was lacking. Contradictory results have been published as to the sub-cellular localization of the paramyxovirus C and V proteins, as well as their presence or absence in the virion. We initiated this work with an examination of the zinc binding capacity of the V protein predicted from the primary sequence of the protein. In order to proceed with the zinc binding experiment, we overexpressed the MV P and V proteins in E. coli using the pGEX expression system. We used the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein to demonstrate the specificity of the zinc binding activity in competition assays, as well as localizing the zinc binding domain to the carboxy-terminus of the protein. We then used these and other GST fusion proteins to investigate the in vitro interactions of the MV P, V, and C proteins with other virally encoded proteins, as well as with cellular proteins. We identified three protein-protein interactions; P-L, P-NP, and P-P. The interaction domain of the P protein that binds the L protein, the NP protein, and the P protein was mapped to the carboxy-terminal half of the molecule that lies 3$ sp prime$ to the editing site. The MV C and V proteins were found to interact with specific cellular proteins, but not with any of the virus-specific proteins. These interactions were confirmed in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system. In order to complete our examination of the protein interactions involved in the viral replication machinery, we proceeded to examine the interactions of the NP protein, again using both GST fusion protein analysis and the yeast two-hybrid system. An array of amino- and carboxy-terminal deletion mutants of the NP protein were expressed as GST fusions and used to map the NP interaction domains with the P protein and with itself. During the course of our investigation of the P and V proteins, we unexpectedly discovered the existence of ribosomal frameshifting on the MV P mRNA. Deletion mutants were constructed in order to localize the frameshift site. The protein product of the construct with the largest deletion that still exhibited the frameshift phenotype was then purified and subjected to protein sequencing. The frameshift site was identified 5 codons upstream of the UAA stop codon that terminates the V reading frame. In addition, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of anti-V immunoprecipitated viral protein provided strong circumstantial evidence for the existence of the novel protein product, which we have termed R, in infected cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Briedis, Dalius J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fd35h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655j219</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
