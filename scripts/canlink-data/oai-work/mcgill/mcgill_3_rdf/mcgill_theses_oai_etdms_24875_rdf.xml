The experimental conditions included a range of pH (3 to 9),  presence and absence of ambient light, presence and absence of oxygen, and presence  and absence of amorphous and crystalline Mn and Fe oxyhydroxides at (Mn - Ox and  Fe-Ox) constant solid: solution ratios of 0.0002. All experiments were conducted at  a temperature of 23 +/- 4°C and initial arsenite concentration of  approximately 100 ppb. Arsenic speciation was determined both in the aqueous phase  and in the combined solid and aqueous phases. Aqueous arsenite oxidation by oxygen alone is slow. Light, pH,  and ionic strength had no effect on the oxidation rate of arsenite by dissolved  oxygen. In the presence of manganese- and iron oxyhydroxides (Mn-Ox and Fe-Ox), the  oxidation of arsenite is rapid: within 15 minutes, more than 80% of the initial  As(III) was oxidized to As(V) by crystalline and amorphous Fe-Ox, and by amorphous  Mn-Ox. In the presence of crystalline Mn-Ox, more than 20% of the initial As(III)  was oxidized within the first 5 minutes of the experiment. Dissolved oxygen was not  essential for the arsenite oxidation by the metal oxides.

Human MDMA abusers exhibit evidence of disturbed serotonin  transmission. Altered serotonergic neurotransmission in MDMA abusers might underline  susceptibility to developing depressed mood. The acute tryptophan depletion (ATD)  challenge was used to study altered serotonin levels in MDMA abusers. Sixteen MDMA  abusers and nineteen age- and gender-matched controls were tested. In a double-blind  crossover study, subjects ingested a 100g amino acid mixture with or devoid of  tryptophan. Mood was measured before and after the ingestion of the amino acid, a  total of three times throughout the day. Impulsivity was measured with the Go/No-Go  task. ATD lowered mood (p &lt; 0.01) and increased anxiety (p &lt; 0.05) in  female MDMA abusers. The present design does not permit a distinction between  effects of MDMA use or a pre-existing trait. If the effects are due to  neurotoxicity, they could reflect MDMA abuse alone or an effect of a combination of  drugs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Young, Simon</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150j80j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b186b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Toxicology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zp00f"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A randomized approach to minimum distance localization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rao, Malvika</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis addresses the problem of minimum distance  localization in environments that may have structural self-similarities. In other  words, how can a robot most efficiently collect sensor data to estimate its position  and rule out ambiguity (as opposed to merely increasing accuracy). The formalism is  that a mobile robot is placed at an unknown location inside a 2 D self-similar  environment modeled by a simple polygon P . The robot has a map of P, can sense its  environment and hence compute visibility data. However, the self-similarities in the  environment mean that the same visibility data may correspond to several different  locations. The goal, therefore, is to determine the true initial location of the  robot by distinguishing amongst several possibilities consistent with the sensed  visibility data, while minimizing the distance traveled by the robot. We present two  randomized approximation algorithms that efficiently solve the problem of minimum  distance localization. The performance of our localization algorithms is validated  and explored via extensive experiments on a range of simulated  environments.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tv64v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp00f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mj63k"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of Dante, a novel member of the DANCerberus family TGF-[beta] inhibitors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Popescu, Olivia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>TGFbeta signaling peptides have been shown to play increasingly  diverse roles in metazoan development and tissue homeostasis. Negative regulation of  TGFbeta ligands such as Nodal can be achieved by physical interactions with  inhibitory molecules. Dante is a recently identified putative member of DAN/Cerberus  family of TGFbeta inhibitors. Previously shown to be unilaterally expressed on the  right side of the mouse node, Dante has been suggested to play a role in Left-Right  axis formation possibly by inhibition of Nodal molecules. The aim of this study was  to further characterize Dante and to determine whether it can physically interact  with Nodal. First, a longer Dante cDNA was isolated in an attempt to clone the  full-length transcript. Furthermore, Dante expression pattern was analyzed during  murine development and adult tissues. Lastly, co-immunoprecipitation experiments  demonstrated that Dante is able to physically interact with Nodal, providing further  support for its potential role as a Nodal inhibitor.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dufort, Daniel</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214p67b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mj63k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cellular signal transduction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transforming growth factors-beta</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r9674301"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The degradation of the stem-loop binding protein at the late 2-cell stage of mouse embryogenesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poirier, Luc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The efficient processing of replication-dependent histone mRNA  requires the Stem-Loop Binding Protein (SLBP). SLBP is also involved in regulating  histone mRNA half-life, their nucleocytoplasmic transport, and their translation.  Unlike somatic cells, where SLBP protein accumulates only in S-phase, SLBP protein  is present throughout the first two embryonic cell cycles in mice. We report here  that in late 2-cell mouse embryos there is a substantial, proteasome-dependent  decrease in SLBP throughout the cell. Based on chromosome morphology, the  degradation of SLBP protein in late 2-cell embryos is most likely a late G2-phase  event. The degradation of SLBP protein is not simply a zygotic clock event, but  requires development to the late 2-cell stage. Furthermore, SLBP protein degradation  in 2-cell mouse embryos requires cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity, DNA  replication, and zygotic genome activation. A model for SLBP protein degradation is  proposed based on observations made in both early mouse embryos and somatic  cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clarke, Hugh J.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mj64v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9674301</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mice -- Embryology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rk88r"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cardiac medical therapy following coronary artery bypass graft surgery</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Okrainec, Karen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite the benefits of coronary artery bypass graft surgery  (CABG), graft closure can still occur and lead to the development of unstable  angina, myocardial infarction (MI) and death.

We  identified p120E4F-1 as a novel factor, which specifically interacts with Bmi-1 in  the cytoplasmic fraction of hemopoietic cells. We observed that the ability of Bmi-1  to extend the proliferative/replicative lifespan of primary fibroblasts correlated  with a down-regulation of p120E4F-1 protein levels. This function of Bmi-1 occurred  without affecting p120E4F-1 mRNA levels suggestive of a direct interaction between  the two proteins.

Thirteen type 2 diabetic  and sixteen non-diabetic individuals participated in a randomized crossover trial  consisting of 4 phases, of 21 days each. During the study period, subjects were  supplemented with plant sterols and/or glucomannan. Overall reductions of total  cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were  greater after consumption of plant sterols and glucomannan compared to plant sterol  or glucomannan supplementation alone. Plasma lathosterol levels, indicators of  cholesterol biosynthesis, were decreased after combination treatment. The results  suggest that a combination of glucomannan and plant sterols substantially improve  plasma lipids by reducing cholesterol absorption and synthesis simultaneously.  Supplementation of plant sterols and glucomannan can thus be used as an effective  treatment for management of circulating cholesterol levels and prevention of  cardiovascular disease.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jones, P.

Fundamental and dynamic tests were used to evaluate dough  rheology. Relevant parameters include Young's modulus (E), energy at break (EB),  storage modulus (G') and phase angle (delta). Increasing moisture content of noodle  dough decreased its Young's modulus, energy at break and storage modulus. However,  the phase angle of the noodle dough increased with increasing moisture  content. For noodle quality test, textural properties, rehydration rate  and fat absorption of fried noodles were evaluated. Moisture content and the amount  of starch added significantly influenced the maximum load before break point of the  cooked instant noodles as determined by tensile test.

A numerical method is  implemented that simulates non-equilibrium phenomena on a mesoscopic time scale. A  system is perturbed by an external force, and time averages of variables  renormalized in space are calculated numerically, using results of linear response  theory, as the system relaxes to equilibrium. The coarse-grained variables evolve  slowly in time, allowing one to advance them on a mesoscopic time  scale. The algorithm was tested on two physical systems: a lattice  confined ferromagnetic Ising model and an off-lattice Argon-like molecular system.  The method simulated accurately the non-equilibrium phenomena studied. It was found  that the algorithm is most efficient when it is applied to a process occurring on at  least two time scales. This allows one to integrate out the fast, microscopic time  scale in order to study long-time, macroscopic behaviour. Through the study of  diffusion in a molecular system, it was concluded that the proposed method is  computationally faster than solving the microscopic equations of motion and more  accurate than solving the macroscopic equations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Grant, Martin</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415p9970.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb43w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w0513"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Rendering falling snow using an inverse Fourier transform</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Linqiao, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents an image based falling snow rendering  method which is based on spectral synthesis technique.

Experimental studies suggested that tricyclic  antidepressants (TCAs) would increase the risk of cancer, whereas selective  serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) would protect against colorectal  cancer. Objectives. This study was carried out to examine the following  hypotheses: (1) The use of TCAs increases the risk of colorectal cancer. (2) In  particular, the use of genotoxic TCAs increases the risk of colorectal cancer as  compared to non-genotoxic TCAs. (3) The use of (SSRIs) decreases the risk of  colorectal cancer. Methods. A population-based nested case-control study was  carried out using as source population who individually participate in the  Saskatchewan Prescription Drug Plan (SPDP) aged 5--82.5 years from 1981--2000 with  no previous history of cancer since 1967. 6544 histologically proven invasive  colorectal cancer cases were identified from the Saskatchewan Cancer Registry (SCR).  For each case, 4 eligible non-cancer controls matched on age, gender and calendar  time were randomly selected.

A cross-sectional survey  was conducted to document substance abuse in 207 successive outpatients with  schizophrenia and related psychoses presenting to a psychiatric continuing care  facility in a large Canadian city. Nicotine, alcohol and cannabis were the most  frequently abused substances. Excluding nicotine, 44.9% met criteria for lifetime  and 14.0% for current abuse/dependence. Current dual diagnosis (DD) patients had  significantly more positive psychotic and depressive symptoms, higher rates of  medication non-compliance, as well as higher rates of tobacco smoking and  significantly longer smoking histories compared to single diagnosis (SD) patients.  The smoking behavior of the DD population is discussed in terms of enhanced risk for  alcohol abuse, as well as effects on antipsychotic blood levels and  metabolism. In the second phase of the study, the starting sample was  reassessed at 4 month intervals out to 12-months of follow-up. The follow-up study  was designed to test the hypothesis that current-DD patients would fare  significantly worse than SD patients. This study found that during the course of  standard psychiatric outpatient treatment there was little decrease in substance use  or abuse over time among the DD group. However, DD subjects experienced a greater  reduction in positive psychotic symptoms compared to SD patients.

This complex process is regulated by a multitude of factors  (1). One such factor is the Polyadenylate Binding Protein (PABP), an abundant  protein associated with messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) (18). As a  result of its interaction with both poly(A) RNA and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G  (eIF4G), a component of the tripartite eIF4F cap-binding complex, PABP elicits mRNA  circularization and stimulates translation (2). Although the mechanism by which mRNA  circularization facilitates translation is not clear, one model suggests that  circularization promotes ribosome recycling. Recently, an interaction between PABP  and the termination factor, eukaryotic Release Factor3 (eRF3/GSPT) was demonstrated  in mammals (71). By interacting with both eRF3 and eIF4G, it was postulated that  PABP physically bridges the stop codon to the 5' cap structure, enabling terminating  ribosomes to reinitiate translation on the same mRNA. To explore this idea, several  PABP mutants lacking the ability to bind eRF3 were generated and added to a  PABP-depleted Krebs-2 Cell-Free Extract to study the effects on translation. The  PABP mutants stimulated translation as effectively as wild-type PABP, suggesting  that the eRF3-PABP interaction is dispensable for translation and ribosome  recycling. RNA-binding protein localization may be regulated by methylation and  protein-protein interactions (98). PABP was also recently identified as a  Coactivator-Associated Arginine Methyltransferase I (CARMI) substrate (23). Here, we  show that PABP methylation does not modulate nuclear shuttling or its interactions  with 14-3-3, a novel PABP-interacting protein. Translation in  "non-nuclear" rabbit reticulocyte lysate is robust and PABP-independent,  suggesting a loss of inhibitory control by nuclear factors.

The DCharts formalism is based  on UML statecharts and DEVS, but provides better modularity and expressiveness.  DCharts semantics is rigorously defined in both an operational way and in a  denotational way. Abstract, textual, and visual syntax for DCharts are  presented. SVM, a DCharts simulator implemented in Python, is presented. It  accepts textual model descriptions and simulates them. Multiple types of  simulations, as well as real-time execution, are discussed in detail with examples.  Model verification is supported by means of repeated simulations in SVM and  rule-checking of the simulation traces with extended regular  expressions. SCC is a tool to synthesize executable code from DCharts models.  It statically optimizes the models to achieve high run-time performance. Multiple  target languages are supported. Applications of the DCharts formalism are studied, by means of  the above-mentioned tools. They demonstrate how DCharts are ready for practical  use.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vangheluwe, Hans</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq26q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375w937</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w052c"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The impact of restricted access to atmospheric oxygen on the survival and development of Aedes aegypti (Diptera:Culicidae) pre-imagos</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cyr, Hélène</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Reduced access to atmospheric oxygen greatly increased early  instar Aedes aegypti mortality. Data suggest that death was by drowning mainly  because slow swimming speed and low visual acuity delayed larvae from finding access  to air. Late instar larvae experienced developmental delays when food depletion in  the immediate vicinity of the breathing site forced them to forage farther away. As  the distance between feeding and breathing sites increased, feeding efficiency of  fourth instars may have declined enough to reduce their pupation success and to  cause increased pupal mortality, reduced adult emergence and sex ratio skewed in  favour of males among emerging functional adults. Thus reduced access to atmospheric  oxygen at the pre-imago level may reduce the vectorial capacity of emerging adult  population.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rau, Manfred E.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gk45j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w052c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aedes aegypti -- Ecophysiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aedes aegypti -- Larvae -- Ecology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aedes aegypti -- Biological control</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z139x"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Counting the onion</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dalal, Ketan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Iteratively computing and discarding a set of convex hulls  creates a structure known as an "onion".

The retention of long term facilitation of  sensory-motor neuron synapses requires local translation. Indeed, retention of long  term facilitation is blocked by rapamycin, an inhibitor of a specific translational  pathway. One rapamycin-sensitive target is S6 kinase. S6 kinase activation and the  subsequent increased translation of 5 ' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs that  encode components of the translational machinery has been proposed to be important  for retention of long term facilitation (Khan et al., 2001). We have cloned one of  these TOP mRNAs, the elongation factor eEF2 and showed that serotonin increased the  translation of this mRNA in synaptosomes. The phosphorylation of eEF2 may also be  regulated by the rapamycin-sensitive system. eEF2 phosphorylation is mediated by the  calcium-sensitive eEF2 kinase and blocks translational elongation. Serotonin  application decreased eEF2 phosphorylation in synaptosomes and in isolated neurites  and this was blocked by rapamycin. This suggests that serotonin-mediated increases  in the translation rate can be independent of the regulation of TOP mRNAs. We  propose a mechanism involving eEF2 for increasing synaptic specificity of  translational control. Stimulation blocks translation at all synapses through  calcium entry and phosphorylation of eEF2. This block can be reversed at specific  synapses through activation of the rapamycin-sensitive system and dephosphorylation  of eEF2. Phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding  protein (4EBP) increases the availability of the mRNA cap-binding eukaryotic  initiation factor 4E and is also rapamycin-sensitive. We found that 4EBP  phosphorylation at threonine 37/46 was stimulated in a rapamycin-sensitive manner in  Aplysia neuronal processes, although it is possible that other 4EBP phosphorylation  sites are also rapamycin-sensitive.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sossin, Wayne S.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tf99v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gw77j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vh359"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Predictors of antibiotic prescribing among primary care physicians</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cadieux, Geneviève, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Antibiotic misuse and overuse increase health care costs while  promoting antibiotic resistance.

Feature point selection requires identifying the points  in one image that can be most reliably identified and matched in a second image.  Most feature point selection methods identify points that are interesting according  to subjective notions as to which points are best for matching, such as points with  a high degree of edge density, nostrils in face images, etc. The EOL method  differentiates itself from the majority of feature point selection methods in that  points are chosen by explicitly evaluating points according to their potential to  result in fast, unique correspondence, given the particular model used for  correspondence and images to be matched. We describe the EOL feature point selection  within the framework of the Bayesian Markov random field (MRF) correspondence model,  where the degree of feature point information is encoded by the entropy of the  Bayesian likelihood term. We propose that feature selection according to minimum  entropy-of-likelihood (EOL) is less likely to lead to correspondence ambiguity, thus  improving the optimization process in terms of speed and quality of solution.  Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the EOL to select optimal feature  points in a wide variety of image contexts, such as objects, faces, aerial  photographs, etc. Correspondence trials comparing EOL feature point selection with  the well-known Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) method reveal that EOL feature points lead  to correspondence that is significantly faster and less likely than KLT to result in  sub-optimal, locally maximal solutions. In addition, ground truth comparisons show  that EOL feature points result in a lower residual error.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Arbel, Tal</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sq72z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tg00d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
