Heat-inactivated antiserum inhibits cell growth and colony formation in soft agar, and kills the cells. These actions occur slowly and metabolic events, in sequence; that is, RNA synthesis is inhibited after 4 hr, but the effects on the rates of protein and DNA syntheses become demonstrable only after 6 to 8, and 8 hr, respectively. Maximal inhibition can he obtained after 24 to 48 hr. These effects together with the apparent involvement of energy generating systems suggest that some indirect mechanism, triggered as a result of primary antigen-antibody reactions on the cells surface, is respons1ble.

The non-specific cytotoxic effect depended on the intensity of the GVH reactions and was contingent upon direct contact between target cells and metabolically active spleen cells.

Using disc gel electrophoresis ± non-ionic detergent, it was found that cytochrome f existed as soluble aggregates at pH 8 and could be disaggregated into a single electrophoretic species by 0.1% non-ionic detergent. Disc gel electrophoresis with non-ionic detergent was also instrumental in designing and monitoring the purification procedure and served as a final chromatographic step. Proof of homogeneity of the cytochrome f was established. The cytochrome appeared to contain one c-heme-containing polypeptide chain and one non-heme chain, each of about 31,000, which was consistent with the equivalent weight of 31,600 obtained from amino acid analysis. Cytochrome f was not autoxidizable, did not combine with CO, and contained no non-heme iron. Absorbance spectra at 22º and at -199º are presented. The technology of disc gel electrophoresis ± non-ionic detergent was further tested with purified protein preparations of membranous origin (cytochrome oxidase, cytochrome b-cI complex and dogfish lens a crystallin).

CO2 has a mainly depressant action on overall transmission from a forelimb nerve to the midbrain medial lemniscus, and on the excitability of the presynaptic afferent terminals and postsynaptic relay neurones in the cuneate. From an input/output analysis, correlating trans-synaptic responses at the medial lemniscus and antidromic responses at the nerve, it was concluded that (i) the efficiency of synaptic transmission at individual active synapses was maintained, (ii) the block of afferent transmission was mainly presynaptic. Depression of afferent fibre excitability was greater in the presynaptic terminals than in the dorsal column. Afferent volleys recorded at the dorsal root and dorsal column showed that CO2 blocked the transmission of supra-maximal responses at or after the root entry zone. Depressant effects of CO2 on afferent transmission most probably involve block of conduction at low safety factor regions of branching in axonal pathways, while the transmission of impulses arriving at the synapses is maintained.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Krnjevic, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77st060.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x2289</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tz15j"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Energy production in the canine ileal mucosa following hemorrhagic shock</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mavrias, Denis A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This investigation has been undertaken to study changes in high energy phosphate metabolism of the canine intestine following hemorrhagic shock. The information on energy metabolism in the intestine is scarce, necessitating extensive studies into normal metabolic properties of this tissue. Respiration of intestinal homogenates was not limited by the level of ADP, but it was limited by the level of cytochromes. These results indicated that oxidative phosphorylation in intestinal mucosa is loosely coupled, a fact that was supported further by the lack of effect of DNP on endogenous respiration. In studies with DNP and NaF, the increased turnover of ATP-phosphate in the presence of glucose was found to be due to energy derived from the glycolytic pathway. Hemorrhagic shock had no significant effect on either oxygen uptake or energy production in the intestinal mucosa in vitro. These results led to a proposal that hemorrhagic shock produces a transport barrier between the intestinal epithelial cells and the circulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McArdle, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w95053510.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tz15j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nm24w"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Patterns of background firing of single sympathetic preganglionic units in the cat spinal cord</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mannard, Allan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Patterns of extracellularly-recorded, stationary, background impulse sequences, from individual cervical nerve sympathetic preganglionic units (SPU), have been systematized by time series analysis (interval histogram, IH; autocorrelogram, ACG).

On the basis of the occurrence and properties of discharge in neuraxially intact and spinal preparations, and the influences of antidromic stimulation, qualitative models are proposed, of SPU spike initiation by a random threshold crossing process (set up by activity in many, independent, converging presynaptic inputs), with firing contiguity limited by postimpulse recovery of excitability. Exponential IH "tails" and ACG "overshoot" are, thus, explained. Bimodal and multimodal IH, revealing cardiac pulse modulation of SPU discharge, are explained in terms of baroreceptor inhibition.

The findings of this study suggest that adenosine is directly incorporated by an erythrocyte adenosine kinase.

This method yields a product of high purity as shown by gel electrophoresis in three different systems as well as different gel concentrations. The purified material has a specific activity of 21.1 micromoles of SHT produced per mg protein per h. The purified enzyme has 7 times the activity towards L-DOPA as it does towards 5HTP. This ratio does not change during purification. 5HTP and DOPA act as mutual competitive inhibitors with KI's similar to their KM's suggesting that they bind at the same site on the enzyme. Activity towards ortho- and meta-tyrosine and erythro-DOPS was also detected in the purified enzyme. Decarboxylase activity was not detected towards para-tyrosine or threo-DOPS. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme found by gel filtration was 8.5-9.0 x 10^4. Dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave two bands. The sum of the molecular weights 4 of these bands was 8.8-9.4 x 10^4. As the method used breaks disulfide bonds it is probable that dopa decarboxylase consists of two peptides of unequal length. By direct measurements on the purified enzyme, it was round that 1 PLP is present per mole of enzyme. Additional PLP does not appreciably stimulate activity towards most substrates suggesting that the purified material is holoenzyme.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sourkes, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pw84g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fr94n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418r338"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cyclic AMP metabolism in brain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Katz, Sidney</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A method for measuring the rate of production of C-labelled 14 adenine nucleotides from C-ATP was developed and used to study the relationship of adenyl cyclase to other membrane-bound ATP utilizing enzymes and cyclic 3', 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) in preparations of rat cerebral cortex and guinea-pig pancreas.

Adrenaline and ouabain stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation by a method not related to inhibition of other membrane-bound ATP utilizing enzymes or to inhibition of PDE activity. Adrenaline stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation in the synaptic membrane preparation required the presence of Ca++ in the preparation media.

Among various nucleosides tested, only dTR and to a much lesser extent, dUR and its 5-halogenated derivatives could serve as phosphate acceptors. All kinds of ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, except for dTTP, were found to be active as phosphate donors, ATP being the most effective. Calf thymus dTR kinase is inhibited specifically by deoxynucleotide derivatives of thymine; the potency of inhibition being in the order of dTTP &gt; dTDP &gt; dTMP. The molecular weight of dTR kinase was found to be approximately 55,000, as determined by gel filtration. Evidence has been obtained which suggests the existence of heat-stable form of the enzyme. Substrates, inhibitors, and products were found to protect the enzyme against heat denaturation. Gel filtration studies suggested that the enzyme undergoes a change in elution volume on Sepharose 6B in the presence of dTTP or ATP, possibly indicating an aggregational or a conformational change in the enzyme. The purified enzyme could be activated by 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. The Km values for dTR and ATP were 57 micromolar and 50 micromolar, respectively. The mode of inhibition by dTTP was found to he competitive with respect to dTR. The inhibition was also competitive with respect to ATP at high concentrations of ATP, but noncompetitive with respect to ATP at lower concentrations of ATP. The Ki value for dTTP was 6.7 micromolar, as determined with respect to dTR. Initial velocity studies suggested that dTR kinase reaction proceeds via a sequential mechanism, possibly a "random Bi Bi".</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Momparler, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h4728.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547v595</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50tv598"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the metabolism of corticosteroids C-21 yl sulfates with particular reference to cortisol sulfate</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hall, Conrad S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Investigations on biogenesis and metabolism of 17-hydroxy and 17-deoxysteroids of the pragn-4-ene C-21 yl sulfate series showed that (a) such conjugates are little if at aIl hydrolyzed by placental sulfatase and are poor substrates with respect to placental 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase compared to the corresponding steroid alcohols; (b) following injection to adult subjects, cortisol sulfate is in part metabolized to ll-oxo and 11beta-hydroxy etiocholanolone glucuronides, but not to C-2l steroid glucuronides of the pregn-5-ene series; its rate of secretion represents only a fraction of that of cortisol; (c) when H-cortisol and C-cortisol sulfate or H-corticosterone and C-corticosterone sulfate are injected to human newborns, of the total amount of tritium excreted into the urine only small proportions are extractable - from 1.3 - 13% in the glucuronide and from 3 - 18% the sulfate fraction.

Proximal tubule fluid was obtained before and after isotonic saline infusion and magnesium chloride. Tubule fluid-to-plasma (TF/P) inulin ratio was depressed after infusions of saline and magnesium chloride, whilst the tubule fluid-to-plasma ultrafiltrate TF/UF magnesium ratio approximated to unity. Fractional excretion of sodium and magnesium showed a parallel increase after saline, but after magnesium chloride infusion fractional excretion of magnesium far exceeded that of sodium. Further recollection micropuncture studies were performed during extracellular volume expansion and magnesium sulphate and chloride infusions with or without furosemide. During volume expansion proximal magnesium absorption was isotonic whereas that in the distal was active. Following magnesium sulphate infusion, mean proximal TF/UF magnesium ratio was 1.25 and mean distal TF/UF magnesium ratio was 1.79. After magnesium chloride infusion mean proximal and distal TF/UF magnesium ratio was 1.28 and 1.89 respective1y. There was a marked dissociation in sodium and magnesium transport in the distal nephron. After magnesium sulphate infusion a small net addition of magnesium in the collecting duct was observed, indicating secretion at this site.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dirks, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn1072153.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859j66z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920g085g"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Myocardial reaction to experimental ischemic injury in the rat</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dusek, Jaroslav</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of the experiments reported was to study the reaction of non-necrotic myocardium to a right ventricular infarct produced by right coronary ligation in the rat. Samples were taken from the right ventricle to investigate the reaction in the marginal zone of the infarct, and from the left ventricle to observe the changes in the cardiac muscle remote from the necrosis. Sham operations were performed in order to investigate the effect of the operative trauma. The evolution of findings in the left ventricular myocardium was correlated in time with the known post-operative increase of myocardial resistance, in an effort to find the possible myocardial factors responsible for this increase. Cardiac muscle cells in the marginal zone and some of the subepicardial muscle cells displayed a variety of histochemical and electron microscopic changes suggestive of an impairment of the cellular function and an increased importance of alternative metabolic pathways, in order to preserve the structural integrity of the cells and to meet their energy requirements. The findings in this area were apparently related to the progressive anoxia which resulted from the fibrotic transformation of granulation tissue surrounding the infarct. Biochemical, histochemical and electron microscopic studies of the left ventricular myocardium remote from necrosis suggested that the preparatory procedure resulted in a temporary stimulation of the proteosynthetic activity in the cardiac muscle cells and that this may form the basis for their increased resistance and adaptability. The findings support the hypothesis of a myocardial factor being important in the resistance against various noxious stimuli.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rona, G.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Kahn, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580q770.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920g085g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21tj480"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Lipoprotein synthesis and secretion by rat liver following partial hepatectomy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Delahunty, Thomas J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Incorporation of intravenously administered palmitic acid 9,10^3H into beta-lipoprotein steadily increases for the first 20 hours of hepatic regeneration. Thirteen hours after partial hepatectomy the concentration of circulating beta-lipoprotein is at a normal level, but the specific activities of liver and beta-lipoprotein-triglyceride were significantly diminished. During perfusion the 13 hour regenerating liver secretes quantities of beta-lipoprotein-triglyceride which exceed those released by a zero hour liver although there is no difference in liver weight. Equal quantities of protein were released by both livers. Triglyceride specific activity in the liver and perfusate B-lipoprotein was diminished, but the protein was not affected. Prelabelling of the accumulated triglyceride with palmitate-1-14C in vivo showed that the per cent release by the 13 hour regenerating liver was equal to that of the control tissue, while that of a CCl4 treated liver was 1/20 of that level. Liver and perfusate triglyceride specific activities were similar for normal and regenerating livers, indicating one continuous triglyceride pool. The 13 hour regenerating liver was secreting quantities of lipid which were on a par with that of the larger normal liver. This was accomplished by increasing the lipid to protein ratio in the beta-lipoprotein molecule. The results are discussed in relation to the possible controlling mechanisms affecting lipid storage and secretion in the premitotic stage of regeneration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rubinstein, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634677w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tj480</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881q149"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Incorporation of 3H-fucose label into glycoprotein in the golgi apparatus of rat cells, and its passage to the cell coat and to lysosomes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bennett, Gary C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Young rats were injected with 3H-fucose and sacrificed after various times.

By 20 minutes, label appeared at all cell surfaces and in lysosomes. It is interpreted that the fucose label was incorporated by the Golgi apparatus into glycoproteins which migrated to lysosomes and to all cell surfaces to be added to the cell coat. A method developed to stain radioautographs of duodenal cells with phosphotungstic acid revealed glycoprotein in all labelled structures, including cytoplasmic vesicles which may transport the labelled glycoprotein to the cell surfaces. In light microscopic radioautographs of many other cell types, label appeared first over the Golgi region and later over cell secretions or over cell surfaces.

It is shown that even though optical activity in quartz introduces only very small changes in the optical wave vector loci, its effects on acoustooptic diffraction geometry are nevertheless easily measurable. A calculation procedure for the diffraction angles incorporating optical activity is described and then experimentally verified. Topez, an optically biaxial crystal, is used to demonstrate the effects on shear-wave acoustooptic diffraction geometry of acoustic propagation along other thon symmetry axes and of interaction in nonsymmetry planes. The diffraction field of a plane aperture or a plane transducer in a highly anisotropic crystal is calculated by means of an angular spectrum of plane waves representation for which the phase velocity surface need only be defined numerically. This theory is experimentally verified by observing optical diffraction from a slit-type aperture in a biaxial crystal and by acoustooptic probe measurements of quasi-longitudinal and quasi-shear ultrasonic beam profiles under conditions of very high elastic anisotropy. Further verification is achieved by using published experimental measurements of ultrasonic surface wave beam profiles on lithium niobate. It is demonstrated that excellent agreement between theory and experiment is possible. Finally, the formalism and associated computational techniques are extended in order to examine various relevant problems in the diffraction and focusing of elastic surface waves.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Farnell, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892f043.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vp03s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qs92q"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fine structure of irreversible alterations in atrial cardiocytes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Berger, Jayson M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a strain of Long-Evans rats, central core myofilament dissociation occurred in over 50% of atrial muscle cells (cardiocytes) studied. The major features of this dissociation were: loss of I-bands and Z-lines, loss of sarco-tubules, reduction in size of associated mitochondria, and dissociated aggregates of thick filaments. The thick filaments appeared joined by linear interfilamentary projections which measured about 164 A in length, 40 A in width, and occurred in regular periodic intervals of about 200 A along the filaments. Most often, the dissociated thick filaments were found to be fragmented further, and, together with other factors, was considered part of an irreversible pattern. Plasmocid, an 8-aminoquinoline, known to be myotoxic in selected doses specifically to I-bands and tubules in atrial cardiocytes was administered to cats in or der to produce experimentally the features present in the rats. After I-band loss induced by plasmocid, the linear projections, termed "cross-bars", were found between thick filaments. The cross-bars were considered to contribute to the transversal stability of A-bands. The patterns of reversible structural alterations appeared as: loss of I-band filaments, reduction of amount of Golgi complex, tubular and mitochondrial swelling, and loss of matrical density in mitochondria. Irreversible fine structural alterations appeared as fragmentation or disorganization of sarcoplasmic tubules, amorphous condensation of A-bands, cytoplasmic disintegration with respect to organelles, and chromatin clumping. The irreversible patterns were correlated with severe alterations in ECG P-wave.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rona, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440w83b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qs92q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
