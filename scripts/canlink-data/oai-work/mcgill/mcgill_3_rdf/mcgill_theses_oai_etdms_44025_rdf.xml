The first gene was Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) which  is a key regulatory enzyme of gluconeogenesis. The second candidate gene, Ornithine  decarboxylase (ODC), is a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. It has a  significant role in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. We first analyzed the  genetic variability of PEPCK-C, the gene which codes for the cytosolic form of  PEPCK. A 3792 by segment of 5'-region of the PEPCK-C gene (pos. -1723 to 2069) was  sequenced in 32 White Leghorn chickens (a total of 64 genomes). A total of 19 single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. We then analyzed the genetic  variability of ODC. A 5 kb sequence of 3' end of the gene was sequenced in 20 White  Leghorn chickens (a total of 40 genomes). A total of 63 variant sites were  identified. The rate of insertion/deletion in ODC was 16%, whereas neither deletions  nor insertions were present in PEPCK-C. Gene trees were constructed for both genes  assuming maximal parsimony. This led to the delineation of 6 haplotypes in PEPCK-C.  Two of the SNPs coincided with RFLP detectable by the restriction enzymes AciI and  BstEII, respectively. Three haplotypes in ODC were defined. In the next step, White  Leghorn chickens from a non-selected closed population were typed for these two  PEPCK-C RFLP. The two RFLP gave rise to three alleles (or haplotype classes), which  in turn defined six genotypes. A comparison of genotypes revealed significant  differences in feed efficiency (FE) and residual feed consumption (RFC). There was  significant interaction between PEPCK-C genotypes and mitochondrial PEPCK (PEPCK-M)  genotypes defined by an RFLP.

Modified high amylose starch tablets  swell to a limit when submerged in water, yielding a hydrogel with quasi-reversible  viscoelastic properties. Such tablets display slow-release properties with a near  zero-order drug delivery kinetics. Mechanical properties, electron microscopy  imaging and swelling behavior have been investigated. Results from the foregoing  investigations and from 13C CP/MAS NMR studies, which showed a clear transition from  amorphous to crystalline organization upon wetting, were used to propose a model.  The latter proposes that the viscoelastic hydrogel is formed due to the propensity  of amylopectin and amylose, the two components of starch, to organize into double  helices. The so formed pseudo-crosslinks, as water penetrates the dry tablet,  explain the shape retention (limited swelling). This model was tested using Curdlan,  a beta-1,3-glucan that is known to crystallize as triple helices. Studies on Curdlan  tablets demonstrated limited swelling and shape retention, but unsuitable mechanical  properties. This supported the model and added a feature that takes into account the  heterogeneous nature of starch as an important factor in the obtention of a good  viscoelastic hydrogel. Because hydrophobic drugs are difficult to release by diffusion  through matrices of hydrophilic polysaccharides, synthesis of compatibilizers was  undertaken. Using a natural hydrophobic polyester: poly([R]-3-hydroxybutyric acid),  PHB, possessing a high enthalpy of crystallization, a self-assembly amphiphilic  system was created. Diblock copolymers of monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol), mPEG  and PHB were synthesized in a one-step, solvent-free, transesterification reaction.  The resulting diblock copolymers were used to form colloidal suspensions of  nanoparticles that are potential drug carriers and compatibilizers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marchessault, Robert H.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831ck50n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm75h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Pharmaceutical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hq15x"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Integrating information about mechanism and covariation in casual reasoning</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rapus, Tanja L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Causal reasoning is an important and complex process, in which  individuals have multiple sources of information available to inform their  judgments. An enduring tension exists between what cues to causality people use and  focus on in acquiring causal knowledge and making causal judgments. Much research on  causal reasoning has focused on how people use information about covariation in this  process. More recently, research has shown that people seek and use information  about causal mechanisms to inform their causal inferences. Consequently, an  important theoretical question is how people combine knowledge about causal  mechanisms, that is, how a candidate cause works to bring about or produce a given  effect, with information about covariation, which is the empirical relation between  these two variables. Very little research has investigated how these two sources of  information are integrated in determining people's causal judgments. Two general  models of how these sources of input are combined currently exist: covariation and  mechanism precedence models. Both these models account for people's causal judgments  on the basis of the primacy of one source of information over the  other. The research presented in this thesis investigates several  variables that are hypothesized to be key in the integration of covariation and  mechanism information. It is hypothesized that the scope of the covariation  information available, as well as the strength of the covariation present between  possible cause and effect are important dimensions of covariation input. It is also  hypothesized that the nature and structure of mechanism information available to the  reasoner is an important variable influencing the integration, specifically the  detailedness of the representation of mechanism information. In four experiments the  effects of these different variables on judgments of causality were assessed in  combination. Overall it was found that how information about covariation strength is  used depends on the detailedness of mechanism information and the scope over which  covariation information is defined. The results indicate that one source of  information does not have primacy over the other. Thus, an interactive model of how  these sources of input are integrated is proposed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dunbar, Kevin</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq19j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq15x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Cognitive</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rk81t"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cooperative localization and multi-robot exploration</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rekleitis, Ioannis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis has two main contributions. The first contribution  is the use of cooperative localization for decoupling the positional error of a  moving robot from its environment. The second contribution is the development of  efficient multi-robot exploration strategies for an unknown  environment. The proposed method is designed to be robust in the face of  arbitrarily large odometry errors or objects with poor reflectance characteristics.  Central to the exploration strategy is a sensor (robot tracker) mounted on a robot  that could track a second mobile robot and accurately report its relative position.  Our exploration strategies use the robot tracker sensor to sweep areas of free space  between stationary and moving robots and to generate a graph-based description of  the environment. This graph is used to guide the exploration process. Depending on  the size of the environment relative to the range of the robot tracker, different  spatial decompositions are used: a triangulation or a trapezoidal decomposition of  the free space. Complete exploration without any overlaps is guaranteed as a result  of the guidance provided by the dual graph of the spatial decomposition of the  environment. The uncertainty in absolute robot positions and the resulting  uncertainty in the map is reduced through the use of a probabilistic framework based  on particle filtering (a Monte Carlo simulation technique). Particle filtering is a  probabilistic sampling technique used to efficiently model complex probability  distributions that cannot be effectively described using classical methods (such as  Kalman filters). We present experimental results from two different  implementations of the robot tracker sensor, in simulated and in real environments.  The accuracy of the resulting map increases with the use of cooperative  localization. Furthermore, the deterioration of the floor conditions did not affect  the quality of the map verifying the decoupling of positioning error from the  environment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dudek, Gregory</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kk106.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rk81t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wn37q"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulation of the peripheral myelin protein-22 gene</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Orfali, Wayel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Peripheral Myelin Protein-22 (PMP22) is a relatively major  component of peripheral nerve myelin. Either missense mutations or duplication of  the PMP22 gene can be the cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A (CMT1A). The  control of PMP22 expression could be a basis for treatment. The aim of my research  is to understand the regulation of the PMP22 gene in a transgenic mouse model.  Initially, -8.5 kb 5' flanking sequence of the rat Pmp22 gene was used to drive  reporter gene expressed in transgenic mice. This construct confers tissue  specificity, weak developmental regulation, weakly detectable levels of expression  in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), but not the expected up-regulation during nerve  regeneration. Secondly, I generated transgenic mice using -21 kb 5' Pmp22 flanking  sequence. This construct confers robust reporter gene expression in the peripheral  nervous system (PNS), and little to the DRGs in one line. The other lines show weak  expression in the PNS, and stronger expression in the DRGs. Thirdly, I targeted a 21  kb Pmp22 promoter/reporter transgene to the hypoxanthine phosphorybosyl transferase  (Hprt) locus in male embryonic stem cells. Using this methodology, I obtained a line  carrying -21 kb of Pmp22 promoter driving beta-galactosidase gene in the hprt locus.  This line confers expression similar to the four lines derived by pronuclear  injection carrying the same construct. Fourthly, I introduced the LacZ reporter gene  at the start codon of Pmp22 in a 100 kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Six  transgenic lines were produced and analyzed, showing embryonic and postnatal  developmental regulation, and high level of expression in the PNS similar to  endogenous Pmp22 expression. From my results and the literature, I suggest that (1)  the stretch of -10.5 to -21 kb could carry repressor(s), (2) there is (a) positive  element(s) that lie(s) between -8.5 and -10.5 kb, and (3) 3' element(s) are  important for Pmp22 expression.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Snipes, G.

Jets were reconstructed using the longitudinally invariant  kT-clustering algorithm. The dijet cross section for events containing at least one  D*+/- charmed meson was measured as a function of various observables sensitive to  hard scattering and the structure of the photon. The results are compared with  predictions from leading-order parton-shower Monte Carlo simulations and with  next-to-leading-order QCD calculations. Differential cross sections of dijets as a function of the angle  between the charm jet and the proton-beam directions in the dijet rest frame have  been measured for samples enriched in direct or resolved photon events. The angular  distribution shows a steep rise for resolved photon events in the photon direction,  providing a clear first evidence for the existence of charm originating from the  photon. The shallower rise for direct photon events as well as for the resolved  photon events in the proton direction are consistent with the quark exchange  diagrams. The charm fragmentation function has also been measured for the  first time at HERA. The fragmentation variable z is given by the ratio of E +  p∥ for the D* meson and that for the associated jet, where E is the energy  and p∥ the longitudinal momentum relative to the jet axis. The measured  cross section was compared to different fragmentation models incorporated in both  leading- and next-to-leading-order frameworks and to the results from e+ e-  experiments.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Corriveau, Francois</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9997209.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644s077</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q4474"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The spatial summation and contrast sensitivity of the red-green, blue-yellow and luminance mechanisms in human peripheral vision</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chu, William, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Color and luminance perception both rely on the different  combinations of the three cone types, termed L, M, and S cones. Each of the color  opponent mechanisms can be defined by their cone weights with (L-M) for Red-Green,  (S-0.5(L+M)) for Blue-Yellow, and (2L+M) for the luminance  mechanism. My project investigates two aspects of peripheral color vision.  One looks at the spatial summation of the three mechanisms across eccentricity and  the other one looks at the selective loss of red-green cone contrast sensitivity in  the periphery. In the spatial summation experiment, we have used two kinds of  horizontal gratings for the investigation: a gabor patch and a sine wave ring  stimulus. A gabor patch is a conventional visual research stimulus. A radially  modulated sine wave ring stimulus is one we designed to test peripheral vision with  the advantage of confining its spatial position in eccentric location. In other  words, from changing the radius of the ring, we can place the rim of the ring either  nearer or further in eccentricity from the central point. Our results show three  things: the spatial summation of both chromatic mechanisms and luminance mechanism  are similar, spatial summation for all three mechanisms varies across eccentricity,  and lastly we find that spatial summation is constant in spatial extent as opposed  to the number of spatial cycles. This last finding is in contradiction to previous  results, which have found that the spatial summation of the luminance mechanism is  determined by the number of stimulus cycles rather than its spatial  extent. We used the sine wave ring stimulus, as described in the spatial  summation experiment, for our second investigation. Our results show that red-green  mechanism unlike the other two mechanisms has a steep post-receptoral signal loss in  the periphery, using the sine wave ring confirming previous studies. In addition, we  have found the outer bound limit of red-green peripheral perception occurs at around  25 to 30 degree. We have optimally increased the stimulus in size and in contrast,  but the red-green detection limit cannot be eccentrically set  further.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848r09w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q4474</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0g354f75d"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of a novel TGF-[beta] accessory receptor in human keratinocytes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marcoux, Anne, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling is involved  in a wide array of cellular responses in both physiological and pathological  conditions. Dysregulation of TGF-beta action can lead to impaired tissue homeostasis  and several developmental defects. Mechanisms regulating TGF-beta signal  transduction include modulation of TGF-beta signaling receptor activity by accessory  receptors. Our group has recently identified a GPI-anchored TGF-beta1 binding  protein, r150, and has shown that it is implicated in the regulation of TGF-beta  signaling in keratinocytes. Recent molecular cloning of r150 in our laboratory shows  that it represents CD109, a novel member of the alpha2-macroglobulin/complement  (AMCOM) gene family. We provided evidence showing that r150 contains an intact  internal thioester bond, which is one of the defining characteristics of almost all  members of the alpha2M/complement family, including CD109. Using affinity labeling,  immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that r150 binds  TGF-beta1 with high affinity and associates with the TGF-beta receptors indicating  that it is a component of the TGF-beta signaling complex. In addition,  overexpression of r150 resulted in a significant decrease in TGF-beta-induced wound  closure and TGF-beta-mediated growth inhibition. In contrast, blocking the  expression of r150 by an antisense approach enhanced the above responses.  Importantly, immunohistochemical analysis showed that r150 expression is markedly  decreased in psoriatic lesions when compared to adjacent normal  skin. In summary, our results demonstrated that r150 is a negative  modulator of TGF-beta responses in keratinocytes, and that it might be a potential  marker or molecular target for therapeutic intervention in modulating TGF-beta  action in human diseases where TGF-beta plays a pathophysiological  role.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq181.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354f75d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892b39k"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of metal ions on macrophages cultured in solution and on phosphorylcholine polymer modified surfaces</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Luo, Li, 1972 Jan. 7-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Metal particles and ions from hip prostheses have the potential  to stimulate macrophages to release various bone-resorbing mediators, leading to  periprosthetic loosening and osteolysis around implants. Previous reports have  suggested that the imbalance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue  inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) activity may contribute to prosthetic  loosening. However, the mechanism controlling these enzymes in the periprosthetic  environment is unknown. The aim of the present project was to characterize the  effect of Co2+ and Cr3+ ions on the expression of genes encoding MMP-1, one of the  principal proteinases capable of degrading native fibrillar collagens in the  extracellular matrix (ECM), its inhibitor TIMP-1, and TNF-alpha, a cytokine that  plays a central role in the induction of implant osteolysis. Human U937 macrophages  were incubated with Co2+ and Cr3+ ions. The level of mRNAs was determined by reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Our results show that both Co2+  and Cr3+ ions induce the expression of MMP-1, TIMP-1, and TNF-alpha in macrophages  cultured in suspension. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and herbimycin A)  partially or completely block induction of MMP-1, TIMP-1, and TNF-alpha by ions.  However, Co2+ and Cr3+ ions had no effect on the expression of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 in  macrophages cultured on the PC-polymer, suggesting that the attachment of U937  macrophages to the PC-polymer surfaces may modify their gene expression. In fact,  MMP-1 and TIMP-1 seem to be constitutively up regulated in this condition. Together,  these findings indicate that activation of MMP-1, TIMP-1, and TNF-alpha by Co2+ and  Cr3+ ions is regulated by tyrosine kinases and suggest that MMP-1 and TIMP-1 may  contribute to the periprosthetic weakening, implant loosening, and osteolysis around  implants.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gd49f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892b39k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gn700"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Marrow stromal cells for myocardial regeneration</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Luo, Jun, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Normal bone marrow is composed of hematopoietic and  non-hematopoietic cells.

We also examine the free energy landscape corresponding to the two  interacting hydrophobic spheres, and find a new intermediate state between the two  states of separate and non-interacting spheres and a weakly bound cluster. The  nature of this intermediate state changes depending on the size of the spherical  particles, and even disappears beyond a minimum critical radius. Our results are  relevant to the understanding of hydrophobic mediated interactions in coarse grained  models of protein folding and protein protein interactions which, to date, have only  accounted for hydrophobicity in an empirical way.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r29m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j38607502</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Fluid and Plasma</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jf267"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Perturbed B cell development in young B7.2 transgenic mice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhu, Lei, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The best-characterized costimulation system for naive T cell  activation is the interaction between CD28 and B7.1 or B7.2 ligands expressed on  antigen-presenting cells such as activated B cells. Unexpectedly, transgenic mice  with constitutive expression of B7.2 on B lymphocytes do not develop systemic  autoimmune diseases, but rather exhibit a reduction of the B cell compartment that  involves a defect in B cell maturation occurring very early in the ontogeny. In this  study, we show that the early B cell loss is accompanied by splenomegaly and  lymphoadenopathy that are due to a dramatic and transient increase in eosinophils.  This immune response leads to disturbed splenic architecture, and is mediated by  CD4+ T cells. In the absence of CD4+ T cells, early B cell maturation is  nevertheless perturbed. Thus, our findings indicate that both T cell subsets  participate in the elimination of B cells, but through different  mechanisms.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930bx68g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf267</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axs55mc534"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Indexing and matching articulated 3-D models using medial surfaces</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Juan, 1982-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We consider the use of medial surfaces to represent symmetries  of 3-D objects.

The five short stories  selected in Lumiere de nuit are linked by a central theme that can be described as a  venturesome and initiatory quest in the larger story of Reality. The glorification  of both the flesh and the spirit is recurrent and validated by the experience of  existence. A disturbed atmosphere is imprinted in the inmost being of the characters  who are compelled to undergo extremes experiences. The world that is given to them,  or that they depict, is divided, the rhythm of life is syncopated as in jazz  melodies. Their neurosis translates to the reader in short sentences that have the  effect of mental short circuits. Lumiere de nuit, Quadrille, La femme violette, La  tasse de the, and Le matin. Avec Beatrice surge at the frontier between Eros and  Thanatos, in the tensive state that binds love and hatred, imagination and reality,  uniqueness and doubleness. The Rift: The development of the characters in Andre Gide's Les  Faux-Monnayeurs (Critical Essay). Since it is both the witness and the subject of  the novel, the protagonist is the most reliable barometer of the reversals that  occur within. At the crossroad of times and literary trends, the gidian character,  in its fruitful singularity, is a constant source of amazement. Haunted by doubt and  fundamental interrogations, this protagonist exists only in imagining life, feels  only in imagining feelings, and talks only behind different masks, names and  destinies. All of which are the product of its imagination, of course. I intend to  analyse the construction of this character, as difficult to seize and define as is  Gide, in the author's most accomplished novel, Les Faux-Monnayeurs.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zb616.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537176b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gide, André, 1869-1951 -- Characters</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gide, André, 1869-1951.

Studies have shown that Parkin mutations account for far more cases of PD than all  other known genetic causes combined. Further, mutations have been identified even in  apparently sporadic cases, suggesting a broader role. There is now strong evidence  that Parkin functions in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP), the main system for  protein degradation in the cell. Ubiquitin (Ub), a small 76 amino acid protein, can be covalently  attached to other proteins. Proteins tagged with Ub are recognized and degraded by  the proteasome. Ubiquitination of proteins requires the concerted activity of three  enzymes: Ub-activating enzymes (E1), Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2), and Ub-ligases  (E3). E3 enzymes form the largest and most diverse family of enzymes and appear to  be involved in substrate recognition, thereby conferring specificity to  ubiquitination. Although recent studies have shown that Parkin functions as a  RING-type Ub E3 ligase, thus targeting potentially toxic proteins for degradation by  the proteasome, the function of its N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) remains  unclear. Currently, we have shown that parkin interacts directly with the proteasome  via its UBL domain and that the autosomal-recessive juvenile parkinsonism  (AR-JP)-associated UBL mutation R42P inhibits the interaction. Our findings suggest  that there may be a crucial link between parkin-dependent poly-ubiquitination of  target proteins and substrate-recognition by the proteasome and the pathogenesis of  an early-onset form of PD.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d705z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881m48h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bh76b"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Baristi and the one best way : organizational structures of employment in specialty coffee chains</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Raine, Emily Elizabeth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study identifies several points of convergence between  specialty cafe chain labourers and the organizations that employ them. Cafe chains  are premised upon their consistent reproduction of experience in numerous locations,  so organizations must put multiple systems of control into place to ensure their  homogeneity across the chain. Foremost among these are Fordism and Taylorism, two  systems that emphasize rational and efficient routines made up of highly segmented  and de-skilled tasks, so that each step in the productive process is done the  "one best way." Because employees' friendly service is part of the  experience that cafes attempt to reproduce across the chain, the social behaviours  of workers are subjected to training and management supervision. The workers, and  particularly those workers engaged in "barista" labour, are foregrounded  in the cafes' corporate literature, and organizational relations with employees are  often used by the companies in marketing and promotional materials. In particular,  barista employees are advertised as models of satisfied workers, which discursively  situates the companies that employ them as enlightened employers.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d0249.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bh76b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Coffeehouses -- Employees</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coffeehouses -- Management</dc:subject><dc:subject>Industrial management</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sg829"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>From the banal to the surreal : Poulenc, Jacob, and Le Bal masqué</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ehman, Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Francis Poulenc (1899-1963) demonstrates a remarkable affinity  for surrealist poetry in his numerous settings of leading modernist French poets  from the first half of the twentieth century. The poetry of Max Jacob (1876-1944), a  once unduly marginalized writer who is now regarded as an influential initiator of  surrealism, provided the inspiration for one of Poulenc's most significant works,  the chamber cantata Le Bal masque (1932). This thesis seeks to shed light on Poulenc's largely neglected  artistic interaction with Jacob by exploring musical counterparts to the poet's  unique surrealist aesthetic in Le Bal masque. Chapter one examines Poulenc's  artistic milieu surrounding the composition and first performance of Le Bal masque,  and reviews previous literature on Poulenc's involvement with avant-garde art and  literature. Chapter two focuses on Jacob himself and discusses key aspects of his  subversive poetic aesthetic. Chapter three outlines the fundamental characteristics  of surrealist art in general and reviews previous discussions of music and  surrealism. The final chapter explores surrealist influences in Le Bal masque while  concentrating on musical parallels to central features of Jacob's poetry and  surrealist art in general described in the preceding chapters.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mc54d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sg829</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Poulenc, Francis, 1899-1963.

The major difference between the two D  and L enantiomers is the spatial arrangement of atoms around a central carbon.  During normal chemical synthesis a mixture of L and D enantiomers are formed in  equally proportion (racemic mixture). Currently, the most common technique for  resolution of a racemic mixture is chromatography using chiral specific columns.  However, this method is limited in scale and is rather costly. This work studies the  possibility for the resolution of racemic glutamic acid by crystallization. Since  the solubility of the two enantiomers in water is the same, the separation is based  only on the rate of crystallization by using appropriate seed crystals. Experiments  are performed with a range of initial supersaturation ratios and seed  concentrations. The results show that an appreciable resolution of racemic glutamic  acid can be attained with the presence of L seeds in solution. At the highest seed  concentration (10 g/L of L glutamic acid), the initial supersaturation of 3.60, 2.50  and 1.60 yields 24.0%, 42.1% and 55.5% pure L glutamic acid crystals, respectively.  Therefore as the initial supersaturation is lowered the percent yield of pure L  glutamic acid increases.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v8381091.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tm49d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r074v704"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Numerical abilities in children with Fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome and typically developing children : a cross syndrome perspective</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rahman, Amira</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the present study, performance on a range of mathematical  reasoning and number processing tasks was assessed across two syndrome groups for  which numerical ability is under-researched: Fragile X syndrome and Down syndrome.

Recitations are recorded and  altered electronically through granulation and phase vocoding. Granular synthesis  cuts audio up into "short sound grains" and combines them into a sequence  of grains to form a longer final output. Phase vocoding uses Fourier analysis to  analyze audio and represent it as a series of amplitudes, phases, and frequencies.  The phase vocoder then uses this information to manipulate the audio without  altering the overall structure of the waveform. The processed sound part is closely linked to the music in the  orchestra. This is as a result of developing the pitch-material of the orchestra by  spectrally analyzing the processed audio. At certain times, the relationship between  the electronics part and the sound of the orchestra is blurred. To accomplish this,  the related formal sections of the orchestra are situated in a canonic relationship  with respect to the processed-sound part.

A 24-waveband (spectrum range 475 to 910 nm) multi-spectral  sensor was used to detect weeds in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean ( Glycine max (L.)  Merr.) in 1999. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Scheffe's test, were used  to determine which wavebands displayed significant differences in aerial spectral  data due to weed treatments. It was found that the radiance values were mainly  indicative of the contribution of weeds to the total vegetation cover in various  plots, rather than indicative of changes in radiance of the crops themselves, or of  differences in radiance between the weed populations and the crop  species. In the year 2000, a 72-waveband (spectrum range 407 to 949 nm)  hyperspectral sensor was used to detect weeds in corn gown at three nitrogen levels  (60, 120 and 250 kg N/ha). The weed treatments were: no control of weeds, control of  grasses, control of broadleaved weeds and control of all weeds. Imagery was acquired  at the early growth, tassel, and fully-mature stages of corn. Hyper-spectral  measurements were also taken with a 512-waveband field spectroradiometer (spectrum  range 270 to 1072 nm). Measurements were also carried out on crop physiological and  associated parameters. ANOVA and contrast analyses indicated that there were  significant (alpha = 0.05) differences in reflectance at certain wavebands, due to  weed control strategies and nitrogen application rates. Weed controls were best  distinguished at tassel stage. Nitrogen levels were most closely related to  reflectance, at 498 nm and 671 nm, in the aerial data set. Differences in other  wavebands, whether related to nitrogen or weeds, appeared to be dependent on the  growth stage. Better results were obtained from aerial than ground-based spectral  data. Regression models, representing crop biophysical parameters and  yield in terms of reflectance, at one or more wavebands, were developed using the  maximum r2 criterion. The coefficients of determination (r 2) were generally greater  than 0.7 when models were based on spectral data obtained at the tassel stage.  Models based on normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) were more reliable  at estimating the validation data sets than were the reflectance models. The  wavebands at 701 nm and 839 nm were the most prevalent in these  models. Decision trees, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and seven  other classifiers were used to classify spectral data into the weed and nitrogen  treatment categories. Success rates for validation data were lower than 68%  (mediocre) when training was done for all treatment categories, but good to  excellent (up to 99% success) for classification into levels of one or the other  treatment (i.e. weed or nitrogen) and also classification into pairs of levels  within one treatment. Not one classifier was determined best for all  situations. The results of the study suggested that spectral data acquired  from airborne platforms can provide vital information on weed presence and nitrogen  levels in cornfields, which might then be used effectively in the development of PCM  systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Prasher, S.
