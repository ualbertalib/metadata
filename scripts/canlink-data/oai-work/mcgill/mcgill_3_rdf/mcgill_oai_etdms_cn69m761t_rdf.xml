Such a ready synthesis of this phenolic glucoside suggested a very good ~stem for the study of the biosynthesis of simple plant glycosides. These compounds occur widely in plants and not very much was known about their biogenesis at the time when this study of the synthesis of phenolic glucosides in plant tissues was undertaken. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Towers, G.
