Each participant wrote a brief narrative describing the specific components of a stressful life event that elicited an attribution of threat. The identified components were assessed for level of ego functioning. In addition each participant was administered the Ways of Coping measure and the Washington University Sentence Completion Test. The results suggest that higher levels of ego functioning whether assessed by source of threat or by developmental task could be predicted by the choice of an analytical problem-oriented approach to stress management. Additionally the Event Appraisal measure has been presented as an instrument that introduces a predictive factor to level of ego development in a real-life situation. The results are discussed in light of the need to access the mechanisms that effect threat evaluations and the selection of the coping strategies that emerge as responses.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mager, George</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r297s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096917p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ego (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adjustment (Psychology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qd99f"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mass transfer limitations in sulfite pulping with anthraquinone</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Morin, Francois</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this project was to study systematically the NSSC-AQ pulping process in order to improve the penetration of anthraquinone and sodium sulfite in wood and to simulate the mass transfer and delignification processes. In a heterogeneous reaction system, such as wood pulping, two main factors control the overall reaction rate: liquor penetration and chemical diffusion. As a first step, some wood characteristics affecting liquor impregnation were evaluated: 1) fiber hydraulic radius, 2) air, steam and water content, 3) wood elasticity and compressibility. Secondly, impregnation and pulping experiments were performed while varying the pre-steaming, compression and soaking time. Finally, experimental profiles were compared to computer simulated results. The two most commonly used species by the pulp industry were chosen for this study: 1) black spruce sapwood and heartwood as well as 2) trembloid poplar sapwood. Impregnation of sulfite-AHQ liquor in wood blocks was simulated by a three-dimensional "Control Volume Finite Difference Method (CVFDM)". To de-couple the pressure and velocity fields, typical to convection-diffusion problems, a mass balance around individual control volume was performed using Poiseuille's capillary flow equation. The pulping kinetic differential equations were included into the CVFDM model to simulate a three-dimensional delignification pattern in the wood. In general, the progression of the anthraquinone impregnation was slow and non-uniform in comparison to sulfite which penetrated rapidly and uniformly during pulping. Furthermore, delignification uniformity was related to the initial chemical profiles observed after impregnation. This confirms the importance of chemical pre-treatment for high yield pulping in order to minimize uneven delignification for chips thicker than 3mm. Results showed that, in most cases, computer simulated profiles were similar to experimental anthraquinone and sulfite impregnation patterns.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kubes, Georges J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gf91n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qd99f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agriculture, Wood Technology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tr25d"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A philosophical examination of recent clinical and theoretical psychoanalysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Massicotte, William J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The philosophy of psychoanalysis is distinguished from psychoanalysis. An account of psychoanalysis is developed in progressively more detail. Recently published material is assessed, e.g., Bion's. Some older literature objects to an inaccurate account of psychoanalysis. This problem is avoided by treating the content and method of psychoanalysis as inseparable. Psychoanalytic propositions have unequal epistemic warrant. Support and objections are found in psychoanalysis and extra-clinically. Philosophical assessments are tied to the inherent features of both classical and contemporary psychoanalytic practice. Clinical psychoanalysis has interrelated procedures which continue to evolve. Both older and modern psychoanalysis have extra-clinical features and use concepts which have emerged from the clinical situation. Modern clinical practice is distinguished. The evolved knowledge of countertransference, transference, projective identification, and interpretation are among its features. The analyst's function in the dyad is stressed and illustrated with recent cases. The expanded clinical application to patients previously judged unanalyzable has produced modifications in theory. Theory is kept to a minimum and consists of flexibly linked concepts. They are a consistent development of recent practice. Some older concepts are inconsistent.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Walker, Jeremy</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sv74s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tr25d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychoanalysis -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Clinical psychology -- Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adz010s075"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Interactions among learning and memory systems : amygdala, dorsal striatum, and hippocampus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McDonald, Robert James</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This series of experiments used the multiple learning and memory systems hypothesis of the mammalian nervous system to investigate the possibility that the amygdala, dorsal striatum, and hippocampal systems might, in certain situations, interact to produce behavior in the normal animal.

Saposins activate lysosomal enzymes which break down membrane glycolipids. The objectives of the present investigation were to examine the developmental expression of SGP-1 and its targeting to lysosomes of Sertoli cells, to characterize the lysosomal form(s) of SGP-1, to examine SGP-1's delivery to Sertoli cells phagosomes and finally to assess the effects of androgens on SGP-1 expression. SGP-1 exists in two forms, a 65 kDa and a 70 kDa form. Labeling experiments demonstrated that the 65 kDa form of SGP-1 is synthesized first then post-translationally modified to the 70 kDa form. Western blot analysis of purified Sertoli cell lysosomes revealed a 65 kDa protein and 15 kDa proteins. The latter were isolated and shown to be saposins which were possibly derived from the 65 kDa precursor. Immunocytochemical studies using anti SGP-1 antibodies demonstrated that lysosomes deliver SGP-1 or/and saposins to phagosomes containing residual bodies. Thus, besides a secretory route of SGP-1 there appears to be a lysosomal pathway that may play a significant role in the hydrolysis of glycolipids of spermatid membranes present in phagocytosed residual bodies. Permeabilization of purified Sertoli Golgi fractions revealed that the 65 kDa protein is strongly associated with Golgi membrane. This association was resistant to low pH, resistant to excess free mannose 6-phosphate and independent of N-linked glycosylation, but sensitive to EDTA treatment. In contrast, the 70 kDa form of SGP-1 was released from permeabilized Golgi Fractions at pH 7.4 and 5.4 but retained at pH 6.4 indicating that it is a soluble protein with biochemical characteristics of a regulated secretory protein. In vivo treatment with tunicamycin resulted in an increase in the density of lysosomal SGP-1 suggesting that N-linked carbohydrate residues are not essential for the targeting of this protein to the lysosomes of Sertoli cells. In contrast, in the nonciliated cells of the efferent duct, tunicamycin treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the labeling density of lysosomal SGP-1 suggesting a sugar dependent lysosomal transport mechanism. Thus, this study demonstrates a unique lysosomal form of SGP-1 (65 kDa). The targeting of the 65 kDa form to the lysosomes and eventually to the phagosomes involves an early association with Golgi membranes independent of mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The trafficking of the 70 kDa form of SGP-1 to the tubular lumen may depend on its selective segregation into secretion granules within the Golgi apparatus of Sertoli cells. Finally, the expression of SGP-1 by Sertoli cells is modulated by androgens.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morales, Carlos</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fd73x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fz62s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720f86v"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Selective incorporation and genomic placement of tRNA in human immunodeficiency virus type 1</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jiang, Min, 1958-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1), the primer tRNA for reverse transcriptase is tRNA$ sp{ rm Lys3}.$ To facilitate the characterization of the viral tRNA$ sp{ rm Lys3},$ we first purified tRNA$ sp{ rm Lys3}$ from human placenta and fully sequenced it. We also developed a rapid method for preparing free and tightly associated tRNAs from viruses. 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE) of viral tRNA patterns showed that the number of tRNAs incorporated into HIV-1 varies from 4 to 25, depending on the cell type producing the virus. COS-7 cells transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA produce virions (HIV-1(COS)) which contain only 4 tRNAs, while chronically infected cell lines (H9 and U937) produce viruses which contain up to 25 tRNAs. Since HIV-1(COS) is infectious, we concluded that 4 tRNA species are sufficient for the viral life cycle, and greater tRNA complexities in viral particles produced in other cell types may represent spurious tRNA incorporation. 4 major tRNAs in HIV-1(COS) are two tRNA$ sp{ rm Lys1,2},$ one tRNA$ sp{ rm Lys3},$ and one tRNA$ sp{ rm Ile},$ identified through RNA sequencing. tRNA$ sp{ rm Lys}$ represents approximately 70% of the viral tRNA.

Although various components of the reproductive axis contribute to altered gonadotropin secretion, neuroendocrine dysfunction is believed to play an important role in the age-related loss of estrous cyclicity in the rodent. Our studies examining the pituitary responsiveness to GnRH with age revealed that the pituitaries of C57BL/6J mice appear to be capable of sustaining normal endocrine function under appropriate stimulus even in old females. Thus we hypothesized that changes at the level of the hypothalamus may be responsible for the alteration in gonadotropin secretion. Our studies evaluating GnRH neuronal function demonstrated that there is no change in the capacity of GnRH neurons to release GnRH with age although the presence of the ovary appears to modulate the GnRH release. Neuroanatomical and pharmacological studies suggest that an age-related decline in the opiatergic influence is responsible, at least in part, for the altered GnRH release. Posttranslational processing of the opiate peptide, $ beta$-endorphin ($ beta$-endo) from its precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and its further posttranslational modification determine the amount of opiate active and antagonist forms ultimately released at the synapse. We hypothesized that age-related alterations in the content of opiate active and antagonist forms of $ beta$-endo occur which contribute to the decline in opiatergic influences on reproductive function. Our data demonstrated that there is a significant increase in the opiate receptor inactive and antagonist forms of $ beta$-endo in middle aged but not in young or old mice. An important mechanism for the differential processing of $ beta$-endo in the anterior and intermediate lobes of pituitary in adult rodents and in the anterior lobe in neonates appears to lie in the relative levels of expression</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Miller, Marilyn M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p014q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73px94n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mk85t"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of agronomic, genetic and environmental influences on oat (avena sativa L.) grain quality</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Humphreys, David Gavin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Agronomic, genetic and environmental influences on oat grain quality were investigated. Nitrogen application at the boot stage of crop development did not generally affect physical characteristics of oat grain. Groat protein content increased with the application of nitrogen at the boot stage of crop development but oil content tended to decrease while $ beta$-glucan content was generally not affected. Delayed seeding usually reduced oat grain quality and usually increased protein and $ beta$-glucan contents. Heritability of $ beta$-glucan content, groat percentage and rust resistance were all low; hence, breeding to improve these traits may be difficult. Results of experiments on the inheritance of $ beta$-glucan were not conclusive but it appears that $ beta$-glucan content is under the influence of the endosperm genome. Genotype by environment interactions were significant for grain yield and for protein, oil and $ beta$-glucan contents. The cultivars Ultima and Sylva were superior in mean grain yield across environments compared to other cultivars. The cultivars Laurent and Nova were superior for mean protein content across environments and the cultivar Marion QC was superior for mean oil and $ beta$-glucan contents.

The cholinergic markers evaluated included choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, the synthesizing enzyme of acetylcholine) activity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE, the enzyme which degrades acetylcholine) staining, ($ sp3$H) hemicholinium-3 (HC3, marker of the high-affinity choline uptake system) and ($ sp3$H) AH5183/vesamicol (marker of the acetylcholine vesicular transporter) binding sites. Muscarinic receptors were investigated with ($ sp3$H) QNB (total population of muscarinic sites), ($ sp3$H) 4-DAMP (putative M$ sb1$/M$ sb3$ sites), ($ sp3$H) pirenzepine (putative M$ sb1$ subtype), ($ sp3$H) acetylcholine, ($ sp3$H) AF-DX 116 and ($ sp3$H) AF-DX 384 (putative M$ sb2$ subtype), while ($ sp3$H) N-methylcarbamylcholine and ($ sp3$H) cytisine were used for the nicotinic receptors. These markers were studied (a) in human neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, (b) in entorhinal cortex lesioned rats, a model of plasticity possibly related to the sprouting of the septohippocampal cholinergic pathway, (c) in the aged memory-impaired and memory-unimpaired rats, and finally (d) during the development and maturation of the rat brain from embryogenesis to adulthood. These markers of the cholinergic synapse are differentially affected depending upon the model studied. In addition, pre- and postsynaptic cholinergic markers are not necessarily altered similarly. For example, muscarinic M$ sb2$ and nicotinic sites decreased in parallel with ChAT activity in the neocortex and hippocampal formation of human brain patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases. However, in the aged memory-impaired rats, ChAT activity and nicotinic sites are unaltered while muscarinic M$ sb2$ sites are significantly increased in cortical areas. Moreover, although AChE staining is increased in the hippocampal formation following lesions of the entorhinal cortex, nicotinic binding sites are decreased and other cholinergic markers are unaffected. Finally, during rat brain development, presynaptic markers such as the acetylcholine vesicular transport and nicotinic sites are expressed prenatally, while others like ($ sp3$H) HC3 and muscarinic M$ sb2$ sites appear only postnatally. Muscarinic M$ sb1$ sites are in low amounts prenatally, increasing gradually during postnatal maturation. The distinct ontogenic profile of each cholinergic marker suggests specific roles for the various components of the cholinergic synapse throughout brain development. Taken together, these results provide information on the differential adaptation, response and possible roles of the various components of the cholinergic synapse in models of neuronal plasticity. For example, nicotinic receptors may play an important role in the development, sprouting and maintenance of a normal cholinergic innervation, while muscarinic M$ sb2$ receptors might contribute to the fine regulation of ACh release, which, if impaired, could produce detrimental effects on cognitive functions such as those seen in the aged memory-impaired rats.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gauthier, Serge</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Quirion, Remi</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zg47n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm867</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A76537299v"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Heat transfer and kinetic studies of particulates under aseptic processing conditions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Awuah, George Brobbey</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Fluid-to-particle heat transfer coefficients (h$ rm sb{fp}$) associated with food and model particles under simulated aseptic processing conditions were experimentally evaluated, and verified using measured inactivation kinetic parameters of the enzyme trypsin. Convective heat transfer coefficients were determined initially using two methods: a rate method based on evaluated heating/cooling rate indices (f$ rm sb c$/f$ rm sb h$) and a ratio method based on the ratio of temperature difference between the medium and particle locations. Carrot and potato tissue in the form of finite cylinders of different lengths (0.02-0.04 m) and diameters (0.016-0.023 m) were used for evaluating h$ rm sb{fp}$ associated with aqueous CMC solutions (0-1.0% w/w) at temperatures ranging from 50 to 80$ sp circ$C and at relatively low fluid flow (0.2 to $0.7 times10 sp{-3}$ m/s) conditions. Carrots generally gave higher h$ rm sb{fp}$ values (100-550 W/m$ sp2$C) compared to potatoes (80-450 W/m$ sp2$C). Laminar flow natural convection dominated the flow regime. Hence, the Nusselt number was modeled as a function of Rayleigh's number which resulted in coefficients of determination (R$ sp2$) greater than 0.80. A pilot scale holding tube simulator was designed and fabricated for routine/rapid gathering of heat penetration data which may be experienced in high temperature short time processing conditions. Using the simulator under conditions comparable to industrial applications, and a full factorial experimental design, h$ rm sb{fp}$ values were estimated using finite cylinders of Teflon and potato tissue of different sizes (length: 0.020-0.0254 m; diameter: 0.0159-0.0254 m), and spherical Teflon particles (diameter 0.0191 m) in food grade CMC solutions (0-1.0% w/w). Operating temperatures were 90, 100 and 110$ sp circ$C, and flow rate was varied from 1.0-$1.9 rm times10 sp{-4} m sp3$/s. Average h$ rm sb{fp}$ values ranged from 56 to 966 W/m$ sp2$C depending on size, shape, fluid concentration, particle orientation, and tube diameter. Differences caused by different particle materials were accounted for by introducing a thermal diffusivity ratio in developed dimensionless correlations for both mixed and forced convective heat transfer to spherical and finite cylindrical particles under simulated aseptic processing conditions. Thermal inactivation of trypsin (bovine pancreas type III) in low and high pH media was studied at temperatures ranging from 90-130$ sp circ$C. Comparative studies of its kinetic data with other bioindicators indicated the enzyme to be suitable for HTST verification/validation purposes. Further studies revealed, probably depending on pH, that trypsin was more susceptible to thermal inactivation at temperatures around 70$ sp circ$C.

We propose a model that jointly determines production and inventory decisions so that the total cost of holding inventory and overtime, at the two plants is minimized. Our model captures the interaction between the two plants and is preferable to the uncoordinated or the sequential approach which ignores this interaction. We consider the case with limited capacity and explicitly model setup times. Strategies based on Lagrangian relaxation and Lagrangian decomposition methodologies are proposed to solve the model. Two main findings emerge from this research. First, our results indicate that coordination could lead to improved cost performance and enhanced profits for firms. Two parameters, the setup time to processing time ratio and the capacity utilization at the two plants played a significant role in determining the cost improvements. Managerial implications relating to implementation of the coordinated model are discussed. The second important finding of this research is that Lagrangian decomposition consistently outperforms Lagrangian relaxation in terms of achieving better deviation from the optimal solution, for this problem. A Linear Programming based technique for further enhancing the convergence between the upper and lower bounds is presented. In the quest for improved performance, multi-plant coordination represents an important strategy for firms. The contribution of the current research is in modelling some of the salient issues of this problem and exploring promising methodological directions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Loulou, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sf579.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000208m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Production planning -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Production control -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb397b18r"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fragonard and the garden setting : the Progress of love at Louveciennes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Borys, Stephen Donald</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Fragonard's Progress of Love is among the most impressive decorative commissions of the eighteenth century, and this despite its sudden cancellation by Madame du Barry. Called upon to produce a series of panels for her pavillon at Louveciennes (designed by Claude-Nicolas Ledoux), Fragonard succeeded in uniting the gardens of the Villa d'Este with the landscape at Louveciennes. Recapturing the essence of villeggiatura and the vistas first experienced during his stay in Tivoli, Fragonard initiated an interplay of the real and painted setting. The Progress of Love became an escape, enticing Du Barry and her lover with its sensuous verdure. But reality destroyed all illusion, and Fragonard's fortune went the way of Du Barry's romance. Forced to choose between the tell-tale Progress of Love and an innocuous though fashionable replacement by Joseph-Marie Vien, Du Barry opted for propriety in her maison de plaisance. Years before, when spurned by Louis XV, Madame de Pompadour resorted to the iconography of friendship. Du Barry, facing a more serious predicament, drew upon the same iconography. However, even with l'amour et l'amitie ensconced in the last panel of the Progress of Love, fate ultimately displaced Fragonard's lovers at Louveciennes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glen, Thomas</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m871r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397b18r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fragonard, Jean-Honoré, 1732-1806 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rk103"><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The relevance of anthropology in medical education : a Mexican case study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Murray, William Breen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The growth of medical anthropology as a distinct sub-discipline has opened up many new roles for anthropologists within the medical field, and identified an ever wider range of mutual interests. In this study the anthropologists role as a teacher in the basic medical curriculum is examined in order to determine whether "broad and general relevance" exists between the two fields. Field data is analyzed from 2 1/2 years active participation teaching at a newly founded medical school in the North Mexican industrial of Monterrey, Nuevo Leon. Information on institutions history and social structures, student values and attitudes toward the professional medical milieu, and responses to specific teaching material is discussed as components of the decision making process which led to role definition. The differences between classroom and field teaching of anthropology were explored in connection with an urban vaccination campaign and an experimental field course in a bi-ethnic rural community of the sierra tarahumara (Chihuahua). The medical school is seen as a reflection of the community and professional context which surrounds it, and the need to make anthropological teaching congruent to its particular needs and circumstances is stressed. The study concludes that general relevance has not yet been achieved due to the lack of a definable clinical role for the anthropologist, and unresolved conflicts between the biological and anthropological models of man.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bd60b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rk103</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anthropology -- Study and teaching (Higher) -- Mexico</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical education -- Mexico</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0c483m10r"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dissolution of high melting point additions in liquid steel</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Argyropoulos, Stavros A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The kinetics of dissolution of titanium and vanadium in liquid steel has been studied. Two periods were distinguished: the steel shell period and the free dissolution period. In the case of titanium, it is shown that the customary frozen shell of steel encases the cylinder following its initial immersion. Premature internal dissolution then begins as a result of liquid eutectic of Fe(,0.3) Ti(,0.7) composition forming at the inner steel shell boundary. This phenomenon triggers an exothermic dissolution and erosion of the inner steel shell. The net result is considerable shortened shell melting times. During the free dissolution period, the temperature of the titanium dissolving at the interface increases and the dissolution process becomes self-accelerating. During the steel shell period with pure vanadium and ferrovanadium alloys, no reaction was observed between the steel shell and vanadium. For low grade ferrovanadium alloys, the dissolution proceeds via a heat transfer mechanism. On the other hand, for high grades, ferrovanadium mass transfer mechanisms dominate. A simplified mathematical model of the process has been developed to describe the coupled heat and mass transfer phenomena involved in the various systems studied.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k35696326.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483m10r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vanadium steel</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel alloys</dc:subject><dc:subject>Titanium steel</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zw413"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Systematic studies in the balsaminaceae</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zinovʹeva-Stahevitch, Alina E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Plant collections, field and herbarium studies were used to evaluate classifications of Impatiens. Accepted interpretations of the perianth are questioned; and a program of developmental studies on several categories of inflorescences proposed. The fruit has been incorrectly described. It is of two types, differing in manner of dehiscence. Chromosome numbers are an inadequate taxonomic character because of parallel cytoevolution. Karyotypes were prepared, but it was found that homologues were not distinguishable. A technique for Hy-banding was developed, and homologues in plants of I. leschenaultii Wall. identified. It is proposed that Hy-banding can identify marker chromosomes which will be a more efficient character than complete karyotypes. The classifications of Impatiens are discussed, and it is concluded that one founded on flower-pollinator relationships is the best, although convergence is a problem. The genera of the Balsaminaceae are reviewed. It is concluded that these show only slight deviations from Impatiens, and are rejected.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429c225.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zw413</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Balsaminaceae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Impatiens</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plants -- Classification</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv9354924"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Monetary limitations of liability in international private air law</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tobolewski, Aleksander</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The existing monetary limitations of liability in international private air law are reviewed and compared with limits in other branches of transport law. The reasons submitted to justify monetary limitations of liability in air law are summarized and criticised. A comparison of the level of limits with statistics and the social requirement to provide full recovery of damages lead to the conclusion that the limits are inadequate and unrealistically low. The problem of the unit of account in which limits are expressed (gold, SDR) and the idea of freezing the amount of damages recoverable in conventions without self-regulatory clauses are discussed from the perspective of inflation and the current economic situation. Deficiencies in the existing legal solutions in air law are exposed and criticised. In conclusion, a new system of compensation to victims of air crashes breaking away from the existing monetary limitations of liability in air law and based on prevailing aviation insurance market practices is proposed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m135h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv9354924</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anp193b91d"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Russian and Slavic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The autobiographical act in the exile narratives of Marek Hłasko and Henry Miller</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gasyna, George</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is an investigation of the autobiographical narratives of two authors, the Pole Marek Hlasko, and the American Henry Miller. Though they lived in different times and places Miller and Hlasko, share some remarkable features with respect to temperament, philosophies of writing, and modes of narrative output. In the chapters that follow I will examine both the biographical and the textual points of contact between these two men, concentrating on the problem of self-inscription in the autobiographical novels, and on the games played with identity that both men engaged in throughout their artistic careers, especially during their periods of exile. The first section provides a recapitulation of relevant biographical data together with a summary of the social and historical contexts as these affect the personal ideology of each writer. I begin with an expose of some parallels in the biographies and the autobiographical narratives of the two men, and subsequently turn to a summary of the broader polemics of authorial representation in works written in the first person. Here the traditional notion of equating the author of an autobiographical novel with its subject will be rejected in favour of examining the network of relationships that exist among the writer, the writer's cultural "persona", and the textual voice. Following this theoretical framework, I explore each author's personal script of emigration, his sense of self-understanding and self-positioning in the world, and the strategies of self-construction and self-invention undertaken both in the narratives and in the public arena. My analysis of each author's most representative autobiographical works of the exile period will finally suggest the conclusion that while the autobiographical impulse supplied the form for virtually all of Hlasko's and Miller's writing, it is the experience of exile that furnished the content for successful narrative self-revelation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roll, Serafima</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nd058.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193b91d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Miller, Henry, 1891-1980 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hłasko, Marek -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exiles in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apr76f547x"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of mindset on relationship illusions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gagné, Faby</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigated Gollwitzer's mindset theory in the context of romantic relationships. One-hundred and sixty-eight students involved in a dating relationship were asked either to deliberate about or to think of implementing a goal not related to their relationship (e.g., finding a summer job) or a goal related to their relationship (e.g., moving in with their romantic partner). All participants subsequently completed assessments of current affect, perceptions of partner and of optimism for the future of the relationship. In line with Taylor and Gollwitzer (1995), thinking about implementing a decided goal not related to the relationship was found to increase positive affect and relationship illusions compared to non-relationship goal deliberation. In contrast, among those in the relationship mindset conditions, deliberation was found to elicit greater relationship illusions compared to goal implementation. These results help to delineate between effects of relationship specific and non relationship specific mindsets on relationship appraisals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lydon, John E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53wx813.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f547x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Set (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Man-woman relationships</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vj67s"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La musique, miroir de l'amour dans Un amour de Swann, suivi de, Nocturne</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gagnon, Isabelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>1.

Indeed, in his texts, Ferron, significantly, returns to his roots---literary and political---to understand, explain, and criticize his nation which at the time was preparing for the Quiet Revolution. Assuredly, Contes du pays incerain (1962) and Contes anglais (1964) are the two works in which are found the greatest number of references to great texts of the Western literary tradition. Ferron transposes classical and traditional Culture into his own and adapts many myths, biblical texts, and folk tales. Moreover, these two collections of tales, united in 1968 under the title Contes, but still independent of each other, allow one to understand, by their titles alone, that the author describes through them his vision of the nation, a bipolar Quebec where uncertainty is opposed to Englishness. From there it is only a short step to linking the present to the past: defining uncertainty and Englishness---signs of the collections' identity, signs, ultimately, of Ferron's vision of the nation---by looking into the processes of reactualization of Ferron's literary roots. Using an approach based on John J. White's method, this thesis proposes a mythocritical reading of Ferron's Contes. This approach allows one to retrace the path the author followed to understand his society. To understand Ferron's vision of the nation developed throughout his texts, one has to go back to the author's literary sources; to know to what extent uncertainty and Englishness are opposed, one has to analyse how each collection of tales transforms and gives new meaning to the myths and legends that are the foundation of the Western culture.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boucher, Jean-Pierre</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956h856.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182n136</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ferron, Jacques -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p663c"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Etude sur la rhétorique des premièrs écrits de Louis-Ferdinand Céline (1924-1944)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Choinière, Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Since Celine's death, the pamphlets he wrote at the beginning of World War II always presented great difficulties for those who studied him. But in the last few years, for various reasons the pamphlets have stirred up researcher's interest. Following this movement, this thesis is an attempt to integrate these pamphlets to the prose of the author of Journey to the End of the Night in a general pattern of analysis. In order to do this analysis, is developed an hermeneutic model of analysis which divides Celine's work into a poetical investigation and a polemic pursuit that demonstrate that these two genres use the same rhetorical strategies. Part I of this thesis investigates the distinct rhetoric used by Celine in mixing poetry and polemic. Part II examines the poetic investigation and the polemic pursuit separately, Celine having separated these two genres after Journey to the End of the Night. Without eliminating the differences between poetry and polemic, this thesis aims at demonstrating the continuity and coherence of Celine's work which is particularly well suited for putting an hermeneutic model of analysis to the test because it is a work that is torn more than any other between the ravishing and the horrific, between the beautiful and the terrifying. And that is where in this profound humanity Celine's work is so rich in interpretation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angenot, Marc</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010s09q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p663c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Céline, Louis-Ferdinand, 1894-1961 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Céline, Louis-Ferdinand, 1894-1961.

In Austen's novels, the epistolary metaphor of the passport links letter reading, the heroine's education process, and views of domestic space. Epistolary issues aligned with domestic spaces indicate the metaphorical relationship between the structural dialectic of closed and open and the epistolary paradox of writing to dissemble character and reading to reveal character. Letter writing and reading represent the spatial order within prescribed views and tours of houses and grounds. The heroine's critical letter reading allows her to distinguish between character types presented through different domestic contents, and the letter's interpretive authority finalizes her social education by serving as a passport figuratively transferring her between natal and martial households.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>O'Toole, Tess</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v838248x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sj19z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Austen, Jane, 1775-1817 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
