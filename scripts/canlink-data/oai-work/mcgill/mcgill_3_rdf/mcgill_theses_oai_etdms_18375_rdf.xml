In April, 1904, Britain signed an agreement with France, clearing up many problems that had stood in the way of better relations between the two countries, and she hoped to conclude a similar agreement with Russia.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fieldhouse, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wr604.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k184v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dk35p"><ual:graduationDate>1956</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Permeability of cerebral blood vessels to protein molecules in convulsive seizures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rozdilsky, Bohdan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Histological examination of the brains of experimental animals subjected to convulsive seizures shows an evidence of tissue damage which could be the result, to some extent, of increased vascular permeability.

Previous work on entrance region heat transfer by J. T. Rogers showed that for a given Reynolds number, higher heat transfer coefficients are obtained with increasing bulk temperatures. Present work confirma Rogers' findings and shows that a temperature correction factor is necessary to account for this increase in the value of heat transfer coefficients with increasing temperatures.
