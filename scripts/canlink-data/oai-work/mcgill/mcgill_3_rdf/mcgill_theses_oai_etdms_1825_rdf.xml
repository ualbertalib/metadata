From a gel filtration column, GSK3beta and tau co-eluted in the fractions corresponding to ~300 kD size molecules. Since the molecular sizes of both GSK3beta and tau are in the range of 45--60 kD, these data indicated that GSK3beta and tau exist as parts of a macromolecular complex in the brain extract. In vivo association of GSK3beta and tau was confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation of GSK3beta with tau from bovine brain lysate. In vitro binding experiments showed that GSK3beta and tau bind to each other with high affinity. However, GSK3beta did not bind to phosphorylated tau. These data suggest that GSK3beta binds to tau directly within the macromolecular complex and phosphorylation of tau regulates tau-GSK3beta interaction. In a microtubule binding assay, His6-GSK3beta bound to microtubules directly and the presence of tau in this assay showed no effect on the association of GSK3beta with microtubules. These result suggest that GSK3beta associates with microtubules in a tau-independent manner.

Toxaphene technical mixture (Tox) applied as a pesticide consists of over 800 congeners. Through processes of environmental degradation, selected metabolism, and bioaccumulation, 2 congeners are prominent in humans; 2-exo,3-endo,5-exo,6-endo,8,8,10,10-octachlorobornane (T2) and 2-exo,3-endo,5-exo,6-endo,8,8,9,10,10-nonachlorocamphene (T12). The MCF7-E3 human breast cancer cell model was used to screen for the estrogenic activities of Tox, T2, and T12. A concentration of 10muM was required by all 3 compounds to elicit an estrogenic response (a proliferative effect (PE) upon the cells). The congeners however, showed slightly different PEs from Tox. Both T2 and T12 had a lower PE than Tox, and T2 had a higher PE than T12. Results from binary combination studies showed that effects of Tox, T2, and T12 were additive. Tox, T2, and T12 had no significant effects on estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor levels. It was shown that the environmental prevalent congeners had lower estrogenic activities than Tox and there is no synergistic effect.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, Laurie</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870z096.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xb68t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Estrogen</dc:subject><dc:subject>Toxaphene</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w955z"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>5-oxo-ETE and its effect on eosinophil recruitment in the Brown Norway rat lung</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stamatiou, Panagiota</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The 5-lipoxygenase product 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) is a potent eosinophil chemoattractant in vitro. To determine whether it is active in vivo, 5-oxo-ETE was administered intratracheally to BN rats and pulmonary eosinophils were immunostained with an antibody to major basic protein. 5-Oxo-ETE induced a dramatic increase in eosinophils, which reached maximal levels (5 times control) between 15 and 24 h following administration, and thereafter declined. LTB4 had a similar effect to 5-oxo-ETE but appeared to be somewhat less effective. In contrast, LTD4 and LTE4 were inactive. 5-Oxo-ETE-induced eosinophilia was inhibited by 75% following pretreatment of the animals with antibodies to integrins VLA-4 or LFA-1, but was not significantly inhibited by an antibody to Mac-1, nor after pretreatment with receptor antagonists to LTB4 (LY255283) or PAF (WEB 2170). These observations raise the possibility that 5-oxo-ETE may be an important physiological mediator in inflammatory diseases characterized with eosinophil recruitment, such as asthma.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Martin, J.

The literature indicates that bacteria, in the small intestine, could modify circulating cholesterol levels through their effects on bile acid excretion. As a result, cholesterol is mobilized for de novo bile synthesis. Furthermore, bacterial fermentation in the small intestine produces short chain fatty acids which affect cholesterol production by the liver. A cross-over, placebo-controlled study was thus conducted on 13 hypercholesterolemic men to establish the effect of kefir, a fermented milk, on cholesterol levels. Subjects consumed kefir or milk for periods of four weeks separated by a four-week washout period. There was no effect on plasma total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triacylglyceride levels upon treatment with kefir. Milk significantly decreased myristic acid (p &lt; 0.01) and palmitoleic acid (p &lt; 0.05) concentrations. Fractional synthesis rate of cholesterol was significantly greater after kefir supplementation than after milk supplementation (0.057 vs 0.042g/day). The effect seen on fractional synthesis rate of cholesterol may be the result of a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (p &lt; 0.05) during milk supplementation. However, it was concluded that the bacterial content of kefir may have been too low to produce any significant effect on blood lipid parameters.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jones, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537317k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644t67w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hypercholesteremia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kefir</dc:subject><dc:subject>Blood lipids</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613n0811"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pattern formation in the mammalian striatum: the development of the thalamostriatal projection in the rodent</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Srivastava, Vinit</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Excitatory amino acids (EAAs) may play a role in sculpting mosaic patterns within the brain. Determining the role of EAA projection systems in sculpting the chemically heterogeneous striatal patch-matrix compartments requires knowledge concerning the spatiotemporal development of afferent EAA systems. EAA systems that afferent the striatum include amongst others, the thalamostriatal projection. The lipophilic tracer. DiI, is used for in vitro assessment of the growth of the thalamostriatal projection in prenatal rats whereas in a series of in vivo postnatal tract-tracing experiments, stereotactic injections of the tracer biocytin are made into the parafascicular (Pf) thalamic nucleus. This thesis has demonstrated that there are sparse thalamostriatal afferents detected at embryonic day 19 and significant fiber density by postnatal day 0. The projection afferents predominantly innervate the matrix as early as postnatal day 1. Specific tropic mechanisms must therefore account for the final pattern of thalamic afferents to the striatum.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sadikot, Abbas</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483m243.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n0811</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tp061"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Metallogeny of epithermal gold and base metal veins of the southern Dawson Range, Yukon</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Smuk, Katherine A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Epithermal veins of the southern Dawson Range, Yukon, are hosted by a wide range of lithologies, ranging from Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks to Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks. Both the 105 Ma calc-alkaline Mount Nansen volcanic group and the 70 Ma shoshonitic Carmacks volcanic group also host small Au-Cu(+/-Mo) porphyry deposits. Although the structurally-controlled mineralized veins are spatially associated with Mount Nansen felsic dykes, K/Ar dates for sericitically and argillically altered dykes proximal to mineralization are --70 Ma, indicating thermal resetting by a Carmacks-age hydrothermal event. These altered dykes are depleted in Na, Pb, Zn, and Cu, but enriched in As and Sb, relative to unaltered dykes. The base metal-rich epithermal veins are transitional between classic low and high sulphidation deposit types. They were deposited by a Na +-dominated fluid with an average salinity of ~6 wt.% NaCl equiv., a temperature of --300°C, a high S2-- (0.20 m) concentration, and significant CO2 (~1 mol.%). The isotopic composition of inclusion fluids (delta18O = ~--10‰; deltaD = ~--95‰) indicate that the hydrothermal fluid was dominantly meteoric, but a magmatic fluid contribution is suggested by the heavy delta18O, delta34S values close to zero, and the high temperatures, salinities, SigmaS, and CO2. The isotopic compositions of Pb in galena correlate well with initial whole rock values for Carmacks volcanic rocks, suggesting that much of the Pb, and other base metals, were leached from the Carmacks volcanics. As and Sb, and by inference Au, are not locally derived. The log fO2 and pH conditions of mineralization were between --34 and --36, and 3--5, respectively. The deposition of base metal sulphides appears to have been caused by an increase in pH due to the consumption of H+ during the alteration of the host rocks. The decrease in SigmaS caused by sulphide precipitation destabilized Au(HS)2-- complexes, precipitating native gold. The mineralization was caused by the hydrothermal circulation of acidic, meteoric water, probably driven by Carmacks magmatism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams-Jones, A.

The objectives were to determine if there was a relationship between person factors and uncertainty and between uncertainty and psychological responses. Data included demographic and physical status, locus of control, uncertainty and stress, depression, psychological distress, and perceived control. The overall level of uncertainty was low, but it was positively associated with recurrence, depression, and illness worry.

The epiphallus and the apical parts of the aedeagus were found to be the most important taxonomic characters. The genera Aptenopedes and Buckellacris were highly divergent from the rest of the melanoplines, while the close relationship between Appalachia, Dendrotettix and Podisma was confirmed by genital characters. Internal male genitalic characters did not provide significant support for many currently recognized tribes and subtribes, suggesting that there is a great need for reclassification in the subfamily.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hsiung, C.

The PCC requires no anatomy or point-pair identification, is robust when encountering changes in scaling and shifts in image amplitudes and requires no priori knowledge of the anatomy, which makes it an ideal candidate for portal-to-DRR image registration. Features for matching are selected from orthogonal portal images and compared to the corresponding megavoltage DRR. The position of the highest correlation value is then converted into beam-to-patient geometry and compared with the actual patient setup. By continuously generating DRRs, the system is capable of verifying translation errors, in-plane rotation and out-of-plane rotation errors. The mean accuracy of translation and rotation registrations tests were 0.58 mm and 0.79° respectively for DRR-to-DRR matching, and 1.22 mm and 1.31° respectively for portal-to-DRR matching.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fallone, B.

The various methods in use to compensate for Rs are explored. A novel method of Rs compensation is described which overcomes the stability limitations of conventional designs. To illustrate the advantages of this new Rs compensation, a voltage clamp amplifier implementing this Rs compensation is used to record rapid Na+ current in rat Superior Cervical Ganglia (SCG) neurons and human ventricular myocytes which could not be resolved with conventional equipment. Data obtained using partial Rs compensation is compared to that obtained with full Rs compensation using the new voltage clamp amplifier.

Comparative learning tests, however, may be influenced by intervening variables like neophobia and tameness: tests are always run on captive animals by human experimenters using novel stimuli. This thesis compares pigeons to territorial and group-feeding zenaida doves on their response to novel stimuli in the field and in captivity, in the presence or absence of humans. In single cages, tameness and neophobia co-vary with learning: pigeons are more rapid than doves at learning, at interacting with a novel apparatus and at feeding in the absence of the human; territorial zenaida doves are slower than group-feeding doves on all three tests. Multiple regressions show that neophobia and tameness explain an important part of the variance in learning. These results are confirmed by a re-analysis of data previously obtained on finches (Whittle, 1996), where neophobia predicts individual learning which in turn predicts social learning. In the field, however, neophobia has opposite effects: territorial zenaida doves now show the smallest effect of novel stimuli on feeding latency. Experiments that test evolutionary predictions about learning using captive animals are thus open to questions of internal and external validity: when we measure comparative performance on a captive learning test, is it really learning we are measuring and does it mirror, as it should, adjustment to environmental novelty in the field?</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lefebvre, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676x87w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55md95v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zenaida aurita -- Food</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition (Biology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Learning</dc:subject><dc:subject>Columba livia -- Food</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zenaida aurita -- Behavior</dc:subject><dc:subject>Columba livia -- Behavior</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arx913r941"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The gesture-speech relationship in children who stutter</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Scott, Lori D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigated the gesture-speech relationship in pre-adolescent children who stutter in comparison to fluent controls. Significant differences were found in the speech and gesture characteristics of the narratives of the two groups on a cartoon retelling task. The children who stuttered produced less complex spoken language, fewer cartoon details. They produced fewer gestures per utterance spoken, and their gestures were less complex in form, structure and meaning. They accompanied less of their spoken narratives with gesture suggesting that gesture is produced with spoken language and does not compensate for disruptions of speech. As well, representational gestures produced in time with disfluent speech were disrupted or frozen at the precise moment of disfluency indicating that gesture and speech are closely tied in production as a single integrated system.

The original data set contained 331,105 lifetime records from the Programme d'Analyse des Troupeaux Laitiers du Quebec, from January 1980 to March 1995. Only 191,167 records (or cows) had type information. Mixed Weibull models were fitted to analyse the data; the probability of being culled (hazard) was defined as a product of a baseline Weibull hazard function and explanatory variables. The heritability estimates for Functional Herd Life were 0.07 in the log scale and 0.15 in the original scale. Sire Estimated Transmitting Ability for FHL, expressed as relative culling rate, ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 for all models. Solutions for fixed effects (all significant) indicated a higher probability of being culled for primiparous cows calving at older ages, for cows producing below herd average, for first lactation cows in the first and last stage of lactation and for older cows at the end of lactation. The risk of being culled did not change for cows in herds decreasing or increasing in size. Cows classified with a high score for Final Score were less likely to be culled; Final Score seems to be an important selection criteria among Quebec producers. Feet and Legs, Rump and Mammary System are traits that producers consider in their culling policies; cows classified with a high score had more chance of surviving. Among the linear type traits, the 5 traits with the highest impact on productive life, were Rear Attachment Height, Fore Attachment, Bone Quality, Stature and Fore Teat Placement; Quebec producers seem to consider these traits when they make their culling decisions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Monardes, Humberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623j106x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r7678</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Holstein-Friesian cattle -- Québec (Province) -- Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956j046"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Physiological and psychosocial determinants of health-care service utilisation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Schlecht, Nicolas F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Introduction. There is evidence that psychosocial factors and social support are determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health-care services use in patients with chronic diseases. Objective . To evaluate what physiological, psychosocial or HRQoL factors are predictors of health-care services use in COPD. Methods. A combination retrospective/prospective hospital-based cohort study was designed. 90 patients with stable COPD were selected from an out-patient registry at the Montreal Chest Institute. Patient evaluation included an interview with two disease specific HRQoL questionnaires: St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire; and five psychosocial questionnaires: Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, State/Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Index, NEO Five Factor Personality Inventory, and Interpersonal Relationships Inventory. Physiological measurements and symptom evaluation included spirometry, six-minute walking tests, and the American Thoracic Society Lung Disease Questionnaire (ATS-DLD-78). Outcome. Emergency room visits, return visits to the ER, and overnight hospitalisations were collected from patients' medical charts. Results. Independent associations were observed for age, gender, lung function, six-minute walking test distance, and use of oral cortico-steroids. HRQoL measures also demonstrated an ability to predict health-care service outcomes. Multivariate model selection identified disease severity and HRQoL as the strongest correlates of presentation for an emergency visit in COPD patients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bourbeau, Jean</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795983p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956j046</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Behavioral</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Social</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azw12z7525"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of unloading on overground ambulation in stroke clients</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Roopchand, Sharmella</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study aimed to determine whether the use of body weight (BWS) during overground ambulation leads to immediate improvements in the gait pattern. of stroke clients, and whether an overground support system is feasible for use as a gait training tool in this population. Fourteen subjects 3 to 18 weeks post stroke and with ambulatory capacity but mobility problem (timed-up-and-go score &gt; 25 s) participated in the study. Subjects were instructed to walk over a distance of 7 m with 0% (full weight bearing), 15% or 30% BWS provided by an overhead suspension system. Ground reaction forces, body kinematics and temporal distance factors were recorded. Subjects demonstrated significant improvements in force generation during both the loading and push off phase of gait (p &lt; 0.001) with increasing support. There were also significant improvements in trunk postural control as well as a decrease in cycle duration and total double support time. The results indicate that providing partial BWS during overground walking allows for the expression of an improved walking pattern in stroke clients. The system was well tolerated by all subjects during testing and indicates therefore that this system is feasible for use in retraining walking in stoke clients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fung, Joyce</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623f728.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z7525</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3t945s99h"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A comparison of the performance of generalized procrustes analysis and the intraclass coefficient of correlation to estimate interrater reliability</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rodrigue, Natalie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A problem often encountered in epidemiology is the evaluation of the validity of a questionnaire administered to subjects. This is usually performed with the help of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC, however, has several drawbacks. This thesis addresses questions on the use of Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) to estimate interrater reliability in epidemiology. GPA is one of the family of methods that are concerned with the analysis of data arising from several subjects. It is a powerful multivariate statistical technique developed in the framework of sensory evaluation to primarily assess interjudge reliability and furthermore to measure the effect of treatments, usually food products in a sensory study. Because of the empirical nature of GPA, informal graphical methods that allow multidimensional spaces to be explored to reveal structure in the data are commonly used, hence facilitating the interpretation of results. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate how GPA could be adapted to epidemiology, more specifically, in the development of scales and in the evaluation of interrater reliability and to evaluate the similarities and differences compared to the ICC.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bellavance, Francois</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mp46g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945s99h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, General</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Statistics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cn04z"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Prognostic indicators of hepatitis A severity during the 1994-1996 outbreak in the Montreal-Centre region</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Richer, Faisca</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objective. To describe the factors predictive of hepatitis A disease severity. Design and setting. Cross-sectional study of hepatitis A cases during the recent HAV outbreak in the Montreal gay community. Subjects. All 631 hepatitis A cases documented in the Montreal-Centre region between November 1994 and December 1996. Outcome measures. Hepatitis A severity was operationalized as (1) the need for hospitalization and (2) a symptom severity index (vomiting, dark urine and abdominal pain). Results. Subjects were predominantly male (84%). Homosexual behaviour was reported in 68% of cases. Prevalence of a high severity index was 8%, and 12% of cases required hospitalization. Non parenteral drug use was the only factor predictive of both hospitalization status and severity index. Our data could not establish homosexual behaviour as a determinant of disease severity. Conclusion. Non parenteral drug users are at increased risk of suffering from a severe disease when infected with the hepatitis A virus. In addition to the current recommendation for routine vaccination of travelers and of homosexual men, drug users could benefit from immunization against this virus.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Allard, Robert</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng85c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cn04z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hepatitis A -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892d03m"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Implication of the calcitonin gene-related peptide and its receptor binding sites in animal models of chronic pain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rémillard, Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37 amino acid peptide arising from the alternative splicing of the calcitonin gene.

The primary focus of, this thesis was to study the involvement of CGRP and its binding sites in rat models of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. The expression and binding sites of galanin and substance P were also examined to assess the specificity of the observed changes. No changes were observed in CGRP, galanin and substance P immunostaining in the dorsal horn of the lumbar regions 4 and 5 (L4--L5) of the spinal cord at 24 hours, 4, 7 and 14 days following the injection of Freund's complete adjuvant or sciatic nerve constriction. However, binding sites at the L4--L5 levels were found to be modulated during the development of chronic pain. CGRP binding sites were found to be increased and decreased in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, respectively. Substance P binding sites were increased in both models while galanin binding sites were decreased only in this neuropathy pain model. In conclusion, the changes in CGRP binding levels observed following the injection of Freund's complete adjuvant or constriction of the sciatic nerve were not mirrored by similar changes in substance P and galanin binding sites. This finding indicates differential involvement of these neuropeptides and their receptors in chronic pain mechanisms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quirion, Remi</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j38609008.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892d03m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514nn57d"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The impact of physician communication skills on continuity of care and emergency department use by regular emergency department users</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Reid, Tracey</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Regular use of the emergency department is associated with a patient's inability to identify a regular primary care physician. Continuity of the physician-patient relationship is largely determined by patient satisfaction, which in turn is influenced by the physician's communication and interpersonal skills. The objective of this study was to estimate the relationship between the communication competency of newly licensed family physicians and the ambulatory health care utilization behaviour of their regular emergency department users. It was hypothesized that physicians with higher levels of competency in patient communication would be the providers of a greater proportion of their patients' ambulatory care than physicians with poorer communication abilities. Consequently, these patients would rely on the emergency department for a smaller proportion of their ambulatory care than patients of physicians with lower levels of communication competency. In total, 474 newly licensed family physicians and 42 113 regular ED user patients were included in the study population. Analysis was conducted at the level of the physician and patients were attributed to the practice populations of the first study physician they saw.

The transforming ability of REV-T is attributed the v-rel oncogene, a member of the Rel/NFkappaB family of transcription factors. Although it is believed that v- rel mediated transformation involves the disregulation of normal NF-kappaB function, the intracellular requirements for transformation are still unknown. We have used the RCAS vectors (R̲eplication C̲ompetent A̲vian Leukosis LTR with S̲plice Acceptor) for infection and dissemination of viral particles in chicken cells, permitting somatic transgenesis of the v-rel oncogene in vivo. In addition, the RCAS system has been combined with a tetracycline regulated gene expression system, in order to allow for conditional expression of the v- rel oncogene in transgenic birds. Using this novel system, we have been able to study in situ transformation by the v-rel oncogene. By addressing the questions pertaining to the cells targeted for transformation by v-rel, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the mechanism for v-rel mediated transformation. Preliminary data suggests that B cells were targeted for transformation by v-rel in the transgenic birds. Phenotypic analysis revealed that transformed cells were not representative of all stages of B cell development, but rather had a mature B cell phenotype.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ratcliffe, M.

Carbachol (CCh), a stable analogue of ACh, stimulates various intracellular signals through mAChRs, including p42-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42mapk) activation and c-fos gene expression. The present study examined the mAChR subtype(s) and the signaling pathway(s) involved in both responses using purified cultures of oligodendrocyte progenitors from newborn rats. The M3 mAChR selective antagonist 4-DAMP and its irreversible analogue 4-DAMP-mustard, but not pirenzepine (M1) or methoctramine (M2/M4), prevented p42mapk activation and c-fos mRNA expression. Pretreatment with a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 but not the inactive analogue U73343 blocked both responses, while the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin had no effect, suggesting the involvement of PLC but not PI3K. In view of the fact that the M3 mAChR mediates p42mapk activation as well as c-fos mRNA expression, the MAPK Kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 098059 was used to establish a link between both responses. PD 098059 pretreatment caused no significant attenuation in c-fos mRNA levels, demonstrating that this response may not be dependent on p42mapk activation. However, the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors quinacrine and AACOCF3 abolished c-fos mRNA expression, implicating arachidonic acid and/or its bioactive eicosanoid metabolites. In summary, these results demonstrate that in oligodendrocyte progenitors, the M3 mAChR is mediating both p42mapk activation and c-fos gene expression via PLC but not PI3K, whereby c-fos gene expression is not regulated by p42mapk but by PLA2.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Almazan, Guillermina</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jn631.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085n47s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505251s"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Meroma : managing the environmental resources of mobile agents</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pourafzal, Ashkan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mobile Agentry is a promising new technology towards the vision of a widely scaleable electronic market. Mobile agents are computational entities which can autonomously migrate from host to host. They migrate like nomadic tribes due to the lack of environmental resources. Whereas the nomads would migrate if the weather was too cold or the food was running out, the agents migrate when the computing power is too low or the memory allowance is running out. It is apparent from the previous analogy with the nomads, that environmental resources play a crucial role in the agent's lifecycle. Even though most agent systems provide environmental resource management of agents to some degree, not all aspects of resource management are in place yet. If the industry continues to embrace mobile agentry, there will be a gargantous amount of heterogeneous agent systems and agents in the near future. Bearing in mind this fact, as well as the dynamic nature of mobile agents and environmental resources, environmental resource management is strongly recommended. In this thesis, we present the criteria to be considered as environmental resources of the agents. We analyze in detail the agent paradigm to find where environmental resource management should be applied, and, based on our analysis, present two solutions to enhance the applicability of the agent paradigm. For completeness, we present similar work in other agent groups.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dini, Petre</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Friedman, Nathan</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qp182.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505251s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r524m"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Heat conduction in YBa2Cu3O7-[delta] : effect of anisotropy and magnetic field</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Popić, Bojana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have used thermal conductivity measurements at low temperature to probe the behavior of the unconventional superconductor YBa2Cu 3O7-delta (YBCO).

Our results on the low temperature thermal conductivity are in good quantitative agreement with the theory for a d-wave superconductor. We have found a very weak (or even negligible) anisotropy suggesting that the anisotropy could not simply be explained by mass tensor anisotropy or the plasma frequency anisotropy. The magnetic field studies revealed an increase in the residual linear term (kappa/ T as T → 0) with field, reflecting the contribution to the density of states from the extended quasiparticles due to their Doppler shift in the presence of vortices.
