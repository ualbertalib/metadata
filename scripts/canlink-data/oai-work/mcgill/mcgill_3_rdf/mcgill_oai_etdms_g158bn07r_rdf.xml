J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hemlock and beech leachates which had percolated through the forest canopy and through the organic layer and the A horizon of two podzol soils were studied. Evidence was obtained to support the view that the podzolization process is more active under a conifer (hemlock) than under a deciduous (beach) canopy. It was found that the organic matter in the hemlock leachates was similar to the organic matter deposited in the B horizon of the soil studied. A chemical fractionation procedure was developed which isolated, from both hemlock leachate and B horizon extract, a substance that was potentially active in podzolization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DeLong, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wk81d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bn07r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
