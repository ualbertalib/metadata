And the significance of most of these things in the final summation of her personality would be of little use, as irrelevant to any rounded picture of a life as is any one of the multitude of impressions and moments which surround Jacob in Jacob’s Room. But we must believe that there is some order in the world; that human activity is partially predictable; that there is continuity of character and interest and aspiration and personality. Else we should all drop our tools where we stand and give up the struggle of living with ourselves and with other people, long before we reached the age of fifty-nine. The process of arriving at judgments concerning the personalities of other people is one of our most important pursuits. However, in everyday life, our evaluation of the people about us is necessarily hurried, unmethodical, and inexact, founded on prejudices, unconscious motives and associations, which have served us in the past.

Up to the present time some 220 million acres of land have been surveyed in Canada of which approximately 40 million acres are located in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. In these provinces alone the number of soil series established to date is close to 300. As the number of recognized differing soil units increases it becomes imperative that soils which have some major characteristics in common be grouped together into higher categories. Attempts have been made, with various success, to group Canadian soils into higher categories, particularly the “great soil groups,” which have been defined elsewhere, mainly in the United States. Some of these higher categories have been defined on limited numbers of known soil units and these in some cases have not represented the entire range of soils which should logically be grouped into the same higher category. The definitions of some great soil groups, have also not been specific enough to permit the separation of border line soils into the respective groups. The shortcomings of the present definitions of some great soil groups are recognized not only in this country but also elsewhere.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DeLong, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qg46t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jh343w281</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2n49t536k"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Petrographic methods of determining the source of clastic sediments</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stocken, Charles Galihad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Petrographic methods as generally understood comprise the methods by which material collected in the field is investigated in the laboratory.

Commenting on the value and nature of such investigation Milner (1940 p. 490) says “The perusal of this more philosophical aspect of the science is not merely academic; indeed, one might almost say that without such inquiry all petrographic work must lose both in precision and value: it will certainly lack vitality. “Tracing the source of constituent particles of a deposit is often by no means a straightforward matter, especially where the locale of a distributive province capable of furnishing the material is obscure or where, owing to widespread erosion, no direct evidence of such a province exists.

The location of these groups, in western Ontario and south eastern Manitoba, is indicated on the accompanying map of the general area. A geophysical survey and diamond drilling program had been completed during the winter months and over the break up period on the Werner Lake group. Geological mapping on a scale of two hundred feet to one inch was commenced early in May in order to correlate the results of the winter’s work. The mapping of the Bird River group of claims was commenced late in June and in conjunction with the mapping a magnetometer survey was carried out. The object of this work was to investigate several known occurrences of copper-nickel sulphides on the property and to locate if possible, by geophysical methods, any other mineralized zones, that may have lain undiscovered under the cover of drift. In this area also, peridotite is the host rock for banded chromite deposits and, as peridotite was known to outcrop on the claims, it was thought that magnetometer survey might reveal the presence of this type of deposit.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>O'Neill, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107229f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d570091z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qw02k"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mental health services for children in Quebec province</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thompson, C.

Having found the affected islet cells uncolored by methods designed to demonstrate hyaline and mucoid forms of degeneration, they (1902) later interpreted the lesion as a manifestation of cytoplasmic vacuolation and liquefaction, and applied the term hydropic degeneration to indicate its presumably aqueous character. Allen (1913) accomplished the first experimental production of a similar lesion in the islets and ductules of the pancreatic remnants of dogs made diabetic by resection of nine-tenths of the pancreas. At about the same time Homans (1914, 1915) demonstrated that in the islets of such experimental material degranulation and vacuolation developed only in the beta cells. Both Allen and Homans failed to find fat, mucin or glycogen in the affected cells; both concluded, as Weichselbaum did, that the vacuoles represented aqueous fluid. Richardson (1939-40), Ham and Haist (1941), Lukens and Dohan (19140, 1942) and Lukens, Dohan, and Wolcott (1943) described the pancreases of dogs and cats treated with anterior pituitary extract; these authors apparently accepted the idea of aqueous vacuolation as the basis of “hydropic degeneration” in their material.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duff, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qq412.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wt75m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avt150n210"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Botany</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A comparison of the morphology and anatomy of normal Abies balsamea and that infected by Melampsorella cerastii (Pers.) Schroet</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Turnau, Edmund Albert Otto</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Melampsorella cerastii (Pers.) Schroet. is an organism which causes witches` brooms (Hexenbesen) in our firs (Abies spp.) and spruces (Picea spp.). It belongs to the group of higher fungi (Basidiomycetes) known as the rusts (Uredinales). The alternate hosts are various species of the Caryophyllaceae e.g. Cerastium and Stellaria (Alsine). Pycnia and aecia are produced on the coniferous host, while the uredinia and telia are borne on the caryophyllaceous host. The mycelium is perennial in both hosts, frequently living as long as the host does, and thus rendering the parasite more permanent even if the required alternate hosts are rare. In fact, it appears that the aecidial host is not necessary for its continued existence (Wilson 1934). Infection takes place in the buds of the spruces and firs and causes hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the tissues. Apical dominance is lost, or, at least, reduced and numerous lateral branches develop resulting in the formation of conspicuous witches’ brooms. These brooms may eventually grow to large size: Pady (1941) shows one on Picea which is six feet long and two or three feet in diameter. Those on Abies, however, are much smaller, more compact and usually more nearly spherical. Typical brooms are shown in Plates 1(a) and 1(d), the first in its fourth year and the latter in its sixth.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pady, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bj14t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150n210</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Balsam fir -- Diseases and pests</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vv08c"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The cortical representation of the feeding reflex</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Van Buren, John M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The term “feeding reflex” is intended to imply the actions of the most rostral part of the digestive tract during the ingestion of food. This includes tongue, lip, and jaw movements, salivation, the pharyngeal, laryngeal and esophageal phases of deglutition and the motor and secretory responses aroused in the stomach. This complex presents a number of points which bear mention. It is marked, of course, by its phylogenetic antiquity and the paucity of specialization apparent in its responses as the phylogenetic scale is ascended. It appears as though Nature had struck upon a satisfactory mechanism and then felt little need to make the improvements so evident in many other responses in higher animals. Throughout the species it is a reflex of considerable complexity, calling into action a great variety of muscular and glandular elements but being characterized by its stereotyped responses. As the tract descends from lips to stomach the musculature comes less and less under voluntary control. This implies that the lower portions come increasingly under the guidance of the autonomic system. The independent motility of the stomach and its variable response to apparently similar stimuli pose puzzling problems in interpretation to the investigator.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Babkin, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z411v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vv08c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579w52b"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Exchange reactions between alicyclic iodides and sodium iodide</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Van Straten, Sylvia Florence</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The saturated ring hydrocarbons are generally believed to behave as aliphatic compounds, for which reason they are frequently referred to as alicyclic.

For example, although the rates of esterification of cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol and cycloheptanol decrease steadily with increase in the number of carbon atoms in the ring (2), the rate of decomposition of sodium bisulphite derivatives of alicyclic ketones shows a minimum with the six membered ring (3).[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289n210.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579w52b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1n79h764w"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An x-ray diffraction study of the nuclei of pleochroic haloes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wagner, Sydney</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A microscopic examination of thin sheets of certain kinds of mica, notably biotite, reveals the presence of small areas containing groups of concentric circles darker in colour than the surrounding mica. Usually a minute particle, more or less transparent, is observed at the centre of each circle. The circular marks are called pleochroic haloes and the particle at the centre is commonly referred to as the nucleus. Joly and Rutherford (1) were the first to show that the haloes are due to darkening of the mica by alpha particles emitted by radioactive material associated in some way with the nucleus. The first attempt to classify haloes according to their radioactive parent element was made by Joly (2a). He was able to distinguish between uranium and thorium types but could not account for a few other varieties which he encountered. More recently, however, Henderson (3) has made a systematic study of the haloes in mica from many localities and has been able to account satisfactorily for their origins. At least six distinct types (3d) have been recognized, each resulting from a different radioactive parent. These are shown diagramatically in Figure 1. From the measured radius of a given halo and a knowledge of the energies of the alpha particles emitted by different radioactive atoms, converted into their range in mica, identification of the halo with a particular radioactive element in the nucleus can be effected.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shaw, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m5107.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h764w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892f221"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Changes of fear with age</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wake, F.

These results ware interpreted as follows: a set to see a particular class of words was formed during the training series; shock facilitated, while failure inhibited this set formation.

Whereas Plato’s theories have enjoyed almost constant re-examination and criticism throughout recent years, the same cannot, unfortunately, be said for those of his great successor. One explanation for this lies, perhaps, in the fact that contemporary Ethical investigation is not interested in the same things in which Aristotle was interested: it is not interested in casuistry: it is not concerned primarily with answering such questions as ‘what is the nature of the good life?’ But neither does it concern itself so much with such matters as the moral character and how a man becomes good. For Aristotle, on the other hand, these questions were the most important. While modern Ethics tends to enquire into the meanings of certain terms like ‘right’ and ‘good’ and ‘obligation’, Aristotle either quickly establishes meaning or assumes it and hastens to enquire into processes: how we come to know what the human good is; how we become good; how we become responsible for our actions; how we make a judgment of what we ought to do in a particular situation.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maclennan, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kr26t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33s072c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aristotle.

However, most of these investigations have concerned themselves almost wholly with the inhibitory effects of narcotics on tissue respiration, and no thorough study of the in vitro effects of narcotics on the glycolytic mechanisms of brain tissue in the presence of narcotics has been attempted.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Elliott, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w790d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3014613</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920g104g"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Case work services for displaced persons immigrating to Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Weiner, Miriam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is the purpose of this study to indicate the need for case work services to displaced persons admitted to Canada from Europe during the decade following world war II. It is the basic assumption of this enquiry that these people need more than casual friendly help from those among whom they settle. The immigrants are strangers to a new homeland, to a new community, to another culture. The D.Ps. face more than the usual difficulties and hardships of adjustment to a new community and its way of life. They have been subject to additional traumatic pressures of a sociological and psychological nature which in many cases have torn asunder their social relationships, family affiliations, political and citizenship status and seriously weakened the ego structure of their personalities. The fears and the anxieties which have been accumulated by them need to be understood and relieved. They need help which will permit them to regain a wholesome acceptance of themselves as individuals with a readiness to assume the responsibilities and the privileges of membership in a community in their new homeland.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Younge, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hn536.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920g104g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30px051"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation of some factors influencing the autokinetic effect</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Westcott, James William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study has two aims; first, to draw some conclusions concerning the stimulus factors, or evidences, which influence the direction of autokinetic movement; second, to utilize these conclusions in elucidating the nature of the autokinetic effect.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Luchins, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fv914.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30px051</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>PSYCHOLOGY -- MENTAL TESTS</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jh72r"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Oxidations of periodate lignin with alkaline hypoiodite and hypochlorite</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Whittall, Norman Stanley</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bleaching of wood pulp with alkaline hypochlorite is of great economical importance in the pulp and paper industry. Considerable work has been done on the problem of such bleaching but mainly from an industrial point of view with the object of effecting economies in the chlorine consumption while at the same time maintaining high quality in the pulps. All of this work, too, was hampered by the necessity of studying the reactions of bleaching either on whole wood or on isolated lignins known to be altered in structure in obscure but probably drastic ways. Some years ago it was found possible to isolate most of the lignin from wood in a state that was only slightly chemically changed. The product, periodate lignin, was a light brown powder preserving much of the original morphological detail, and differing from most other isolated lignins in retaining the original insolubility of lignin in all liquids investigated. The availability of "periodate" lignin encouraged the writer to study the actions of a typical bleaching agent, sodium hypochlorite, and a closely related substance, sodium hypoiodite, upon it. This work supplements earlier results that were complicated by the presence of carbonydrates of wood or by the use of a less suitable type of lignin.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445ch53w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jh72r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xm83g"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The design and construction of a 100,000 volt linear ion accelerator</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Whittier, A.

These studies were based on a cooperative survey of Mount Royal Ward, Montreal, by the student members of the seminar. They were an architect, two economists, a geographer and a socioligist. The architect directed a survey of the effects of the existing land use controls on the density of the Ward. It revealed that there is a confusion of theoretical considerations on which the controls are based, and that in the main the existing controls are ineffective. One of the conclusions of the total survey was that the social and economic forces directing the process of city growth result in conditions of crowding and dispersal, and that this forms the basis for the social control of density. These facts gave the lead to the development of this thesis. The first part of the thesis is a review of the theoretical considerations determining a method of control of residential density.

The interpretation of the face is based on the work of Du Porte (1946); that of the male genitalia, on papers by Beirne (1942) and Hardwick (1948); that of the sternum, on lectures at Macdonald College, McGill University. FACE The most prominent sclerite on the anterior aspect of the head (Fig.l) is the frons (Fr), which is about as broad as long, and convex, being more sharply rounded both ventrally and dorsally. Between the antennal sockets (As), there runs a distinct white line, somewhat rounded backward. This line is not marked internally by a ridge and is apparently the frontal suture (fs), the coronal suture being possibly represented by a thin median line in the vertex devoid of scale scars; the mid-cranial sulcus is lacking; the frontal suture marks the dorsal limits of the frons. The frons is limited laterally by the frontogenal sulcus (fgs), which, with its interior ridge, runs ventrally from the mesoposterior borders of the antennal sockets close to the compound eyes (Ce), which are very large and descend below the level of the frons. The antennae are thus borne dorsolaterally on the frons. The compound eyes occupy the genal area except for a very narrow posterodorsal rim.

The hardness of the bone as compared to other tissues, the slowness of repair following fracture, and the length of time for bone autolysis, all supported this concept. However, some doubt was cast on this theory, when in 1887 Macewan noted the difference in strength and brittleness in the bones of young children, adults and the very aged. He also observed that in sickness the bones of children became very soft and pliable and that 2 weeks after recovery they had returned to their former hard state. This surely suggested that the metabolism of bone reflected the general body condition.Sixty years after the work of Macewan, Newman and Riley made the following statement, “Bone cannot be considered to be a stable system in which the inorganic phase is inert. Rather, the stability of the skeletal system can be attributed only to an extremely efficient control of the inorganic composition of the circulating fluids”.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92gb47q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278x55s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A794081260"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Blood lipids in relation to diet</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wilmot, Valerie C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A review of the literature indicates that blood lipid levels are normally relatively constant, and are independent of age, body weight and ordinary meals. Variations from normal levels occur in pregnancy, under duress, in certain pathological states, and after fat ingestion.  Extremes in fat intake influence the levels directly. Low fat diets increase the saturation of the component fatty acids. Levels of blood lipid fractions tend to change slowly and proportionally. Phospholipid and neutral fat levels rise during fat absorption but not in proportion to the amount of fat ingested; cholesterol levels change inconsistently. Experimental work confirms the above observations regarding alimentary lipemia and, in multiple sclerosis patients, shows that with low fat diets blood cholesterol and phospholipid levels fall temporarily and neutral fat levels remain depressed. The physical State of blood fat is discussed. The methods used to determine four lipid fractions are minutely described and discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Swank, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jv40d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/794081260</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t2546"><ual:graduationDate>1950</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the nature of the nutritionally deleterious constituents of heated vegetable oils</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wiseblatt, Lazare</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During World War II, the serious shortage of edible fats and oils in Canada stimulated investigations on the use of domestic vegetable oils for foods. Attention was concentrated on linseed oil, which could be produced in large quantities; but hydrogenated linseed shortenings developed serious flavor reversion. This made them totally unacceptable to the consumers. Evidence was obtained in this Department that linolenic acid on hydrogenation forms precursors of reversion compounds. Investigation of means for the removal of linolenic acid from linseed or soybean oil triglycerides led to the use of thermal polymerization, followed by solvent segregation into an "edible" fraction and a drying fraction of superior film-forming properties. The "edible"fraction yielded a hydrogenated shortening of acceptable stability and flavor. However, it showed markedly lowered nutrutuve value when included in the diet of rats at levels of 10$ or over. The primary aim of the research reported herein has been to concentrate and identify the material responsible for the deleterious nature of heat-polymerized linseed oil. It is likely that similar products are responsible in heated soybean or other oils. Linseed oil was chosen for study because the damage occurs with Short heating periods, and because most previous data were obtained with linseed oil.[…]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Common, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569750b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t2546</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
