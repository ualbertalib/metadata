In taking up the challenge of reality in a contemporary context which also demanded deference to a sophisticated modern audience, the author presents a composite image of the whole which cannot be captured except in its multiplicity through mimicry, satire, parody, lyricism and elements of the fantastic. Pizzuto's refreshing and unique style may be seen in four major areas: the presentation of reality, the depiction of time, character portrayal and lastly, word technique. The simultaneous interaction of these elements in Pizzuto's production brings a bold new dimension to the portrayal of reality and to the Italian literary scene. Essentially, this is the substance of the thesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wg72t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042t75d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pizzuto, Antonio, 1893-1976 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reality in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5t34sk315"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Chalcocarbonyl chemistry : application in hormonal receptor determination, metalloporphyrins and metal-arene bond activation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ismail, Ashraf A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The reaction of ((eta)-Arene)Cr(CO)(,2)(CX) (X = S, Se) complexes with excess (RO)(,3)P (R = Me, Et, n-Bu, Ph) yields Cr(CO)(,2)(CX) (RO)(,3)P (,3), predominantly as the mer I isomer, in which a phosphite ligand is trans to CX.

The molecular structures of Cr(CO)(,2)(CX) (MeO)(,3)P (,3) have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Intramolecular isomerization of these complexes as well as their tricarbonyl analogue has been demonstrated and activation parameters have been calculated for the rearrangement processes. Two-dimensional ('31)P NMR spectroscopy has provided evidence that isomerization occurs via trigonal prismatic intermediates. Kinetic investigations of the reaction of ((eta)-C(,6)H(,6))Cr(CO)(,2)(CX) with (MeO)(,3)P have established a first-order rate dependence on both the complex and the entering ligand. The faster reaction rate of the selenocarbonyl derivative relative to its thiocarbonyl analogue originates in a lower entropy of activation in the former case. The effect on the reaction rate of variation in the nature of the arene and of the entering ligand has been investigated. An approach to hormonal receptor assay involving the detection by FT-IR spectroscopy of Cr(CO)(,3)-labelled modified estradiol bound to estrogen receptors in target tissue is reported.

Two typical gas injection configurations (i.e., conventional central injection and C.A.S. alloy addition procedure) were investigated. Flow visualization studies were carried out using a suspended network of silken threads, mean velocity vectors and overall flow patterns were determined by video recording techniques, while mean velocity vectors and associated turbulence level were also measured with laser doppler velocimetry. These measurements show very reasonable agreement with equivalent numerical predictions. To simulate the subsurface motion of additions, spherical wooden balls of various densities were dropped from typical heights, and their subsurface trajectories, immersion times, etc., recorded by means of a video recorder. Frame by frame analysis of the video tapes showed trends which are in good accord with computed trajectories. Mixing times of simulated molten additions were measured by the conductivity measurement technique. These were compared with prediction from an equivalent tracer dispersion model and excellent agreement achieved. For industrial application, flow, particle motion, and mixing times in a 150 ton steel processing ladle have been predicted and their technological significance discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/707958495.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150k02c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hydrodynamics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel -- Inclusions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel -- Metallurgy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Foundry ladles</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g3449"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Motion-compensated predictive coding of image sequences : analysis and evaluation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>O'Shaughnessy, Richard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this study, motion-compensated predictive coding of monochrome image sequences was investigated. The goals were to evaluate the performance limits of this coding method, to determine its relative advantages in comparison to other predictive coding techniques not compensated for motion, and to identify the factors which limit further improvements in performance. A motion-compensated prediction algorithm which estimates displacements only from previously-transmitted data was presented, and was shown to be nearly optimal. At low distortion levels, an adaptive intra-inter-frame predictor not compensated for motion was found to be almost as effective as motion-compensated prediction. At higher distortion levels, however, motion-compensated predictive coding becomes more attractive. The main factors which limit the performance of motion-compensated predictors were identified as: input noise, spatial interpolation errors, and the local nature of the displacement estimation methods. Methods to control these limiting factors were suggested.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214p87t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g3449</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Coding theory</dc:subject><dc:subject>Image processing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Image transmission</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440t11p"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Underground UHF-EM transillumination : a feasibility study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>La Fleche, Paul Thomas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A feasibility study into the use of UHF-EM transillumination measurements in geophysics is presented. The electrical properties and absorption rates of common crustal materials are examined with the goal of identifying specific conditions under which sufficient material penetration at UHF frequencies is available. A prototype 445 MHz continuous-wave transillumination instrument designed for underground use is described. Test surveys, with this instrument, were conducted at the Big Nickel Mine in Sudbury, Ontario, to obtain a number of through-rock absorption rates. Estimated effective resistivities of between 500 and 1500 ohm-metres are determined from the survey data. Effective conductivities and permittivities from AC and DC electrical property measurements on geological samples from the mine site corroborate these transillumination survey results. The results of the field surveys indicate that the UHF-EM transillumination technique is a feasible and useful geophysical method.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jr93t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440t11p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Transillumination</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geophysical instruments</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electromagnetic waves</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct744"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A unified theory of system-level diagnosis and its application to regular interconnected structures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Somani, Arun K. (Arun Kumar)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>System-level diagnosis is considered to be a viable alternative to circuit-level testing in complex multiprocessor systems. The characterization problem, the diagnosability problem, and the diagnosis problem in this framework have been widely studied in the literature with respect to a special fault class, called t-fault class, in which all fault sets of size up to t are considered. Various models for the interpretation of test outcomes have been proposed and analyzed. Among these, four most known models are: symmetric invalidation model, asymmetric invalidation model, symmetric invalidation model with intermittent faults, and asymmetric invalidation model with intermittent faults. In this thesis, a completely new generalization of the characterization problem in system-level diagnosis area is developed. This generalized characterization theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for any fault-pattern of any size to be uniquely diagnosable under all the four models. Moreover, the following three results are obtained for the t-fault class: (1) the characterization theorem for t-diagnosable systems under the asymmetric invalidation model with intermittent faults is developed for the first time; (2) a unified t-characterization theorem covering all the four models is presented; and finally (3) it is proven that the classical t-characterization theorems under the first three models and the new result for the fourth model, as mentioned in (1) above, are special cases of the generalized characterization theorem. The general diagnosability problem is also studied. It is shown that the single fault diagnosability problem, under the asymmetric invalidation model is Co-NP-complete. As regards the diagnosis problem, most of the diagnosis algorithms developed thus far are global algorithms in which a complete syndrome is analyzed by a single supervisory processor. In this thesis, distributed diagnosis algorithms for regular interconnected structures are developed which take advantage of the interconnection architecture of a multiprocessor system.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d5021.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17ct744</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electronic digital computers -- Reliability</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multiprocessors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fault-tolerant computing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278t81s"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Electro-ultrafiltration with rotating dynamic membranes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Turkson, Abraham K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In axial electrofiltration, a DC electric field is imposed between a rotating inner cylinder and a stationary outer cylinder giving rise to four mechanisms which act to minimize solute accumulation at the filter surface: turbulence, centrifugal force, electrophoresis and shear stress which removes solute aggregates. Four dynamic membranes, Zr(IV) oxide, calcium oleate, poly-2-vinylpyridine and cadmium sulfide, were used to filter bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a disodium phosphate solution at pH = 8 and Prussian blue in distilled water. Prussian blue is a particle of 0.01(mu)m diameter with a zeta potential of -41mV while BSA is a macromolecule of 69,000 molecular weight, a Stokes-Einstein radius of 0.0038(mu)m and a zeta potential of -23.3mV at pH = 8. For BSA, the flux declined with time while the rejection increased. Filtrate fluxes increased with rotation rate and electric field and declined with concentration for both feeds. The flux declined beyond N = 2000rpm and was constant above C(,0) = 5.0wt%. For Prussian blue, the rejection was greater than 90% at all levels of E, N and C(,0). For BSA, the rejection increased with rotation rate and declined with concentration. The BSA rejection declined above N = 2000rpm and was constant beyond C(,0) = 0.5wt%. A mathematical model was derived to predict the time variation of filtrate flux and a rejection model was used to predict the effect of surface concentration on BSA rejection.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dn11x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278t81s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Filters and filtration</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electroultrafiltration</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z157v"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The social significance of home networking : public surveillance and social management</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wilson, Kevin G., 1952-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyzes the social significance of the integration of the home into computer networks. The social significance of home networking is grasped when these systems are understood in their relationship to emerging forms of electronic social control. The thesis establishes this connection through an analysis of structural trends in the videotex industry which demonstrates the value to the corporate sector of cybernetic information generated by interactive systems. The North American tradition of privacy policy is reviewed and demonstrated as inadequate for the protection of personal privacy in home networking. It is further shown that privacy policy does not represent an adequate theorization of social control in computer networking, since it does not account for practices of aggregate social control, which have been termed in the thesis "social management," so vital to the cybernetic economy of late capitalism. Finally, the thesis argues that current conceptual frameworks and policy mechanisms cannot assure the socially beneficial development of home networking, given the tendency towards the integration of such systems into structures of social control.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494926g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z157v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electronic data processing -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Minicomputers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Privacy, Right of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social control</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gt41b"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The land and the loom : rural industry in the North of France, the example of Montigny-en-Cambrésis, 1680-1800</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vardi, Liana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The eighteenth century witnessed the expansion of rural industries. One of the more important was the production of linen cloth in the North of France. This study focuses on a village in southeastern Cambresis, Montigny, and examines the relationship between landownership and agricultural occupations on the one hand and artisanal and mercantile activities on the other. Weaving was introduced in the village some time in the seventeenth century but only became a major occupation in the eighteenth and the primary one in the nineteenth. This activity was controlled through numerous parallel channels, but the emergence of rural middlemen constitutes a dynamic breakthrough. They flourished despite constraints until the Revolution which re-channeled some of their energies. Although dependent on a supplementary income, the peasant-weavers did not sever their roots with the land. They continued to work as seasonal agricultural labourers, and were fully integrated within the agrarian community.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924c536.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gt41b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>France -- Economic conditions -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Textile industry -- France -- Montigny -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cottage industries -- France -- Montigny -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Montigny (Cambrai, France) -- Economic conditions -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930bx93t"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Flow dynamics in a model of the large airways</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Menon, Anilkumar S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Oscillatory velocity profiles and the pressure-flow relationship were measured in a 3:1 scale rigid model of the human central airways. A reciprocating pump provided flows with frequencies of 0.25, 1, 2 and 4 Hz and tidal volumes of 300, 500 and 1500 mL giving tracheal Womersley numbers up to 31 and peak tracheal Reynolds numbers up to 17000. A hot wire anemometer was used to measure velocities along two perpendicular diameters (one in the plane of the model and the other in the plane perpendicular to the model) at 10 stations distributed through the model. Velocities were also measured with and without a model larynx and with tracheal intubation in steady inspiratory flows. The flow distribution to the five lobar bronchi was identical in all experiments. Oscillatory velocity profiles were compared with the steady velocity profiles at nearly identical Reynolds numbers. The flow in a branch was quasi-steady below a critical Strouhal number in agreement with an order of magnitude analysis. For quasi-steady oscillatory flows the velocity profile developed from an initially flat shape to the profiles characteristic of steady flow in branching tubes. Flows that were not quasi-steady exhibited relatively flat profiles over the entire respiratory cycle. The effects of tidal volume, frequency and the geometry of the airways on the velocity profiles were determined. While the larynx produced a significant jet within the trachea it had no effect on the velocity profiles beyond the carina. The presence of a concentric endotracheal tube located halfway between the glottis and the carina had little effect on the velocity profiles in the main stem and the lobar bronchi. Inserting the tube further into the trachea altered the velocity profiles in the right upper lobar bronchus. In oscillating flow the pressure was essentially uniform around the periphery of a branch in strong contrast to the results for steady flow. The pressure drop in oscillating flow was much larger than the pressure drop in steady flow at an equivalent flow rate. The functional form of the relationship between the pressure drop across the different branches of the model and the tracheal Reynolds number was similar to that suggested by earlier researchers, however the coefficients were very sensitive to the geometry of the model.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gh191.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bx93t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Airway (Medicine)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Air flow</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hg22r"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Summation characteristics of the neural network subserving self-stimulation reward</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mason, Patrick Alan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research examines the summation characteristics of the neural network subserving self-stimulation reward. The data show that the neural network has two integrators that sum the signals produced by brain stimulation. The time constant of the first integrator is approximately 450 msec, whereas that of the second integrator is approximately 6.5 sec. Furthermore, these integrators are sensitive to the spatiotemporal arrival of the signals. When prolonged stimulation is delivered at a high pulse frequency, the initial pulses contribute the most to the rewarding effect. Later pulses are affected by the reduced ability of the neurons or synapses to transmit signals along the neural network due to fatigue. A fatigue effect may be dissipated by splitting a pulse train into two parts by an interval of no stimulation. This should increase the rewarding effectiveness of the pulse train. However, the rewarding effectiveness is dependent upon the duration of the interval of no stimulation and the magnitude of the two pulse-train halves. A long interval of no stimulation combined with a low stimulation magnitude may cause a frustration response and a decay in memory of the associations between the response, first pulse-train half, and second pulse-train half. These would make the rewarding effectiveness of the two pulse-train halves lower than that of a continuous pulse train. Previous models of summation are unable to predict the present results. The data are explained in terms of a newly developed model of summation involving two central integrators and fatigue.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g831d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hg22r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reinforcement (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain stimulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reward (Psychology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rp38v"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Power format radio : a study of Canadian Current Affairs Radio</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bruck, Peter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The CBC Current Affairs program Sunday Morning is used as a case study to develop an appropriate theory and conceptual apparatus for the understanding of the relationship between the organisation of news-production and news-product.

Results from these experiments further describe the specificities of the processes of uptake and acetylation for choline and of storage and release for acetylcholine in the mammalian nervous system. Specificity at the level of the transport mechanism into synaptic vesicles in mammalian brain tissue was identified with acetyldiethylhomocholine, a poor substrate for vesicular compartmentation. This property of the analogue was exploited to study the site of origin of released transmitter from brain slices. When tissue was incubated with ('3)H choline and ('14)C diethylhomocholine, raising the concentration of K('+) caused increased release of ('3)H acetylcholine but not of ('14)C acetylated analogue; during rest, both compounds were released spontaneously. These results suggest that evoked transmitter release originates from the vesicular compartment and spontaneous release from the cytosol. Diethylhomocholine was also used to investigate the regulation of acetylcholine synthesis in the superior cervical ganglion of the cat. Treatments that affect accumulation and acetylation of choline and releasability of acetylcholine were tested for their effect on the accumulation and acetylation of diethylhomocholine. Results suggest that precursor delivery is important in regulating synthesis but that another factor, probably related to Ca('++) influx during nerve terminal impulse invasion, is also necessary.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k336b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f422v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj67314712"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of a temperature-sensitive mutant of Balb3T3 cells and identification of the defective function</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zeng, Guichao</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>At the restrictive temperature of 39(DEGREES)C, DNA synthesis in ts20, a temperature-sensitive mutant of Balb/3T3 cells, decreases progressively after an initial increase during the first 3 h while RNA and protein synthesis remains at a high level for 40 h. Infection with polyomavirus does not bypass the defect in cell DNA synthesis and the mutant does not support virus DNA replication at 39(DEGREES)C. The synthesis of form I and replicative intermediates of virus DNA at 39(DEGREES)C decrease at about the same rate. The block to cell DNA synthesis is reversible while the block to virus DNA synthesis is not. The defects in virus and cell DNA synthesis are expressed in vitro as reduced ('3)H-dTTP incorporation, consistent with the in vivo data. The addition of wild-type cell extracts complements the depressed cell DNA synthesis in vitro. The complementary factor is detectable in cytosol and can be partially purified. Analysis of virus DNA synthesized in vitro in the mutant cells with ts phenotype reveals an accumulation of DNA molecules migrating between form I and form II. This indicates a topological block in the mutant. Both the complementing activity and DNA topoisomerase I activity are extractable into cytosols. In extracts from mutant cells both activities are present in lower amounts and both are thermolabile. Ts20 is a DNA('ts) mutant whose defect blocks an early step in DNA chain elongation and includes the loss of DNA topoisomerase I activity. These studies provide evidence for a role for this enzyme at this step in eukaryotic DNA replication.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687j241.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j67314712</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arb68xc55p"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Equation of state and structure in non-electrolyte liquids and their mixtures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Costas Basin, Miguel Antonio</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Structural effects in hydrogen and non-hydrogen bonded liquids and their mixtures have been studied using several experimental techniques and theoretical approaches. Apparent heat capacities and volumes of linear alcohols in hydrocarbons were determined at very low alcohol concentrations and their self-association in solution discussed in terms of the Treszczanowicz-Kehiaian theory. An extension of this theory was used to describe cholesterol self-association and its interactions with tripalmitin and lecithin. Heat capacities of water-organic mixtures are reported. It is found that water behaves as a lower alcohol at the organic-rich concentration range. At the water-rich end, Shinoda's views on water structuring around hydrophobes are supported. Thermal pressure coefficients of cyclohexane + normal and branched alkanes are consistent with the presence of orientational order in the long pure n-alkanes. Excess volumes for mixtures of alkanes with liquids of different internal pressures are predicted using Flory theory. The anomalous thermodynamic behaviour of cyclopentane mixed with cyclic and branched alkanes has been studied through the measurement of cyclopentane spin-lattice relaxation times in these mixtures. An extension of Sanchez-Lacombe theory for pure liquids is described and the molecular parameters obtained for sixty common substances. An equation of state for pure n-alkanes with correlations of molecular orientations is presented.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z863m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xc55p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Alcohols</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liquids -- Thermal properties</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydrogen bonding</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472x184"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Probabilistic models of the natural history of multiple sclerosis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wolfson, Christina, 1955-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Variability in the clinical course of multiple sclerosis is one of its most interesting and yet discouraging features. Research into patient and disease characteristics which might predict future disease course has produced conflicting results. This thesis presents an original approach in which the course of the disease is described by the movement of patients through well defined disease states. Two probabilistic models: the semi-Markov and the stochastic survival model are proposed to evaluate the effect of prognostic factors on transitions from state to state. The feasibility and applicability of both models is evaluated using data on the course of multiple sclerosis in 278 diagnosed patients from L'hopital Neurologique de Lyon who were followed from 1956-1976. The stochastic survival model is found to be the most appropriate. A short first remission, male sex, and multiple symptoms at onset are found to increase the risk of a poor prognosis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tg17k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472x184</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451j33r"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Upper urinary tract stones and dietary habits</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gagnon, Gilbert, 1954-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of the present study was to determine the relationship between dietary intake and the formation of idiopathic upper urinary tract stones. More specifically, the aim of this study was to test the relationship between the formation of idiopathic upper urinary tract stones and diet in new cases and demonstrate how the inclusion of recurrent cases in a study could affect the relationship mentioned above. A case-control approach was used. A total of 61 new cases was compared to 58 controls. A parallel analysis was made for 62 recurrent cases and 59 controls in order to demonstrate the possible effect of dietary advice received in the past in relation to previous episodes of kidney stones. All controls were selected from patients who had an intravenous pyelogram for a reason other than one related to the formation of a kidney stone and were matched to cases for age and sex. The dietary history of patients was established and constituted the main part of a home interview. Logistic regression was used and potential confounding factors were adjusted for, including family history of stones, ethnic group, and source of the patients. Some differences in nutrient intake were observed between new cases and their controls. Differences involved oxalates, vitamin D and the combination of proteins, purines and magnesium. As the direction of the observed differences did not fit the research hypotheses and likely explanations were found, it was concluded that there was no relationship between diet and kidney stone formation. The analysis involving recurrent cases and their controls revealed that there was effectively a dietary bias which affected the estimated intake of calcium, water, magnesium, purines, and possibly proteins and vitamin C as well. It is concluded that any case-control study on kidney stone formation should be done separately for new and recurrent cases.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n203z91c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451j33r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asf268594d"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular cloning of measles virus nucleic acid sequences</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Greer, Peter Alan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A library of cDNA clones was prepared from measles virus infected cells. Six classes of viral specific cDNA sequences were identified by a combination of Northern and Southern blot hybridization analysis. Clones corresponding to measles virus NP, P/C and M genes were initially identified by hybridization selection translation experiments. Restriction mapping analysis and comparison with the recently published nucleic acid sequences have confirmed the identities of these clones. The cloned sequences corresponding to the NP and M genes were subcloned into a plasmid vector which contains the Salmonella phage SP6 promoter sequence. These constructions facilitated the in vitro synthesis of RNA. This cloned RNA was subsequently translated in vitro, giving rise to the measles virus NP and M proteins. In addition to the full length NP and M proteins, smaller peptides were observed in this in vitro expression system. The series of smaller peptides made from the cloned NP RNA appear to correlate with NP-related peptides which are seen in extracts prepared from infected cells. The other three classes of viral specific clones could not be conclusively identified by hybridization selection translation experiments. However, northern blot hybridization analysis enabled a tentative assignment of these three cloned sequences to the measles virus HA, F and L genes. The clone corresponding to the F protein was subsequently expressed in vitro using the SP6 transcription vector system described above.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tv90g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf268594d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s1616937"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The myelin-associated glycoprotein in development and disease</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Frail, Donald E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) has been identified as the antigen for an IgM paraprotein present in some patients with peripheral neuropathy. The immunochemical characteristics of the MAG epitope recognized by the IgM indicate that the same epitope is recognized by all patients and that carbohydrate is an essential component of this epitope. The synthesis of mouse MAG during development has also been studied. Two developmentally regulated MAG polypeptides have been characterized in the central nervous system (CNS) and it appears that two MAG proteins exist in-vivo. The developmental synthesis of the two MAG polypeptides was abnormal in the CNS of two dysmyelinating mutants. Finally, it appears that only one polypeptide is synthesized in the peripheral nervous system. The role of MAG in both demyelinating diseases and in normal myelination is discussed in the light of these observations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343s940.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s1616937</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296wz829"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A telephone reassurance service for the elderly : an evaluation study of a natural support system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>King, Hinda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is an evaluation of a natural support system, a community-based programme serving the aged living alone.

Segregation by age and sex within this population is evident, with summering groups consisting of mature females with calves, immature and maturing males, and large mature males. The diet consists of arctic cod, shrimp, and squid during June and July, but feeding activity declines markedly during the open-water months of August and September. Growth layers in the unerupted teeth and periosteal zone of the mandible were found to be related to age but absolute rates of accumulation of these layers are uncertain. The maximum life span is estimated to be 40 to 50 years. Male narwhals, which mature sexually at lengths exceeding 390 cm and at 16-17 growth layers, display protracted maturation and a possible annual cycle of spermatogenesis. Females, which mature sexually at lengths exceeding 340 cm and at 12 growth layers, are seasonally polyoestrous, experiencing up to four consecutive ovulations during the breeding season. The gestation period is estimated to be 15.3 months. The season of conceptions is March to May and calving occurs during July and August. Since the lactation period exceeds 12 months, the interval between successive conceptions is usually three years, but about 20% of females conceive at the first breeding season following birth of their calves. The annual population birth rate is calculated to be about 0.07. The basic life history features of the narwhal are similar to those of other medium-sized toothed whales.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333302m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rf31m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mammals -- Arctic Ocean</dc:subject><dc:subject>Narwhal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mg241"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Logical and sheaf theoretic methods in the study of geometric fields in sheaf toposes over Boolean spaces and applications to Von Neumann regular rings</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacCaull, Wendy Alwilda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We investigate some properties of (geometric) fields in toposes of sheaves over Boolean spaces and establish the internal validity of a number of classical theorems from Algebraic Geometry and the theory of ordered fields.

Most faculty members reported doing some work on improving their teaching, but they were likely to engage in these activities only when they saw a problem and felt it was solvable; they used improvement services only when those services were seen as relevant and necessary to the solution (which was rare).
