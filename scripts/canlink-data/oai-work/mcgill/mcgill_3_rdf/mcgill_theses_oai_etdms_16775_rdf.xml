Studies of the employment interview have not, in general, been concerned with the manner in which the interviewer reaches his decision. Interest has been focused on the reliability of the decision and on its validity as a predictor of job success. The empirical nature of these studies has resulted partly from concern with the immediate applied problems of improving personnel selection and partly from the difficulty of conceptualizing the development of perceptual and cognitive processes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webster, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514np969.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816r14v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583xz72x"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Geographic and occupational wage differentials in Quebec and Ontario</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Amery, Anthony. D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Public and professional interest in wage determination has, in the past, been occupied with an analysis of the determination of the level of wages, both absolutely and relatively to the rewards of the other factors of production. Consequently any analysis of the wage structure has been given relatively minor attention. But the issue of what the wage structure should be, and how it is determined, is just as important as the larger questions of the determination of the wage level and the distribution of the proceeds of production between the labour and the other factors of production.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Asimakopulos, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gx37c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583xz72x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nf755"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Synthesis and behaviour of RNA as shown by radioautography in mouse tissues in vivo</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Amano, Minoru</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Progress in the investigation of nucleic acids has been unexpectedly rapid during the past decade. They, like proteins, carbohydrates and fats, have been recognized as indispensable constituents of all living organisms and, indeed, of all tissues. Two, and only two, kinds of nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), have been identified in living tissues. The morphological evidences of nuclear conjugation at fertilization, and the succeeding nuclear divisions led to the belief that the main genetic material is in the nucleus and consists of the nuclear chromatin.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jf82t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nf755</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
