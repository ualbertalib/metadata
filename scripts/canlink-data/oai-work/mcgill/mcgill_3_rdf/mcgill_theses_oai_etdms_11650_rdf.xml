The remaining 10 stars could, on the basis of energy and momentum criteria, be attributed to either of the above disintegration processes but the balance of evidence is in favour of the 0^16 (n, α) 0^13 reaction. Further evidence for the O^16 (n, nα) O^12 reaction was found in the coincidence of energy levels in O^16 calculated on the basis of this reaction with known energy levels. Evidence was also obtained for the existence of the proposed 9.8 Mev. level in oxygen. The relative probabilities of the two reactions mentioned above are compared at different incident neutron energies.

Over a century ago, histologists and cytologists were already puzzled by the structure of this tissue. Some of the best histological works of the 1890’s were done in unraveling the complexity of this epithelium. In fact, some of the descriptions given by the workers of this time have remained classical until now. Recently, with the advent of histochemical techniques and of the electron microscope, there has been a renewed interest in the study of the seminiferous epithelium. Several important problems had indeed remained unsolved. Some of them were histological, e.g. the arrangement of the various types of cells present in the epithelium, that is spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids, in a series of different combinations. Others were cytological, e.g. the complex series of changes taking place during the transformation of a spermatid into a spermatozoon. others, finally, were endocrinological, e.g. the relationship between the male hormone-secreting Leydig cell and the production of Spermatozoa by the seminiferous epithelium. The first two of these problems will be examined systematically in the present study.

Indeed nothing has heretofore been published about the bacteria and yeasts that are indigenous to Canadian apples. Research about the microflora of fruit has been directed, for the most part, toward establishing the effects of preservatives on the keeping quality of fruit and fruit products. Few studies have been made, however, to determine the types and respective numbers of microorganisms initially present on fruit. There seems to be little doubt that the amount of preservative and the type of preservation used for fruit and fruit products depend to a great extent on the types of organisms initially present. For instance, the keeping quality of apple juice before it is bottled depends largely upon the initial contamination of the fruit with spoilage microorganisms [...] The present study was undertaken to isolate and classify a number of the most predominant yeasts occurring on apples grown at two widely separated places in Quebec. The study also included an investigation of the yeasts found in apple cider that was fermented and allowed to mature under natural conditions for one year, and the rate and factors affecting the rate of alcohol production by fermenting yeasts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wallace, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494c517.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n1710</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bacteriology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajh343w23n"><ual:graduationDate>1947</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The toxic effects of coccidiostatic sulphonamides in chickens</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Frank, Julius</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The common domestic fowl harbours a number of protozoan parasites of the Genus Elmerla; the most important of these is Elmerla tenella. the cause of caecal coccldiosls in chicks.

The study includes investigation of a wide variety of blood components, data for which were previously available only as isolated findings. It has been shown that there is a close relationship between the peripheral venous oxygen saturation and the clinical condition of the patient. The use of observations on the character of the peripheral veins as a criterion in the clinical assessment of casualties, has been demonstrated to have a metabolic basis. The crucial condition of peripheral oxygen supply in desperately wounded cases has been established, and with it the reasons why blood may be of greater value than plasma in the resuscitation of these casualties. The metabolic disturbances of abdominal casualties have been found to be essentially the same as those of extremity cases. It has been shown that adequate transfusion is essential for correction of the metabolic disturbances in both extremity and abdominal cases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hoff, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nm387.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qv986</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r183j"><ual:graduationDate>1947</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le Courrier anglais de Stendhal : ses jugements sur la politique et la litterature</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lenoir, Norah Marguerite</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>En juin 1821, Beyle quitte brusquement Milan qu’il habité depuis sept ans.

The epidermis is derived from the embryonic ectoderm,while the gastrodermis is formed of the endoderm. Whether the sexual products originate from any particular layer, or whether there exists a sexual polarity between the two layers, has long attracted the attention of zoologists since the enunciation of von Baer’s germ-layer theory.

Present indications are that this shortage is likely to continue, in view of an expanding livestock industry, increased consciousness of the importance of proteins on the part of feeders, and the world food situation in general. Consequently, a widespread search is being conducted for new materials to serve in this capacity, and information on their efficiency as protein supplements is important with a view to recommending their most efficient use. The most acute shortage has occurred in the case of proteins of animal and marine origin. Among the factors contributing to this situation have been government encouragement of the production of swine for export, transportation problems involved in moving fish meal from the seaboards, and increased poultry production due to a shortage of beef. In the past, animal and marine protein concentrates have been highly regarded as supplements in livestock rations, and considerable evidence was accumulated indicating their superiority over concentrates of vegetable origin. Recently, however, this evience has been questioned and it is suggested that the superiority of animal proteins may be due in part to the fact that they contain liberal amounts of minerals and vitamins in which vegetable proteins are usually deficient.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Crampton, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935611b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dg82p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nutrition</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atb09j858k"><ual:graduationDate>1947</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Part I. ammonia-soda process applied to sodium sulphate. : Part II.

During the war years works had been erected in western Canada for the production of large quantities of ammonia, and it was desirable that a peacetime use for this chemicalbe found. Furthennore there are large supplies of sodiumsulphate in the Canadian west. The world-wide success ofthe ammonia-soda process applied to sodium chloride led to the inquiry as to whether the same process could be applied to sodium sulphate. Preliminary investigation indicated that the formation of sodium bicarbonate would present no difficulty, and that the chief problem would be in recovering ammonia from the ammonium sulphate formed, or in finding some method of removing It from the solutions. It was while considering this problem that the author was led to conceive of ammonia as a precipitating agent for ammonium sulphate. The object of this brief investigation was merely to establish the principles involved and to outline in a general way the proposed process.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z408j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j858k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
