Data was collected from three basic sources: public opinion surveys, a sample of election candidates, and the editorial columns of twenty Canadian daily newspapers. It is the contention of the author that the 1965 campaign and certain related events constitute a microcosm of the period 1960-1965 and that this period represents a unique phase in the history of Canadian federalism. Evidence is adduced to illustrate the essential nature of the twin crises of English-French and federal-provincial relations and to support thee hypothesis that, while destined to interact, each of these problems had its own independent origin and source of dynamism. Finally, it is argued that, because of increasing regionalism, serious faults within the party system and other factors, neither problem was handled satisfactorily during the period under study.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Frankel, Saul</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p777x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bs544</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada -- English-French relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Federal government -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Sciences, Political Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Elections -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
