Cette thèse se veut une analyse approfondie de ces cinq traductions et de leur évolution, dans l'objectif de caractériser la poétique de traducteur d'Yves Bonnefoy. Pour ce faire, nous examinons dans notre première section le rapport de Bonnefoy à la poésie et à la traduction, puis à Shakespeare et à Hamlet afin de contextualiser les traductions et de définir la position traduisante et le projet de traduction de Bonnefoy, selon la méthode proposée par Antoine Berman. La seconde section est consacrée à l'analyse proprement dite, que nous entamons en donnant un aperçu des traductions de Bonnefoy à travers deux passages de la pièce, avant de nous lancer dans l'analyse détaillée des traductions. Dans le cadre de celle-ci, nous cherchons à caractériser les traductions de Bonnefoy au niveau lexical, syntaxique et poétique : Bonnefoy est-il fidèle au texte original ou davantage créateur ? Parvient-il à allier les dimensions éthique et poétique du traduire ? Nous avançons l'hypothèse selon laquelle les deux notions de dialogue et de dialectique sont deux outils conceptuels qui nous permettent de décrire la pratique traduisante de Bonnefoy telle qu'elle se manifeste dans les cinq traductions de Hamlet. Ces deux concepts mettent en jeu la notion de voix : qui de Shakespeare ou de Bonnefoy est le plus audible dans les cinq traductions ? Enfin, l'analyse détaillée est suivie d'un commentaire et d'une critique des traductions, qui passe par une confrontation des traductions au projet du traducteur. Les notions de dialogue et de dialectique sont complétées par celle de ré-énonciation, afin de redéfinir et de caractériser plus avant la fidélité et la création telles que Bonnefoy les pratique. Nous réexaminons le pôle de la création à l'aide des notions traductologiques de domestication et d'appropriation. Finalement, tout en soulignant les écarts entre théorie et pratique, nous tentons de dégager le mouvement d'ensemble des traductions de Bonnefoy et de mettre en valeur l'originalité de sa poétique de traducteur.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Between 1957 and 1988, the contemporary French poet Yves Bonnefoy translated Shakespeare's Hamlet five times. This thesis is an in-depth analysis of these five translations and of their evolution: above all, it explores Yves Bonnefoy's poetics of translation. The first section examines Bonnefoy's articulated understanding of poetry, translation and their relationship, but also of Shakespeare and Hamlet, in order to contextualize the translations and define Bonnefoy's approach to the translation process (position traductive) and his translation project, according to the method proposed by Antoine Berman. The second section provides a survey of Bonnefoy's translations through the study of two passages of the play, followed by a detailed analysis. The objective is to characterize Bonnefoy's translations at the lexical, syntactic and poetic levels. Questions addressed in this section include: Is Bonnefoy faithful to the original text, or does he translate creatively? Does he successfully combine the ethical and poetic dimensions of translation? We will explore Bonnefoy's translation poetics and practice through the hypothesis that the notions of dialogue and dialectics are the most appropriate conceptual tools for describing his translation practice as revealed in the five translations of Hamlet. These two concepts also involve the notion of voice, and one is moved to enquire whose is more audible in these five versions, Shakespeare's or Bonnefoy's. The detailed analysis is followed by a critical examination of Bonnefoy's five versions of Hamlet by means of a forced confrontation between the poet's texts and his declared translation project. Here, the notion of re-enunciation is introduced in order to complement the ideas of dialogue and dialectic, and thereby re-define and better characterize the faithfulness and the creativity practiced by Bonnefoy. The creative aspect of translating is re-examined through the concepts of domesticating and appropriating. Finally, while exposing the gaps between theory and practice in Bonnefoy's oeuvre as a translator, this thesis aims at defining the general trend of Bonnefoy's translations while emphasizing his originality as a translator.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gillian Lane</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956g25j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q442r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Literature - Comparative</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb397875z"><ual:graduationDate>2010</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Statistical methods for out-of-plane ultrasound transducer motion estimation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Laporte, Catherine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>L'échographie 3D main-libre consiste habituellement à déplacer et à mesurer le déplacement d'une sonde échographique 2D conventionnelle au-dessus d'un sujet et à créer un volume à partir des images qui sera ensuite interprété dans un but médical. Puisque les capteurs de position externes peuvent être encombrants, il y a un intérêt à calculer la trajectoire de la sonde à partir des images elles-mêmes. Cette thèse se penche sur de nouvelles méthodes pour le calcul de la composante hors-plan de la trajectoire de la sonde utilisant la relation prédictive entre la décorrélation hors-plan du speckle échographique et le déplacement de la sonde. Afin de résoudre les ambiguïtés directionnelles associées à cette approche, un nouveau cadre d'opérations est proposé. Ce cadre combine des techniques d'optimisation combinatoire et des techniques statistiques robustes pour détecter les mouvements non-monotones et les intersections entre les images. Pour tenir compte de la variabilité du coefficient de corrélation échantillonnaire entre deux portions d'images de speckle pleinement développé correspondantes, un nouveau modèle probabiliste de la décorrélation du speckle est développé. Ce modèle permet de quantifier l'incertitude associée à l'estimé d'un déplacement, facilitant ainsi l'utilisation d'une nouvelle approche de maximisation de la vraisemblance pour l'estimation de la trajectoire hors-plan qui exploite pleinement l'information rendue disponible par des mesures de corrélation multiples et redondantes acquises dans des images de speckle pleinement développé. Afin de généraliser l'applicabilité de ces méthodes au cas d'images de tissus véritables, un nouvel algorithme guidé par les données est proposé pour l'estimation de la longueur de corrélation hors-plan locale à partir d'attributs statistiques acquis à même le plan image.

Tracking devices can be cumbersome; thus, there is interest in inferring the trajectory of the transducer based on the images themselves. This thesis focuses on new methods for the recovery of the out-of-plane component of the transducer trajectory using the predictive relationship between the elevational decorrelation of ultrasound speckle patterns and transducer displacement. To resolve the directional ambiguities associated with this approach, combinatorial optimisation techniques and robust statistics are combined to recover non-monotonic motion and frame intersections. In order to account for the variability of the sample correlation coefficient between corresponding image patches of fully developed speckle, a new probabilistic speckle decorrelation model is developed. This model can be used to quantify the uncertainty of any displacement estimate, thereby facilitating the use of a new maximum likelihood out-of-plane trajectory estimation approach which fully exploits the information available from multiple redundant and noisy correlation measurements collected in imagery of fully developed speckle. To generalise the applicability of these methods to the case of imagery of real tissue, a new data-driven method is proposed for locally estimating elevational correlation length based on statistical features collected within the image plane. In this approach, the relationship between the image features and local elevational correlation length is learned by sparse Gaussian process regression using a training set of synthetic ultrasound image sequences. The synthetic imagery used for learning is created via a new statistical model for the spatial distribution of ultrasound scatterers which maps realisations of a 1D generalised Poisson point process to a 3D Hilbert space-filli</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tal Arbel</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gg87z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397875z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Biomedical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462592b"><ual:graduationDate>2010</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The spirit of sound:prosodic method in the poetry of William Blake, W.B.

S. Eliot, et il explore la relation entre les structures poétiques du son et les buts spirituels de chaque poète. L'argumentaire du projet soutient que dans les poèmes prophétiques de Blake, The Four Zoas, Milton, et Jerusalem, dans la poésie du milieu et de la fin de la carrière de Yeats, et dans la poésie après-conversion d'Eliot la structuration attentive des figures non-sémantiques du langage sert à façonner un processus à travers lequel on pourrait arriver au seuil de la réalité spirituelle. L'introduction sert à situer les oeuvres des trois poètes dans le genre de l'écriture mystique, à établir la nature épistémologique du son poétique et de sa relation à l'expression mystique, à considérer les exigences historiques et personnelles qui ont influencé les choix prosodiques de chaque poète, et à cerner la méthode prosodique selon laquelle on scande leur poésie. Le premier chapitre aborde les efforts de William Blake de revoir l'épopée chrétienne Paradise Lost de Milton selon une prosodie logaédique dont l'intention est de transporter le lecteur d'une perception rationnelle à une perception spirituelle de soi et du monde. Le deuxième chapitre considère le développement de la prosodie en contrepoint de W. B. Yeats comme étant intégral à sa tentative de se construire en tant que poète moderne et à sa philosophie mystique antithétique. Le chapitre trois examine la prosodie liminale de T. S. Eliot avec laquelle il crée un mouvement incantatoire qui indique une réalité spirituelle derrière la réalité matérielle. La conclusion prend en considération les buts spirituels de Gerald Manley Hopkins et H. D. (Hilda Doolittle) afin de postuler une réévaluation du rythme à ressorts d'Hopkins et l'enchaînement révisionnel du son d'H. D. en tant que pratiques prosodiques intrinsèque à leurs buts spirituels.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>This project focuses on the prosody of three major poets, William Blake, W. B. Yeats, and T. S. Eliot. It explores the relationship between each poet's poetic sound structures and his spiritual aims. The project argues that in Blake's prophetic poems The Four Zoas, Milton, and Jerusalem, in Yeats's middle and late poetry, and in Eliot's post-conversion poetry, the careful structuring of the non-semantic features of language serves to model a process through which one may arrive at the threshold of a spiritual reality. The introductory chapter situates these poets' works within the genre of mystical writing; establishes the epistemological nature of poetic sound and its relationship to mystical expression; considers the historical and personal exigencies that influence each poet's prosodic choices; and outlines the prosodic method by which their poetry is scanned. Chapter one addresses William Blake's efforts to re-vision Milton's Christian epic Paradise Lost by means of a logaoedic prosody intended to move the reader from a rational to a spiritual perception of the self and the world. Chapter two considers the development of W.B. Yeats's contrapuntal prosody as integral to his attempt to make of himself a modern poet and to his antithetical mystical philosophy. Chapter three explores the liminal prosody of T. S. Eliot by which he creates an incantatory movement that points to a spiritual reality behind material reality. The project concludes with a consideration of the spiritual aims of Gerard Manley Hopkins and H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) and posits a revaluation of Hopkins' sprung rhythm and H.D.'s revisionary chain of sound as prosodic practices intrinsic to their spiritual aims.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Miranda Brun Hickman</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f864c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462592b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Literature - English</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784m30t"><ual:graduationDate>2010</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nephrin mediated signaling in actin organization of podocyte</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhu, Jian Xin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Les podocytes sont des cellules épithéliales fortement différenciées qui contribuent à la barrière de filtration sélective du glomérule rénal.

La dynamique de la régulation du cytosquelette d'actine podocyte est vitale pour la fonction rénale. La néphrine, identifiée comme une protéine d'une micro-membrane, relie les processus de pied des podocytes adjacents, ce qui est essentiel pour l'intégrité structurelle et fonctionnelle des podocytes. Il a été rapporté que la phosphorylation de la tyrosine de la néphrine est responsable de son interaction avec la kinase-PI3 et le NCK.

The actin-based podocyte foot processes possess a subplasmalemmal actin network and a central core of actin filament bundles. The dynamic regulation of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton is vital to kidney function. Nephrin, identified as a slit diaphragm protein, connects foot processes from adjacent podocytes, which is critical for the structural and functional integrity of podocytes. It has been reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of nephrin was responsible for its interaction with PI3-kinase and Nck. PI3-kinase and Nck-Pak signalings are well known regulators of actin dynamics. Therefore, we studied the role of PI3-kinase and Nck-Pak signalings activated via the tyrosine phosphorylation of nephrin, in actin cytoskeleton organization of cultured podocytes. We identified that Y1152 of rat nephrin was responsible for nephrin -PI3K interaction. Stable transfection of rat nephrin in the podocytes with podocin led to nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation, PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt, increased Rac1 and Pak activity, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization with decreased stress fiber and increased lamellipodia. These actin cytoskeleton changes were reversed with an inhibitor of PI3K and not seen when the nephrin mutant Y1152F replaced wild type nephrin. Pak was coimmunoprecipitated with nephrin and Nck in vitro and in vivo.  The nephrin increased Pak phosphorylation was completely abolished by a nephrin mutantY1208/1224F (fail to bind Nck), but not affected by the Rac1 inhibitor. Dominant negative Nck constructs blocked Pak1 phosphorylation induced by antibody-mediated cross-linking of nephrin.

I draw from post-traditionalist sociology for my theoretical framework.  I conducted face-to-face individual interviews to develop a collective and individual understanding of the perceptions of seven Indo-Canadian teenage males from four cities in British Columbia.  Results indicate that their educational and personal identities are constructed more in relation to their daily social interactions and less in relation to traditional Punjabi cultural norms.  Results from the student interviews reveal that they negotiate their identities in relation to social interactions that are always shifting.  A pattern emerged whereby the participants are constantly trying to find a sense of self and belonging as they discuss how they identify themselves and their place in relation to school, family, culture, and peer groups.  This study has implications for educators and for second generation identity studies.  Increasing ethnic and cultural diversity creates a need for educators to encourage and embrace the involvement of parents from the often reluctant Punjabi community.  Understanding and recognizing the different ways these youth develop their identities may enable educators and identity researchers to confront the growing academic underachievement of Indo-Canadian high school male youths.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Cette étude de cas de nature qualitative décrit et analyse l'identité scolaire d'élèves masculins Indo-Canadiens de deuxième génération fréquentant l'école secondaire.

Des entrevues individuelles ont été menées afin de développer une compréhension collective et individuelle de la perception de sept adolescents masculins d'origine Indo-Canadienne provenant de quatre villes de Colombie-Britannique. Les résultats indiquent que leur identité scolaire et personnelle se construit davantage en fonction de leurs interactions sociales quotidiennes plutôt que selon les normes culturelles Punjabi. Les données d'entrevues révèlent que ces élèves négocient leur identité en lien avec des interactions sociales toujours changeantes. Les résultats suggèrent l'émergence d'un mode selon lequel les participants tentent constamment de trouver un sens de soi et un sentiment d'appartenance en lien avec la façon dont ils s'identifient et à la place qu'ils occupent dans leurs écoles, leurs familles, leur culture et leurs groupes de pairs. Cette étude a des implications pour les agents d'éducation ainsi que pour les études concernant le développement de l'identité d'immigrants de deuxième génération. Une plus grande diversité ethnique et culturelle requiert des agents d'éducation qu'ils encouragent et acceptent l'implication des parents, souvent réticents, de la communauté Punjabi.

A  recent shift from "fences and fines" to "devolved" conservation  at Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in Cabayugan has been lauded in  government and non-governmental circles to support Tagbanua livelihoods while  preserving the rain forest. Concurrently, however, the Tagbanua have adjusted to  migrants dispossessing them of land, controlling the trade in forest products, and  the means of agricultural production. Given that conservation and local resource  access and use now intersect, this study asks whether "community-based"  conservation can fulfill its own objectives while addressing older disparities in  social relations of production and exchange. A history of national park and cadastral zoning has restricted  Tagbanua access to forest resources while supporting settler migration onto public  lands. The two-way process of park zoning and migrant control over trade and  productive resources has become interrelated and shaped the evolution of  conservation in Cabayugan from 1971-2001. Although older "fences and  fines" criminalized traditional resource uses, such as swidden (kaingin), and  supported state interests in expanding paddy rice cultivation (basakan ), newer  community-based approaches have carried on this agenda. Going against its purported  benefits, such conservation has supported the livelihoods of dominant households,  both politically and economically. Over time, these households have used political  economic opportunities to build on and influence how projects support their  livelihoods, which has exacerbated socio-economic differences between both social  groups. As a result, conservation practitioners have continued to tie into and  support wealthier households' production, while fulfilling the state's agenda of  curbing swidden. Confined to unequal trade and restrictions over swidden, Tagbanua  livelihoods remain vulnerable and have difficulty sustaining paddy rice. With few  options to reinvest, they fail to access those socio-political and economic networks  that enable participation in projects that support more lucrative cultivation.  Despite good intentions, current attempts by state practitioners and  non-governmental organizations at livelihood development for conservation have  proven to be more divisive than effective.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bp715.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pd473</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Forest conservation -- Philippines -- Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park</dc:subject><dc:subject>Non-timber forest resources -- Philippines -- Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tagbanua (Philippine people) -- Land tenure -- Philippines</dc:subject><dc:subject>Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park (Philippines)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36tz01x"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>All negotiations are not perceived equal : the impact of culture and personality on cognitions, behaviors, and outcomes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ma, Zhenzhong, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Culture and personality have been two of the most-studied  factors in negotiation research, yet only limited evidence has been provided for  their impact on negotiation behaviors and outcomes. This dissertation first reviews  the development of negotiation research and explores an emergent body of negotiation  studies that integrate cognitive and social factors into the examination of the  negotiation process (Bazerman, Curhan, Moore, &amp; Valley, 2000). A mental model of  dyadic negotiation is proposed to incorporate the principles from social cognition  research, whereby negotiation is seen as a cognitive decision-making process with  involved parties defining what are appropriate objects of the dispute and what are  acceptable behaviors and tactics. Within this framework, negotiator's cultural  background, personality, and interpersonal relationship with counterpart jointly  determine negotiator's cognitions, which further determine negotiation process  (Barry &amp; Friedman, 1998; Thompson, 1990, 1998). A laboratory experiment is then designed to explore the effects  of culture and personality on: (1) negotiator cognitions---the mental  representations of the negotiation situation, issues, and negotiation partners, (2)  competitive, collaborative, and yielding negotiation behaviors, and (3) economic and  affective negotiation outcomes. Three important negotiator cognitions, win-lose orientation,  face-saving, and trust, are empirically tested in this study. Results suggest that  negotiator cognitions do mediate the impact of personality and culture on  negotiation process. Similarly, the impact of negotiator cognitions on negotiation  outcomes is mediated by negotiation behaviors manifested during negotiation.  Specifically, final results show that individualistic negotiators tend to perceive  negotiation as a win-lose process and agreeable negotiators are more likely to trust  their counterparts. Results also show that extraversion, long-term orientation, and  collectivism are predictors of face-saving. Moreover, face-saving predicts  competitive behavior that leads to higher individual profits while trust determines  the level of collaboration that often leads to higher satisfaction. Practical  implications and future research are discussed in the final chapter.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f633j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz01x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Culture</dc:subject><dc:subject>Negotiation in business</dc:subject><dc:subject>Personality</dc:subject><dc:subject>Negotiation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xj166"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Literature, protestantism, and the idea of community</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lucas, Kristin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Protestant community is articulated through liturgy,  history, and drama. Liturgy teaches communal bonds and scripts their enactment,  while narrative and dramatic depictions of the collective past appeal to the  imagination of readers and viewers. Liturgy and literature are joined by the  participation they invite, which engages parishioners, readers, and audiences with  questions of affiliation and collectivity. Lack of attention to the ways Renaissance  texts pondered over and produced bonds of commonality has sidetracked us from the  communal nature of the period. We need to reevaluate such bonds to better understand  how English culture imagined relationships between individual and community, and  between people and institutions---including church and theatre. When orthodox  writing is treated as doctrine and praxis, and not as a means for political  indoctrination, we gain a different understanding of the potential for human  relationships, one more generous and reciprocal than the model of coercion that has  dominated literary studies. Such reciprocity is found in Church of England liturgy,  and in the imaginative space of Foxe's Acts and Monuments, which seeks to forge the  Protestant community through an ethics of reading. Imaginative space was also a  public space, and Shakespeare's King John and Marlowe's The Massacre at Paris  reflect upon religious affiliation in moments of war and atrocity; both plays  represent very tangled lines of identification that do not endorse  Catholic-Protestant factions but undo them. Religious writing and public theatre  explored the precarious balance between community and individual, offering readers  and audiences a vehicle for thinking about their own immediate lives and their sense  of belonging.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827c16t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xj166</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Community in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616.

It searches for solutions to  self-interest and agency costs, problems that it is posited are innate to the  anthropomorphism of the corporation and to the separation of management and  ownership of widely held, publicly traded, corporations. Practically, this dissertation is anchored in experience,  garnered from empirical research, based on in depth and general surveys, as well as  detailed interviews. It examines the workings of corporations, including their  boards of directors, of gatekeepers, of checks and balances and of shareholders and  the relative importance and rationale for the roles that they play. Based on the  academic and empirical efforts it is posited that self-interest and the funneling  syndrome, (a process whereby information required for decision making is constrained  and managed by those in control), almost always predetermines the outcome of the  corporate formal decision making process involving the board of directors. This  facilitates abuse. When it occurs and there appears to be no accountability,  confidence essential to the capital markets, quite understandably,  suffers. A hypothesis is advanced to explain the complexity of a  potential failure of corporate governance through a relatively simple formula. It  draws conclusions as to what is required to help address the challenges raised by  the breakdown in effective corporate governance and to help instill greater investor  confidence. A self-assessment mechanism to help quantify how effectively a  corporation is dealing with corporate governance, both on an absolute basis  (comparing itself year over year) and on a relative basis (compared to one's peers)  is proffered. This tool of more effective corporate governance, seeks to identify  the causes for breakdowns in corporate governance and to assist a board of directors  in dealing more proactively with this challenge.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rx16f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz8060241</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corporate governance</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj4305249"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>L'oeuvre comme interaction : anti-textualisme, actionnalisme et ontologie écologique</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Martel, Marie D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we defend the view of works-as-interaction by  developing three independent arguments: the anti-textualist, the actionalist and the  ecological arguments. The anti-textualist argument has two parts. First, the uniform  category of text does not cover the diversity of types of literary works, as it is  shown by oral works, multiple-texts works, visual literary works and numerical  literary works. Second, we reject the idea that the text is sufficient to give the  identity conditions of the literary work. The latter argument forces us to include  the history of production and, in particular, of the generative actions required for  the apprehension and appreciation of the ontology of the literary work. This is the  historicist argument. However, before defending an actionalist point of view,  various alternatives are considered. Thus, we consider various textualist proposals  that claim to be able to accommodate historical aspects of the production of a work.  From the weaknesses of these views, we move to other, more historically inclined,  positions, in particular Levinson's post-textualist position. However, the latter is  based on a theory of types which we find to be incompatible with his historicist  inclinations. Moreover, Levison's views do not meet the requirements of an  epistemology of performance. Thus, the actional thesis seems to be the only  alternative left. Using Davies theory of performance as a springboard, we develop  and defend the idea of the work-as-interaction according to which a work consists in  a relation between the generative action and the integrative action. We also include  an ecological premise. We develop a further criticism of analytic aesthetics and the  theory of performance, arguing that the actions composing the environment, the  context of reception in which the generative action is integrated, have to be  included. Our thesis of work-as-interaction explains, on the side of the generative  act, a variety of li</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pd46t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj4305249</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Literature -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Art -- Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At148fh59f"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evolution of the payments system and the long-term demand for money in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liao, Weinian, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation starts by examining the evolution of the  Canadian payments system from a historical perspective by reviewing the  institutional evolution, as well as the development and adoption of some of the  newest payment instruments. Two major trends in recent Canadian payment history are  revealed, i.e., cash payments are being replaced by non-cash payments and  paper-based payment instruments are being replaced by electronic payment  instruments. Next, we adopt a model proposed by Snellman et al. (2000) to  conduct a Canadian study of the retail cash payment flows. The estimated results  imply that the share of cash, as well as cheques, in overall retail payments in  Canada has declined quite considerably. We then investigate the cash substitution  process, as well as the electronification of payments in Canada using S-shaped  growth curve models. Our results indicate that although the card payments will  continue to further substitute for cash, cash will still remain the preferred medium  of retail payments in Canada. However, approximately 80% of all payments are  forecasted to be electronic in just 20 years. This dissertation then extends the existing literature on the  long-run money demand relationship in Canada by employing information on the payment  technology development as an instrument variable to account for financial  innovations that might have caused structural shifts in the money demand equation.  The econometric methodology employed is cointegration and error-correction  modelling. It is found that our measure of financial innovations removes most of the  structural breaks in the money demand equation over the sample period. A unique and  significant long-run money demand relationship is detected. The short-run dynamic  specifications of the VECM system imply the weak exogeneity of output and interest  rates.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f866x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fh59f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electronic funds transfers -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Money -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Money supply -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1z40kt33t"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Transposon-mediated gene diversification</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Elrouby, Nabil</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Transposons are mobile genetic elements that have the potential  to cause mutations as a result of different aspects of their life cycle. Because  most of these mutations are detrimental and due to a selfish life cycle seemingly  aiming at increasing their numbers, transposons have been regarded as  "junk" DNA that contributes no evolutionary function to the host organism.  In this thesis, I argue that although most of the transposon-induced mutations are  detrimental, some may lead to benefits for the host and become adaptive. I discuss  recent evidence from the literature that points to several mechanisms by which  transposons and transposon activity may lead to the diversification of host genes  and gene functions. I also provide evidence that transposons have inserted in the 5'  flanking region of the gene coding for maize and teosinte auxin-binding protein 1  (Abp1). These transposons do not change the structure of the Abp1 transcripts but  may modulate Abp1 gene expression quantitatively. In addition, I document the first  case outside of oncogenic retroviruses, of a retrotransposon (called Bs1) that  transduced portions from three different maize genes. I show that the Bs1-associated  transduction events resulted in the formation of one uninterrupted open reading  frame that is both transcribed and translated in reproductive tissues. I suggest  that, such as in the case of Bs1, gene transduction by retroelements may be a  general mechanism for the evolution of new hybrid genes by the shuffling of host  sequences. I conclude that transposons are better regarded as means for the  generation of gene and genomic diversity. Natural selection will favor and fix  adaptive variants whereas detrimental mutations are likely to be purged out of the  population.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r139p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kt33t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corn -- Variation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transposons</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetic regulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zea -- Variation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw37637335"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The impact of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms on Canadian administrative law</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lambert, Nicolas C. G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms can be interpreted  in two ways regarding its relation with administrative law. First, as an alternative  statutory remedy against government; second, as a general democratic mandate to  reconsider the foundations of Canadian administrative law. Nevertheless, in spite of  the entrenchment of the Charter, the former interpretation has prevailed. Indeed,  since 1982, the Charter has developed as a distinct body of rights operating  separately from administrative law remedies. The interpretation of the Charter as a distinct statutory remedy  has caused problems in both the definition of administrative power under the Charter  and in the judicial review of administrative action. First, the interpretation of  the Charter as autonomous remedy has polarized the definition of administrative  power insofar as administrative authorities can either apply or not apply the  Charter. However, both solutions are extreme: administrative authorities are not  superior courts; conversely, the notwithstanding clause set aside, the power to give  effect to the Charter cannot validly be withdrawn. Second, at the judicial level,  even though it is part of the Constitution, the Charter has been treated as an  autonomous cause of action against government, thus distinct from inherent judicial  powers. This has prompted a separate regime of judicial power under the Charter, and  separate constitutional and administrative law standards of review. However, the autonomy of the Charter and administrative law, at  both administrative and judicial levels, is being reconciled through the integration  of the Charter into the process of statutory interpretation, thus minimizing the  distinction between "administrative law" and the "law of the  Charter".</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214p548.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w37637335</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada.

The work consists of a single movement, with a duration of approximately 15 minutes. The analysis focuses mainly on formal structure, pitch organization, texture and rhythm. Some of the main topics are: large-scale form and subdivisions of each section, thematic interrelations of the sections, central pitches, pitch collections, chord structure and interrelations between texture and rhythm. Throughout the course of the work, the music closely follows an overall process of searching for a valid structure and "core". In realizing this process the music takes on a variety of devices, among them: various kinds of symmetry within texture and form; thematic relations between separate sections through variants and material transformation; a coherent pitch organization which contains structural pitches, symmetrical collections and three main groups of chords; a complex and carefully structured rhythmic organization. The concluding section of this essay compares between some of the properties of a crystal and the structure of various parts in Crystallisation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gk30x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247ds61f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Orchestral music -- Analysis, appreciation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adler, Ayal.

The thermal fields are measured using cold-wire thermometry  in a flow with a Reynolds number (Uh/nu) of 10200. The transverse, total RMS temperature profiles are a function of  the separation distance between the line sources (d/h), their average wall-normal  position (ys_av/h), and the downstream location (x/h) (relative to the line  sources). The non-dimensional form of the scalar covariance, the correlation  coefficient (rho), is a function of the same parameters and quantifies the mixing of  the two scalars. In all cases, the transverse profiles of the correlation  coefficient flatten and tend towards 1 as x/h increases. The minimum value of the  correlation coefficient for a given transverse profile (rhomin) drifts towards the  wall for line source combinations that are not symmetric about the channel  centreline. (For profiles that are symmetric about the centreline, the minimum  correlation coefficient always occurs at the centreline.) The initial downstream  evolution of rhomin (and rhoys_av/h - the value of the correlation coefficient  measured at the average wall-normal source location) depend mostly on d/h.  Therefore, to an extent, the measured evolutions are similar to those in homogeneous  turbulence. However, the dependence on Ys_av/h is never entirely negligible. At a  certain downstream position, the (inhomogeneous) high turbulence intensity (found  near the wall) serves to accelerate the scalar mixing. For line source combinations that are not influenced by the  above-mentioned, near-wall, high turbulence intensities, spectral analysis indicates  that the degree of mixing across scales is relatively constant for the range of  parameters studied herein. In the case of near-wall mixing, the large scales were  found to evolve more rapidly. This presumably derives from the large-scale nature of  turbulence production, which is strong in the nearwall region.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074v67t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375w830</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tm505"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Why 1839? : the philosophy of vision and the invention of photography</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Delmas, Didier</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>1826 is the date attributed to the very first known photograph,  Nicephore Niepce's "View from the Window at Gras." For traditional  historians of photography this date marks the moment when the genius of man was  finally able to merge the knowledge of chemistry with that of optics to create the  most amazing technology of visual representation. However, those same historians  recognize that the two essential components of photography---the camera and the  properties of silver halides---had been known for centuries before the first  photograph was ever taken. This thesis explores two fundamental questions: Why wasn't  photography invented soon after its major technological components were discovered  c. 1650? And why was it invented in the early decades of the nineteenth century c.  1830? This gap of some 200 years separating the feasibility of photography from its  actualization has remained largely unexplained. The answers to both questions is found by situating the  genealogy of the invention of photography within the development of the Western  philosophy of vision. The fact that photography was invented at the junction of the  Classical and Modern epistemes offers a unique opportunity to approach the history  of photography from the perspective of the history of thought. Hence this thesis  takes its inspiration from the work of Michel Foucault and some of his  followers---in particular Jonathan Crary and Geoffrey Batchen. The result of this  radical shift from the technical to the intellectual environment allows the history  of photography to transcend the narrow confines of technology and formal  appearances. From a Foucauldian perspective I argue that photography was invented as  a response to the epistemic instability experienced during the transition from the  Enlightenment to Modernity.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qj223.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tm505</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vision -- Philosophy -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Photography -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Photography -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahx11xf77k"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of prenatal maternal stress on the development of attention problems in five-year-old children</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Morin, Mariko Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Research indicates a relationship between prenatal maternal  stress (PNMS) and attention levels in children. Studies with non-human primates  suggest that both exposure to PNMS and the timing of a stressor during pregnancy are  associated with greater attention problems in offspring; however, this has not been  sufficiently tested in humans because of methodological constraints. We explored the  relationship between objective and subjective measures of PNMS for 85 women who were  pregnant during the 1998 Quebec Ice Storm and attention levels in their 5.5 year-old  children, while controlling for socioeconomic status, child's sex, and maternal  state anxiety. As a group, children in the study displayed significantly less  attentive behaviour compared to a standardized norm. Boys in this group were  significantly less attentive than girls. Objective PNMS exposure during 1st  trimester correlated positively with attention problems in the children, accounting  for 15.2% of the variance in attention levels as rated by Kindergarten teachers. In  a behavioural task to detect sustained attention difficulties and Attention  Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms, children exposed during the 3rd  trimester obtained significantly worse scores compared to children exposed in other  trimesters. However, in this case, objective and subjective PNMS appeared to act as  protective factors, raising the possibility of the presence of another unknown  mechanism that negatively affected the attention variables.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jv15j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xf77k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stress (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pregnancy -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct44d"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A historiography of idealized portraits of women in Renaissance Italy : the idea of beauty in Titian's La Bella</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rosshandler, Michelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Renaissance art historians concur that women were  characteristically depicted as ideal types in Renaissance portraiture. Nonetheless,  the historiography of portraits of women in Renaissance Italy reveals generational  shifts between scholars. Male scholars writing in the nineteenth-century to the mid  twentieth-century applied formalist and cultural historical methodologies. Recent  scholars raise issues that were previously neglected, such as social historical and  feminist concerns. Following this rationale, I argue that the changing interests of  scholars have altered the interpretations of portraits of Renaissance women.  Moreover, this historical difference is split along gender lines in the  historiography of Titian's La Bella. A critical review of the literature on this  painting shows that male scholars, such as John Pope-Hennessey, Harold E. Wethey,  and Charles Hope define the work in formal terms, such as "charming" and  "pretty," whereas female scholars such as Elizabeth Cropper, Patricia  Simons and Rona Goffen concur the work to be a synecdoche for the beauty of painting  itself. A historiography of Titian as a portrait painter confirms that recent  scholars have shifted focus from formal studies to an assessment of the social  context, conditions of patronage and the feminist issues surrounding the artist's  portraits.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv11f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17ct44d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women in art</dc:subject><dc:subject>Titian, ca. 1488-1576 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Portrait painting, Renaissance -- Italy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kg86f"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identity and language at a multiethnic elementary school : what can be learned in a fifteen-minute interview?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ross, Christopher W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This qualitative inquiry describes the linguistic perspectives  of eighteen grade six students at Ecole Duncan, a multiethnic primary school (grades  K-6) located in Park Extension, an inner-city neighbourhood of Montreal. Employing  standard tools of ethnographic enquiry, such as interviews and participant  observation, I examined the childrens' perception of the interplay of language and  identity, and rooted the inquiry within the theoretical framework of social  constructivist learning. The key element of the lived experiences of these children  that surface in the data is that their perceptions and experiences are largely  determined by a sense of belonging and opportunities to participate in the life of  their communities. I conceptualize students' language learning as a social practice,  and identity as being socially constructed, contradictory, and subject to change  over time. Rampton's concepts of expertise, affiliation and inheritance are used in  the theoretical framework. The major assumption of this study is that social factors  influence children's identities, which has a reciprocal effect upon their language  learning. This inquiry has implications for policy makers, educators and  families.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn009z305.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kg86f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Language</dc:subject><dc:subject>Identity (Psychology) -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociolinguistics -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wq725"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The vanishing commons : tenure reform, individuation and dispossession of land in the pastoral rangelands of Kajiado District, Kenya</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Moiko, Stephen Santamo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Countries in the developing world, in attempts to promote  investment in land and agricultural productivity, and to establish frameworks for  economic development, have regularly embarked on extensive tenure reforms designed  to replace customary forms of tenure with private individual forms. In the Kenya  rangelands, the Group Ranch system: a hybrid tenure system that allows communal  ownership and use of titled land, was created and implemented in the rangelands  where private tenure was thought to be unsuitable. This thesis discusses the failure  of the Group Ranch system in Kajiado District, and the parallel transformation of  Maasai communal lands into private, individual holdings, which has eroded land  security, facilitated land loss to non-residents, created local socio-economic  disparities, and made difficult the sustainable practice of pastoral livelihoods.  From this discussion it is suggested that communal tenure systems may be useful in  preventing and addressing land and resource related problems, and that tailoring  land policies and tenure reforms to clarify and strengthen customary systems can  play a significant role in promoting land conservation and productivity in the  African rangelands and enhance security for the people that depend on  them.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n853c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wq725</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Land tenure -- Kenya</dc:subject><dc:subject>Masai (African people) -- Land tenure</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak0698799x"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Islamic feminist community organizing for combatting violence against women : a case study of Rifka Annisa, Women Crisis Center, Yogyakarta, Indonesia</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Setiawan, Dorita</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis focuses on an Islamic feminist community  organization, and its activities in combating violence against women. The case  example discussed in this study is the Rifka Annisa Women's Crisis Center (WCC Rifka  Annisa) located in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. By examining the environment and the  issues that WCC Rifka Annisa faces, broader thematic concerns can be applied to  Indonesian society in general. This study reviews western feminist and community  organizing approaches, and examines them in light of the specific religious,  cultural, economic and political context in Indonesia. A blend of Islamic feminim  and community organizing approaches has emerged in Indonesia. Data collection for  this study was based on interviews and direct observations. Exploring this  perspective will contribute to the knowledge, practice and values of social work  generally, and development work in similar contexts in particular.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b5919024.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698799x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Feminism -- Indonesia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Crimes against -- Indonesia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social service -- Indonesia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Family violence -- Indonesia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514nm01b"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Italian identity in Montreal : issues of intergenerational ethnic retention</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Martinis, Lucio</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Over time, the Italian community has become an integral part of  Canada's ethnic mosaic. However, to what 'ethnic' cost has this integration  occurred? This thesis looks at issues of ethnic retention among successive  generations of Italian families living in Montreal. Focus is placed on three  fundamental questions: (a) How did the Italian community change through generations?  (b) Are the young generations displaying signs of symbolic ethnicity? and (c) How  can the ethnic identity of Italians in Montreal be defined in 2005? Drawing on  Herbert Gans' symbolic ethnicity approach, the initial hypothesis suggests that  socio-economic upgrade spurs an ethnic consciousness founded on cultural symbols  rather than on cultural values. Through ethnographic-based interviews, data was  collected on 60 individuals grouped into 20 Italian families. Based on in-depth  intergenerational comparisons between grandparents, parents and youth, results seem  to confirm that young Italians reflect a pattern of symbolic  ethnicity.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tm51f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nm01b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Italian Canadians -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Ethnic identity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ethnicity -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r3670"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Gender-specific factors impacting upon males' disclosures of child sexual abuse</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stoddard, Stephanie M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this research was first, to identify why males  sexually abused as children under-report their experiences of child sexual abuse.  Secondly, the disclosure experiences of males sexually abused as children were  examined and analyzed, with a particular emphasis placed on exploring the links  between low disclosure rates, gender role socialization, and homophobia. Qualitative  data were gathered during semi-structured interviews of men sexually abused during  childhood. Issues and themes arising during interviews were generally consistent  with those identified in the literature. However, the sample size was small and  additional research---employing larger samples---should be completed in order to  collect further qualitative data regarding the disclosure experiences of males  sexually abused as children. Despite its limitations, this research does provide  valuable insight into the experience of disclosure for male victims of child sexual  abuse.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k546r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r3670</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Male sexual abuse victims</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child abuse -- Reporting -- Sex differences</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child sexual abuse</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
