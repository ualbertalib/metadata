Data indicates that early xenoislet graft failure is due to non specific inflammatory mechanisms that occur prior to T cell mediated rejection. The host hepatic endothelial cell may be important in this process because it is essentially the first cellular barrier encountered by intraportally introduced islets. We have characterized the initial response of endothelium to xenogeneic islets by measuring the expression of 11-1alpha, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and iNOS mRNA in an in vitro dog-to-pig model of xenoislet transplantation. Materials &amp; methods. Dog islets were co-cultured with either porcine hepatic endothelium or porcine aortic endothelium over a 24-hour period in serum free medium. RNA was extracted at eight time points. RT-PCR was performed in order to visualize II-1alpha, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and BIOS expression. Bands were semiquantitated by comparison to an external standard (GAPDH) using band densitometry. Results. Hepatic endothelium had early (one hour) expression of IL-1alpha, IFN-gamma, and iNOS transcript. IL-1alpha peaked at two hours, IFN-gamma at 12 hours, and iNOS at one and 12 hours. Aortic endothelium expressed low levels of IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha, but not IFN-gamma or NOS. Conclusions. We have demonstrated that xenogeneic islets are able to activate host endothelial cells without serum or immune cells. The observed endothelial response corresponds with known islet toxic substances. Furthermore, the response differs between endothelial beds suggesting that these differences may be important in choosing suitable implantation sites for islets. Our findings suggest that host endothelium may play an important part in early injury of islet xenotransplants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Christou, Nicolas V.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Metrakos, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dr37f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v838229q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kj122"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The link level security implementation of bluetooth technology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sun, Zheng, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bluetooth technology is a de facto global standard for a short-range, low-power and low-cost form of wireless communication. New as it is, the technology is anticipated to play a very important role in an increasingly mobile world. Like almost any other modern communication technology, Bluetooth must be sufficiently secure before it can be widely accepted. This is particularly challenging for Bluetooth due to the fact that it uses radio as the physical communication media. The nature of microwave links, as opposed to fixed cable connections, means that Bluetooth is especially vulnerable to attacks. However, through the use of some well-known and highly-effective cryptographic algorithms, Bluetooth is able to achieve the three most important security goals: secrecy, authenticity and integrity. The focus of the thesis is how Bluetooth translates the theoretical cryptographic techniques into effective real life implementations. Security measures in Bluetooth are taken at both the application level and the link level. In the thesis, the author places the emphasis on the link level measures. Various security areas are discussed, such as random number generation, key management, encryption, authentication, etc. The limitations and weaknesses of Bluetooth security implementations are also discussed, and some suggestions for future improvements are offered.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ratzer, Gerald</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tw91z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kj122</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462724m"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evaluation of NARCM using aircraft observation from NARE</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Teakles, Andrew</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Northern Aerosol Regional Climate Model (NARCM) is being developed in order to better understand how aerosols affect the Canadian climate. NARCM uses microphysical and chemical parameterizations that enable it to predict the evolution of the aerosol spectrum using the concentration and composition in 12 size-segregated bins as prognostic variables. In this study, two aerosol species are considered as prognostic variables within NARCM: sulphate and sea-salt. The sulphur species concentrations and aerosol distributions simulated by NARCM are evaluated against clear-sky in-situ aircraft measurement taken off the coast of Nova Scotia during the North Atlantic Regional Experiment (HARE). NARCM demonstrates skill at predicting the column burdens of the sulphur species concentrations at the NARE site throughout the NARE period. Simulations of the average column burdens of sulphur dioxide and sulphate showed differences of 57% and 28% respectively from the observed values. The accumulation mode in the aerosol distributions simulated by NARCM has a tendency to be smaller than the measured mode. There is evidence that the absence of other aerosol species may account for the too small sizes of the simulated aerosol when sulphate volumes are small.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leighton, H.

In addition to further defining the role of lysine56, the work presented in this thesis explores the functions of glutamine100 and aspartate125 through the use of site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification. The results indicate that the function of glutamine100 is to polarize lysine56 for cyclohydrolase catalysis, and that of aspartate125 is for the binding of the H4folate substrates.

Single SiC-Mo and $ rm Si sb3N sb4$-Mo joints were produced using hot-uniaxial pressing. The microstructure of the resulting interfaces were characterized by image analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The mechanical properties of the joints were investigated using shear strength testing, depth sensing nanoindentation, and neutron diffraction for residual stress measurement. SiC was solid-state bonded to Mo at temperatures ranging from 1000$ sp circ$C to 1700$ sp circ$C. Diffusion of Si and C into Mo resulted in a reaction layer containing two main phases: $ rm Mo sb5Si sb3$ and Mo$ sb2$C. At temperatures higher than 1400$ sp circ$C diffusion of C into $ rm Mo sb5Si sb3$ stabilized a ternary phase of composition $ rm Mo sb5Si sb3$C. At 1700$ sp circ$C, the formation of MoC$ rm sb{1-x}$ was observed as a consequence of bulk diffusion of C into Mo$ sb2$C. A maximum average shear strength of 50 MPa was obtained for samples hot-pressed at 1400$ sp circ$C for 1 hour. Higher temperatures and longer times contributed to a reduction in the shear strength of the joints, due to the excessive growth of the interfacial reaction layer. $ rm Si sb3N sb4$ was joined to Mo in vacuum and nitrogen, at temperatures between 1000$ sp circ$C and 1800$ sp circ$C, for times varying from 15 minutes to 4 hours. Dissociation of $ rm Si sb3N sb4$ and diffusion of Si into Mo resulted in the formation of a reaction layer consisting, initially, of $ rm Mo sb3$Si. At 1600$ sp circ$C (in vacuum) Mo$ sb3$Si was partially transformed into $ rm Mo sb5Si sb3$ by diffusion of Si into the original silicide, and at higher temperatures, this transformation progressed extensively within the reaction zone. Residual N$ sb2$ gas, which originated from the decomposition of $ rm Si sb3N sb4,$ dissolved in the Mo, however, most of the gas escaped during bonding or remained trapped at the original $ rm Si sb3N sb4$-Mo interface, resulting in the formation of a porous layer. Joining in N$ sb2$ increased the stability of $ rm Si sb3N sb4,$ affecting the kinetics of the diffusion bonding process. The bonding environment did not affect the composition and morphology of the interfaces for the partial pressures of N$ sb2$ used. A maximum average shear strength of 57 MPa was obtained for samples hot-pressed in vacuum at 1400$ sp circ$C for 1 hour.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>ew, Robin A.

The objective is to ensure a valid and cost effective implementation of the overall system. The problem surfaces in a great number of applications, many of which fall within the area of digital systems design. However, despite its wide range of applications, vertex coloring remains one of the most complex optimization problems known and to this day no efficient method has been shown to provide optimal answers in all instances of the general case. This dissertation explores characteristics of optimality of vertex colorings, bounds on the chromatic number and coloring heuristics. The first few characteristics are based around the fundamental and residual nodes of an optimal coloring. An examination of the subset of fundamental nodes will reveal necessary subgraph properties for an optimal coloring and its graph; one of which is based on Kempe chains. In turn, this leads to a bound relating the chromatic number and the number of odd cycles in a graph. Subsequently, a continuous variable formulation of the vertex coloring problem is presented along with an analysis of its solution space. The characterization of the space illustrates the problem's complexity and the nature of its local minima relates to the Gallai-Roy theorem. The results given will have algorithmic significance since their proofs are constructive. The WWI pair of vertex coloring heuristics is then disclosed. The algorithms are based on successive compressions of pairs of non-adjacent nodes each reducing the problem instance by one node until a complete graph is obtained. The criteria for selecting pairs of nodes concentrate on the affinity and conflict values calculated from structural properties of the graphs. The heuristics are justified by upper bounds on the chromatic number and approximation arguments. It is demonstrated that some compressions preserve the chromatic number or the maximal clique size of a graph, thus resulting into some identifiably optimal selections by the algorithms. Ultimately, this leads to the characterization of a class of perfect graphs. Finally, a set of benchmarks for the WWI algorithms on random graphs and k-colorable random graphs is given and favorable comparisons are offered with existing algorithms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Pramod C.

(Paula Frances)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A case study of American Sign Language (ASL) acquisition revealed an emerging phonological system influenced by biological, cognitive, and linguistic factors. A hearing child (SJ), acquiring ASL from her Deaf parents, was videotaped over seven sessions between the ages of 1:0 and 2:1. Of the 1,699 manual behaviors observed, 804 were lexical items, or signs. All signs were phonetically coded. Detailed analyses were undertaken to discover acquisition patterns for the three major parameters of ASL signs (handshape, hand location and movement). Overall, SJ's signs were well-formed and adhered to ASL phonological constraints. Location primes were produced accurately, due to SJ's knowledge of the structure of her body. Errors occurred with body parts that were not perceptually salient. Movement parameters were not mastered by SJ during the period of study; no systematic set of substitutions was observed. Handshapes were produced with low accuracy. SJ relied on a small set of maximally contrastive handshapes (i.e., (5,1,A)). These handshapes represent the convergence of ease of production, distribution in the target language phonology, and perceptual salience. SJ used three processes to fit target handshapes to her emerging phonological system: spreading of selected fingers, changing of selected fingers from a marked to an unmarked set, and changing to an open position. These processes reflect anatomical and perceptual preferences as well as linguistic influences. SJ's sign production showed a small improvement in accuracy and a marked reduction in variability between the ages of 1:0 AND 2:1. Visual feedback did not affect the sign accuracy. A passive hand was more likely to be added to one-handed signs produced outside the visual field, possibly increasing tactile feedback. Path movement and horizontal-place primes were more accurate when tactile feedback was present. There was no evidence that SJ used lexical selection or imitation as strategies for phonological acquisition. Finally, many of the same factors that influence phonological acquisition in speech guided SJ's acquisition of handshape primes. Her acquisition of location primes, by contrast, did not resemble processes observed in phonological acquisition in speech.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50tt26h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r2647</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>American Sign Language -- Acquisition -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>American Sign Language -- Phonology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abz60cz10t"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evaluation of the quality of an injury surveillance system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacArthur, Colin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The health care burden associated with childhood injury is huge. Surveillance--the collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data--is seen as an important step towards understanding and controlling the injury problem. The usefulness of surveillance data, however, depends on their quality. Quality may be defined as the collection of reliable and valid data along with an unbiased capture of events. (An important issue in paediatric injury surveillance is that proxy respondents are often used to provide data on behalf of the child.) Previous evaluations of paediatric injury surveillance data, however, have not directly estimated the reliability and validity of proxy respondent information nor assessed the relative importance of factors associated with system capture. Given these gaps in knowledge, this thesis examines the reliability and validity of proxy respondent information on childhood injuries. In addition, the importance of precise definition of the surveillance population of interest is described, along with identification of factors associated with failure of injury capture by a national paediatric injury surveillance system. The sensitivity, specificity, and representativeness of injury capture by this system is estimated for three different, but not mutually exclusive, populations of childhood injury. The results from the proxy respondent studies provide important information on the utility of proxy data on childhood injury, while the studies on injury capture highlight the influence of process and health services utilization on surveillance system function. The implications of these findings for researchers and policy makers are discussed, with examination of the cautions necessary when drawing inferences from surveillance data.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pless, I.

Feminist reflection on the dichotomy reveals that at it serves the patriarchal purposes of misrepresenting, masking and devaluing women's lives. Teleworkers are individuals who work at home; they often opt for this work arrangement because they want to better integrate their public (or work) and private (or nonwork) spheres. Ironically, however, teleworkers reify the dichotomy between public and private in their daily lives. Through in-depth qualitative interviews with female and male teleworkers, I explore the mechanisms which reinforce this. These mechanisms include first, the sexual division of labour in the home and second, the gendered notion of "professionalism." Comparing female and male teleworkers I show how workers at home are physically removed from the office environment but work in a way that largely reproduces the "gendered professionalism" inherent in the organizational culture of this environment. Perceiving the opportunity to telework as a privilege, they have to legitimate this work arrangement by continuing to make sharp distinctions between public "work" and private "nonwork" which in turn reinforces the sexual division of labour in the home. These mechanisms keep the public-private dichotomy in place. I argue, however, that teleworkers interpret the dichotomy in a critical manner; through a "critique from within" they challenge the dichotomy. This challenge originates in their experiences that the best work (which they often call "real work") is carried out in the private sphere of the home. In fact, the office is identified as inappropriate for "real work" precisely because it is public. The dichotomy between public/work and private/nonwork begins to be prized open. I argue that the long term consequences of this critique will depend upon the guided entrenchment of telework within organizations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tancred, Peta</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hk763.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cz092</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Telecommuting</dc:subject><dc:subject>Work and family</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qk33t"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Multi-dimensional Lie-algebraic operators</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Milson, Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We investigate the geometric properties of multi-dimensional Lie-algebraic operators. Such operators are relevant to the study of quasi-exactly solvable, quantum mechanical systems. The present effort addresses several issues raised by the Q.E.S. research program. One such issue is the normalizability of an operator to Schrodinger form; this criterion is known as the operator closure conditions. We give a geometric, and a representation-theoretic reformulation of the closure conditions, and then use these techniques to obtain solutions for the case of linear SL(2) actions in the plane. The study of multi-dimensional Lie-algebraic operators benefits from an intrinsic, geometrically based approach. We do this by taking as our setting the fibre bundle $ pi$: G $ to$ M, where G is a Lie group, and the base is a homogeneous space. The symbol of a second-order Lie-algebraic operator induces a pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor, g, on the base; the symbol also induces a horizontal-vertical decomposition of the above bundle. Not surprisingly, the geometry of g is determined by this decomposition, and thus allows us to investigate g in terms of the horizontal and vertical vector fields associated to the decomposition. Of particular interest is the class of flat geometries induced by Lie algebraic operators. One motivation for considering this class is furnished by Turbiner's Conjecture, which states that a Lie algebraic operator admits separation of variables if its symbol induces a flat metric. In the planar case we prove a global result to the effect that a flat, Riemannian manifold of the type described above, is isometric to the quotient of the Euclidean plane by reflections. We then use this result to give a proof of a limited form of Turbiner's conjecture.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kamran, Niky</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n492s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qk33t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h113q"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The procolophonid Barasaurus and the phylogeny of early amniotes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Meckert, Dirk</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The procolophonid amniote Barasaurus besairiei Piveteau 1955 is fully described and restored for the first time with emphasis placed on the postcranial skeleton, which is only poorly known in most of the other taxa of early amniotes. The study focuses on testing a hypothesis of relationships, namely whether procolophonids are the sister-group of Testudines as proposed by Reisz &amp; Laurin (1991). The description provides a sound basis for a new phylogenetic study of early amniotes. Using 13 taxa and 68 characters, the analysis indicates that synapsids are the sister-group of all other known amniotes, named Sauropsida. The Sauropsida are divided into Palaeosauropsida and Eusauropsida. Palaeosauropsida comprise Millerettidae as the sister-group of Procolophoniformes. The Procolophoniformes contain Procolophonia and Testudinomorpha as sister-groups. Testudines are the sister-group of Pareiasauria within the Testudinomorpha. Within Procolophonia, the family Owenettidae, including Barasaurus and Owenetta, is the sister-group of the family Procolophonidae. Eusauropsida include captorhinids, Palaeothyris and diapsids. All of the three major amniote clades have extant taxa: Synapsida--mammals; Palaeosauropsida--turtles; Eusauropsida--diapsids including birds. The terms "Reptilia" and "Parareptilia" are omitted from systematics: Parareptilia for a misleading name and Reptilia in general because of its historical burden. The new tree is strong in supporting Procolophonia and Testudinomorpha (sister-group of Pareiasauria and Testudines). It is not very firm in establishing eusauropsids and diadectomorphs because they were outside the main focus of the analysis. Mesosauria is the only group of Palaeozoic amniotes not included in this study.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Carroll, Robert L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021g797.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h113q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reptiles -- Classification</dc:subject><dc:subject>Barasaurus</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cladistic analysis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jg45n"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The performance and dynamics of fixed-film pressurized tubular bioreactors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lu, Dapei</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A Fixed-Film Pressurized Tubular Bioreactor (FFPTB), which used the inner surface of a tube as the support surface, was evaluated under laboratory conditions to treat synthetic wastewater where glucose was used as the carbon source.

The tube HRTs ranged from 16 to 38 minutes, and organic loadings from 2.29 to 11.46 g COD/m$ sp2$-d (the area being the inside surface area of the tube), depending on the liquid flows and initial waste concentrations. The FFPTB performed well (80-85% organic removal) under COD loadings of up to 7.64 g/m$ sp2$-d at relatively short HRTs (40-45 minutes) using the compressed air supply. When pure oxygen was used, the raw wastewater with an initial COD varying between 80-120 mg/L could be treated with even higher efficiency (90-95% organic removal). It was observed that the COD, TOC and DO decreased dramatically over the initial portion of the tube, then decreased more slowly. Biofilm thickness along the tube varied in similar fashion, with the greatest thickness (350-750 $ mu$m when the compressed air was used, and 1,900 $ mu$m with the pure oxygen supply) registered at the beginning of the tube and decreasing to 90 to 345 $ mu$m at the end. The biofilm thickness at the beginning of the tube was found to be proportional to the initial strength of the wastewater used. Furthermore, as the influent substrate concentration increased, the pressure had to increase appropriately to maintain a sufficient DO level for aerobic respiration in the system. The application of elevated pressures appeared to reduce the thickness of the liquid diffusion layer, thereby increasing the mass transfer rate, and consequently increasing the substrate utilization rate in the biofilm. Besides the experimental investigations, a mathematical model based on Monod-type kinetics, molecular diffusion, liquid layer mass transport, bacterial growth and decay as well as shear stress under steady-state conditions was developed and verified for the FFPTB. Based upon numerical simulations, for a given bulk substrate concentration, the model would give a solution for substrate flux into the biofilm and predict the TOC concentration along the tube. The model was also able to predict the biofilm thickness along the tube with reasonable accuracy. The system appears to be particularly suitable for high rate treatment of wastewaters, especially at low initial concentrations and for small systems. The high level of efficiency of the system could be achieved with short detention times and confined gaseous emissions as well as a low production of sludge.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gehr, Ronald</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278v79z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jg45n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Sanitary and Municipal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nc736"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evidence of three-dimensional cloud effects in satellite measurements of reflected solar radiation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Loeb, Norman Gary</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of the plane parallel model in analyzing satellite measurements of clouds, and to examine what role 3D cloud effects may play in explaining any discrepancies. Direct comparisons between one year of Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) scanner radiances and plane parallel model calculations are carried out under different Sun-Earth-satellite viewing configurations over ocean between 30$ sp circ$N and 30$ sp circ$S. When the plane parallel model calculations are matched to observations at nadir on a pixel-by-pixel basis by adjusting cloud fraction and cloud optical depth, the resulting frequency distributions of cloud optical depth show a systematic shift towards larger values with increasing solar zenith angle, regardless of what assumptions are made in the calculations. On average, this increase in cloud optical depth is extremely large for solar zenith angles $ sbsp{ tilde}{&gt;}$63$ sp circ.$ For the thinnest 50% of the clouds, the increase only occurs at very oblique sun angles, whereas it is observed at all solar zenith angles for the thickest 10% of clouds. The cause is traced to a fundamental flaw in plane parallel theory when applied to real clouds: at nadir the solar zenith angle dependence of model reflectance is opposite to that of the observations. On average, differences between observed and plane parallel model reflectances are found to be less sensitive to view and relative azimuth angle than to solar zenith angle. For solar zenith angles less than ${ approx}63 sp circ,$ plane parallel model reflectances are within $ approx$10% of the observations. As solar zenith angle increases, differences between the observations and calculations increase at all view angles. At lower sun elevations, observed reflectances exceed plane parallel values by a constant amount at all view angles in the backscattering direction, while plane parallel model reflectances show a different view angle dependence from that observed in the forward direction. When comparisons are performed as a function of relative azimuth angle, no appreciable dependence in the reflectance difference is observed. Violation of the principle of reciprocity applied to real observations is shown to be mainly caused by the systematic difference in the solar zenith angle dependence between observations and plane parallel calculations. Monte Carlo simulations involving stochastic, isotropic, scale-invariant broken cloud fields are carried out in order to show that, qualitatively, differences between observed and plane parallel reflectances are generally consistent with 3D theory. While much of the discrepancy between 3D and 1D reflectances can be attributed to the presence of cloud sides, affecting the illuminated cloud area, it is shown that the slope of the illuminated cloud top surfaces may also play an important role.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Davies, Roger</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s4038.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nc736</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Remote Sensing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qt581"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of analytical methods for the speciation of arsenic in the marine environment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Momplaisir, Georges-Marie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Several biologically important arsenic compounds including methylarsonate, trimethylarsine oxide, tetramethylarsonium ion, arsenobetaine and arsenocholine were prepared, in good yields, from sodium arsenite, or dimethylarsinic acid. These organoarsenic compounds together with arsenite, arsenate and dimethylarsinic acid were used as standards for the development of analytical methods for determining the levels of individual arsenic compounds (arsenic speciation) present in natural matrices. Arsenobetaine, arsenocholine and tetramethylarsonium ion were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with on-line detection by thermochemical hydride generation (THG)-AAS. The analytes were eluted from the cyanopropyl bonded phase HPLC column with a 1% acetic acid methanolic mobile phase which also contained diethyl ether triethylamine, and trimethylsulfonium iodide or picrylsulfonic acid. A surface response methodology and a univariate optimization procedure were used to determine the optimum concentration of solvent modifiers in the methanolic mobile phase. Limits of detection in the range 4-5 ng (as As) were obtained for the arsonium analytes under optimum chromatographic conditions. A simple phenol extraction procedure was developed to isolate arsonium analytes from edible marine tissues (lobster tail muscle, peeled and deveined shrimp, and cod fillet), cod liver oil and human urine. The crude extracts were separated on the cyanopropyl column using a methanolic mobile phase and detected on-line by THG-AAS. Recoveries from tissues or from urine which had been spiked at 0.1-3.4 $ mu$g of As cation/g of fresh weight were 80% or greater for each of five sample types. An improved HPLC-AAS interface which was compatible with either aqueous or organic mobile phases was also developed. The interface provided approximately equivalent responses to different arsenic oxidation states which resulted in low to subnanogram chromatographic limits of detection for arsenic oxyanions and arsonium cations in an aqueous or methanolic mobile phase. Nascent As anions and As cations were conveniently coextracted from aqueous solution or from fish muscle by phenol extraction and quantified in the same chromatographic run. This method has been applied to a standard reference sample of dogfish muscle (DORM-1), a marine reference sediment sample (PACS-1) and to sediment porewaters (SAG-15) from the Saguenay Fjord.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, W.

In the first model, we examined the SP-IR boutons apposed to three functional types of dorsal horn neurons and their morphological interaction with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and enkephalin (ENK) in the cat spinal cord, using a combination of intracellular electrophysiological recording and horseradish peroxidase injection with ultrastructural immunocytochemistry. In addition to SP-IR only boutons, we detected boutons co-localizing SP plus CGRP and SP plus ENK immunoreactivities presynaptic to nociceptive neurons. Quantitatively, significantly higher numbers of SP-IR, SP+CGRP-IR and SP+ENK-IR boutons were apposed to nociceptive neurons. Non-nociceptive neurons were rarely innervated by boutons which were SP-IR, SP+CGRP-IR and SP+ENK-IR. In contrast, ENK-IR only boutons innervated non-nociceptive neurons considerably. Boutons co-localizing SP and CGRP were considered as originating from primary sensory afferents. Most nociceptive neurons contained ENK immunoreactivity, but non-nociceptive neurons were never ENK-IR. The interaction of SP and $ gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the superficial dorsal horn of the cat and rat spiral cord was also investigated. The co-localization of SP and GABA in axonal terminals was detected for the first time in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the cat, but not rat, spinal cord. In the second model, we used immunocytochemistry to study the SP-IR fiber innervation of the white matter of transgenic mice expressing NGF in myelinating oligodendrocytes driven by a MBP promoter. SP-IR fibers were observed in the white matter of the CNS of both transgenic and control mice from postnatal day 0 to day 2. From day 5 on, however, these SP-IR fibers increased markedly to become ectopic fibers in transgenic mice, but decreased dramatically, and finally disappeared, in control mice. The ectopic SP-IR fibers of transgenic mice persisted throughout adulthood. Capsaicin treatment abolished all ectopic SP-IR fibers, indicating their primary sensory origin. In conclusion, SP-IR fibers specifically innervated nociceptive neurons and co-localized with CGRP, ENK and GABA in the cat dorsal horn. The finding provides anatomical substrates for roles of SP in nociception and for functional interactions of SP with ENK and GABA. Ectopic SP-IR fibers innervated the white matter of the CNS of transgenic mice where NGF was abnormally-produced.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ribeiro-Da-Silver, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s173k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bz85b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb3979798"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular analysis of the telomeric half of human chromosome 2q</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liu, Jing, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The first part of my thesis dealt with the physical mapping of human chromosome 2 employing the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) cloning system. To generate a chromosome 2 YAC sublibrary, over 1,000 interspersed repetitive sequence (IRS)-PCR probes were generated and used to screen the CEPH midi YAC library and approximately 2,000 chromosome 2-specific midi YACs were identified. These YACs were divided into 223 YAC groups, i.e., sets of unordered overlapping YACs, and using publicly available contig analysis software, a tentative order of YACs within each YAC group could be established. To order YAC groups, the chromosome 2 YAC sublibrary was screened with 87 genetically mapped microsatellites and cytogenetically mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and 44 YAC groups were localized along the genetic map of chromosome 2q. In addition, 16 known genes were physically linked with microsatellites within YAC groups, thus providing integration points for genetic, cytogenetic and YAC-based physical maps of chromosome 2q. In a subsequent step of the analysis, the chromosome 2 YAC mapping data created by the Whitehead Institute (WI)/MIT Genome Center were integrated into our dataset. The integrated dataset consisted of 240 YAC groups, of which 14 large groups containing both our and WL/MIT Genome Center YAC groups were located on chromosome 2q. These 14 groups consisted of 1,195 YACs, which will form the backbone for the construction of a complete YAC contig for human chromosome 2q. The second part of my thesis dealt with the identification of genetic markers within or in the vicinity of NRAMP1, a candidate tuberculosis susceptibility locus. The human NRAMP1 gene was mapped to chromosome 2q35 by PCR analysis in a monochromosomal hybrid panel and by YAC contig analysis. Nine sequence variants and polymorphisms were identified within the NRAMP1 gene by single strand conformation analysis (SSCA), DNA sequencing and Southern analyses. Furthermore, two highly informative microsatellites, D2S104 and D2S173 were shown to be linked to NRAMP1 within a 1.5 Mbp YAC contig. Together, these markers provide molecular tools for further genetic analysis of inherited susceptibility to tuberculosis and related diseases of the macrophage.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schurr, Erwin</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623j045d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb3979798</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj38608533"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Synthesis, characterization, and enzymatic degradation of poly[R,S)-b-hydroxybutyrate] of varied tacticities</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hocking, Philippa J. (Philippa Jane)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Poly ((R)-$ beta$-hydroxybutyrate), PHB, is a naturally-occurring thermoplastic polyester of widespread interest due to its inherent biodegradability. A synthetic racemic analogue, poly ((R,S)-$ beta$-hydroxybutyrate), was prepared via the methylaluminoxane-catalyzed polymerization of (R,S)-$ beta$-butyrolactone, and fractionated to yield a range of tacticities, including new material primarily syndiotactic in nature. Each fraction was characterized, and the syndiotactic crystal structure was examined. An x-ray fibre diagram was recorded, the measured reflections were indexed, and a tetragonal unit cell was assigned. To supplement the initial characterization and probe the polymerization mechanism, high resolution $ sp{13}$C nmr spectra were obtained for the full tacticity range of the racemic PHB and interpreted with regard to several statistical models. A two-site model involving enantiomorphic and first-order Markovian sites was proposed, and the parameters describing each sample were derived. Average isotactic and syndiotactic block lengths were also calculated. The connection between stereoregularity and crystalline morphology was probed through the precipitation of single crystals. Lamellar single crystals similar to those of bacterial PHB were obtained from isotactic racemic PHB even of low stereoregularity; syndiotactic PHB gave a non-diffracting precipitate of two morphologies apparently differing in tacticity. Cocrystallization of R and S repeat units was implied. In recognition of the important of biodegradation to the interest in this material, the enzymatic degradability of the synthetic PHB was investigated, using extracellular PHB depolymerases of both bacterial and fungal origin. For solvent-cast films of PHB, the rates of weight loss decreased in the order bacterial PHB $&gt;&gt;$ synthetic atactic $&gt;$ synthetic isotactic $&gt;$ synthetic syndiotactic in both enzyme systems. The relative degradation rates of the synthetic samples changed significantly when the single crystals of natural and synthetic PHB were degraded. These observations were interpreted in terms of the opposing effects of crystallinity and stereochemistry, and the assumed normalization of crystallinity differenced in the single crystals of different tacticity. Differenced between the two enzyme systems, preferential enzymatic attack on the edge or fold surfaces of the single crystals, and the implications in terms of chain cleavage mechanism were also examined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marchessault, R.

The biological importance of the E6/p53 interaction was then directly examined in HPV-16 containing cervical carcinoma derived cells by introducing the monomeric p53 mutant which is resistant to E6 mediated degradation. The two major observations made from this study were: (i) loss of p53 activity plays an important role in maintaining the malignant phenotype of these cells with respect to cell proliferation; (ii) the monomeric p53 mutant without its C-terminal regulatory region was biologically functional with respect to impairing cell proliferation in HPV-16 containing cervical carcinoma derived cells. Finally, it was revealed that the cellular MAP kinase signal transduction pathway was more active in cells expressing the HPV-16 E5 gene than in control cells or cells expressing E6 and E7.

Raw data were collected from Moroiso Phase (ca. 5000 B.P.) sites of the Early Jomon Period in the Kanto and Chubu regions. Many archaeologists have assumed that the Jomon people were sedentary inhabitants of large villages, occupied throughout the year. However, recent developments in Jomon studies suggest that we must reevaluate the assumption of Jomon sedentism. In this study, Moroiso Phase settlement patterns, including intersite lithic assemblage variability, site size and site location, are examined in the context of an ethnographic model of hunter-gatherer subsistence-settlement systems. The results indicate that the Moroiso Phase settlement patterns correspond very closely to those of hunter-gatherers who are relatively sedentary but move their residential bases seasonally. Changes of settlement patterns over time within the Moroiso Phase are also examined, and the results are explained in relation to changes in the natural environment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ikawa-Smith, Fumiko</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wh64b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/765372694</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Japan -- Antiquities</dc:subject><dc:subject>Land settlement patterns, Prehistoric -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jōmon culture -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hunting and gathering societies -- Japan</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avx021g800"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A cognitive perspective on expertise in literary understanding</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Graves, Barbara</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research presents a psychological investigation of the characteristics of literary reading and the expertise associated with it. Specifically, it examines the kinds of knowledge about discourse which highly skilled readers use to generate a representation of a fictional narrative. At the same time it investigates their informal reasoning and the role that authorial intentions play in their interpretive strategies. To investigate highly skilled literary readers who are trained to look at texts in multi-dimensional ways, this research applied a cognitive model of literary reading to analyze the readers' verbal protocols in terms of discursive patterns and reasoning strategies. The findings suggest that as student readers gain knowledge and experience, their developing expertise is demonstrated by their ability to generate knowledge representations of the multiple components of a literary text. The construction of an explicit communicative context, however, is a hallmark of literary expertise and is instrumental in their reasoning since it frames the problem space for their text descriptions. Students, in contrast, appear ambivalent about the author-text relationship.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Frederiksen, C.

Effects of prolonged, intense (20 $ times$ threshold), low frequency (4 Hz) stimulation of meridian and non-meridian sites on the thermally evoked nociceptive withdrawal reflexes of the tail and limbs were studied. Threshold was the minimum current required to elicite muscle contraction. Intense stimulation applied to meridian sites inhibited tail withdrawal. This inhibition persisted beyond one hour after the end of stimulation. Stimulation of non-meridian sites produced a smaller inhibition; this occurred during the conditioning only. Thus, a brief inhibition or both the brief and a persistent, post-stimulation inhibition were produced by stimulation of non-meridian or meridian sites, respectively. Little effect was evoked on limb withdrawal reflexes. Expression of the post-stimulation effect required 20 $ times$ threshold stimulation with long pulse durations ($ geq$2 ms), low frequency of stimulation (2 Hz-6 Hz) and long train durations (20 or 40 min). The brief effect could be evoked at 10 $ times$ threshold with short pulse durations($ leq$2 ms) at higher frequencies of stimulation (8 Hz) and with short train durations (10 min). Stimulation of meridian sites evoked both the brief and the post-stimulation effects in chronic spinal transected rats (7-14 days): in acutely spinal transected rats ($ leq$48 h) the brief effect was evoked only. The return of the post-stimulation effect was coincident with the return of bladder function. Both the brief and post-stimulation inhibition were blocked by the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist 5-amino-2-phosphonovaleric acid (APV). The wide spectrum opiate receptor antagonist naloxone, or $ mu$-opiate antagonist $ beta$-funaltrexamine, attenuated both the brief and persistent inhibition. The $ delta$- and $ kappa$-antagonists, TIPP($ psi$) and nor-binaltorphimine, attenuated the inhibition during the stimulation. Both drugs blocked the post-stimulation effect and even facilitated withdrawal. In chronically spinal transected rats, naloxone blocked the inhibition. These data suggest that intense, low frequency activation of primary afferents arising from meridian but not non-meridian sites produces both brief and persistent inhibition of the tail withdrawal reflex. Limb withdrawal reflexes are only minimally inhibited by this activation. It is suggested that the persistent antinociception may be due to long-term plastic changes in inhibitory mechanisms within the CNS because these effects persist long after the end of stimulation and presumably after synaptic inputs from these fibres have ceased. It is also suggested that inhibitory mechanisms are provoked by prolonged activation of high threshold fibres, are dependent on the parameters of stimulation, are extrasegmental in nature and differentially modulate tail vs. limb nociceptive reflexes. Activation of spinal NMDA receptors appears critical for the expression of the persistent antinociception. The inhibition is also differentially mediated by activation of multiple opiate receptors: $ mu$-, $ kappa$- and to a lesser degree $ delta$-receptors mediate the brief effect, while the persistent antinociception is dependent on activation of $ delta$ -and $ kappa$-receptors and to a lesser degree $ mu$-receptors. Data from spinal animals suggest that the mechanisms mediating the inhibitory effects include both spinal and supraspinal components.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Henry, James L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322f84g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rw050</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246t59c"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of photovoltaic cells on electrodeposited CuInSe2 films</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Qiu, Chunong</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Using polycrystalline thin films of CuInSe$ sb2$ (thickness 1.5 $ mu$m) prepared by an electrodeposition method, photovoltaic cells of the form ZnO/CdS/CuInSe$ sb2$ have been fabricated and studied. Before the cell fabrication, properties of the electrodeposited CuInSe$ sb2$ were first studied. Conditions for the preparation of high resistivity CdS thin films (thickness 360 A) by a chemical bath deposition method were then established. This was achieved by varying the deposition temperature and amount of NH$ sb4$OH in the solution. It was observed that the quality of CdS films deposited at a temperature of 60$ sp circ$C and an NH$ sb4$OH concentration of 0.48 M was the best. Thermal stability of low resistivity, In- or Ar-doped, rf-sputtered ZnO thin films (thickness 1$ mu$m) was also studied. This was done by heat treating the ZnO films in air, O$ sb2$ and N$ sb2$ at temperature in a range from 200 to 350$ sp circ$C. It was observed that the amount of increase of resistivity at a given temperature decreased as the doping concentration was increased from 0.5 to 5.3 wt.%.

For comparison, cells of CdS(low $ rho$)/CdS(high $ rho$)/CuInSe$ sb2$ were also fabricated by evaporation of low resistivity CdS. The CuInSe$ sb2$ films used were treated either in vacuum or Ar. For those treated in vacuum, very poor properties were observed. The properties improved after a post fabrication heat treatment in air, however, the efficiency of these cells was below 2%. The low conversion efficiency was due to the low open circuit voltage. From capacitance-voltage measurements, this was found to be due to a high acceptor concentration on the surface of the vacuum treated CuInSe$ sb2$ films (10$ sp{17}$ cm$ sp{-3}$). For the cells fabricated on the CuInSe$ sb2$ films treated in Ar, photovoltaic effects were present before the air heat treatment. An efficiency of 6.8% was obtained for one of the best cells, sample J8-4 (with low resistivity CdS window). For cells with ZnO window, a conversion efficiency of 6.3% was obtained (cell O51). For these cells, the acceptor concentration in CuInSe$ sb2$ was 10$ sp{16}$ cm$ sp{-3}$, which was one order of magnitude lower than that of CuInSe$ sb2$ films treated in vacuum. The diffusion length of minority carriers (electrons) in the electrodeposited, p-type CuInSe$ sb2$ was first measured using the photocurrent and capacitance methods. For the vacuum treated CuInSe$ sb2$ films, the electron diffusion length was small (less than 0.1 $ mu$m). For those treated in Ar, values of the electron diffusion length were about 0.5 $ mu$m. These values are close to those reported for evaporated CuInSe$ sb2$ thin films. Some of the fabricated cells were also studied using an electron beam induced current (EBIC) method. From the EBIC experiments, the effective diffusion lengths of electrons with values greater than 1 $ mu$m were obtained. Considering the surface recombination effect, the electron diffusion length of the electrodeposited CuInSe$ sb2$ was finally found to be 2.4 $ mu$m. This large electron diffusion length was consistent with the high short circuit current density observed in I-V measurements of the electrodeposited CuInSe$ sb2$ cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shih, I.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mx021.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246t59c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Energy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aws859h19c"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of Ca, K and water table depth on tomato mechanical properties</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rajabipour, Ali</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two series of tests were performed in summer 1993 and repeated in summer 1994 to investigate effects of potassium, calcium and water table depth on mechanical properties of tomato fruit. In the first group of tests five mechanical properties stress, strain, ER (ratio of stress to strain at break), energy and toughness were calculated from the force-deformation curve obtained by compression of pericarp disks taken from tomato fruits (cv New Yorker) at the breaker stage. In the second group of tests force, deformation and energy were obtained from puncture tests on whole tomato fruit. The textural parameters were used to compare the effects of the potassium, calcium and water level depths on the mechanical properties of tomatoes. Results showed the effects of calcium and water table depths on the mechanical properties were significant. Tomato fruits exposed to increasing moisture stress levels by increasing water table depth exhibited increased firmness. Increased application of calcium also resulted in increased firmness. Application of different potassium levels had in general no significant effect on breaking stress, strain, ER, energy and toughness of tomato fruit pericarp. A new method of measuring skin strength of tomatoes is described. The method, refered to as loop method, overcame the problems with the existing method using mechanical grips. Further, the loop method was applied to measure the effect of potassium and calcium on skin strength of tomato. Using the loop method, data were collected on relaxation of tomato skin (epidermis). A computer program was written to model th tensile stress relaxation behaviour of tomato skin. The program was employed to calculate linear and non-linear coefficients of a relaxation model. The fitted values were in a very good agreement with experimental data (R$ sp2&gt;$0.99).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Norris, E.

Proceeding from a psychoanalytical point of view, the author has uncovered another novel, an unspoken novel, that unfolds with Maupassant's novelistic production. This "other novel" expresses the engendering of the subject, which can be defined as the son-subject's liberation from the primal maternal dominion, thanks to the process of identification with the father. Maupassant's six novels mark various stages in this trajectory. The primal novel Une vie establishes the problematics of the maternal dominion. In Bel-Ami can be seen the formation of the matrix of identity, which coincides with the emergence of the son-subject. The two central novels, Mont-Oriol and Pierre et Jean, illustrate the traumatic experience of paternity and filiation; the latter novel shows the relinquishment of narcissistic defense mechanism. Subsequently, in Fort comme la mort, the repressed narcissistic wound can be analysed. With the final novel, Notre coeur, the son-subject achieves the father position, thus escaping the madness associated with the double-bind of the ambivalent mother. Previous criticism devoted to the works of Guy de Maupassant has focussed on the thematic obsession of paternity and filiation. This thesis sets out to demonstrate that this obsession is also the very principle driving the engenderment of the novel.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rivard, Yvon</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fn328.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107073k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Maupassant, Guy de, 1850-1893 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
