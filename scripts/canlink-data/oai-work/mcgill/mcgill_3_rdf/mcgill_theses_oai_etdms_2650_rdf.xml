The flow front of molten materials including the polymers and aluminum inside the mold has been probed by a multiple-channel probing system with a time resolution of about 1 ms. This information can be used to control the plunger movements. The gap development which is important for the understanding of the thermal contact between the mold and the part due to the shrinkage is also monitored. Gap formation time periods versus different packing pressure and at different part locations with different part thickness have been investigated. The ultrasonic velocity inside the part during the solidification has been also measured for the interpretation of the solidification process. For monitoring the die casting of aluminum with a melt temperature above 690°C, novel high performance buffer rods together with cooling channels are integrated into the die thus the ultrasonic measurement such as flow front and gap formation can be carried out with high signal-to-noise ratio signals for the first time at such elevated temperature.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jen, C.

Many central regulatory problems arise from the fragmented regulatory system, which is not effectively structured to further the goals of securities legislation. The purpose of this thesis is to review, and make recommendations in respect of, the securities regulatory system in China with particular attention to the regulatory role of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). After examining the characteristics of China's securities market development and identifying existing problems in the regulatory system, the thesis adopts a broad outlook through a comparative survey of securities regulators in selected jurisdictions in seeking appropriate resolutions to China's regulatory concerns. Specific substantive reform proposals for improving the regulatory system and in particular the CSRC are subsequently presented. The overriding theme of the proposals is the need for a more effective CSRC, one that would be able to provide efficient and adequate regulation of China's securities markets. The law in this thesis is stated as of July 1996.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Johnston, David L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mh671.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544br66q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, Public Administration</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economics, Finance</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wj21r"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>"Only the vague outline of my original shape remains" : the miscarriage of autobiography in the novels of Audrey Thomas</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Reeds, Nolan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis contends that there has often been a critical tendency to understate the challenges to the genre of autobiography that occur in Audrey Thomas's three novels: Songs My Mother Taught Me, Mrs. Blood, and Blown Figures. Chapter one qualifies autobiography in terms of its reliance on the liberal humanist subject as both author and protagonist. In the context of poststructuralist criticism, the author cannot be the unified, unique, original locus of truth that the liberal humanist subject is posited to be. Thus, as the subject collapses the foundation of autobiography collapses. Chapter two is a detailed analysis illustrating that the three novels stylistically and thematically deny the existence of the liberal humanist subject. thereby exemplifying the poststructuralist challenge to autobiography. The Canadian canons reliance on mimetic literature---of which pure autobiography would be the prime example---is offered as an explanation for critics' understatement of the texts' denial.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooke, N.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj464.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wj21r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Autobiography in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thomas, Audrey Callahan -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qf20g"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The language of authority : the expression of status in the Scottish medieval castle</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McGrail, M.

As Fe-rich compositions may exhibit spin fluctuation effects, transport properties were not studied below 80 K where spin fluctuation effects must be taken into consideration. The compositional and structural integrity of the samples was verified by means of X-ray diffractometry, electron-microprobe analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. It was also confirmed that the first crystallization product for all the compositions is the face-centered cubic phase with the NiTi2-type structure. A true comparison between amorphous and crystalline transport properties was thus possible. For the metallic glasses, it was observed that rho( T) had a temperature dependence of the form: A + Bexp(--T/Delta) in agreement with Mizutani who proposed this relation for glasses containing a significant number of d-electrons at EF. The characteristic temperature, Delta, was found to be related to the Debye temperature, theta D, and the parameter B to the electronic specific heat coefficient, gamma. The resistivity data for the crystalline tenary compounds exhibited a (c -- bT + aT2)-dependence. Both the glasses and their crystalline counterparts were characterized by negative temperature coefficients of the resistivity, alpha. However, for the glasses, alpha increased as the Fe content increased whereas for the crystalline compounds alpha decreased as the Fe content increased.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Altounian, Z.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qr74k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580p76h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117r08b"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Stability analysis of the spine pertaining to idiopathic scoliosis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Reimbold, Micheline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A three-dimensional structural analysis model of the human thoracolumbar spine and rib cage has been developed in order to investigate its stability in relation to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis is one of the most puzzling deformities of the spine, due to the fact that there is no known initiating cause. From the viewpoint that it can be explained in a purely biomechanical manner, one particular hypothesis as to its etiology is investigated in this thesis. The hypothesis is that a lordosis-inducing growth of the thoracic spine [34,100,115] in conjunction with spinal asymmetries in the lateral or horizontal plane [34] is the primary cause of the deformity. Analyses are performed on the constructed model using the MSC/NASTRAN finite element program. The model consists primarily of interconnected beam elements to represent a realistic geometry of the spine and rib cage. The various stiffness properties needed in the model were obtained from the published literature. Simulations of analyses and experiments performed by other researchers produced comparable results, thereby validating the present model, which is then used to investigate the above hypothesis. Lordosis-inducing growth, in which the anteriors of the thoracic vertebrae grow faster than the posteriors, is simulated in a geometric nonlinear analysis by differential thermal loading of these parts. Results show that under such loading, the model of the normal spine with its natural asymmetries of the thoracic region, gradually deforms into a shape with displacements and rotations typical of thoracic idiopathic scoliosis. These results therefore constitute a validation of the stated hypothesis, and indicate that a lordosis-inducing growth of the thoracic vertebrae is a likely cause of thoracic idiopathic scoliosis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shnvastava, S.

MSZ assumes a system consisting of a not of client machines and a got of server machines. All of these machines are connected through the Internet. A user can ask for a document to be played with the desired quality of service from any server; MSZ is responsible for selecting the beat server that is able to deliver the document to the user most efficiently. The best server satisfies the following properties: (1) It stores the requested document and has the ability to deliver the document to the user (the ability includes its free CPU time and free bandwidth and free memory space). (2) The server is much closer to the user geographically in comparison to other servers in the system, and the related network path has the most available resource, which is more than the service requires. (3) The server has a lighter system load compared to other servers. MSZ is able to minimize the response time and optimize the service quality as much as possible (the users are rejected only when the requested document is unavailable in all servers or servers are all loaded at maximum, or the communication network resource is less than the service required). Also MSZ has the self-learn ability. The more it is used, the better it works. The system has the ability to detect any degradation in service and to automatically recover during the presentation of the document. A server's failure doesn't affect the whole system and it is very easy for the system to add and remove a server. Generally, MSZ offers a better service to users with less blocking time, less cost and higher quality service.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Friedman, Nathan</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pv873.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km90b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, System Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mx641"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of the Orange lodges on Irish and British politics, 1795-1836</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Senior, Hereward</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to trace the history and estimate the influence of the Orange Society, which flourished from the time of its founding in 1795 until its dissolution by the Duke of Cumberland in 1836.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>W.

It is found that at high Reynolds nurnber the jet may be self preserving if the free stream velocity varies as the downstream co-ordinate to a power which in turn depends on the non-dimensional velocity of the jet.  The growth of the jet is then linear. The effect of an upstream boundary-Iayer on the outside of the slot is also considered. This analysis is then applied to the outer part of a wall jet in a similar pressure gradient. The effect of the inner boundary layer on the outer part of the flow is considered and formulae for the growth of the inner boundary-Iayer and the variation of skin friction are given. Also a form for the non-dimensional mean velocity profile including the inner boundary-layer is suggested. The predictions of the theory are found to be in substantial agreement with measurements of the mean velocity, the static pressure and the skin friction in wall jets with an equilibrium pressure gradient. Experimental measurements have also been made for wall jets in streaming flow with zero pressure gradient and wall jets in still air. The results of these experiments compare weIl with those of previous investigators . The law-of-wall and the velocity defect law for wall jets are investigated and the former is found to be limited in application. A simple power law appears to be useful for representing the whole boundary-layer velocity profile and forms the basis for the analysis of the inner boundary-layer .</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>B.

Working memory function is dependent upon effective stimulus filtering, which leads to the question as to whether nAChR agonists augment working memory function directly, or whether this effect is mediated indirectly through a strengthening of sensorimotor gating. In the present studies, the C57BL/6J and 129X1/SvJ strains of inbred mice were tested at 2 and 8 months of age in the pre-pulse inhibition paradigm (PPI) and the working memory version of the Morris Water Maze task (MWM). The prototypic and non-selective nAChR agonist, nicotine (0.5-2.0 mg/kg), and the α4β2 nAChR subtype specific agonist, RJR-2403 (0.06-0.54 mg/kg), were employed for cholinergic stimulation. Nicotine administration, but not RJR-2403, tended to enhance PPI in 2 month, but not 8 month-old animals. Both nicotine and RJR-2403 were ineffective in modulating working memory function. Hence, with these strains, at these ages, in these paradigms, and at these particular drug dosages, sensorimotor gating and working memory do not appear to be correlated processes nor does nAChR stimulation appear to modulate either process within these experimental parameters. This research demonstrates the importance of fully characterizing the dosage spectrum of drugs in animals commonly used in behavioural testing and, thus, further research into this area is warranted.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>L'activation des récepteurs nicotiniques pour l'acétylcholine (nAChR) accroît la filtration des stimuli sensori-moteurs ainsi que la mémoire de travail. Le fait que la mémoire de travail soit dépendante de la filtration des stimuli soulève la question à savoir si les agonistes des nAChR joue un rôle direct ou indirect via le renforcement de la filtration des stimuli.  Nous avons utilisé deux espèces de souris (C57BL/6J et 129X1/SvJ) consanguines âgées de 2 et 8 mois dans les tests de pré pulse inhibition (PPI) ainsi que dans une version du Morris water maze (MWM) pour la mémoire de travail. La nicotine (agoniste non sélectif), ainsi que le RJR-2403 (agoniste spécifique) furent utilisés pour la stimulation cholinergique.  Les résultats révèlent que la nicotine et non le RJR-2403 a produit une tendance à l'augmentation des performances dans le PPI chez les souris âgées de 2 mois, exclusivement. De plus, la nicotine et le RJR-2403 furent inefficace dans la modulation des fonctions de la mémoire de travail.  En résumé, il semble que la filtration de stimuli sensori-moteurs ainsi que la mémoire de travail ne seraient pas des processus en corrélation et que l'activation des nAChR ne module pas ces processus, du moins, avec les espèces de souris, l'âge, les tests comportementaux ainsi que les drogues utilisés. Davantage de recherche est nécessaire pour clarifier ces incertitudes. fr</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rochford, Joseph</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s460w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z314g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k725d"><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The land in trust : a social history of the organic farming movement</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Peters, Suzanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the ideas, assumptions, and activities of the predecessors and later advocates of the American organic farming movement.

Such interpretations adhered strictly to the letter of the law.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c957k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451k789</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dārulʻulūm Devband</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islamic law -- India -- Interpretation and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Taqlīd</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fatwas</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2j62s7039"><ual:graduationDate>1965</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Concept learning in hyperactive and normal children</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vīķe-Freiberga, Vaira</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hyperactivity is a common presenting symptom among children seen in psychiatric clinics, and refers to an excessive level of activity which is sufficiently sustained to become a serious source of complaint. Until recently interest in the hyperactive child was confined to the psychiatric literature. As a result, most of the information currently available deals with questions of diagnosis and treatment. The psychological functioning of the hyperactive child has received little attention, although some information on it has been presented in the form of incidental findings. In order to meet this need for objective, controlled data, a research project, in which the writer participated, was designed to study the behaviour of hyperactive children in a variety of test situations. The specific concern of the experiment reported in the present thesis was the behaviour of hyperactive children in a controlled learning situation, using a concept formation task.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sc576.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s7039</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Exceptional children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child development</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afx719p502"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Indications for transfer for childbirth in women served by the Innuulisivik maternity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chatwood, Susan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Innuulisivik: maternity is a northern based service in Povungnituk, Quebec which serves the Inuit women of the Hudson Coast. Although most women stay in the north for childbirth, others are transferred south. This thesis will describe the experience of the Innuulisivik: maternity which uses committee based risk assessment for transfer decisions. Data for the three year period 1989 -1991 were examined. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the observed differences in the distribution of several variables according to birthplace. Data were available for 411 women. 350 (85.2%) of the births occurred at Innuulisivik, 44 (10.7 %) women were transferred and 17 (4.1 %) were nursing station births. In 4/5 of all transfers, clinical conditions were identified which in themselves usually require transfer. Premature labour was prevalent in the transfer group. The data demonstrates that risk scoring by consensus is a viable option for northern birthing units. Finally logistical and cultural factors should be included for meaningful risk assessment in the north.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gq41z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719p502</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Epidemiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k726p"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Electronic structure and transport properties of quantum dots</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Güçlü, Alev Devrim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this Ph.D thesis, electronic structure and transport properties of quantum dots are studied using advanced numerical techniques based on fundamental many-body theory. In fact, in such nanostructures, correlation and quantization effects dominate motion of electrons like in real atoms, hence an exact treatment is often necessary to understand and predict their electronic properties. Moreover, experimental realization of quantum dots in the presence of magnetic field gives rise to several new many-body physics that are inaccessible in real atoms, and they provide a crucial testing ground for important concepts of mesoscopic and nanoscopic phenomena. The many-body tools used in this work include exact diagonalization, quantum Monte Carlo, Hartree-Fock, and Keldysh Nonequilibrium Green's function analysis. Each of these methods have their advantages and inconveniences. For studying closed systems with small number of electrons, exact diagonalization is the best choice, since it provides complete information about the total energy, wave functions and correlations for not only the ground state but also for excited states. We used exact diagonalization method to study in detail circular parabolic and ring shaped quantum dots containing up to 8 electrons, and we have found that spatial localization of electrons inside the dot gives rise to interesting new physics. On the other hand, for studying disordered quantum dots exact diagonalization method becomes powerless due to the broken spatial symmetry. Thus, we developed a fixed-phase quantum Monte Carlo algorithm combined with Hartree-Fock solutions, which allowed us to investigate the effect of impurities on electronic properties inside parabolic dots containing up to 13 electrons. To investigate open systems and transport properties, we have expanded exact diagonalization solutions in terms of Keldysh Green's functions which allowed us to discover a new transport blockade regime. Finally, again using Keldysh Green's function formalism, we have studied a double quantum dot system in the presence of Kondo resonance, and we have shown that multi-channel transport gives rise to particularly interesting competition effects between resonant tunneling and Kondo effect.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bd87r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k726p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472z55g"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of an intelligent injection system and its application to resin transfer molding</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chu, Jingsong</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) is a procedure in composite material manufacturing in which resin and fibers are held apart until the last possible moment. In this way it can be contrasted with other manufacturing methods where the resin and fiber are combined prior to use. In RTM, unresinated fibers are held within a tool cavity and a differential pressure is applied to a supply of resin so that the resin flows into the reinforcement completely wetting it out. Reinforcements may be made of any fiber and the use of all forms has been reported, from unidirectional through woven or knitted cloths to needled and random mats and fully three-dimensional reinforcement preforms. The resin can be of a very wide range of chemistries and formulations, so long as the basic process requirements are met. Cure times can be from a few minutes to many hours. Resin injection machines vary widely, and production line design can be just as varied. The focus of this project will be the development of an intelligent injection system and its application to RTM. In order to achieve this, the Lab VIEW program will be employed to control pressure and flow rate—the two important parameters of RTM. This system includes an injector, computer, data acquisition boards, electric system and pneumatic system. A number of experiments have been performed to find the optimal application of this system. During the manufacturing of composite parts, all the processing parameters, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate and displacement with respect to time, can be written to a computer hard disk to be analyzed later. All the data acquired during the operation can help us to understand in depth the processing of composite materials and the relationship between process, quality and property.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jd489.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472z55g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17cw28f"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fraue und seele : relations texte-musique dans les Altenberg lieder op. 4 de Berg</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pedneault, D. Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>For his first work composed without Schoenberg's supervision, Berg chose to set five short poems by his friend and intellectual idol, the controversial poet Peter Altenberg. Carrying the title Filnf Orchesterlieder nach Ansichtskarten-Texten von Peter Altenberg (1912), the cycle is at once aphoristic (with respect to the songs' duration) and titanic (with respect to their orchestration and motivic density). But the title invites the question: what imagery might the composer have hoped to illustrate with these musical postcards? This thesis investigates text-music relations in Berg's opus 4 with the objective of showing that the music's structure, far from being semantically neutral, participates actively in the création of rich poetic imagery anchored in the socio-cultural context of turn-of-the-century Vienna. Previous studies focus on the work's cyclic motives its interval-cycle substructure. The present study focuses on text-music relations and voice leading - the contrapuntal and harmonie procedures which govern the music's surface and determine its deep structure. It is shown that the voice-leading structures of the individual lieder - in both local detail and at a more broadly conceptual level - give form, meaning, and nuance to the poetic image that emerges in each song, and help define the different facets—physical, emotional, and spiritual — of the protagonist that inhabits them.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mx659.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cw28f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Berg, Alban, 1885-1935 -- Lieder, orchestral acc., op. 4</dc:subject><dc:subject>Songs (Medium voice) with orchestra -- Analysis, appreciation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Altenberg, Peter, 1859-1919 -- Musical settings</dc:subject><dc:subject>Songs (High voice) with orchestra -- Analysis, appreciation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Berg, Alban, 1885-1935. -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583xx064"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Exploring access to NAFTA's environment commission complaint process</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hernandez, Roberto</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This paper raises questions about the accessibility of the Articles 14 &amp; 15 submissions mechanism, a public complaint process that attempts to use the eyes of ordinary persons in Canada, Mexico and the US to monitor an important environmental treaty obligation: NAFTA signatories' commitment to effectively enforce their environmental laws. In order to consider whether the Articles 14 &amp; 15 review tool is accessible, we assemble a set of indicators that nourish four hypotheses, which may reveal if the review tool is sufficiently well installed to attain its long term objectives in a significant measure. The hypotheses are: 1) that the CEC receives an insufficient amount of submissions; 2) that it takes considerable or random times to process them; 3) that it consistently takes longer, or has more troubles, to process Mexican and disadvantaged-group cases; 4) that few complainants harvest any benefits from complaining, being more likely that they do if they are rich environmental NGOs than if they are ordinary individuals. The information we present is based on primary research and statistical information on the processing of NAAEC Articles 14 and 15 submissions. Our chief objective is not to conclusively prove or disprove these hypotheses, but to provide a framework to respond these questions. By consistently focusing their efforts on evaluating the attainment of the ultimate objectives of this review tool, all authors who have critiqued the Articles 14 &amp; 15 submissions process have failed to consider whether the complaint mechanism is effectively positioned to capture environmental law enforcement information from all of its target population. Instead, this paper explores the implementation of Articles 14 &amp; 15 by generating information on the attainment of its midcourse objectives. This paper may be of interest to persons working on issues concerning the implementation and further elaboration of NAAEC Articles 14 and 15 and to those pondering whether and how the proposed FTAA and the Canada-Chile Free Trade Accord should be structured to deal with the environmental consequences of further economic integration.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fn859.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583xx064</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Commission for Environmental Cooperation (Montréal, Québec)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental law -- North America</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada. -- Treaties, etc. -- 1992 Oct. 7</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mp53w"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Short-term costs of relocating a territory in a Caribbean damselfish, Stegastes diencaeus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McDougall, Peter T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Little is known about the costs of relocating a territory into an established neighbourhood. In this study we investigated short-term costs of relocation in the longfin damselfish, Stegastes diencaeus, on a fringing reef in Barbados. Experimental removals of residents created vacancies, and focal observations over two days examined the intensity and duration of behavioural changes in the newcomers. Newcomers used smaller territories than original residents, and exhibited increased movement, increased agonistic behaviour and decreased foraging. The behavioural changes suggest that energetics are a major cost to relocation, but that opportunity costs, predation risk and injuries are also important. Differences between strangers and expanding neighbours support the concept of 'dear enemy' recognition, but familiarity does not influence the agonistic behaviour initiated by these newcomers. The costs reported here represent important limitations to the mobility of individuals and provide insights into the stability of fish territories.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52jb15m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mp53w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stegastes -- Territoriality -- Barbados</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av692t850g"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of scriptural testimony, reason and spiritual practice in Upadésasahasri : a non-commentarial work of ´Sa?nkara</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fillion, Christine Marguerite</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis is an examination of the prose part of the UpadesascThasri, a non-commentarial work of Sahkaracarya (8 century CE).

The second main objective was to study the influence of WTM on grain corn yields. Two drainage treatments were compared: conventional free drainage and WTM (combined controlled drainage and subirrigation) with a design water table depth at 0.6 m below the ground surface. Tile drainage and surface runoff were monitored and sampled automatically. Increased outflow volumes and concentrations - and therefore increased P loads - were measured in drainage water from plots under WTM. Plots under WTM also generally exhibited higher P loads in surface runoff. Higher P concentrations in surface runoff from plots under WTM were observed in surface runoff, especially during winter. Phosphorus loads from combined tile drainage and surface runoff were low compared with literature data (&lt;0.4 kg/ha/year). However, the mean P concentrations in tile drainage were above Quebec's surface water quality standard of 0.03 mg total P/L during both growing seasons in plots under WTM, but not in plots with conventional free drainage. Mean P concentrations in surface runoff water routinely exceeded the criteria, except in plots with conventional free drainage in winter 2002. Therefore, P from tile drainage and surface runoff could contribute to the eutrophication of surface water. Based on these results, WTM increases P loads from the field, both in tile drainage and surface runoff. However, the well water used for subirrigation was found to contain P concentrations above Quebec's surface  water quality standard, and this could partly explain the higher P concentrations found in water from plots under WTM. Water table management increased grain corn yields by 35% in both years. The growing seasons of 2001 and 2002 were among the driest ever recorded in Canada.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b1087.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290c71c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Water table -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corn -- Soils -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corn -- Yields -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Phosphorus content -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10ws566"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Exposure of the eastern screech-owl to selected contaminants in apple orchards of southern Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Richards, Ngaio L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examined the exposure of the Eastern Screech-owl (Otus asio) to contaminants in apple orchards of southern Quebec. Using a worstcase scenario approach, secondary exposure to three organophosphorus insecticides, (phosmet, azinphosmethyl and phosalone), two anticoagulant rodenticides, (chlorophacinone and diphacinone), and residues of previously applied organochlorines, particularly DDT and metabolites, was assessed. Exposure to PCBs and trace metals was also considered. Small mammal species preyed upon by Screech-owls were captured in orchards for residue analysis on a continual basis for persistent compounds or after insecticide and rodenticide applications. Beginning in the winter of 2000, 98 nest boxes were constructed and installed in woods inhabited by Screech-owls, adjacent to orchards. These boxes were then repeatedly inspected for pellets and prey remains. Estimated exposure of Screech-owls 0-60 hr post-application was 0.641 mg/kg for phosmet and azinphosmethyl and 0.401 mg/kg for phosalone. Exposure to phosmet at this level may warrant concern. The acute poison zinc phosphide is now the primary means of small mammal control in the study area and the possibility of exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides is diminishing. Observed DDE residues were most elevated in the short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) and ranged from &lt;1.00 to 26.29 ug/g (wet wt) in whole-body pools. A Screech-owl egg found in a nest box between two orchards may have been thinned by as much as 19.8%, of concern because thinning maintained at 15.0 - 20.0% has been linked to population decline. Only background levels of PCBs and trace metals were detected. Finally, over 950 Screech-owl case files were also obtained from one Canadian and seven United States wildlife rehabilitation facilities and analyzed for evidence that pesticide exposure was an underlying or contributing cause of admissions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4306903.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10ws566</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Orchards -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Eastern screech owl -- Effect of pesticides on -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac821gn17s"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Skate blade hollow and oxygen consumption during forward skating</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Morrison, Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of skate blade hollow on oxygen consumption during forward skating on a treadmill. Varsity level female hockey players ( n = 10, age = 21.7 yr) performed skating tests at three blade hollows (0.25 in, 0.50 in, and 0.75 in). The subjects skated for four minutes at three submaximal velocities (12, 14, and 16 km/h), separated by five minutes of passive recovery. In addition, a VO^max test was performed on the day that the subjects skated at the 0.50 in hollow. The VOimax test commenced at 14 km/h and increased by 1 km/h each minute until volitional exhaustion was achieved. Four variables were measured for each skating bout, volume of gas expired (VE), volume of oxygen consumed (VO2), heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). No significant differences (pO.05) were found in any of the four test variables (VE, VO2, HR, RPE) across the three skate hollows. These results show that when skating on a treadmill at submaximal velocities, skate blade hollow has no significant effect on VE, VO2, HR or RPE.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hx61f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gn17s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Treadmill exercise tests</dc:subject><dc:subject>Skating -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Skates -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
