G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is, primarily, a presentation of a "re-exploration" of the physiography and vegetation of a large portion of Northern Ontario. At the same time, it serves as an illustration of a method of multiple survey through the use of aerial photographs. The area of Northern Ontario which is "re-explored" is the roughly 93,903 square miles encompassed by the Albany River Sheet (No. 2220) of the World Aeronautical Chart Series, published at a scale of 1 to 1 million (Map 1, in pocket). There were three principal reasons for selecting this particular area. One is that it is contiguous to Northern Quebec where similar studies have been made by research groups in the Geography Department of McGill University.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hare, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92gb92j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x287g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612s240"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The application of information theory to mathematical linguistics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dawson, Donald. A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The first attempts to apply information theory to mathematical linguistics were made by C. Shannon in 1948 (ref.60) and by B. Mandelbrot in 1952 (ref.39). Information theory, now a branch of mathematical probability, was originally introduced by communications engineers. Thus, in the papers of Shannon and Mandelbrot analogies between the applications to physics and the applications to linguistics are frequently stressed. Fortunately, information theory bas very recently been developed on a purely mathematical basis. Thus, in this thesis references to physical analogies will be made only where they seem to clarify the situation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lambek, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58ph55d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612s240</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tz96r"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Factors contributing to compatibility in marriage for a sample of 465 Canadian wives</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Davison, Daintry</ual:dissertant><ual:dissertant>Gerhardt, Aleida</ual:dissertant><ual:dissertant>McGibbon, Joan</ual:dissertant><ual:dissertant>Segal, Constance</ual:dissertant><ual:dissertant>Watts, June</ual:dissertant><ual:dissertant>Zukerman, Norma</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyses the 465 completed questionnaires of a 1958 newspaper mail survey or Canadian women living with their husbands. Of the 12 items on the questionnaire, the first 8 enlisted information relevant to the respondent's age, husband's age, duration of the marriage, previous marriage if any, number of children, length of acquaintance prior to the marriage, husband's occupation, and wife's occupation if she was working outside the home. The remaining 4 items requested the respondent to state the qualities she liked most in her husband, those she disliked most, whether she would marry him again, and, finally, to state reasons why she would or would not.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ross, V.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h099c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tz96r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246w64n"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pillars: applications and limitations in underground mining</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Davies, John. J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The applications and limitations of pillars in underground mines is a subject that is of great importance to many mining companies, both new and old, but unfortunately has received little attention in the mining literature. Where underground pillars are used, the determination of suitable sizes present a problem about which little is known. An attempt has been made to gain an understanding of the factors involved in this problem by reviewing both theoretical and practical information on the subject. With this at hand, an attempt has been made to analyse pillar designs used in the Elliot Lake Uranium District, Ontario.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morrison, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zj12z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246w64n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mining Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50h100x"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Adrenal function in experimental nephrosis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Das Gupta, Dyutish. C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The nephrotic syndrome is most frequently encountered in children within the age group of one to six years. It is characterized by the occurrence of massive albuminuria, hypoproteinemia, hyperlipemia and voluminous edema. When this syndrome is almost pure, that is to say, when it is not accompanied by hematuria, renal insufficiency or hypertension, it has for a long time been referred to as lipuid nephrosis. The German anatomists (MUNK, 1908; VOLLARD AND FAHR 1913) were the first to use this name arising from the observation that the renal tubules are infiltrated by birefringent liquid substances accompanied by signs of inflammation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Giroud, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s852f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50h100x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Investigative Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
