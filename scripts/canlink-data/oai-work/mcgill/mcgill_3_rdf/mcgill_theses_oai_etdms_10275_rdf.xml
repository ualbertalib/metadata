This derivative was excreted in the urine along with unchanged pentylenetetrazol. Pentylenetetrazol and its metabolite can be separated on paper chromatograms developed in water-saturated isobutanol. Both substances, however, are chromatographically inseparable with water as the mobile phase. Distribution of tritium-labelled pentylenetetrazol in the rat after intraperitoneal injection indicated that it was readily taken up by tissues, especially the liver. Perfusion of the isolated rat liver with citrated blood containing tritiated-pentylenetetrazol demonstrated that the metabolite of this central nervous system stimulant drug was formed in the intact liver. In vitro formation of the metabolite by the perfused rat liver was inhibited by SKF 525-A. No metabolite was formed, however, when the agent was incubated with rat liver homogenates. A simple column chromatographic method using the neutral resin Amberlite XAD-2 was developed to enable isolation of the metabolic derivative of pentylenetetrazol for further chemical analyses.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hosein, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hs69n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289n05m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vt96s"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Investigative Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Electron spin resonance activity in human breast cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kalomiris, Constantine G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Electron Spin Resonance measurements on lyophilized biopsy and mastectomy samples from 132 cases of human breast diseases showed a highly significant increase (P &lt; 0.00l) in mean g-factor gm, for the malignant diseases (gm = 2.0068 ± 0.0004) compared to the benign diseases (gm = 2.0050 ± 0.0002).

Reestablishment of the steady state concentrations of ATP requires 50 to 60 minutes. Decreased rates of protein synthesis, glycogen synthesis, ion transport, PRPP synthesis, and incorporation of adenine and hypoxanthine into the acid soluble fraction are associated with the decrease in ATP concentration. During the first 6 minutes following glucose addition fructose diphosphate accumulates and the concentration of inorganic phosphate decreases. Glycolysis and glucose utilization decrease in the interval between 1 and 6 minutes after the addition of glucose. After preincubation of the cells, addition of glucose does not cause large changes in ATP levels and the period of decreased metabolic activity is eliminated. The maximum rates of PRPP synthesis, glycolysis, and adenine incorporation are greater in non-preincubated than in preincubated cells. Partial replacement of sodium by potassium ions in the incubation medium causes a prolongation of the period of ATP recovery and of decreased metabolic activity. Possible factors involved in the regulation of the above events are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scholefield, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f908t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462842r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mj61k"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The functional heterogeneity of the lymphocyte</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Daguillard, Fritz</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Rabbit and human lymphocytes were studied for their capacity to respond with blastogenesis and mitosis to various stimuli in vitro.

There is a correlation between endogenous adrenal ascorbic acid levels and the ability of the glands to transport ascorbic acid -I-14 C in vitro in a variety of species. The transport system is specific for L-ascorbic acid. ACTH, cyclic AMP, and a number of corticosteroids inhibit ascorbic acid uptake but do not alter a variety of other transport systems. ACTH, and cyclic AMP inhibition of ascorbate transport parallels the stimulation of steroidogenesis in response to these agents. ACTH and cyclic AMP inhibition of ascorbate transport is dependent on protein synthesis but not on RNA synthesis. Inhibition by corticosteroids is not dependent on protein or RNA synthesis, indicating that the corticosteroids produced in response to ACTH and cyclic AMP are responsible for the observed inhibition of ascorbic acid transport. Ascorbic acid -I-14 C is actively transported in the rat pituitary gland in vitro.

Auditory naming was also assessed in blind children and found to be significantly inferior to that of control subjects, suggesting that the superiority of visual naming in seeing children cannot be attributed to factors of attention or set.

The ARC which were morphologically small lymphocytes, could be isolated by passage of the normal bone marrow cells through an antigen-sensitized glass bead column. Immunocompetence following irradiation correlated with the reappearance of the bone marrow ARC. Furthermore, the ARC activity could be initiated by incubation of the cells with the antigen in vitro.

A method is presented utilizing ultraviolet spectrophotometry to measure the concentration of polypeptides fractionated by continuous flow and horizontal electrophoresis by extrapolation from density-concentration curves of type 12, 60-75 percent polypeptides.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Matheson, B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q7324.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05ff93m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Microbiology and Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wt53k"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Investigative Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>'In vitro' corticosteroid biosynthesis by frog and turtle interrenals</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mehdi, Afzal Z.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The pathways of steroid biosynthesis have been explored in interrenals from the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta picta).

The cleavage mechanism is NADPH dependent and mitochondrial-bound, 3) delta-5-pregnenolone-4-l4c is converted into delta-4-3keto metabolites. This reaction is effected by all subcellular fractions.

Histologically tumor regression resulted from massive cell autolysis, while other cells persisted with the formation of irregular acinar spaces containing a milk-like fiuid histochemically similar to normal rat milk. Electron microscopy revealed structural differentiation in these tumor cells similar to that found in lactating breast cells, but the cellular secretory mechanism and cytomorphological characteristics of this tumor milk were unlike that of a normal lactating rat breast. Furthermore, mammary tumor mitochondria of the thyroxine treated host revealed both structural and functional abnormalities. Although tumor regression occurred despite the endocrine milieu in a hyperthyroid rat favouring tumor growth, it was concluded that thyroid hormone acts directly on the tumor mitochondria to induce a form of wasteful oxidative metabolism, thereby interfering with the energy requirements of the mammary tumor.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kalant, N.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773z705.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bm41v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gg98s"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mechanism of action of azaguanine and use of inhibitors of protein biosynthesis in the study of cellular controls</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kwan, Sau-Wah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A study has been made of the mechanism of action of 8-azaguanine and the possible use of this analogue, together with other inhibitors of protein biosynthesis in the study of cellular controls operating through polyribosomes. The results indicate that 8-azaguanine causes a preferential breakdown in vivo of the membrane-free polyribosomes in normal, regenerating and neoplastic rat liver to inactive monomers and dimers, with a concomitant inhibition of protein biosynthesis. 8-Azaguanine-2-C14 is incorporated into components of the polyribosomes; although the transport of ribosomes to the cytoplasm is inhibited, the synthesis of nuclear RNA does not appear to be significantly inhibited. The kinetics of incorporation of 8-azaguanine into nucleotides and into RNA support the theory that 8-azaguanine acts through the formation of defective messenger RNA. The free and membrane-bound polyribosomes are equally active in vivo. Most of the polyribosomes in Hepatoma 7800 appear to be functional in vivo.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webb, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bp748.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gg98s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322h68h"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Investigative Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Adrenal cortical function in murine leukemia</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khalid, Rauf A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An ultramicro radioassay based on the principle of competitive protein-binding was adapted for use in the determination of plasma corticosterone and urinary corticosteroids of high leukemia AKR and low-leukemia C57 mice.

In adult lungs the bronchi accounted for the bulk of the airway resistance but in children below 5 years the contribution of the bronchioles rose sharply. Additional studies suggested that the bronchioles develop at a slower rate than the parenchymal surface of the lung and that this anatomic fact causes bronchiolitis to be more serious in young children than adults. Organic disease of the small airways was the major cause of airway obstruction in emphysematous lungs and collateral pathways were important in ventilating the parenchyma beyond this obstruction. The centrilobular emphysematous spaces were found to have a decreased compliance and their anatomy suggested that they may be ventilated both from the atmosphere and collaterally from surrounding parenchyma. Regional lung volumes and the pleural pressure. gradient were estimated in dogs using measurements of lung density and these data are used to discuss the support of the lungs within the thorax.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macklem, P.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Thurlbeck, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010t13h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vt972</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613n1621"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Monteregian dike rocks</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hodgson, Christopher J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Monteregian petrographic province of southern Quebec consists of eleven alkalic intrusive stocks, and associated dikes and sills. The latter consist of lamprophyres (camptonite, fourchite, alnoite), leucocratic dikes (bostonite, tinguaite, ijolite) and mesocratic dikes of intermediate composition. The lamprophyres are distributed in three zones bounded by faults: an eastern camptonite zone, a central fourchite zone, and a western alnoite zone. The westward transition represents chemically a progressive decrease in Si02, Al203, Ti02 and total Fe, and a progressive increase in MgO, CaO, K20/Na20 and volatiles content of the respective lamprophyres, and is interpreted as generation of separate magma batches at increasingly greater depths within the upper mantle westward.
