In demonstrating that reification and hegemony were formulated in response to the unsuccessful revolutionary movements in Hungary and Italy of 1919-1920, it becomes evident that the respective theories of Lukacs and Gramsci were meant to constitute critiques of bourgeois cultural domination. Thus, their problematic extends to analyses of more specific issues, such as the role of positivist science as the prevailing "paradigm of rationality" and the instrumental function of "traditional" and "organic intellectuals." The solutions that both theorists sought in order to overcome reification and hegemony are embedded in their neo-Hegelian interpretations of Marxism, where historical materialism is defined as a methodology characterised by its utilisation of the conceptual tools of "dialectic," "totality," and "absolute historicism." However, Lukacs was forced by historical circumstances to retreat into the realm of aesthetics, although he continued the critique of reification by way of his theory of critical realism. Simultaneously, Gramsci began to elaborate more practical solutions to cultural domination through his theory of the "war of position," catharsis, and counter-hegemony.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hellman, John</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pd783.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831ck85r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gramsci, Antonio, 1891-1937 -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Politics and culture -- Italy -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lukács, György, 1885-1971 -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Politics and culture -- Hungary -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akw52j893k"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evaluation of new industrial product ideas : an empirical study of the new product screening model and an analysis of managers' screening behavior</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Brentani, Ulrike</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis evaluates how industrial product firms screen new product ideas. Its aims are to investigate: (1) the evaluative dimensions used when assessing proposals, (2) how these criteria relate to screening decisions and (3) how new product environments--market, product and firm--affect this decision model. A two stage research approach involved: (1) the establishment of new product screening attributes relevant to industrial product firms and (2) a reassessment by managers of recently screened new product ideas (accepts and rejects) in terms of these attributes. Managers' new product screening decisions supported the hypothesized decision model. Nine of the eleven composite dimensions characterizing new industrial products, were key determinants in explaining screening decisions. These dimensions were further classified according to: (1) four basic criteria categories, (2) the basic risk/return investment model and (3) the screening role played by each. Moreover, the project environment, particularly its market, had a significant influence on the screening model. The results have implications for developing operationally more effective screening approaches.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579t10d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j893k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Product management</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marketing -- Decision making</dc:subject><dc:subject>New products</dc:subject><dc:subject>Decision making</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct84c"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ita</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Italian</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Vincenzo Cuoco, vita e opere</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sbarra, Ugo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A genuine and conscious Italian nationalism began to manifest itself during the Napoleonic era, and Vincenzo Cuoco was the apostle of this first revival of national consciousness.

The purpose of our thesis is thus twofold. On the one hand, we wish to emphasize Cuoco's constant preoccupation with the shaping of the future Italian nation, through a large-scale re-education of the public, in order to re-integrate the lower classes, the common people, and raise them to a reasonable degree of civil consciousness. On the other hand, we shall attempt to bring out the internal unity of Cuoco's writings, which are not the product of a random inspiration, but rather constitute an organic whole, a systematic program of moral and political reconstruction of the Italian nation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935386s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17ct84c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cuoco, Vincenzo, 1770-1823</dc:subject><dc:subject>Politicians -- Italy -- Biography</dc:subject><dc:subject>Italy -- Politics and government -- 1789-1815</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zh65h"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Unemployment in Jamaica : an analysis of the relation between the demand for labour and the distribution of income</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brown, Adlith, 1939-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study attempts to extend the scope of existing analyses of unemployment in Jamaica by exploring empirically one aspect of the relation between demand and unemployment. The central hypothesis is that the structure of consumer expenditures which result from a highly skewed income distribution pattern is a cause of continuing high levels of unemployment. A static Leontieff-type input-output model is used to generate solutions for industry output levels and associated employment levels, for alternative expenditure patterns resulting from income redistribution. The results confirm the hypothesis. It was found that although higher employment levels were generally associated with more equitable income distribution structures, employment expansion was also constrained by the absence of intersectoral linkages.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x4847.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zh65h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Unemployed -- Jamaica</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jamaica -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Income distribution -- Jamaica</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451j405"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structural organization and phosphorylation of mammalian neurofilament subunits</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Julien, Jean-Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The structural organization and phosphorylation of the 68,000 (P68), 145,000 (P145) and 200,000 (P200) dalton subunits of rat neurofilaments (NFs) were investigated. Partial proteolysis of NFs with chymotrypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease provided evidence that the disposition of each of the three subunits within the NF structure is different. The proteolytic fragments of P68 and P145 were recovered mainly in the particulate centrifugal fraction, indicating that the two subunits are closely associated with the filament backbone. In contrast, a 160,000 dalton fragment of P200 which may correspond to the side-arm projections on NFs, was released into solution by chymotryptic cleavage. P68, P145 and P200 were found to be phosphorylated in vivo and were shown to contain about 3, 9 and 22 mols of phosphate/mol of polypeptide, respectively. The phosphate moieties in the subunits are predominantly in form of phosphoserine, although P145 also contains a small amount of phosphothreonine. Proteolytic cleavage studies on NFs that were ('32)P-labelled in vivo revealed that the phosphorylation sites on the subunits are localized in restricted domains. No ('32)P was detected in that region of each subunit that may be involved in formation of the filament backbone. The majority of phosphorylation sites in NFs are peripherally located in a 40,000 dalton segment of the projection domain of P200. The observed similarities between the phosphopeptide maps of in vivo- and in vitro-('32)P-labeled NF subunits indicated that the polypeptides are phosphorylated in vivo by a protein kinase activity that co-purifies with NF preparations. Characterization of the protein kinase activity revealed that it is cyclic AMP-independent, preferentially phosphorylates casein as compared to histone, has a Km for ATP of 20(mu)M, and does not appear to be associated with the projection domain of P200. The activity is distinct from the microtubule-associated protein kinase activity since the latter phosphorylates different sites on P145.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bf898.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451j405</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801ph09s"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fatty acid reductase : an enzyme complex catalyzing the synthesis of aldehydes for bacterial bioluminescence</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Riendeau, Denis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The biosynthesis of long chain aliphatic aldehydes required for light emission by bacterial luciferase has been studied in Photobacterium phosphoreum. A fatty acid reductase has been identified and shown to catalyze the conversion of fatty acids to their corresponding aldehydes in a reaction that requires NADPH and cleavage of ATP to AMP. The fatty acid reductase activity was measured using a sensitive luminescence coupled assay with luciferase or from the reduction of {('3)H}tetradecanoic acid to {('3)H}aldehyde using thin layer chromatography to resolve the product of the reaction. The measurement of the enzyme activity in extracts during bacterial growth indicated that the fatty acid reductase activity is induced at a late stage of growth during development of bioluminescence. The fatty acid reductase has also been shown to catalyze the ATP-dependent activation of the fatty acid to an acyl-protein (acyl-protein synthetase activity) and the reduction of tetradecanoyl-CoA to the aldehyde (acyl-CoA reductase activity). Acyl-protein synthetase and acyl-CoA reductase were resolved into functional components and shown to restore fatty acid reductase activity upon mixing. The acyl-CoA reductase has been purified to apparent homogeneity, giving a single polypeptide of molecular weight of 58,000 as analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The changes in physical and kinetic properties of these enzymes after their resolution demonstrate that they are associated into an enzyme complex which catalyzes the reduction of fatty acids in bioluminescent bacteria.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bq151.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801ph09s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adz010q97x"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Radar as a remote sensor of regions of supercooled cloud water</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Massambani, Oswaldo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A new technique, named Vertical Profile Indicator (VPI), which uses the vertical structure of the reflectivity profile to delineate regions most likely to have supercooled liquid water content (SCLWC) within the precipitation field, was developed. When the aircraft flew in the "active regions" (as defined by the VPI technique) it was found that 90% of the time significant amounts of SCLWC were observed. Using Doppler and "Quasi-Doppler" radar data, high convergence cores (&gt; 3.0 x 10('-3) s('-1)) and updraft activity were observed to occur preferentially in the "active regions". During the 1981 winter-spring period of the Precipitation Enhancement Project in the Duero Basin of Spain percentages of "active regions" in relation to the whole precipitation field, and in relation to the total radar observation area, did not exceed 47% and 18% respectively. The VPI technique provides information which may be used to direct research aircraft to cloud regions containing SCLWC to allow measurements of the time evolution of their microphysical state. These measurements would permit a better estimation of the residence time of the SCLWC and its removal rates. This is a key parameter for better understanding the microphysical properties of clouds and consequently the possibility of artificial modification of precipitation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042t81j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q97x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Radar meteorology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cloud physics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Precipitation Enhancement Project</dc:subject><dc:subject>Supercooled liquids</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn009z73z"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Minimal aeration of swine manure for odor control</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ghaly, Abdelkader Elmetwaly</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A race track type oxidation ditch with a disc aerator was constructed on a model scale.

The effect of the manure concentration on the microbial growth was investigated in a batch culture operation. High manure concentration had an inhibitory effect on the microbial growth. Data from batch culture operation were used to design a continuous culture operation. The latter was used to evaluate the concept of minimal aeration of swine manure for odor control.

It is reported here that the infection of soybean (Glycine max L.) roots with Rhizobium japonicum results in the synthesis by the plant of at least 18-20 polypeptides other than leghemoglobin during the development of root nodules. Identification of these "nodule-specific" host polypeptides (referred to as nodulins) was accomplished by two-dimensional gel analysis of the immunoprecipitates formed by a "nodule-specific" antiserum with in vitro translation products of root nodule polysomes that are free of bacteroidal contaminations. Nodulins account for 7-11% of the total ('35)S-methionine-labeled protein synthesized in the host cell cytoplasm, and the majority of them are of 12,000-20,000 molecular weight. These proteins are absent from the uninfected roots, bacteroids and free-living Rhizobium, and appear to be coded for by the plant genes that may be obligatory for the development of symbiosis in the legume root nodules. Analysis of nodulins in ineffective (unable to fix nitrogen) nodules developed due to Rhizobium strains SM5 and 61A24 showed that their synthesis is reduced and their expression differentially influenced by mutations in rhizobia. Apart from the low molecular weight nodulins, a 35,000 MW polypeptide present in the nodule cytoplasm was also identified as "nodule-specific". This protein, referred to as nodulin-35, represents about 4% of the total cytoplasmic protein in root nodules, and its appearance is not affected by mutations in several nodulating strains of Rhizobium. Nodulin-35 was not detected in uninfected soybean, bacteroids or free-living Rhizobium, and it appears to be synthesized by the plant during the formation of root nodules. Whereas the transformation of free-living Rhizobium into bacteroids is accompanied by substantial changes within the population of cytoplasmic proteins, the majority of plant polypeptides from nodules are also present in uninfected (non-nodulated) roots. Hence, to further identify and isolate the "nodule-specific" proteins, it was essential to develop several immunological procedures, including a preparative adsorption of antibodies with antigens, the multiple immunoreplica technique, and isolation of a single-copy mRNA by immunoprecipitation of the nascent peptide-polysome complex, which are described in this thesis. In addition, two polypeptides of bacterial origin were found to be cross-reactive with the "nodule-specific" antiserum, suggesting that they are secreted into the host cell cytoplasm during symbiotic nitrogen fixation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666531z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n203r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plant proteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Root-tubercles</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soybean</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831ck861"><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Reading processes of skilled older adult readers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacLean, Margaret Louise</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An iterative case-study approach was used in this investigation of reading processes used by mature experienced readers. Six retired schoolteachers (aged 55 plus) were interviewed to obtain comprehensive data on their reading interests, attitudes, and life long reading habits. A combination of modified cloze and guided introspection procedures were used to examine the reading behaviours exhibited across multiple and varied texts. Scoring procedures were developed which considered sentence, partial text, and whole text level acceptability of modified cloze responses. As well, a framework which considered whether responses were mainly text-based or knowledge-based was developed for analyzing the guided introspection data. Results indicated that although attitudes towards reading were constant across total lifespan, reasons for reading and reading interests changed. Differences in processes used to comprehend text were apparent across both subjects and texts. Subjects exhibited similar sentence and partial text scores, but whole text level scores differed. Guided introspection protocols indicated mainly interactive response processing rather than either text-based or knowledge-based processing. Mode of processing changed across texts depending on reader interest in text topics. Results indicated the value of the iterative case-study design for obtaining intensive data on reading processes. As well, the procedures developed for collecting and analyzing data were useful for examining how readers construct and reconstruct meaning as they read.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nx92h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831ck861</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reading</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reading interests</dc:subject><dc:subject>Older people -- Books and reading</dc:subject><dc:subject>Comprehension -- Testing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap5547s27g"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The contributions of Anglophone African novelists to the novel</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Johnson, Joyce Walker</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The works of important Anglophone African novelists, in particular those who have contributed to the growing body of literary criticism, support their claim that there is a distinctive African novel. Their novels clearly demonstrate the attachment of the novel form to the specific cultural, social and political milieu in which it is produced. The thematic concerns of Anglophone African novelists have far-reaching effects on their treatment of subject-matter and on their narrative methods. The structures of certain important novels reveal patterns of experience which are typical of African societies. Symbols and motifs which are used to further structural development in many novels are derived from situations existing within the culture and from traditional oral literature. In depicting character, novelists emphasize African social values and develop characterization with reference to the present problems facing individuals in contemporary African societies. Verbal and narrative style in the novels are also clearly influenced by local idiom and the patterns of the indigenous languages. In general, novels by Anglophone African novelists show how the social motivations of the novelist and his cultural situation control his development of themes and his exercise of technique.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k806t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547s27g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>African fiction (English) -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am900nv43g"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>D.H. Lawrence's revision of E.M. Forster's fiction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sampson, Denis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Lawrence's revision of the fiction of his English comtemporary E. M. Forster is a key to the way in which Lawrence's imagination worked. He discovered in early 1915 that Forster was already producing a body of fiction which treated many of his own themes in a manner which resembled the visionary and prophetic mode he wished to create. This study demonstrates that Lawrence's motivation and method in the writing of many scenes in The Rainbow, Women in Love, The Lost Girl, Aaron's Rod, and St. Mawr are governed by his compulsive misreading of scenes, symbols, characters, settings, plots and motifs in Forster's fiction. It is evident that Lawrence needed to establish dominance over Forster in this manner in order to keep alive what he called his "passional inspiration."</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r9674565.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv43g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lawrence, D.

The hybridization of complementary DNA (cDNA) probes with homologous and heterologous polyadenylated polysomal RNAs showed that most of the 20,000-25,000 RNA sequences expressed were common to uninfected root and nodule tissues. There was a marked increase in the relative concentration of leghaemoglobin and moderately abundant nodule sequences following infection by Rhizobium. A nodule-specific cDNA probe (NS-cDNA), prepared by eliminating common root sequences by cascade hydroxylapatite chromatography, was used to characterize a small population of nodule-specific sequences. Hybridization of NS-cDNA to DNA from soybean embryos and not to Rhizobium demonstrated that these sequences are encoded by the host genome. Hybridization with nuclear RNA from uninfected tissues showed that the primary mode of regulation of these sequences is at the level of transcription. Expression of these small nodule-specific-mRNAs is differentially modulated by ineffective strains of Rhizobium. The relative concentration of nodule-specific and common moderately abundant sequences increased to varying extents, in parallel with leghaemoglobin, reaching a peak when nitrogen fixation commences. These data suggest that host gene expression is coordinately regulated during early nodule development. Indoleacetic acid appeared to modulate the expression of common moderately abundance sequences, but had no detectable effect upon leghaemoglobin or nodule-specific sequences. Preliminary characterization of 26 cDNA clones indicated that, in addition to leghaemoglobin and other positively regulated sequences, there were two clones whose mRNA concentration decreased during nodule development.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278t911.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm411</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Soybean -- Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Root-tubercles</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r3912"><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Changes in virulence of Neisseria meningitidis in response to in vitro growth conditions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brener, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neisseria meningitidis (SD1C) when grown in an iron-limited medium at low pH exhibited a dramatic increase in virulence for the mouse. This enhanced virulence correlated with a specific colonial type, and altered outer membrane protein profile, the expression of an uptake sytem for iron from human transferrin, and an increased resistance to phagocytosis by mouse polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The outer membrane of cells grown at pH 6.6 contained a 69,000 molecular weight protein (protein III) that was exposed on the cell surface. The outer membrane of iron-limited cells grown at pH 7.2 also exhibited protein III, but cells grown at pH 7.2 with sufficient iron possessed only minute quantities of this protein. Only iron-limited cells actively accumulated iron from human transferrin. Iron-limited cells initially took up ('59)Fe from transferrin at a similar rate, irrespective of their growth pH, but after 60 minutes cells grown at neutral pH accumulated less than half the ('59)Fe of cells from pH 6.6 cultures. At 24 hours, N. meningitidis (M2092) produced small and large colonies in which the cells elaborated predominantly thin (2.5 nm) and thick (4.5 nm) pili, respectively. The piliated meningococci possessed a sizeable intracellular pili(n) pool and, although in vitro pili reassembly was energy-independent, the in vivo assembly of pili on the meningococcal surface required a functional respiratory chain. Meningococci normally piliated at pH 7.2 were nonpiliated at pH 6.6, whereas nonpiliated meningococci at pH 7.2 remained nonpiliated at low pH. The effect of simulated in vivo growth conditions on meningococcal phenotype and virulence are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xm658.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r3912</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
