They were "equipotentiality" and "mass action." Both concepts were supported by impressive experimental evidence; a number of further studies have tended to confirm them (these will be summarized later), and both terms are firmly established in the literature. Nonetheless, this state of affairs has not been entirely satisfactory. It is difficult to reconcile mass action and equipotentiality with the results of many studies on animals higher than the rat.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hebb, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526h227.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913t83x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88cm52x"><ual:graduationDate>1954</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The administration and scope of Canadian Anti-Monopoly policy since the Second World War</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Singer, Paul.

D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Following the discovery of lead-zinc deposits in the O'Connor Lake area, N.W.T. during the period 1948-50, the Geological Survey of Canada decided to undertake a programme of geological mapping and examination of mineral occurrences in the area during the year 1952, under the supervision of Dr. A. B. Irwin, the then Resident Geologist of Yellowknife, N.W.T. After a shortwhile however, the present writer assumed full responsibility of the project and the mapping of the area was thence continued through the summers of 1952 and 1953 entirely by the present writer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kranck, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956k97d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hh21x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz806411s"><ual:graduationDate>1954</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Education, technology, and the end of man</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Price, John. W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study of modern technical education has been restricted to a consideration of that type of technical education which is directed chiefly towards industrial and engineering occupations; hence, agricultural education and commercial education have been excluded as topics which might be considered in distinct, separate, comprehensive studies. Excluded from this study, for similar reasons partially, are the courses in manual training, industrial arts, and domestic science, which are often given in elementary and secondary schools; moreover, a study of these courses has already been made by Orville White, in The History of the Practical Education Courses in Canadian Secondary Schools, McGill University Thesis, April, 1951.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Currie, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128f98b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806411s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w3805"><ual:graduationDate>1954</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fertility in diploid and tetraploid red clover</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Povilaitis, Bronys</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>With the progress or civilization agriculturists have been asked to provide the population with more and better food. Accordingly, attention has been directed not only to those crops which can be used as an immediate source or food but also to those which only serve to provide fodder for domestic animals. Red clover is a plant of the latter type. The intermediate climatic zones of the Eurasian and North American continents constitute the main areas of distribution of red clover. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boyes, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dr09h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w3805</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wv56m"><ual:graduationDate>1954</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An economic analysis of accountancy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Potter, Calvin. C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work attempts to show the connection between economics and accountancy in the everyday practices of accountancy. To the best of my knowledge this theme has never before been treated on the scale of a book. J. Canning's work, The Economies of Accountancy, deals with the topic, but his is a static approach; he interprets accounting classifications economically. On the other hand, while Kenneth Boulding's latest book, A Reconstruction of Economics, is dynamic, using the balance sheet in all phases of economic analysis instead of merely in Money and Banking as heretofore, the emphasis is upon economic analysis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Beach, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x5263.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wv56m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v661q"><ual:graduationDate>1954</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the micro-environment of the free-living stages of nematodes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poole, John. B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Since the original studies of Boulenger (1915) (4), Ransom (1906) (38) and Veglia (1915) (46), in the beginning of the twentieth century there have been sporadic and isolated researches on various aspects of the effects of the micro-environmental conditions on bursate nematodes. These included both laboratory and field studies but covered a relatively small number of species of the bursate nematode group. In the laboratory the worms were usually subjected to various artificially imposed conditions and then were compared in their reactions and appearance to nematodes kept under natural conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cameron, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w9505452g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v661q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Parasitology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
