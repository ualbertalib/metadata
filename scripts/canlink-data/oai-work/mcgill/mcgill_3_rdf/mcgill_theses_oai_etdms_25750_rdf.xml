This thesis proposes a solution to this problem that is accomplished by utilizing the large collections of digitized music available at many libraries. Using OMEN, libraries will be able to perform on-demand feature extraction on site, returning feature values to researchers instead of providing direct access to the recordings themselves. This avoids copyright difficulties, since the underlying music never leaves the library that owns it.

This thesis will contend that pluralism is central to the Qur'an's vision for society as cooperative and inclusive, as exemplified in such verses as 2:62, 49:13, and 5:48. The Qur'anic doctrine of pluralism---buttressed by the notion of the commonality of humanity---influenced the Prophet's public policy, especially his actions and relations with other communities. This is seen especially in the 'Constitution of Medina', through which the Prophet aimed to establish a unified 'community of believers' (ummah) that included different religious groups, like Muslims and Jews.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v339k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cq73g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Religious pluralism -- Islam</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hc48h"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Modified LLL algorithms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhou, Tianyang, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Lattice basis reduction arises from many applications, such as cryptography, communications, GPS and so on. This thesis is concerned with the widely used LLL reduction. We cast it as a QRZ matrix factorization for real bases. Based on the matrix factorization, we first give the real version of the LLL algorithm (the original LLL algorithm is for integer bases). Then we propose three modified algorithms to improve the computational efficiency, while the reduced matrices satisfy the LLL-reduced criteria. The first modified algorithm, to be referred to as MLLLPIVOT, uses a block pivoting strategy. The second one, to be called MLLLINSERT, uses a greedy insertion strategy. The last one, to be called MLLLLAZY, uses a "lazy" size-reduction strategy. Extensive simulation results are given to show the improvements and different performance of the three algorithms. In addition, numerical stability of the LLL algorithm and the three modified algorithms is considered. The simulations indicate that on average the computational efficiency (measured by CPU time) of the four algorithms have the increasing order: LLL &lt; MLLLPIVOT &lt; MLLLINSERT &lt; MLLLLAZY, and the four algorithms are backward numerically stable in most cases, and in some extreme cases, the numerical stability of these algorithms is in an opposite order. Furthermore, we also give the complexity analysis of LLL, MLLLINSERT and MLLLLAZY under the assumption of using exact arithmetic.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306sz55p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hc48h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505082c"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>spa</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Hispanic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Amor, lesbianismo, niñas buenas, y putas : las protagonistas de Lucía Etxebarría</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ceia, Vanessa Vitorino</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Lucia Etxebarria's first two novels, Amor, curiosidad, prozac y dudas and Beatriz y los cuerpos celestes, demonstrate just how the author affirms, questions and discredits the binary notions that are historically associated with gender. A critical approach to the social roles traditionally categorized as masculine and feminine and the literal and symbolic concepts of homo, hetero and bisexuality---all of which are personified by the varied protagonists of the two works---unveils the faulty foundation upon which the cultural, sexual and even biological dichotomies of male and female are constructed and perpetuated. These arbitrary ideals are patriarchal constructs that inherently marginalize, conceal and even eradicate the innumerable unclassifiable gender combinations that can be found along the sexual spectrum.

On the basis of a careful reading of Zheng's three book-length histories of Chinese and world literature, written from the early 1920s to late 1930s, the thesis questions the characterization of Republican literary historical scholarship as simply iconoclastic (vis-a-vis Chinese tradition) or derivative (vis-a-vis the West). It shows that Zheng's literary historiography was actually comprised of multiple and sometimes contradictory approaches to the past. These approaches were shaped, on the one hand, by the demands of a professional discipline that was constructed on the ideal of a universal literature but also faced with the task of integrating the Chinese people into history; and, on the other, by a confrontation and creative negotiation with earlier readings and valuations of Chinese literature.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311p626.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246s35k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chinese literature -- History and criticism -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zheng, Zhenduo, 1898-1958 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722h9139"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ger</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Erika Mann et Pauline Julien : voix parallèles dans l'exil et l'engagement</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Augustin, Myriam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This master's thesis focuses on two female artists, Germany's Erika Mann (1905-1969) and Quebec's Pauline Julien (1928-1998).

Obesity is frequently accompanied by an array of health conditions such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes which are all considered to be part of what is now known as the metabolic syndrome. The role of adipose tissue as an endocrine organ has been emphasized by the characterization of its hormones: leptin, adiponectin and resistin. All three proteins regulate energy utilization. Over the past decade, leptin and resistin have also been shown to affect the reproductive system. This suggests that other adipocytokines, such as adiponectin, may also affect reproduction. This relationship was investigated using a porcine in vitro maturation system. When porcine cumulus oocyte complexes were matured in the presence of 30mug/mL of recombinant adiponectin an improvement in the meiotic maturation was observed. Moreover, maturation of denuded oocytes revealed that adiponectin acts through the cumulus cells to improve meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes. Finally, maturation of cumulus-oocyte complexes in the presence of MAPK pathway inhibitors suggested that adiponectin acts at or downstream of MEK1/2 and 38MAPK. This study shows, for the first time, an effect of adiponectin on porcine oogenesis. Further investigation will determine whether adiponectin also affects embryo development.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860720b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p740p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Swine -- Embryos</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oogenesis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fat cells</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qs194"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of plant sterols and exercise training on apolipoprotein A and B, adiponectin, growth hormone and ghrelin in hypercholesterolemic sedentary adults</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Collins, Melissa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Plant sterols (PS) lower total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and inflammatory markers, and decrease risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Hypertension occurs in 10% of pregnancies. Snoring is a marker for sleep apnea, and is a newly identified risk factor for gestational hypertension. Moreover, sleep apnea is an independent risk factor for hypertension in the non-pregnant population. I hypothesized that sleep apnea was associated with gestational hypertension. Hypothesis. The prevalence of sleep apnea is higher among pregnant women with hypertensive pregnancies than among those without hypertension during pregnancy. Design. Case-control study of 17 pregnant women with gestational hypertension and 33 pregnant women without hypertension, with matching by gestational age. Sleep apnea was ascertained by polysomnography. Results. The crude odds ratio for the presence of obstructive sleep apnea, given the presence of gestational hypertension, was 5.6. The odds ratio was 7.5 (95% CI 3.5-16), based on a logistic regression model with adjustment for maternal age, gestational age, nulliparity, first pregnancy, and body mass index. Conclusion. Gestational hypertension was strongly associated with the presence of obstructive sleep apnea.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395w7548.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tm20f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arv042t388"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evaluation of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging based measurement of myelin water</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chia, Charmaine L.

In brain, T2 distributions typically contain myelin water (MW), intra/extra-cellular water, and cerebrospinal fluid. The percentage of MW signal to the total T2 distribution signal constitutes the myelin water fraction (MWF), which is related to myelin content, making it a useful measure for monitoring demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis. This thesis presents simulations of T2 decay curves for white and grey matter brain tissue models and investigates the effect of analysis procedures on the T2 distribution and the MWF estimates. Cross-site reproducibility and scan re-scan experiments were also conducted to establish the reliability of MWF estimates and hence the applicability of the technique for clinical trials.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773v97z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042t388</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rp03r"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Calcium and vitamin D intake in a Canadian population : results from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poliquin, Suzette</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objectives. To estimate calcium and vitamin D intakes in Canadian men and women, to compare these intakes to Canadian guidelines, and to determine factors associated with intake of these nutrients. Methods. We estimated intakes of calcium and vitamin D from both diet and supplements using cross-sectional data from 9,423 randomly selected subjects 25 years of age and older who completed an interviewer administered abbreviated food frequency questionnaire. The participants were recruited from July 1995 to September 1997 in nine centres across Canada. We characterized the relationships of calcium and vitamin D with socio-demographic and lifestyle variables, physical characteristics, medical diagnosis and use of osteoporosis related medications. Results. The median daily intake for calcium was estimated to be 930 (interquartile range (IQR) = 589;1360) mg for women, and 774 (IQR = 507;1155) mg for men; for vitamin D, intakes were 3.6 (IQR = 1.1;10.0) pg and 2.7 (IQR = 0.9;7.5) pg for women and men, respectively. Age and study centre were found to be associated with calcium and vitamin D intakes in both genders. Other variables associated with calcium intake included vitamin D intake, weekly energy expenditure and femoral neck bone mineral density. Factors found to be associated with vitamin D intake in both genders included calcium intake, height and caffeine intake. Conclusions. The only group that on average met adequate daily intake levels for calcium was women aged 51-70. For vitamin D, on average, women and men under age 51 met adequate intake levels. Further education programs may be required to encourage increased consumption of these nutrients.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tm21q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rp03r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nutrition</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8336h226r"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors on bone mineral density</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Richards, John Brent</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objective. The use of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may impair load-induced bone formation but also prevent menopause-associated bone loss. We hypothesized that COX-2 inhibitor use would be associated with an increased bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women not using estrogen therapy and conversely, a decreased BMD in men. Methods. We used data from the Canadian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study, a longitudinal, randomly selected, population-based community cohort study. The outcome measure was percent difference in bone mineral density (g/cm2). Using linear regression, we estimated the effect of COX-2 inhibitors on this outcome, while adjusting for important potential confounders. Results. There were 4780 subjects available for study, of which 394 subjects reported daily COX-2 inhibitor use. In males, daily use of COX-2 inhibitors was associated with a lower BMD at all hip sites (percent difference between users and non-users at total hip: -3.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), -6.0, -0.3]. In post-menopausal women not using estrogen replacement therapy, daily COX-2 inhibitor use was associated with higher BMD at most sites (percent difference at total hip: +3.0% [95% Cl, 0.3, 5.8]). Conclusions. COX-2 inhibitor use was associated with a lower BMD in men and, on the other hand, a higher BMD in post-menopausal women not using estrogen replacement therapy. Men who have used COX-2 inhibitors may wish to seek a BMD measurement to assess their fracture risk. However, COX-2 inhibitors may have utility in post-menopausal women if bone-selective analogues can be developed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096728s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h226r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Epidemiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap5547r66z"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studying the role of dimerization in regulating the activity of Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Sigma</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Polychronidou, Maria</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>RPTP-sigma is a member of the LAR-RPTP subfamily that has been associated with neurite outgrowth and neuronal regeneration.

RPTP-sigma forms homodimers in cells under physiological conditions and antibody induced dimerization of HA-tagged RPTP-sigma leads to changes in the localization of the protein from the plasma membrane to vesicles in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, when N1E-115 cells were used as an in vitro model for studying the effect of RPTP-sigma-dimerization on neurite outgrowth, it was observed that induction of dimerization of the phosphatase allows neurite outgrowth in conditions that are normally non permissive for differentiation of the cells, indicating that dimer formation probably inhibits RPTP-sigma activity. In order to provide useful tools for studying the signaling cascades regulated by the phosphatase, a series of tagged constructs of potential RPTP-sigma interacting proteins were made.

Micron-sized polystyrene beads are embedded in the network, and their thermal motion is recorded by video microscopy. Our results show that the motion of small beads varies from highly confined to free, likely indicating the heterogeneous structure of the network. In contrast, the motion of larger beads is entirely confined, setting an upper limit on these heterogeneities. The viscoelastic moduli of the model microtubule networks are then obtained from the autocorrelation position function of the beads by using a generalized Langevin equation. We find that the microtubule network examined behaves like a soft viscoelastic solid at low frequencies, and a viscoelastic liquid at higher frequencies. Limitations of the method are discussed, in particular a possible underestimation of the magnitude of the viscoelasticity, and improvements to the technique are suggested.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w9505083n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vt647</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87pq61p"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>In-cycle control of the extrusion blow molding process</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lalli, Gino</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Parison length control in extrusion blow molding of plastic parts has been studied and attempted for the past quarter-century. Most methods used involve cycle-to-cycle control where the next part shows an improvement over the previous one using either weight measurement of the part or a simple photocell initiating the cutting of the parison. In the present thesis, plant models are developed using a control engineering technique called system identification. Since the process model thus determined is based on experimental data, sag and swell of the parison are implicitly taken into account. Furthermore, an in-cycle robust controller is designed and simulated where the die gap opening and the extrusion speed are adjusted as the parison is being extruded. The outlined control strategy focuses on controlling the parison length against process disturbances and machine drifts. The control system thus obtained is then reduced to two single-input single-output controllers for potential implementation on the extruder machine employed throughout the research.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn106z362.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pq61p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct167"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Two mutations, one goal : understanding the hyperexcitability associated with epilepsy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gauthier, Claudine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In my research, I looked at two sodium channel mutations associated with epilepsy, C121Wbeta1 and G257Rbeta1A. C121Wbeta1 is a non-functional mutant that causes epilepsy. G257R is a new mutation in the beta1 splice-variant beta1A and is associated with juvenile tonic-clonic seizures. Sodium channel beta1 subunits are believed to modify the functional properties of the sodium channel alpha subunit. Though beta1 has been studied in several heterologous backgrounds so far, results show that its functional properties are highly dependent on cellular background. I transfected beta1 and C121Wbeta1 in primary cultures of rat embryonic cortical neurons to study them by whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, but overexpression of these two proteins turned out to be toxic to the neurons. beta1A and G257Rbeta1A were studied in CHO cells by whole cell patch clamp. Neither of them showed any functional modification properties and the G257R mutation does not cause a gain of function effect.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jp00q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17ct167</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920fx16g"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le modèle québécois d'intégration culturelle comme troisième voie entre l'intégration républicaine et le multiculturalisme bilingue : analyse et réformes possibles</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rousseau, Guillaume, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is sometimes said that the Quebec model of cultural integration constitutes a third way between the French model (republican integration) and the Canadian model (bilingual multiculturalism) for addressing issues relating to immigration. The present thesis analyses that hypothesis by reviewing the history of laws related to language and religion, especially as they concern the integration of immigrants, in France, English Canada and Quebec. In parallel to those legal histories, the thesis presents some statistical data, notably to better understand the motivations of legislators and to assess the degree of conformity between social change and the policies these legislators have sought to pursue. After having demonstrated certain weakness of the Quebec model of integration, this thesis proposes three reforms to improve it. The first one, which concerns language legislation, is of republican inspiration. The other two focus on laws concerning religion and are inspired by the Canadian model of integration.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430493h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fx16g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bilingualism -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Québec (Province) -- Emigration and immigration -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Québec (Province) -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multiculturalism -- Law and legislation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8623hz052"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Balancing freedom of the press and the right to privacy : lessons for China</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sun, Zhendong, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The conflict inherent in balancing freedom of the press and the right to privacy invariably presents some controversial legal issues. In addressing the legal dilemmas posed by these competing interests, an in-depth analysis of the conceptual value of these two equally important rights becomes a preliminary starting point. Through its exploration of the history and development of the press and privacy laws in both the United States and Canada, this thesis examines the fundamental values enshrined in these two rights. The author holds that the freedom of the press contains no privilege under the law, but that it serves as the means to promote the public's right to know in a democratic society, while the right to privacy offers an individual the autonomy to regulate his private affairs. By analyzing arguments of "pubic interest," "public figure," and "public privacy," the author compares the theoretical approaches to and practical attempts at striking a balance between the interests of the press and the privacy of the individual in the United States and Canada. Finally, the essay proposes how these experiences may contribute to the construction of relevant Chinese laws.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547r677.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623hz052</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Privacy, Right of -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freedom of the press -- China</dc:subject><dc:subject>Privacy, Right of -- China</dc:subject><dc:subject>Privacy, Right of -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freedom of the press -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freedom of the press -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801pg534"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The UAV and the current and future regulatory construct for integration into the national airspace system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Peterson, Mark Edward</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ("UAV") have been a part of aviation from the infancy of manned aviation; yet, have not reached their fullest potential as they are not integrated into the national airspace system ("NAS"). However, we are at the edge of technological breakthroughs to make integration a reality. Nevertheless, the regulatory construct necessary to provide safe integration of UAVs is unfinished. This thesis looks at necessary regulatory changes within the United States to allow for integration of the UAV into the NAS. I will first define the UAV and look at its historical roots. Then, I will review existing regulations and directives of manned flight that would apply to UAVs, as well as various rules specifically for UAVs that now exist. Through this examination, I will review the gaps and offer recommendations to fill regulatory holes in hopes to provide a useful contribution to the eventual integrated flight of UAVs.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451h82g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pg534</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Airspace (International law)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drone aircraft</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z9030141"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Forms of trade secret protection : a comparative analysis of the United States, Canada, the European Union and Romania</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Petroiu, Marius</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is as an attempt to overview the forms of trade secret protection presently in place in the United States, Canada, the European Union and Romania.

Frequency-domain system identification methods are applied to model the dynamic behaviour of the suspension system from experimental test data using a data analysis software tool called CIFER. Advanced features such as the Chirp-Z Transform and composite window techniques are used to extract high quality frequency responses. A linear multivariable state-space model is derived which matches the experimental frequency response data set in the frequency range 65Hz-240Hz. Accurate uncertainty modeling on the nominal suspension is needed to design controllers achieving acceptable levels of robustness and performance. It is shown that modeling errors are best characterized using a combination of both additive and multiplicative uncertainty, as well as perturbations of the state-space model parameters. Robust feedback control design techniques using H-infinity and mu-synthesis are presented. It is shown both through simulation and experiment that vibration attenuation over the frequency range 65Hz-120Hz is achieved without affecting the system dynamic behaviour outside this range.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sj91d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dg05b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Automotive</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz8060038"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Design of DC-stable log-domain filters and their application in multistandard receivers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shaheen, Mohamed</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A study of the concepts involved in the bias-stability of log-domain filters is presented. Through a thorough analysis of the factors contributing to the existence of multiple and unstable operating points in log-domain filters, a biquad architecture that overcomes these drawbacks is proposed. This is accompanied with a theoretical verification of both stability and the input-output linear behavior. The study provides a foundation for the design and implementation of other bias-stable log-domain circuits. This thesis also presents the design of a multistandard channel-select filter for GSM, IS-95, and WCDMA. The filter's tunability extends from 100 kHz to 20.05 MHz. The implemented 6th-order quasi-Butterworth log-domain filter was fabricated in a Silicon Germanium (SiGeHP5) technology, operates from a supply voltage as low as 1.2 V, and consumes a maximum power of 12.9 mW at 20.05 MHz cutoff frequency. Dynamic biasing techniques are employed in order to extend the SFDR of the filter, e.g. from SFDR = 39 dBm to SFDR = 48 dBm at 20.05 MHz cutoff frequency.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sd085.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz8060038</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atd96k2852"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Influence of cutting-edge preparation on the performance of PVD-coated inserts in dry machining</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wang, Tao, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In interrupted dry cutting, both sharp tools and blunt tools have short lives. The tool life decides the cost, tool changing frequency, and machining precision. Finding the proper edge radius, which leads to longer tool life, is an effective way to improve machining efficiency and quality. In this thesis, the tool-wear behavior of PVD coated High-Speed-Steel cutting tools with different cutting-edge radii have been experimentally investigated. By conducting fly hobbing tests, the optimum cutting-edge radius and edge-preparation process for coated HSS cutters have been concluded. Furthermore, the influence of cutting-edge radius on the performance of PVD-coated carbide inserts has also been investigated experimentally and numerically. The simulation results from DEFORM 3-D agree well with the experiment results from orthogonal cutting. Finally, some simulation results such as strain, strain rate and stress have been analyzed. The experimental and numerical investigations have provided guidelines and evidence for future study of the tool-wear behavior of PVD-coated carbide cutters in gear hobbing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k06987806.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k2852</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
