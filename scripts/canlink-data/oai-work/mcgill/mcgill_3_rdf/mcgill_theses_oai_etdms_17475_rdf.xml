The data on chromosome abnormalities in bovine embryos however, are limited. The principal aim of this study was to investigate chromosome abnormalities and their effect on the development of bovine embryos produced in vitro. 193 embryos were evaluated for chromosomal abnormalities, using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with developed DNA probes for X and Y chromosomes. Our results demonstrate that uniformly abnormal embryos were found mostly at the early cleavage stages, and embryos with extensive chromosome abnormalities were usually arrested by the morula stage. Chromosomal mosaicism was observed at the 2- cell stage and increased steadily with subsequent stages of development. By the blastocyst stage, chromosomal mosaicism was the main abnormality observed and affected 95% of the blastocysts. Most of the mosaic blastocysts comprised of diploid and tetraploid cells. In the second part, a detailed analysis of 121 day 7 and days 9-10 blastocysts, demonstrated that the proportion of polyploid cells in most of the morphologically good quality embryos was less than 15%, which was significantly lower than in poor quality embryos.

Sixteen trichloro-, seven trifluoro- and five dichloro-acetamidines were prepared by procedures characterized by their simplicity, the absence of catalysts and the high yields of the reaction products. Experimental evidence was produced to support the reaction mechanism and certain limitations to the above mentioned reactions were defined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taurins, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nz319.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd376133s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322j36f"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The preparation and properties of derivatives of germane</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Griffiths, James. E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The chemistry of carbon and to a lesser extent that of silicon has been extensively studied and recent rapid progress in organosilicon chemistry has prompted renewed interest in the properties of tetracovalent germanium compounds. Much of the work has centred on compounds of the type, R4-nGeXn where n = 0 to 4, R is alkyl or aryl and X is a uni- or divalent atom. Since comprehensive reviews on the chemistry of inorganic and organic germanium compounds are available (56, 57), only a brief outline of the more relevant literature will be given here to facilitate discussion of the reactions and new compounds reported in this thesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Onyszchuk, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zf76f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322j36f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1n79h8112"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Antibody-antigen reactions in allergy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gordon, Julius</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Antibody-antigen interactions characterize both the immune and allergic conditions. The antibodies responsible for the allergic condition have been credited with several unique characteristics both to explain the difference in the clinical manifestation of immunity and allergy, and to explain the failure of detecting these antibodies in vitro. The purpose of the present investigation was to develop a simple, quantitative technique for demonstrating the antibodies in allergic sera.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sehon, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd3761342.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h8112</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m545b"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The early novels of D.

The novels have received the greatest share of this attention, and have been the subjects of many interesting and valuable studies. However, The White Peacock and The Trespasser, Lawrence's first two novels, have been misunderstood and neglected by a great number of his critics. They have received less attention than any of the novels except The Boy in the Bush, which Lawrence wrote in collaboration with M.L.

E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In formal terms, the literature to be surveyed in this section involves a class of behaviour defined partly by inclusion and partly by exclusion. That is, we shall be concerned with behaviour reinforced by changes in sensory stimulation with the exception of those cases where this change is, or has been, associated with the commonly accepted drives requisite to the survival of the species, such as hunger, thirst or sex. This includes a wide range of experiments dealing with exploratory behaviour, the response to novelty, investigatory reflexes and the like. The class of behaviour under discussion has been most commonly catalogued under the heading of “curiosity”.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milner, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bq22q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42nc55j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw3763b54j"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Estrogen methodology and excretion in human subjects</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Givner, Morris.
