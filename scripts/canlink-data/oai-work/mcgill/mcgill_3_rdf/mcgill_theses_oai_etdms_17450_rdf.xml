It binds substrate in an extended conformation and reacts only with soluble substrates. Subtilisin has a large nonpolar pocket (the S1 pocket) to bind acyl group and a shallow crevice (the S 1' pocket) to bind one substituent of a secondary alcohol group, while the other substituent remains in solvent. The reactivity and enantioselectivity of subtilisin toward nonpolar secondary alcohol esters is low. Based on its structure, we hypothesized that subtilisin would be highly reactive if the acyl group anchored the substrate to the active site and highly enantioselective if there was a large hydrophobicity difference between alcohol substituents. To test our first hypothesis, we show that an anchoring acyl group increases protease reactivity and extends subtilisin E to a new class of substrates, N-acyl sulfinamides. Subtilisin E did not catalyze hydrolysis of N-acetyl arylsulfinamides, but did catalyze a highly enantioselective hydrolysis of N-dihydrocinnamoyl arylsulfinamides. The N-dihydrocinnamoyl group mimics phenylalanine and thus binds the sulfinamide to the active site. We then use the 3-(3-pyridyl)propionyl group as anchoring group to increase substrate solubility. We use this group to resolve multi-gram quantities of three important compounds and isolate the enantiomers without the use of chromatography. Next, we use different anchoring acyl groups to extend several proteases to tertiary alcohol esters. We show that a syn-pentane-like interaction destabilizes the transition state for reaction of tertiary alcohols, but that the addition of an anchor group that binds substrate to the protease stabilizes transition state and enables proteases to catalyze hydrolysis of tertiary alcohol esters. To test our second hypothesis, we show subtilisin enantioselectivity stems from a favourable hydrophobic interaction between nonpolar substituent and S1' pocket residues and favourable solvation of polar substituent in water. The enantioselectivity of a series of secondary alcohols in water varied linearly with the difference in hydrophobicity (logP/P0) of the substituents. The larger the logP/P0 difference the higher the enantioselectivity. Consistent with our hypothesis, the enantioselectivity of subtilisin toward N-acyl arylsulfinamides is high because of the large difference in substituent hydrophobicity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483n851.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139576b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bj552"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Understanding the multiple roles of the CA-SP1 boundary region in HIV-1 Gag multimerization, gag-membrane binding and viral RNA packaging</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guo, Xiaofeng, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Gag protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contains a 14 amino acid region termed SP1 that is located between the capsid (CA) and downstream nucleocapsid (NC) sequences, and plays an active role in Gag assembly. This activity of SP1 involves its amino-terminal residues that, together with adjacent CA residues, constitute a putative (x-helical structure spanning Gag residues from positions 359 to 371. However, the underlying mechanisms are mostly unclear. The major goal of this PhD study was to understand the role of SP1 in HIV-1 Gag multimerization, membrane binding and viral RNA packaging. In addition to the reported function of the SP1 region in virus assembly, we further mapped the assembly determinants within SP1 to H359, K360, L364, A367, and M368. Detailed analysis of the L364A and M368A mutations revealed that they not only affected Gag multimerization, but also Gag-membrane association. We propose that the latter defect is a result of the former. Interestedly, the membrane binding defect associated with M368A can be corrected either by changing NC to the leucine zipper (LZ) motif derived from the yeast transcription factor GCN4 or by a L364A second-site mutation, although neither of them restored wild-type levels of particle production to the M368A Gag. These results suggest that SP1 may affect events of virus assembly subsequent to Gag-membrane binding such as capsid morphogenesis or virus budding. We also studied the R362A mutation that is located within a short 359-HKAR-362 basic fragment. Results of RNase protection assay, native Northern blots as well as filter-binding assays showing reduced packaging of viral RNA into the R362A mutated viruses. These data reveal the function of the C-terminal disordered sequence of CA in HIV-1 RNA packaging. Further analysis of the BIV CA/NC spacer region demonstrated the key role of this region in BIV Gag assembly. In summary, our results demonstrate that the SP1 sequence regulates Gag multimerization, Gag-membrane binding as well as viral RNA packaging.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mg673.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bj552</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Virology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afx719q76d"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase : an optimized mitochondrial one-carbon folate pathway</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Christensen, Karen E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Folate is required for the synthesis of nucleotides, the regeneration of methionine, and methylation reactions. The one-carbon tetrahydrofolate (THF) pathways in higher organisms are separated into the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments. Studies in both yeast and tumour cells suggest that mitochondria produce formate for use in de novo purine synthesis in the cytoplasm. Yeast have a mitochondrial NADP-dependent methyleneTHF dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase-synthetase (DCS), however, the only known homolog in mammals was the bifunctional NAD-dependent methyleneTHF dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase (NMDMC). The cloning of the gene and cDNA of the murine DCS allowed the comparison of the 3'-untranslated region of NMDMC with the synthetase coding region of DCS. Similarities in these regions, also observed in humans and Drosophila , demonstrated that NMDMC evolved from a trifunctional DCS precursor through the loss of the synthetase. Without the synthetase activity it was unclear how the mammalian mitochondrial pathway could produce formate from formylTHF. The characterization of DCS null cell lines demonstrated that the only methyleneTHF dehydrogenase in mammalian mitochondria is NMDMC. However, synthetase activity amounting to ~6% of wild-type levels was detected in the mitochondria. Northern blot analysis suggests that this activity is attributable to the recently identified mitochondrial DCS. Examination of the sequence of this protein revealed multiple mutations of the DC domain that would inactivate the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase, demonstrating that this protein is actually a monofunctional synthetase. The specificity of NMDMC for NAD is significant because it optimizes the mitochondrial folate pathway to produce formate. A homology model of NMDMC was constructed based on the crystal structures of three related proteins and was used to study the requirement for inorganic phosphate (Pi) and magnesium ions for dehydrogenase activity. The Pi and Mg+2 binding sites were found near the adenine ribose of NAD through site-directed mutagenesis. These ions interact with each other and the cofactor to adapt an NADP-binding ancestor to bind NAD by compensating for the absence of the covalently bound phosphate group. Both NMDMC and the mitochondrial synthetase appear to have evolved from NADP-dependent DCS ancestors. This pathway has been optimized through evolution to support the demand for purines during periods of rapid growth.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301510t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719q76d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237hw399"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Cap-binding inhibitor of translation, d4EHP</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cho, Park, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In eukaryotes, the initiation phase of protein synthesis or translation is a multi-step process that culminates in the positioning of the SOS ribosome at the initiation codon of a messenger RNA (mRNA). Recognition of the cap structure by eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (etF4F; composed of three subunits: the cap-binding protein e1F4E, the RNA-helicase eIF4A and the scaffolding protein eIF4G) facilitates this process. The ability of eIF4F to bind to the cap, as a result of the Cap:eIF4E interaction is of particular importance, as it is the major target of translational regulatory mechanism. Early embryogenesis requires the activity of various maternal determinants called morphogens, whose spatial and temporal expressions are tightly regulated at the level of translation. Positional information encoded within these factors is thus important for the establishment of body polarity. For instance, in Drosophila, when maternal Caudal (Cad) and Hunchback (Hb) proteins are allowed to accumulate inappropriately in an embryo, anterior and abdominal segmentations are blocked. Hence, the precision of Cad and Hb expression domains is critical for normal development. An eIF4E-related protein called eIF4E-Homologous protein (4EHP) was first described in 1998. However, the function, if any, of 4EHP in translation has been elusive, since it does not interact with any known initiation factors. In order to elucidate its biological function, the power of Drosophila genetics was used. In this thesis, I show that the Drosophila homolog of 4EHP (d4EHP) interacts with Bicoid (Bcd) and Brain tumor (Brat) proteins to inhibit the translation of maternal cad and hb mRNAs. Simultaneous interaction of d4EHP with the cap and Bcd or Brat results in mRNA circularization, which renders cad and hb mRNAs translationally inactive. This example of cap-dependent translational control that is not mediated by eIF4E defines a new paradigm for translational inhibition involving tethering of the mRNA 5' and 3' ends.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988p633.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hw399</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wh23n"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>GABAergic signalling in temporal lobe epilepsy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Benini, Ruba Sayed</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Earlier studies on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), by focusing on the anatomical and electrophysiological abnormalities of the hippocampus, have attributed a major role to this limbic structure in the process of epileptogenesis and seizure generation. Recently however, there has been increasing evidence from both animal and human studies that other limbic structures, including the subiculum, the entorhinal cortex (EC, perirhinal cortex (PC) as well as the amygdala, are possibly involved in the process of epileptogenesis. With the help of both acute and chronic models of limbic seizures, I have used an electrophysiological approach to gain more insight into the mechanisms through which these structures could participate in the establishment of hyperexcitable neuronal networks. Particularly, my investigations have focused on assessing the role played by the subiculum, the amygdala and the PC in epileptiform synchronization in vitro. My findings demonstrate that seizure-induced cell damage in chronically epileptic mice results in a change in limbic network interactions whereby EC ictogenesis is sustained via a reverberant EC-subiculum pathway ( Chapter 1). Furthermore, I have discovered that the subiculum, which holds an anatomically strategic position within the hippocampus, is capable of gating hippocampul output activity via a GABAA-receptor mediated mechanism (Chapter 2). My investigations in the amygdala have confirmed that this limbic structure contributes to epileptiform synchronization (Chapter 3). Moreover, using a chronic rat model of TLE, I have found novel evidence suggesting that alterations in inhibitory mechanisms play a role in the increased excitability of the lateral amygdalar nucleus (Chapter 4). Finally, my studies in chronically epileptic rats have also led to preliminary data signifying hyperexcitability of the PC as well alterations in the interactions between the amygdala and this cortical structure (Chapter 5).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xn30n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wh23n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj236595s"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The innate response to injury in the central nervous system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Babcock, Alicia A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Innate responses in the central nervous system (CNS) provide first-line defense against infection and injury. Microglia and astrocytes may direct leukocyte infiltration to the injured CNS. The signaling mechanisms that orchestrate this response are ill-defined. Innate roles for microglia and astrocytes are supported by reports demonstrating glial expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs recognize conserved pathogen-associated motifs and generate innate immune responses, usually by signaling through the adaptor protein, MyD88. TLRs may also generate innate responses to tissue damage. The data in this thesis implicate TLR2/MyD88 as key mediators of innate response to brain injury in mice. Transection of axons in the entorhinal cortex causes tissue damage analogous to a stab injury at the lesion site, and axonal degeneration distal from the wound, in the denervated, lesion-reactive hippocampus. A significant increase in leukocyte proportions was detected by 3h in the stab-injured entorhinal cortex, but not until 12h in the denervated hippocampus. This identified a window of CNS-directed innate response in the denervated hippocampus, without influence of infiltrating cells. Expression of numerous cytokines and chemokines was induced during this time. Microglia and astrocytes were identified as major sources of the chemokine CCL2. Macrophage infiltration to the stab-injured entorhinal cortex and the denervated hippocampus was dependent on MyD88-dependent CCL2/CCR2 signaling, but not TLR2-signalled response. T cell entry to the denervated hippocampus was regulated by TLR2 signaling and required MyD88-mediated response, whereas T cell recruitment to the stabinjured entorhinal cortex was only partially dependent on MyD88 signaling and did not require TLR2-mediated response. TLR2 signaling also regulated expansion of the hippocampal microglial population 5 days after lesion. Microglia were supplemented by circulating bone marrow-derived precursors, but this occurred predominantly at later times post-injury. No parameter measured was dependent on TLR4. These data identify novel signaling pathways that link glial responses to brain injury with subsequent neuroinflammation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881q74r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236595s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505410z"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization and prevention of cell death in isolated islets of langerhans</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Aikin, Reid</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A major limitation to the success of islet cell transplantation as a therapy for type I diabetes is the cell loss induced by the islet isolation procedure. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate signal transduction events and related intracellular activities that are implicated in islet cell survival/death following islet isolation in order to develop therapeutic interventions to promote islet survival. The isolation of pancreatic islets imposes considerable stress on these cells, resulting in significant levels of cell death following isolation which was associated with activation of the stress-activated c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). However, within 24 hours in culture, JNK activation was greatly reduced concomitant with an increase in AKT activation. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signalling resulted in sustained JNK phosphorylation, while activators of AKT suppressed JNK phosphorylation, indicating that the rise in AKT activity during islet culture suppresses JNK. One of the stimulus of the PI3K/AKT pathway was found to be insulin secreted by the islets themselves, acting in an autocrine manner. The result of this autocrine activation of the prosurvival AKT pathway, and subsequent suppression of JNK, was a decrease in the appearance of apoptotic cells in islets after 72 hours in culture. Caspase inhibition alone was unable to prevent cell death in isolated islets. In addition, the amount of mitochondrial depolarization occurring in isolated islets was unaffected by caspase inhibition, leading to the notion that the commitment to islet cell death could be occurring at the level of, or upstream of, mitochondrial dysfunction. Indeed, inhibition of BAX translocation to the mitochondria, a critical event mediating mitochondrial permeabilization, prevented islet cell death. Inhibition of JNK also prevented mitochondrial permeabilization and cell death. The current results demonstrate that insulin can act as an autocrine survival signal in isolated human islets. These findings also reveal the interdependence of necrosis and apoptosis in isolated islets, suggesting therapeutic strategies which target early events in cell death signalling in order to prevent multiple forms of islet cell death.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rj05m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505410z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70n014d"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The geology of the Forsyth and associated magnetite deposits, Hull Township, province of Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Machamer, Jerome.

This thesis is a study of the tools and techniques of subject analysis available to the aeronautical librarian. These tools and techniques fall into the following categories: the various formats of catalogues, lists of subject headings, classification schemes, printed catalogue cards, indexes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wright, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h097t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784q17w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Library Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45qd419"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of the palaeomagnetism of rocks from Yamaska and Brome Mountains, Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Larochelle, Andre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Reverse magnetic polarization of rocks "in situ" is a phenomenon which has been observed and reported by several workers since its discovery by Brunhes (1906) in baked clays and adjacent basalts of Miocene age in Central France.

This thesis describes the use of the exchange reaction of tritium between cellulose and water to determine the accessibility of cellulose, and also to indicate changes in the molecular configurations occurring during the repeated wetting and drying of cellulose. The structure of cellulose has been extensively reviewed in many texts (1-4); however, aspects of the fine structure relevant to the present work will be discussed briefly.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mason, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bj56b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117s591</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar494vp62z"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Bachelor of Divinity</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The background of romanticism : secularism in Europe, 1789-1815</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hayes, Alan Lauffer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The following pages represent an attempt at what I might call, with some hesitation, 'applied theology'. In them I endeavour to describe the development during a specific period of European history, of a phenomenon which has been, especially in the last fifteen years or so, a topic of intense theological discussion. That phenomenon is secularism. Now, the concept 'secularism', as it is understood nowadays, played no part in the theological discussions of the years we shall consider. The closest term was 'atheism', which we, from our perspective, in consideration of the secular theism of the French Revolution, for example, can see to have a rather different meaning. What I attempt to do here, then, is to write, not quite an essay in historical theology, since there is no theology of secularism in the period at issue; nor quite an essay in Church history, since, in a secularized society, the Church appears merely as one social institution amongst others; but an historical essay on the development of certain social attitudes which to-day pose a genuine theological problem.[...]</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x496k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vp62z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Secularism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Romanticism -- Europe</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25xd35p"><ual:graduationDate>1959</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>the Learning of Punished Incorrect Responses</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Koppenaal, Richard John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the major issues in learning theory has centered around the question of whether reward is necessary to strengthen an association between a stimulus situation (S) and a response (R).
