Lowermost carbonates on Salient Mountain and The Colonel  were deposited in quiet environments behind the developing stromatolitic reef. The  upper two thirds of the platform formed in shallow water and consists of huge,  elongated Platella and Cryptozoon bioherms, within which most shelly fossils are  found. Carbonate production is terminated by Gog Group siliciclastic sedimentation.  Thin, shell-bearing stromatolitic carbonates discovered within the lowermost Gog  Group bring into question the current position of the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary  in the southern Rocky Mountains (western Canada). Petrographic and geochemical data indicate that the Salient  Platform has undergone significant diagenetic alteration. delta13C values of  microsparitic limestones appear to retain a primary isotopic signature, which  correlates well with coeval late Neoproterozoic successions  worldwide.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/736665106.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d029p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agm80hv88f"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Relative quantification of host gene expression and protein accumulation upon turnip mosaic potyvirus infection in tobacco</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sassi, Giovanna</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infects a variety of crops,  worldwide, including the economically relevant Brassicacea family.

In this study, quantification of various transcripts  and protein products from infected tobacco was performed via real-time RT-PCR and  ELISA. In comparison to the gamma-tubulin endogenous control, gene expression for  the tobacco H3, HSP70 and granule-bound starch synthase was affected by TuMV  infection with time.

By genotyping M. tuberculosis isolates (M.TB), cases with matching DNA  "fingerprints" are inferred to be due to ongoing transmission, and those  with non-matching or "unique" fingerprints are inferred to represent  re-activation disease. Two population-based molecular epidemiologic studies using  three genotyping methods (IS6110 RFLP, spoligotyping and MIRU) are presented here.  The first study examines all TB cases among the Inuit community if Nunavik, Quebec  (1990-2000). Our analysis identified previously unrecognized inter-village  transmission and estimated that at least 65% of TB cases were due to ongoing  transmission. The second study is a case-control study that examines a  pyrazinamide-resistant (PZA-R) M.TB strain present in the Canadian-born population  (1990-2000). We observed that 77 PSA-R TB cases shared a common mutation conferring  the PZA resistance. In this low-incidence setting, the cases were most likely due to  reactivation from a common but old PZA-R M.TB strain in the absence of significant  ongoing transmission. In contrast to the Inuit case-study where 76% of cases had  matching genotypes across all three modalities, only 19% of PZA-R cases and 13% of  Canadian-born controls were clustered by the same analysis. The utility of cluster  analysis in the understanding of the transmission patterns of TB in these two  different populations are compared and discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p524g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bf53w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97kr05s"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sedimentology, stratigraphy and depositional history of the Falher F conglomerate trend, Alberta, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nodwell, Byron J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Detailed sequence stratigraphic analyses indicate that the lower  Cretaceous Falher F unit is made up of 4 sandy/pebbly prograding parasequences  labeled F1, F2, F3, and F4. Of the parasequences only F3 has a significant (&gt;2m)  thickness of conglomerate. Vertical lithological successions through a conglomeratic  section suggest that the F3 pebbles were deposited on the upper shoreface and  foreshore as part of a conformable, shoaling-upwards package of rocks. Detailed  mapping, using core, well logs, production data and 3-D seismic, show that the  conglomerates form a 4 km wide linear body deposited along a linear topographic  trend. This topographic trend coincides with the northern edge of the underlying  upper Devonian Gold Creek (Smokey) reef trend. Furthermore, the longshore  termination of the conglomerate is located at a NW-SE trending structural feature  that was active during Falher F deposition. Two models could explain the development of a thick conglomerate  buildup along a linear topographic step. The first suggests that southward  (transgressive) movement of a pebbly barrier was halted at the topographic feature.  The second suggests that when the F3 parasequence shoreline arrived at the  topographic step progradation rates slowed significantly.

It  is a disabling condition that mostly affects the elderly with huge costs to society.  Estimating the prevalence of OA is important for planning health services, for  creating programs aimed to prevent OA disability and for assisting patients living  with these disabilities. Several authors have attempted to estimate the prevalence  of OA using data obtained from self-report questionnaires or administrative  databases. Self-report questionnaires are prone to recall bias and estimates from  administrative databases have relied solely on diagnostic codes, that can sometimes  be inaccurate. If data from three presumed conditionally independent tests are used  to estimate the prevalence, then the problem is identifiable, meaning that all  parameters can be estimated without imposing constraints on the parameter space.  When data from the three conditionally independent diagnostic tests were considered,  the estimated prevalence of OA was 14.8% (95% CI: 14.5-15.1). A moderate degree of  variation in this prevalence estimate was found across different models carrying  different assumptions. The Bayesian latent class methodology used is advantageous in  accounting for the different estimates that may arise from different sets of  modelling assumptions. As the validity of the results rely on various assumptions,  all of which are difficult to verify, final conclusions depend on which assumptions  are thought most likely to be true, and the degree of robustness of estimates across  different models.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193965k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415p992m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gerontology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vb959"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Establishment and persistence of kura clover no-till drilled into pastures with herbicide sod suppression and nitrogen fertilization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Laberge, Guillaume</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Kura clover was successfully established via sod-seeding in  different environments.

Paraquat (0.9 kg a.i. ha -1) did not suppress sufficiently the grass population for  clovers to establish while glyphosate applied at high rates (3.3 kg a.i. ha -1) led  to excessive grass suppression, excessive legume content and temporary weed  encroachment.

This increased Hg burden is known to have  adverse neurological and reproductive effects on Common loons. A positive  correlation between mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) has been reported to exist in  marine mammals and various species of marine and aquatic piscivorous birds. It has  been hypothesized that the Hg/Se interactions may involve in the multiple mechanisms  of Hg detoxification. This study focused on the suggested Hg/Se complex that forms  in association with specific proteins. Specifically, this project focuses on the  nature of these interactions in different tissues from wild Common loons (Gavia  immer) that have been collected by the Canadian Wildlife Service. The Hg and Se  concentrations in the various tissues were quantified using AAS. MALDI-TOF-MS and  protein sequencing characterized the nature of the Hg/Se complex binding protein.  Among the tissues, the liver had the highest concentrations of Hg and Se followed by  kidney; muscle and brain. A strong association between Hg and Se was found in liver,  kidney and eggs whereas there was no association in muscle and brain. In contrast  brain and muscle had highest percentage of organic Hg suggesting that only inorganic  Hg is associated with Se. Two Hg-Se binding protein complexes were found in liver  both in the 15,200-15,300 Da range while one such complex in the same weight range  was found in kidneys, when sequenced it was found that these proteins were the alpha  A chain of Hemoglobin. The protein complex found in eggs was unique and although it  was impossible to fully sequence it, it represents an unknown protein. The role of  Se in Hg toxicity in eggs warrants further study.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr171x76f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp52q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mercury -- Bioaccumulation -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Common loon -- Effect of water pollution on -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Selenium -- Bioaccumulation -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Methylmercury -- Bioaccumulation -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p0967666"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mu transduction in vivo with cryptic Mu pac motifs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Franceschetti, Marie-Laure</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mu is a temperate, transposable coliphage with an unusual mode  of replication and maturation. Mu is encapsidated linked to host sequences flanking  the dispersed, integrated phage genomes. For encapsidation to occur, phage genomes  must be recognized and removed from the chromosome. A putative enzyme recognizes the  specific pac sequence within Mu left end. The objective of my research is to characterize the influence of  selected E. coli sequences on Mu transduction. In transduction the virion prohead is  filled up with an important percentage, if not in totality, of host DNA. Cryptic pac  sequences are defined as E.coli K12 genomic sequences showing the highest homology  with the endogenous Mu pac sequence. Those host sequences could influence Mu  packaging process towards transductants rather than "standard" infectious  phage particles. Using ClustralW software, two cryptic pac sequences were  identified. Transduction assays with cloned cryptic pac sequences give insight into  E.coli intrinsic potential to promote transduction.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096767g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p0967666</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj2362599"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The use of inhomogeneity corrections for inverse planned IMRT</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Boudreau, Chantal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, the use of inhomogeneity corrections in  intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) inverse treatment planning is investigated.  Firstly, the dosimetric consequences of CT beam hardening artifacts present on  images used for treatment planning are estimated and found to be of little clinical  significance (&lt;1% dose difference). Secondly, experiments to evaluate the  PEREGRINE Monte Carlo system (Nomos, Cranberry, PA) are undertaken for a 6 MV photon  beam. The use of inhomogeneity corrections in clinical treatment planning is  assessed for five clinical head and neck cancer cases. The cases are planned with  the CORVUS optimization module and the dose distributions are then calculated with  CORVUS and PEREGRINE in order to compare the two calculation techniques with  emphasis on how each method handles tissue inhomogeneities. The plans are assessed  in terms of dose, dose-volume distributions and the biological indices of TCP and  NTCP. On average, PEREGRINE calculates a 1% lower mean dose to the GTV and a 2%  lower mean dose to the CTV compared to the CORVUS calculations with EPL  inhomogeneity corrections. In the last part of this work, quality assurance (QA)  measurements are performed for a clinical case to investigate how the CORVUS and  PEREGRINE calculations agree with the dose measurements on a QA  phantom.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c8075.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj2362599</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj38607588"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Myocardial revascularization using Omentum graft "Old wine in a new bottle"</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Benhameid, Osama Saleh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background.

Chief among the factors that prompted  evolution is the recognition of fairness as a guiding principle in the elaboration  of jurisdictional rules. This thesis presents the consequences such recognition has  already had and should have on the granting of freezing measures, those specific  provisional measures aimed at freezing a defendant's assets pending  litigation. Having reviewed the freezing measures that can be obtained from  Canadian courts, this thesis shows how concerns of fairness to the parties have  questioned traditional grounds of jurisdiction and how it has affected the very  availability of freezing measures. However, out of concerns of fairness to the  plaintiff, Canadian courts with no jurisdiction to hear the merits of a dispute  should be ready to assert jurisdiction for the limited purpose of freezing  assets. Finally, turning to the scope of those measures, this thesis  deals with the issue of extraterritoriality. It is argued that out of concerns of  fairness to innocent third parties courts should be extremely cautious in granting  extraterritorial measures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Saumier, Genevieve</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88ch091.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qc75n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sanctions (International law)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Conflict of laws -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liquidity (Economics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Actions and defenses -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s080s"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Choosing accommodation over confrontation : Syrian policy towards Israel 1991-2000</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Edde, Dayana Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of the United  States to dominance marked the start of a new era in international relations. The  need to study accommodation as a security strategy in the developing world stemmed  from this major development. In this context, this thesis attempts to add to the  growing literature on accommodative strategies by analysing the dynamics of  accommodation in protracted conflicts in the developing world. The specific case  selected in the search for insights is the evolution of Syrian policy towards Israel  in the post-Cold War era. Three instances of attempted accommodation are studied:  the Madrid Peace Conference (1991), the Wye Talks (1995), and the Shepherdstown  Talks (1999). This thesis argues that the main explanatory factors for accommodation  in this case are to be found in the external politico-military sphere. On the  objective level, the role of powerful third parties and the changes in the  opponent's policies particularly stand out. On the subjective level, external  politico-military concerns, in the desire to avoid potentially permanent losses,  appear to be the prime generator of accommodative moves.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nobie, Paul</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j622s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s080s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Israel -- Foreign relations -- Syria</dc:subject><dc:subject>Syria -- Foreign relations -- Israel</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87pq87t"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>ICAO's aviation security programme post 911 : a legal analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jallow-Sey, Aisatou</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Unlawful interference with civil aviation has become a major  concern for the world aviation community. The misuse of aircraft as a weapon of mass  destruction has created new challenges. Air terrorism has moved from hijacking or  unlawful seizure of aircraft to an in-flight explosion caused by sabotage and  finally to September 11, 2001, to the use of a civil airplane as a weapon of  destruction. The events of September may be the biggest security challenge  ever faced by the aviation industry. The impact of this tragic event on the global  economy has been very harsh. The events have tended to obscure the fact that civil  aviation continues to be an inherent safe mode of transport. Great efforts are being made at the national and international  levels to create a security net which is global in nature and so tight that not one  further potential act of unlawful interference can slip through. However, the fact  remains that, in weaving the net and designing measures with the objectives of  preventing, combating and eradicating acts of terrorism involving civil aviation, it  is prudent to be imaginative in assessing the threat, which could come from new  directions and in new forms. This thesis explores the implications of the 11 September 2001  events. A global strategy is initiated by ICAO and endorsed by the States, with the  aim of protecting lives, restoring public confidence in air travel, and promoting  the financial health of air transport. I will therefore examine the measures  initiated by ICAO in response to the new challenges in aviation and which form the  basis of the aviation security action plan. The perspective is that the events of 11  September have changed the world, and changed irrecoverably. Nothing will be the  same for the aviation industry.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacKeigan, M.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Milde, M.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn487.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pq87t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Security measures</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>International Civil Aviation Organization</dc:subject><dc:subject>September 11 Terrorist Attacks, 2001</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g3317"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The case for international standards and agricultural free trade</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kiiza, Moses Gatama</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The sharp decline of tariff trade barriers has been one of the  achievements of the world trading system. However, the reduction in tariffs has  exposed the many non-tariff barriers that remain. As tariffs continue to fall, there  seems to be a corresponding reliance on SPS measures as a source of protection for  domestic producers. This underscores the need for a legal framework that can address  the fundamental issue of whether a measure validly exists to protect consumers or is  merely a 'sham' to protect domestic producers. This thesis argues that the  protectionist use of SPS measures undermines the promised benefits of agricultural  trade liberalization. Developing countries face numerous problems with regard to SPS  measures. This thesis examines these problems and argues that there is a need to  strengthen the capacity of developing countries to establish and implement SPS  measures; meet the SPS requirements of trade partners; and participate fully in the  work of standard setting organizations in the establishment of international  standards, guidelines and recommendations. In addition, despite the proposed  reductions in tariff barriers stipulated in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, a lot  remains to be done to fully liberalize trade in agriculture. Several issues still  need to be addressed in order to enable developing countries to reap the benefits of  trade liberalization in agriculture. These issues include market access, domestic  and export support, food security and special and differential  treatment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>de Mestral, Armand</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf2685713.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g3317</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Free trade</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agricultural industries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Non-tariff trade barriers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb3978881"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>International intellectual property disputes and arbitration : a comparative analysis of American, European and international approaches : the search for an acceptable arbitral site</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Juras, Camille</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This paper compares the arbitral procedures used in different  legal systems and evaluates their suitability for international intellectual  property disputes.

As companies in the financial services sector attempt the  efficient management of increasingly voluminous and strategically important  information and knowledge, governance mechanisms currently available in the Canadian  context have not kept pace. This thesis is at once a retrospective and prospective  examination of the regulation and control of intellectual capital. The first two  substantive sections of this thesis are primarily definitive and  contextualizing---first defining the nature of contemporary legal and managerial  concepts of intellectual capital and property, then examining the varied legal  frameworks from which an intellectual capital governance scheme is distilled. The  final chapter attempts a synthesis of these definitions and legal approaches to the  governance of intellectual capital. The keystones of this synthesis are twofold:  first, uniform Canadian legislation; and second, a more focused incorporation of  'property rights' in intellectual capital.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lametti, David</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn832.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333280s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Knowledge management -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Intellectual capital -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Right of property -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182k71p"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Improving the protection of minority shareholders in Chinese company law</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>He, Weiguo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with improving protection of minority  shareholders in China.

The total operating wind power capacity in the world has  increased greatly. As more and more attention is paid to the increase in both the  size and number of wind farms, a number of problems should be investigated in more  detail. The voltage stability problem primarily focuses on the reactive power  management that affects voltage stability and transmission losses. Wind power farm  installations that have the potential to displace a large percentage of fossil-fuel  generation must be designed to avoid unacceptable frequency and voltage disturbances  due to fluctuations in the wind power farm output. The focus of this research is on the modeling of wind farms and  the issues related to the interconnection of wind farms with the utility grid.  Voltage stability problems are investigated for both strong and weak  interconnections. Furthermore, the model and control of the Superconducting Magnetic  Energy Storage (SMES) system is introduced into the wind farms to improve the power  quality of wind farms. The study is conducted firstly, on a single wind energy  conversion system, followed by addition of the issues of voltage stability and VAr  compensation, and finally the investigation of the impact of wind farms on power  quality are discussed in detail.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rt94g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085k659</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Energy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2f75r8519"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Analysis of rime ice accumulation at Mont B√©lair and design of transmission lines</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yang, Zhang, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to review current approaches for  the specification of design loads for rime ice and to propose improvements based on  an analysis of field data provided by Hydro-Quebec. Hydro-Quebec established an  experimental site on Mont Belair in 1994 for the purpose of obtaining much more  detailed data on ice accretion in real time for both glaze ice and rime ice. In this  study, rime ice events were identified, analyzed and characterized in terms of their  recurrence, severity and relationship to winds. IEC-60826 (2000) recommended  procedures are used to calculate design rime ice and wind-on-ice loadsusing the ice  load map of CSA C22.3 No. 1-01. The Extreme Type I (Gumbel) distribution is chosen  for rime ice in the calculation of design loads based on a reliability-based method.  Design rime ice loads derived from the two procedures show that the rime design  loads based on short term data at Mont Belair are compatible with IEC-60826 (2000)  provisions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h493q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75r8519</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666505b"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Quality factor enhanced coupled inductor structures and their RF applications</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Hanzhen, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is concerned with one of the key passive components  in RFIC design, namely on-chip inductors. Complete design equations, EM simulation  and data processing procedures have been established and demonstrated for 0.18um and  0.13um CMOS technologies. Following these procedures, several inductors have been  designed and fabricated. A low noise amplifier (LNA) working at 6 GHz has been  implemented using the TSMC 0.18 standard CMOS technology, and the prototype chip was  successfully tested. As an attempt to build higher performance on-chip inductors, a  new quality factor enhanced coupled inductor structure is proposed and discussed.  Through intertwining and coupling two inductors, and making use of the positive  mutual inductance built up between them, a 56% increase in quality factor has been  achieved. Detailed design guidelines and methodologies are presented. Measurement  and simulation results of the fabricated prototypes demonstrated the accuracy and  effectiveness of the work proposed. VCO and LNA designs using the coupled structures are presented.  Simulation results also demonstrate the performance improvement resulting from using  coupled structures, compared to using optimized standard inductors.

A series of experiments with heat flux and temperature sensors  are performed on thermoforming machines at the Industrial Materials Institute,  National Research Council, for the purpose of determining the heat capacity for  several materials. The ambient air velocity, air temperature and the sheet internal  temperatures at different depths inside a plastic sheet were measured. Based on  these on-line measurements, a methodology for evaluating heat transfer coefficients  and heat capacities was developed. Moreover, two different approaches were used to  tune the experimental results through sensitivity analysis. Additionally, in order  to improve simulation precision and better control the heating process, an approach  for measuring internal sheet temperature is discussed.

Unanticipated difficulties can follow from the breakdown of such  relationships for both children and parents if the custodial parent leaves the  family's former habitual residence with the child. This is especially true for the  left-behind parent. The starting point for this study was the discussion among  experts as to whether an Additional Protocol to the 1980 Child Abduction Convention  might resolve the inherent weak protection of access rights. To answer this question  concerning the necessity of such an Additional Protocol, this thesis provides an  overview of the relevant existing and future international legal frameworks that  address child protection and parental responsibilities and shows the evolution in  child law from a formerly neglected issue to a high-profile topic.

Because this  question touches at once upon the effectiveness of these rights and on their status  as norms of positive law, attempting to answer it requires first, an openness to  other disciplines, and subsequently, to the question of the respect and control of  these norms, namely that of sanction. From the outset, a preliminary and  multidisciplinary analysis of the issue of contemporary poverty hints at an  undeniable deviation with "pure legal theory". Moreover, economic and  social rights are becoming more and more tangible in national legislation and more  frequently invoked before the court (who is turn are showing a growing openness).  'Hard law' does have a place in this implementation, notably a symbolic one. Thus,  the first part is dedicated to the determination of the role of 'hard law' as well  as to the relevance of judicial activism. Given the limitations of 'hard law', the  second part examines the issue of alternate courses of State action as opposed to  any other demands for rights. Two forms of 'soft' and 'reflexive' law will then be  examined in the interest of rendering economic and social rights effective:  respectively from within the State, and from outside its framework. First, strategic  planning (accompanied by outcome-based management) may serve to coordinate the State  apparatus in the struggle against poverty. In what concerns the role of law at a  societal level and in the context of a complex society, societal guidance will be  preferred to impose strategic planning. In this way, it will be possible to shed  light on other forms of sanction, which may be complimentary to legal ones. Finally,  it is necessary to establish certain control and follow-up mechanisms of this  category of rights, more relevant and innovative in order to garner a greater  effectiveness of economic and social rights.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p772z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k06988021</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political questions and judicial power</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poverty</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poor</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law and economics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law -- Political aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Civil rights</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bp79c"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le couplage de donn√©es et la protection de la vie priv√©e informationnelle sous l'article 8 de la Charte canadienne</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ar√®s, S√©bastien</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Data matching is the automated process permitting the comparison  of significant amounts of personal data from two or more different databanks in  order to produce new information. Its use by governments implicates many rights and  freedoms, including the protection against unreasonable search and seizure under  section 8 of the Canadian Charter. In the author's opinion, a governmental data matching program  will probably constitute a search or seizure under section 8 when a positive answer  is given to two questions. First, is there a use or transfer of information which  implicates constitutionally protected information? Generally, section 8 will only  protect biographical personal information, as described in the Plant case. Second,  one must determine if a reasonable expectation of privacy exists as to the purpose  for which the information will be used. In other words, one must determine if the  two governmental databanks are separate on the constitutional level. However, a positive answer to both of theses questions does not  mean that the matching program necessarily infringes section 8. It will not be  considered unreasonable if it is authorised by law, if the law itself is reasonable,  and if the execution of the program is reasonable. Presuming that the program is  authorised by law, it is probable that a matching program aimed to detect  individuals collecting illegally social benefits will not be considered  unreasonable.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn76n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bp79c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Statistical matching</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public records -- Access control -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Privacy, Right of -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public records -- Law and legislation -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada.
