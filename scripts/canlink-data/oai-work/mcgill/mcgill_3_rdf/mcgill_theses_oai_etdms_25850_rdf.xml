It is known that an excess of glucocorticoids can interfere with learning and memory processing and affect neural activity within brain regions that subserve these processes. Although the behavioural effects of lowered glucocorticoids are known and resemble those of excessive glucocorticoids, the impact of low glucocorticoid levels on brain activation patterns is not. We conducted a within-subject double-blind placebo controlled study in which participants performed a verbal memory task in the scanner under both placebo and Metyrapone (potent inhibitor of glucocorticoid synthesis) conditions. There were three functional runs in the study, encoding, immediate old/new recognition, and delayed recognition old/new recognition. Retention was also assessed at two instances of free recall, immediately after the scans and 24hrs later. As expected, glucocorticoid levels were significantly lower in the Metyrapone condition relative to placebo. There were no significant effects of the drug manipulation on either measure of memory performance. In terms of neural activity, the activations observed under the placebo condition alone were consistent with those found in the literature using similar tasks including left and right inferior frontal and hippocampus regions at encoding, and right inferior frontal regions at both immediate and delayed recognition. When we contrasted the drug and placebo sessions, we found task-specific activation patterns, which were of greater magnitude in the Metyrapone condition. These results suggest that a decrease in circulating glucocorticoid levels can have a significant impact on brain activation patterns irrespective of behavioural change. It is possible that increased cognitive effort was required under the influence of Metyrapone, which was reflected in the increased activity observed. Our findings also raised important issues with respect to the development of phfMRI protocols.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z112h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr171x54d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290965t"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Association of selective and conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with acute renal failure</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Schneider, Verena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The safety of the novel class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the COX-2 inhibitors, is currently debated, with the focus on their cardiovascular toxicity.

The risk of ARF for all NSAIDs combined was highest within 30 days of treatment initiation (adjusted rate ratio (RR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61 - 2.60) and receded thereafter. After at least 30 days without an NSAID-prescription, the risk had returned to baseline.

There is conflicting opinion if performing successive bouts of strenuous exercise reduces the severity of EIAH. The aim was to (a) test the hypothesis that the severity of EIAH would be reduced with three successive bouts of strenuous exercise, (b) to determine if repeated bouts of exercise increases hyperventilation thus improving arterial PO2. Seven fit female subjects with EIAH [arterial PO2 or PaO2= 88 +/- 2 mmHg, A-a DO 2 = 25 +/- 3 mmHg and 7 fit female control subjects (PaO2 = 100 +/- 5 mmHg, A-a DO2 = 16 +/- 5 mmHg) performed three bouts of intense exercise on a cycle ergometer at 236 +/- 27 watts [oxygen consumption at end of each set = 48 +/- 6 mL/kg/min, or 96 +/- 5% of maximum] for 5 min each with 10 min of rest between sets. Arterial PO 2 increased [EIAH Delta = +4 +/- 5 mmHg. 95% CI = 0.6 to 7.8; Control Delta = +2 +/- 2 mmHg. 95% CI = 0.4 to 3.6] and arterial PCO 2 or PaCO2 decreased [EIAH Delta = -5 +/- 4 mm Hg, 95% CI = -7.4 to -2.2; Control Delta = -4 +/- 2 mmHg, 95% CI = -5.8 to -2.4] between set 1 and set 3 (P&lt; 0.05). Also, 34% of the variance in the change in PaO2, was explained by the variance in the change of PaCO2 (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, repeat exercise improves PaO2, which is related to improved hyperventilation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb4948756.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722h917d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anoxemia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exercise</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9k41zd808"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>BALBc mice develop pulmonary fibrosis after six months of cigarette smoke exposure</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Scott, Adrienne S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Rationale. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in humans is associated with chronic cigarette smoking. At present only an acute model exists for lung fibrosis research. Objective. Describe a chronic animal model of lung fibrosis produced by cigarette smoke exposure. Methods. Six BALB/c mice have been exposed to two unfiltered cigarettes a day, 5 days a week for 6 months. Results. The phenotype was characterized by lung mechanics, histology and gene expression. Tissue elastance (compliance) and resistance was observed to be significantly elevated in the cigarette smoke-exposed mice compared to untreated controls. Histologically, airspace size in lungs of smoke exposed mice assessed by mean Linear Intercept and percent area of tissue was significantly decreased and increased respectively compared to controls. Inflammatory cell counting resulted in a significant increase in neutrophils in experimental mice. Assessment of Collagen type I clearly demonstrated a prominent interstitial deposition in smoke-exposed mice compared to controls. Conclusions. These data demonstrate that BALB/c mice are susceptible to the development of pulmonary fibrosis following chronic cigarette smoke exposure. This model could be an important contribution to the study of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in humans.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h470d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zd808</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p7452"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Economics of introducing forage and livestock into alternative crop rotation systems during the transition to organic agriculture</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Riofrío Ordóñez, Carlos Andrés</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the economic feasibility of alternative crop rotations and to determine the economic implications of including forages and livestock during the transition to organic agriculture in Nova Scotia. The rotation systems were distinguished by: (i) frequency of forage in the rotation, (ii) source of nutrient supply, and (iii) type of farming operation. The economic analysis was divided in two parts. The first part analysed data from a four-year crop rotation experiment, using enterprise budgeting and statistical methods to compare differences among rotations under different treatments. The second part involved the development of a multi-period linear programming (LP) model to simulate a commercial operation. The results from the statistical analysis suggest that crop enterprise net returns tended to be higher in forage-based rotations and in the livestock systems compared to cash crop rotations and the stockless system. Results from the LP model suggest that including forages and beef cattle during the transition to organic agriculture can provide considerable economic benefits, especially when crops were grown under ruminant compost.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wq55h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p7452</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Forage plants -- Nova Scotia -- Economic aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Organic farming -- Nova Scotia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Crop rotation -- Nova Scotia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Beef cattle -- Nova Scotia -- Economic aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah702q661v"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Over-expression of the potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2 in developing zebrafish</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Reynolds, Annie, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In embryonic neurons, the intracellular chloride concentration is elevated, making GABA and glycine depolarizing. Later in development, coincident with neuronal maturation, the extruding potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2 is expressed. It reverses the chloride gradient, rendering it hyperpolarizing. Early depolarization is assumed to play trophic roles during nervous system development. I thus decided to investigate the effects of the depolarizing chloride gradient on development in vivo in the zebrafish embryo. I first determined the temporal pattern of KCC2 expression in zebrafish and found it was absent in the embryo. I then over-expressed wild-type, gain-of-function and loss-of-function variants of human KCC2, using GFP-tagged constructs for detection purposes. Over-expression of functional hKCC2 perturbed the morphology and motor behaviours of the embryos. At the cellular level, KCC2 impaired axonal growth and affected the neuronal populations in the brain, hindbrain and spinal cord. This suggests the depolarizing effects of glycine are critical for neurogenesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sd106.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q661v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Symporters</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zebra danio -- Development</dc:subject><dc:subject>Potassium channels</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carrier proteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chloride channels</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p2909663"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Glial cell and leukocyte response to experimental demyelination</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Remington, Leah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To understand why remyelination fails in diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), I studied the cells and molecules involved in remyelination.

Alterations in expression and cellular localization of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1alpha and mGIuR5) is important in various neuronal systems, and these receptors are also known to modulate nociceptive neurotransmission in the spinal dorsal horn. The aim of the present study is to determine whether persistent inflammation produces alterations in ultrastructural localization of mGluR1alpha and mGluR5 in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Persistent inflammation was induced in rats by an intraplantar hindpaw injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Three days after the CFA injection, rats were perfused with fixatives, and spinal cords were removed and the lumbar segments L3-L5 were sectioned using a vibratome. Using pre-embedding immunocytochemical protocols for electron microscopy, we quantified immunogold-labeled mGluR1alpha and mGluR5, in lamina IV-V and I-II, respectively, in the spinal dorsal horn of both CFA-treated rats and untreated control rats. Compared to untreated rats, CFA-treated rats had a significant increase in membrane-associated mGluR5 immunogold-labeled particles in lamina I-II neurons. No change in the ratio of membrane vs. intracellular mGluR1alpha receptors was found in CFA-treated rats, however membrane-bound mGluR1alpha moved closer to the synapse in CFA-treated as compared with untreated rats. These findings suggest that persistent peripheral inflammation elicits increased availability of spinal dorsal horn group I mGluR's for synaptically-released glutamate binding. Thus, trafficking of Group I mGluR's may underlie the development of plastic changes in spinal dorsal horn neurons and associated persistent inflammation-induced chronic pain.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fk79r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tx78b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247ds427"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Optimization of pre-processing variables for hyperspectral analysis of focal plane array Fourier transform infrared images</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pinchuk, Tommy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A genetic algorithm was employed to select the optimal combination of preprocessing variables, including data pretreatment, data manipulation and feature extraction procedures, for eventual clustering of a data set consisting of hyperspectral images acquired by a focal plane array Fourier transform infrared (FPA-FTIR) spectrometer.

The genetic algorithm evaluated combinations of variables pertaining to bacterial film thickness tolerances, baseline correction, pixel co-addition, outlier removal, smoothing, mean centering, normalization, derivatization, integration and principal component selection. Following numerous iterations of unsupervised processing, the genetic algorithm arrived at a sub-optimal solution yielding a clustering accuracy of 97.8% and a data utilization of 28.6%. The results provided insight into the co-dependencies of the pre-processing variables and their consequential effect on the selected data. The robustness of the classification model was evaluated and reinforced by the successful classification of two distinct validation sets.

First, I demonstrate the effectiveness of C12E5/hexanol as an orienting media for the measurement of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) at low pH and for proteins with the positively charged surfaces, such as carbon storage regulator A at pH 4.5 and catalytic fragment of 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP-CF; theoretical pI 8.99). Second, the structure of the regeneration-induced CNPase homolog was determined based on 15N-1 H, 13C'-13C alpha, and 13Calpha- 1Halpha RDCs measured in Pf1 phage alignment media. Finally, 2D experiments based on the recently introduced SAD-REDOR technique for the measurement of RDCs in proteins were developed. The SAD-REDOR (single-alignment domain rotational-echo double resonance) technique consists of magic angle spinning (MAS) and rotor synchronized radiofrequency pulses applied to the molecule fixed in the polymer-stabilized liquid crystalline media. MAS averages dipolar couplings to zero, while the application of the RF pulses allows selective recovery of chemical shift anisotropy, homonuclear or heteronuclear RDCs. SAD-REDOR can be used to study strongly aligned biomolecules. It allows measurement of both scalar and dipolar couplings in a single sample and control over their magnitudes. Here, I present SAD-IPAP and SAD-HSQC experiments for the measurements of 15N-1 H RDCs in direct and indirect dimensions, respectively, as it is demonstrated for 15N-enriched PSLC ubiquitin.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698781g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zt551</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xh94c"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dynamic data structure analysis and visualization of Java programs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pheng, Sokhom</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>For many years, programmers have faced the problem of reading and trying to understand other programmers' code, either to maintain it or to learn from it. Analysis of dynamic data structure usage is useful for both program understanding and for improving the accuracy of other program analyses. Data structure usage has been the target of various static techniques. Static approaches, however, may suffer from reduced accuracy in complex situations and have the potential to be overly-conservative in their approximation. An accurate, clean picture of runtime heap activity is difficult to achieve. We have designed and implemented a dynamic heap analysis system that allows one to examine and analyze how Java programs build and modify data structures. Using a complete execution trace from a profiled run of the program, we build an internal representation that mirrors the evolving runtime data structures. The resulting series of representations can then be analyzed and visualized. This gives us an accurate representation of the data structures created and an insight into the program's behaviour. Furthermore we show how to use our approach to help understand how programs use data structures, the precise effect of garbage collection, and to establish limits on static data structure analysis. A deep understanding of dynamic data structures is particularly important for modern, object-oriented languages that make extensive use of heap-based data structures. These analysis results can be useful for an important group of applications such as parallelization, garbage collection optimization, program understanding or improvements to other optimization.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343s57v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xh94c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4q77fr65w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Data mining using relational database management system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ma, Xuesong, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>With the wide availability of huge amounts of data and the imminent demands to transform the raw data into useful information and knowledge, data mining has become an important research field both in the database area and the machine learning areas. Data mining is defined as the process to solve problems by analyzing data already present in the database and discovering knowledge in the data. Database systems provide efficient data storage, fast access structures and a wide variety of indexing methods to speed up data retrieval. Machine learning provides theory support for most of the popular data mining algorithms. Weka-DB combines properties of these two areas to improve the scalability of Weka, which is an open source machine learning software package. Weka implements most of the machine learning algorithms using main memory based data structure, so it cannot handle large datasets that cannot fit into main memory. Weka-DB is implemented to store the data into and access the data from DB2, so it achieves better scalability than Weka. However, the speed of Weka-DB is much slower than Weka because secondary storage access is more expensive than main memory access. In this thesis we extend Weka-DB with a buffer management component to improve the performance of Weka-DB. Furthermore, we increase the scalability of Weka-DB even further by putting further data structures into the database, which uses a buffer to access the data in database. Furthermore, we explore another method to improve the speed of the algorithms, which takes advantage of the data access properties of machine learning algorithms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579s484.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fr65w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b591884d"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Self-adjusting doses of oral antihyperglycemic therapy using repaglinide or glyburide in type 2 diabetes : the soaring study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacKinnon, Lindsay M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cette etude pilote de six mois examinait si l'autogestion (AG) intensive par un agent secreteur d'insuline avait pour consequence une glycemie amelioree en comparaison avec une gestion standard (GS) chez les individus atteints de diabete de type 2.

This thesis focuses on value-based reinforcement learning methods, which rely on computing utility values for different behavior strategies that can be adopted by the agent. Real-world complex problems involve very large discrete or continuous state spaces where the use of approximate methods is required. It has been observed that subtle differences in the approximate methods result in very different theoretical properties and empirical behavior. In this thesis, we propose a new framework for discussing many popular function approximation methods, called Probabilistic Linear Function Approximation. This allows us to highlight the key differences of several approximation algorithms used in RL.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666477c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv39h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257f33n"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Prevention of the neutrophil-induced mammary epithelial damage during bovine mastitis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lauzon, Karoline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Reduction of milk production following acute bovine mastitis causes important economic losses. In this study, two experiments were conducted to asses the ability of different antioxidants to prevent neutrophil (PMN)-induced mammary damage in acute bovine mastitis. First, a co-culture model composed of bovine mammary epithelial cell line (MAC-T cells) and bovine PMN activated by phorbol myristate acetate was used. Activated PMN release reactive oxygen species that are cytotoxic for bovine epithelial cells. Addition of dimethylthiourea or bathocuproinic acid did not induce any protective effect. On the other hand, addition of catechin, deferoxamine or glutathione ethyl ester (GEE) significantly reduced PMN-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner as demonstrated by lower levels of released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The second experiment was undertaken with the last three antioxidants to evaluate their protective effects in vivo. A model of LPS-induced mastitis on dairy cows was used. The extent of cell damages was evaluated by measuring quarter milk levels of LDH and 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl beta-D-glucosaminidase ( NAGase) at varying intervals before and after intramammary infusions of LPS, with or without antioxidants. Milk levels of haptoglobin and bovine serum albumin were also analysed. Catechin and GEE did not induce any protective effect whereas infusions of deferoxamine, a chelator of iron, decreased milk levels of LDH, NAGase and haptoglobin hence suggesting a protective effect against PMN-induced damage. Deferoxamine did not interfere with PMN migration into the mammary gland. Additionally, deferoxamine inhibited bacterial growth in vitro but did not affect PMN's ability to phagocytize live Escherichia coli. Overall, our results suggest that local infusion of deferoxamine may be an effective tool to protect mammary tissue against PMN-induced oxidative stress during bovine mastitis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nt81p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257f33n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Diseases -- Treatment</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antioxidants -- Physiological effect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mastitis -- Treatment</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bh52r"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Accurate surface dose measurements in CT examinations using high sensitivity MOSFET dosimeters calibrated by Monte Carlo simulations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lemire, Matthieu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this work is to use MOSFET dosimeters to accurately measure surface dose delivered during CT examinations in various scanning conditions. To achieve this, the behaviour of MOSFETs under kilovoltage x-ray irradiation first needed to be investigated. A dose-to-dose reproducibility of 4.5%, and a mean change in sensitivity response of 10.4% with accumulated dose were measured. A Monte Carlo model of the x-ray source of a PQ5000 CT simulator was built and validated in order to investigate the MOSFET response characteristics and perform dose calculations. An over-response of 10% was observed when the beam energy was decreased from 140 to 80 kVp, and a slight anisotropy of 8.5% from the mean value over 360º was observed. The dosimeters were calibrated on a solid water phantom using a method involving MC surface dose calculations. Good agreement was found between measurements and simulations of surface dose on a cylindrical PMMA phantom for a stationary tube technique, single axial scan and multiple contiguous axial scans, with generally less than 7.5% discrepancies. Film and MOSFET measurements were then performed for helical adult brain scan parameters using different pitch and collimator settings. The use of five MOSFETs combined in a linear array was found to be suitable to accurately measure surface dose in helical scans for almost all pitch and collimation combinations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k5179.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bh52r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ans0646328"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of TN5TAC1 conditional mutants of Sinorhizobium meliloti</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lauzon, Jean-François</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Four Sinorhizobium meliloti mutants with IPTG-dependent phenotypes were isolated via random Tn5tac1 mutagenesis.

The insertion in Rm30194 is upstream of tacA, which appears to be under conditional control of the Tn5tac1 Ptac. While all four strains formed root nodules on alfalfa, Rm300192 and Rm30193 attained only 53% and 36% respectively, of the wild-type shoot dry weight value. Five previously isolated Tn5tac1 mutants were also characterized. Significantly, Rm30044 (bhbA) was able to use arabinose but not glutamate as sole carbon source, a novel finding. Finally, Rm30047 (gpsA), which lacks NADPH-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) activity, was found to have an NADH-dependent G3PDH activity that was repressed by IPTG, possibly due to conditional expression by the Tn5tac1 P tac of genes downstream of gpsA.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720d070.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns0646328</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rhizobium meliloti -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wq56s"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Using local oxidation lithography to build mesoscopic structures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Landry, Olivier</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We use an atomic force microscope to perform nanolithography by local oxidation on two-dimensional electron gases.

Corn fiber oil contains phytosteryl fatty acyl esters, ferulate phytostanyl esters, and free phytosterols. To date, however, no studies have examined the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of ferulate phytostanyl esters. Moreover, although plant stanols and sterols have been established as cholesterol-lowering agents over the past five decades, their exact mechanisms of action are not clearly understood. One of the possible mechanism is that plant sterols/stanols disrupts the normal sub-cellular cholesterol absorption by down-regulation of the influx sterol transporters such as the Niemann pick C1 like 1(NPC1L1) protein and/or up-regulation of efflux sterol transporters such as the ATP binding cassette (ABC) G5 and ABCG8 protein. Hence, the objectives of this thesis were to assess the efficacy of corn fiber oil, ferulate phytostanyl esters and their parent compounds including sitostanol and ferulic acid, on plasma cholesterol levels. Further, objectives were to investigate their impact on parameters of cholesterol kinetics and gene expression of sterol transporters to obtain insight into their role in genetic control of regulation of cholesterol flux. Results of this experiment demonstrate that the hypocholesterolemic effect of corn fiber oil is mostly due to sitostanol, while esterification of ferulic acid and sitostanol yields no apparent synergistic cholesterol lowering effect. Present data exhibited a cholesterol absorption lowering effect of corn fiber oil and sitostanol and suggest that this effect may be due to up-regulation of intestinal enterocyte efflux sterol transporters such as ABCG5 and ABCG8.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c0801.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t207h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Golden hamster</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corn oil -- Physiological effect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sterols -- Physiological effect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phytosterols</dc:subject><dc:subject>Blood lipids</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cholesterol -- Metabolism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahq37vn89w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Analysis of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) 5 regulation and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling in muscle cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jean-Baptiste, Gaël</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>G protein-coupled Receptor (GPCR) signalling pathways are essential for all aspects of cell and organ physiology and the involved proteins work together to transmit signals across the plasma membrane. This process is highly regulated by a number of proteins including RGS (Regulators of G protein Signalling) proteins, which serve as GTPase-activating proteins for the Galpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. Previous work in our lab has identified RGS5 as being expressed in the heart as well as being up regulated in the atria but not the ventricules of transgenic (TG4) mice that have a 195-fold cardiac increase in beta2AR levels. To further characterize RGS5 expression, an RGS5 specific antiserum was generated. Western Blot analysis of a panel of rat tissues demonstrated that basal expression of RGS5 protein was confined to the heart and skeletal muscle tissues, as well as the respective cell lines HL-1 and C2C12. Although GPCRs and RGSs are actively being studied in the heart, little is known regarding the role of GPCRs and RGSs in skeletal muscle. Moreover, several conditions such as atrophy, which is characterized by apoptosis of the muscle fibers, are associated with GPCRs in the skeletal muscle. As a prelude to investigating the role of RGS5 in the regulation of GPCR signaling, we identified a number of GPCRs that are able to signal via ERK1/2 in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. The signalling and responses induced by one GPCR agonist, Lysophosphatidic Acid (LPA), a potent inducer of survival and apoptosis, were analyzed in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722h919z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vn89w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613mx873"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Impact of a carbon market on afforestation incentives : a real option approach</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jetté-Nantel, Simon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The study investigates farmers' decision to afforest marginal agricultural land to create carbon sinks in western Canada. A real option model, which incorporates price risks related to carbon and timber revenues as well as opportunity cost uncertainty, is used to assess the impact of a carbon market on farmers' afforestation decision. Irreversibility of the decision is also modeled by including sunk cost of forest establishment and the cost of reversing the afforestation process. In addition, the non-permanence impact on the profitability of afforestation was analyzed by assessing the effect of two non-permanence carbon accounting schemes. Results indicate that both, actual non-permanence policies and the presence of real options, have a significant negative impact on afforestation incentives. However, the carbon market has a positive effect as it increases the expected revenues to afforestation and also represents a diversification opportunity. Yet, even in the presence of a carbon market the investment barrier remains considerable. Despite the positive effect of the carbon market, results show that unless carbon prices reach levels well above $100/tC a subsidization of afforestation cost is needed in order to generate substantial GHG abatement from marginal agricultural land afforestation in western Canada.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r821k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mx873</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Afforestation -- Economic aspects -- Canada, Western</dc:subject><dc:subject>Emissions trading -- Canada, Western</dc:subject><dc:subject>Greenhouse gases -- Economic aspects -- Canada, Western</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbon sequestration -- Economic aspects -- Canada, Western</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w012d"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Active learning in partially observable Markov decision processes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jaulmes, Robin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>People are efficient when they make decisions under uncertainty, even when their decisions have long-term ramifications, or when their knowledge and their perception of the environment are uncertain. We are able to experiment with the environment and learn, improving our behavior as experience is gathered. Most of the problems we face in real life are of that kind, and most of the problems that an automated agent would face in robotics too. Our goal is to build Artificial Intelligence algorithms able to reproduce the reasoning of humans for these complex problems. We use the Reinforcement Learning framework, which allows to learn optimal behaviors in dynamic environments. More precisely, we adapt Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to environments that are partially known. We take inspiration from the field of Active Learning: we assume the existence of an oracle, who can, during a short learning phase, provide the agent with additional information about its environment. The agent actively learns everything that is useful in the environment, with a minimum use of the oracle. After reviewing existing methods for solving learning problems in partially observable environments, we expose a theoretical active learning setup. We propose an algorithm, MEDUSA, and show theoretical and empirical proofs of performance for it.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n139x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w012d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
