A hexahistidine-tagged form of the human homologue of Tom20 has been over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified under native conditions. This Tom20 protein has been shown, in these studies, to compete for the import of a matrix-destined mitochondrial precursor protein, pre-ornithine carbamoyltransferase (pOCT), into mitochondria isolated from a mammalian source (rat heart), as well as to directly bind the presequence-bearing pOCT in vitro. Furthermore, a protocol has been established for the isolation of import-competent outer membrane vesicles from rat liver mitochondria. These vesicles have been preliminarily characterised in terms of the import of two outer membrane-destined DHFR fusion proteins, Tom70(1-29)-DHFR and Tom20(1-28)-DHFR, and have been shown to exhibit similar characteristics/requirements for protein import as seen for intact mitochondria: temperature sensitivity, the dependence upon cytosolic ATP, and the requirement for protease-sensitive outer membrane surface components.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shore, Gordon C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hb82x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sm48j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, General</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vd536"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Biocatalysis of chlorophyllase in ternary micellar system using chlorophyll derivatives as substrates</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Samaha, Hiba</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A partially purified chlorophyllase, obtained from alga Phaeodactylum tricornutum, was assayed for its hydrolytic activity towards the pheophytin in ternary micellar systems of hexane/Tris-HCl/surfactant.

The approach is based on the concept of the characteristic angle beta. We measured radial percentage depth doses in a polystyrene cylindrical phantom irradiated with electron arc beams having angles beta in the range from 5$ sp circ$ to 100$ sp circ,$ for 9 MeV, 12 MeV, 15 MeV, and 18 MeV electron beam energies. We showed that the characteristic angle-$ beta$ concept can be extended to the beams with nominal energy of 18 MeV. The validity of the empirical relationship, relating the doses in two beams with different energies, was confirmed. A linear relationship between the angle $ beta$ and the depth of dose maximum, the depth of the 85% depth dose, and the depth of the 50% depth dose, was established. The surface dose dependence on the angle $ beta$ was also determined and the bremsstrahlung contamination in the electron arc therapy studied.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Podgorjak, Ervin B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kq18x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182n24q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t125j"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Investigations on relative definability in PCF</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pucella, Riccardo R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The focus of this thesis is the study of relative definability of first-order boolean functions with respect to the language PCF, a paradigmatic typed, higher-order language based on the simply-typed $ lambda$-calculus. The basic core language is sequential. We study the effect of adding construct that embody various notions of parallel execution. The resulting set of equivalence classes with respect to relative definability forms a supsemilattice analoguous to the lattice of degrees in recursion theory. Recent results of Bucciarelli show that the lattice of degrees of parallelism has both infinite chains and infinite antichains. By considering a very simple subset of Sieber's sequentiality relations, we identify levels in the lattice and derive inexpressibility results concerning functions on different levels. This allows us to explore further the structure of the lattice of degrees of parallelism and show the existence of new infinite hierarchies. We also identify four subsemilattices of this structure, all characterized by a simple property.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Panangaden, Prakash</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544br50t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t125j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d202p"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development and validation of a theoretical method to evaluate the efficacy of mechanical cultivators</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Portillo Nuñez, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The methods currently used to evaluate cultivator weed control are imprecise and often biased. A new method was tested. An experiment was carried out at two sites in 1993 and again in 1994, using a split-plot design with four repetitions. Cultivation was carried out on weed populations simulated with rye grass (Lolium spp L.) and mustard (Sinapis alba L.) in 1993 and on both simulated and natural weed population in 1994 with Rabe Werk, Hiniker and Kongskilde cultivators. Weed control was assessed by the effective weed kill and the percentage of the area of the simulated weed population which was affected, and by counts and visual observations on the natural weed population. The new method provided an objective assessment of the cultivation treatments, especially by the effective weed kill index. The area affected approach was not suitable for all cultivation treatments. There was agreement between the proposed method and the conventional methods. This validated the proposed new method. Overall, the Hiniker with ridgers performed the best. The Hiniker without ridgers, and the Kongskilde with or without ridgers performed similarly. The Rabe Werk without goosefoot attachment resulted in the poorest weed control. The degree of weed displacement varied among the cultivators and was associated with weed density. The degree of weed displacement onto the crop row from the inter-row area was low ($&lt;$1% in 1993 and up to 3.4 in 1994). The weed displacement distance was related to weed density and the degree of weed uprooting produced by cultivation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, Donal</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qv02c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d202p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Weeds -- Control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cultivators -- Evaluation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tillage</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw37639044"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Novel roles of the L-selection receptor on lymphocytes in cell division and signal transduction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Po, John Leander Zapanta</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Leukocyte extravasation is a regulated mechanism involving the initial contact, adhesion, and transmigration of leukocytes through layers of endothelial cells into the surrounding tissue. L-selectin is the peripheral lymph node homing receptor mediating the initial interaction and weak adhesion between lymphocytes and endothelial cells. This thesis presents two non-traditional roles of L-selectin-involvement in cell division and signaling. Cytokinesis is the last phase of mitosis in which the plasma membrane invagination occurs between the newly formed daughter cells. L-selectin concentrates along the cleavage furrow of dividing Daudi cells. Arresting cells after completing mitosis results in detectable shed L-selectin in the culture supernatant. In contrast, no soluble L-selectin is detected after arresting cells in the G$ sb2$ phase. This suggests that the relocation and shedding of the L-selectin receptor is involved in cytokinesis of Daudi cells. In addition, calcium mobilization from internal stores is induced using the L-selectin monoclonal antibody, FMC46, on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and Daudi cells. Priming of PBMCs with FMC46 before Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulation increased aggregation and proliferation at lower doses of PWM compared to lymphocytes stimulated with PWM alone. These data provide evidence for direct alteration of lymphocyte activation status after ligation of a specific L-selectin epitope. The physiological role of L-selectin-mediated signaling may be important in the priming of lymphocytes during extravasation such that lymphocytes are more responsive to antigenic stimulation after completing transmigration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jensen, Gitte S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nn432.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w37639044</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623f59q"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Phylogenetic trends in phytoplankton resistance to Cd and Cu toxicity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Payne, Chris, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Some species of marine phytoplankton are believed to be more tolerant of high concentrations of trace metals than others, but no conclusive test of this hypothesis has been conducted. Eleven species of phytoplankton representing 5 classes were grown in Aquil medium containing Cd$ sp{2+}$ concentrations between 10$ sp{-9.85}$ and 10$ sp{-6.84}$ M. Growth rates and intracellular concentrations of Cd, C, N and S were measured. Cadmium quotas (mol Cd/litre-cell volume) were lower in members of Bacillariophyceae than in Chlorophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, Dinophyceae and Cyanophyceae (ANOVA, p $&lt;$ 0.001). Cellular C:S molar ratios decreased in phytoplankton grown at high (pCd 7.37-6.84) compared to low Cd (no added Cd), as S/litre-cell volume increased. Similar results were observed for C:N molar ratios. In two species that were examined, C:S ratios decreased as a linear function of increasing Cd concentration. Mean Cd$ sp{2+}$ concentration that reduced growth rate to 50% of maximum (pCd$ sp{50})$ was not significantly different among phytoplankton classes (ANOVA, p $&lt;$ 0.05). When these experimental data were combined with pCd$ sp{50}$s calculated from published sources, Chlorophyceae were found to be the most resistant class (ANOVA, p $&lt;$ 0.01). Cadmium and Cu resistance (pCd$ sp{50}$ and pCu$ sp{50})$ were correlated (r = 0.52, p $&lt;$ 0.05), suggesting co-tolerance of phytoplankton to toxic levels of these metals. Chlorophyceae were most tolerant and Cyanophyceae the least tolerant of Cu (ANOVA, p $&lt;$ 0.01). No significant differences were observed among Bacillariophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, and Dinophyceae, which were of intermediate sensitivity to both metals.

Inflammatory cells, by releasing mediators and cytokines, participate in the pathogenesis of IPF. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a vasoconstrictor and mitogenic peptide, is one of the mediators that has been shown to be involved in the fibrotic process of IPF in humans. There are, however, no studies examining the role of ET-1 in animal models of IPF. We used the rat model of pulmonary fibrosis, induced by bleomycin, to study the role of ET-1 and endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) in IPF using immunohistochemistry (IHC). We also studied by morphometry the effect of bosentan, the mixed ET-A/B receptor antagonist, on the severity of the fibrosis. We found increased ET-1 and ECE-1 immunoreactivities in the lungs of the fibrosis group compared with the control group (P $&lt;$ 0.05), principally in epithelial cells. By morphometry, we found a decrease in the volume fraction (Vv) of air and an increase in the Vv of connective tissue in the fibrosis group compared with control. The fibrosis was significantly reduced by bosentan (P $&lt;$ 0.05). These results are consistent with the notion that ET-1 is an important mediator of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Michel, Rene P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv9355050.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311r40k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asq87bw55q"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulation of phospholipase A2</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Panesar, Mandip</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In rat membranous nephropathy, complement C5b-9 induces glomerular epithelial cell (GEC) injury and proteinuria, which in some models is partially mediated by eicosanoids. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the C5b-9 complex activates a high molecular mass cytosolic phospholipase A$ sb2$ (cPLA$ sb2)$ in cultured rat GEC, which leads to release of arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosanoids, and may contribute toward plasma membrane injury. In this study, we investigated if C5b-9 can also activate other PLA$ sb2$ isoforms. In GEC stably overexpressing sPLA$ sb2$ (Type II PLA$ sb2,$ 14 kD) (produced by transfection), the C5b-9-stimulated increase in free $ sp3$H-AA, ($ sim$2 fold above basal) was not significantly different from neo (control) GEC. In contrast, in GEC overexpressing cPLA$ sb2,$ C5b-9 stimulated a $ sim$9 -fold increase in free AA, as compared to unstimulated cells. This result suggests that C5b-9 activates cPLA$ sb2,$ but not the sPLA$ sb2$ enzyme, to release free AA. In further studies, we addressed the regulation of cPLA$ sb2$ in C5b-9-stimulated GEC. The present model of cPLA$ sb2$ activation involves the combined effects of: (1) an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, which induces translocation of cPLA$ sb2$ from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, and may be mediated by the amino terminal "CaLB" (Ca$ sp{+2}$-dependent lipid binding) domain, and (2) phosphorylation by MAP kinase. To test the role of the CaLB domain, release of AA was monitored in GEC stably transfected with three constructs; cPLA$ sb2$ wild type (wt), cPLA$ sb2 Delta$CaLB (i.e., cPLA$ sb2$-wt with deleted CaLB domain), and neo (control) GEC. In GEC overexpressing cPLA$ sb2$-wt, C5b-9 stimulated a marked increase in free AA (as above). In contrast, in GEC overexpressing the cPLA$ sb2 Delta$CaLB enzyme, the C5b-9 induced increase in free $ sp3$H-AA was comparable to neo, despite expression of cPLA$ sb2 Delta$CaLB at levels similar to cPLA$ sb2$-wt.

The initial approach considered was the use of an existing FTIR analytical package which was designed to measure iodine value (IV), saponification number (SN), and cis and trans content. It was hypothesized that these measures could be related to SFI using multiple linear regression (MLR), thereby allowing the existing analytical package to simultaneously make SFI measures. It was found that there was a strong relationship between SN/cis/trans measurements and SFI, especially in sequentially hydrogenated oils. The MLR relationships, however, did not reproduce the dilatometric SFI values with sufficient accuracy in the general case, and this approach had to be abandoned. Subsequently, a partial least squares (PLS) calibration approach was investigated, relating the dilatometric SFI data directly to the spectral characteristics of the melted fats. It was found that suitable PLS calibrations could be developed for soybean and Canola oils. Based on these results, an FTIR system was programmed to determine SFI and the performance of the system validated using pre-analyzed "unknowns". It was shown that the SFI of either soybean or Canola oils could be determined to within $ pm$ 1.0 SFI. As configured, the FTIR system is capable of determining the SFI of a neat and clear, melted fat sample at 80$ sp circ$C in less than two minutes, providing four SFI values, representing the solids content at 50, 70, 80 and 92$ sp circ$F. In contrast to the standard dilatometric method, which takes over two hours to carry out, the FTIR approach provides a rapid means of determining SFI, the technique being suitable for routine quality control applications in the fats and oils industry.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Voort, F.

It is a major source of cholinergic inputs to the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, areas important in reward, and is believed to modulate activity of dopamine neurons through a cholinergic mechanism. The firing rate of cholinergic PPTg cells is regulated by muscarinic autoreceptors that can be blocked to increase cell firing. If the PPTg modulates dopamine neurons involved in reward, then a muscarinic antagonist microinjected into the PPTg should be rewarding. To test this hypothesis, bilateral microinjections of scopolamine methyl bromide (5 $ mu$g or 20 $ mu$g) or 0.9% saline were used as reward treatments in the conditioned place preference test. On the test day, rats from both doses of drug avoided the drug-paired chamber, which suggests that cholinergic PPTg cells are not involved in reward.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Franklin, Keith B.

It is necessary for rehabilitation professionals to understand the factors that contribute to seniors' independence in order to accurately focus services and to justify directions taken in the process of health care reform. The overall objective of this study was to determine the degree to which inner-city seniors are living independently today and to identify factors contributing to independent living. A cross-sectional study was conducted with subjects selected by a random telephone selection method. One hundred and sixty-one community-dwelling persons, aged 65 and over who live in Montreal's downtown core were interviewed over the phone to obtain information on sociodemographics, health and disability. Nearly 30% of participants reported their degree of independent living as only moderate or low on the three independent living outcomes. The vast majority reflect a positive portrait of physical function and integration. However, this group represents the tip of the iceberg because they are significantly healthier than non-participants. Several demographic, health and disability factors were identified as contributing to independent living in this group of community-dwelling seniors. These findings are important for rehabilitation professionals as many of the factors are modifiable from both societal and health points of view.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mayo, Nancy E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/736666625.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq59b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Individual and Family Studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gerontology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445cg47j"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An information retrieval tool for reverse software engineering</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Magdalinos, Christos</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Information retrieval in large data spaces using formal, structure oriented patterns of features has many possible applications.

Simulating billiard balls has become an important benchmark for parallel event driven simulation schemes. The approach distinguishes itself in that it makes use of shared variables to enable processors to ascertain the state of the computation at neighboring processors. The table is partitioned into segments which are simulated by different processors. The shared variable corresponds to a region at the boundary between table segments (referred to as the critical region). By making use of shared variables, a significant speed-up over the execution time of a purely conservative approach is obtained. The algorithm was implemented on a BBN Butterfly, as was a purely conservative algorithm. In the purely conservative algorithm, a processor wishing to process a ball in the critical region waits until the neighbouring processor's simulation time is greater than the time of the event it wishes to process. In our experiments, we examined three population levels of balls--2400, 4800 and 7200. These populations were chosen to reflect low, medium and high populations of balls. The shared-variable approach resulted in a 30 to 50 percent decrease in execution time with respect to purely conservative approach.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tropper, Carl</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290c57j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qk82r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296x1151"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Currents induced by somatostatin-14 in monkey kidney cells (COS-7) stably expressing human somatostatin receptor subtype 4</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lu, Jun, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent studies have shown that a variety of K$ sp+$ channels can be enhanced by somatostatin (SST; inward and delayed rectifier, muscarinic regulated K$ sp+$ channel, Ca$ sp{2+}$-activated K$ sp+$ channel, ...). Since a somatostatin receptor (SSTR) is heterogeneous, it is not clear which SSTR subtype (five are identified) is involved in regulating each K$ sp+$ channel, nor whether the regulation is and if so to what extent receptor subtype specific. In this study we characterized electrophysiologically the effect of somatostatin-14 (SST-14) in monkey kidney cells (COS-7) stably expressing one of the five recently cloned SSTR subtypes, human somatostatin receptor subtype 4, using whole cell voltage clamp technique at room temperature (20-23$ sp circ$C). The outward current produced by a sequence of depolarizing steps from a holding potential of $-$80 mV was enhanced by $&gt;$1 nM SST-14. Both the endogenous and SST-14 enhanced outward current had a high threshold ($ sim -$40 mV). The reversal potentials of their tail currents changed with a change of (K$ sp+ rbrack sb{ rm o}$ as expected for a current carried predominantly by K$ sp+$ ions. It was blocked by TEA (10-20 mM) and Ba$ sp{2+}$ (1 mM), but not by charybdotoxin (100 nM) and carbachol (50 $ mu$M) in the extracellular solution suggesting that it is largely due to a delayed rectifier K$ sp+$ channel. A smaller inward current at potentials negative to $ sim -$60 mV was also observed and was enhanced by SST-14 in a similar concentration range. It was blocked by Ba$ sp{2+}$ (1 mM) and Cs$ sp+$ (1 mM) suggesting that SST-14 also enhances an inward rectifier K$ sp+$ current. Both outward and inward currents enhanced by SST-14 were pertussis toxin and cAMP sensitive.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glavinovic, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kq196.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x1151</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asx61dp45z"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Towards an understanding of responses to discrimination</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Louis, Winnifred R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Three hundred and twenty men and women were exposed to five levels of conventional sexism and affirmative action-induced discrimination.

Unfortunately, maintaining reliable noise-free video transmission, especially in cost sensitive teleoperation applications is a frequent problem. We developed a mobile robot system for teleoperation using a robot mounted camera as a primary sensor. This system functions in a partially-known environment for which a 3D geometric map is available. In this thesis we describe aspects of the system related to enhanced reality, that is the augmentation of the returned video data with information extracted from the world knowledge base. If during robot navigation our sensor data (returned video) experiences transmission delays or becomes too noisy or obstructed, we superimposed artificially generated graphics (using the model representation) onto a regular video picture. Once a clear transmission was recaptured or the obscuring obstacle shifted from its old position, video data covering that area of the image was redisplayed for consequent navigation. This task of fusing these two representations together simultaneously, in an efficient and realistic fashion during robot teleoperation, was the goal of our research.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dudek, Gregory</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719p324.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h380r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053j14q"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Peatland methane emissions and influencing environmental factors in the southern fringe of the discontinuous permafrost zone, Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liblik, Laura K. (Laura Kaarin)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A static chamber technique was used to measure methane emissions in July and August, 1995 from peatland sites in the Fort Simpson area, Northwest Territories, at the southern fringe of the discontinuous permafrost zone. Sites were classified ecologically and geomorphologically, and water table and temperature regimes were monitored. Methane emissions ranged from $-$3.3 to 1144.2 mg/m$ sp2 cdot$d, from raised frozen sites to pond sites, respectively, similar to emissions recorded from other boreal regions. Water table was the strongest predictor of CH$ sb4$ emission. Although peat temperature is significantly correlated to methane flux, it did not significantly improve the flux-water table relationship. Methane storage within the saturated portion of the peat profile ranged from 0.2 to 4.2 g/m$ sp2$ over depths ranging from 30 to 76 cm, and did not play a large role in surficial emissions. The zone immediately above and below the water table appears to regulate methane diffusion to the surface. Residence times (storage/flux) ranged from 12 to 30 days in poor fens, and from 6 to 5789 days in fens. Ranges and mean fluxes of methane were determined according to landform and water table position. Based on the geomorphology of the area, overall flux determined for the Fort Simpson area, map NTS 95H, NW1/4, is estimated to be 19 mg/m$ sp2 cdot$d.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Moore, T.

The identity of the 0.75 kb fragment was confirmed by sequence analysis. This cDNA sequence encodes a protein that has been shown to associate specifically with the U1 snRNP. Northern blot analysis revealed that U1 snRNP C mRNA is a 0.75 kb transcript present in a variety of tissues in the mouse including, the testes, heart, intestine, lung, muscle, pancreas, spleen, kidney, brain and liver. In situ hybridization confirmed the somatic and haploid expression of the U1 snRNP specific C mRNA transcript. In an attempt to correlate RNA expression with protein distribution, light microscopic immunocytochemistry with the anti-Sm antibody was utilized to illustrate spliceosomal snRNP distribution within the mouse. Immunoblots of testicular homogenates probed with the anti-Sm antibody revealed several reactive proteins, of which one, a 21 kD polypeptide, appears to be the U1 snRNP specific C protein based on its predicted molecular weight. Immunoperoxidase staining using the anti-Sm antibody revealed protein localization predominantly within the nuclei of most cells examined, namely; hepatocytes, somatic and germ cells of the testis, neuronal cells within the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, cardiocytes, nephronic cells, intestinal cells, pancreatic acinar cells and Islet of Langerhans cells. However, exceptions in this nuclear reaction were noted in the nuclei of some pancreatic acinar cells, cells of the spleen, and in all elongated spermatids.

Trie structures are used as indexes to store and query spatial data on secondary storage. This thesis deals with point and segment data. Maps are treated as a series of segments in the plane, and links between these maps and other maps or pictures are treated as point data. Maps are stored as Zoom tries on secondary storage. Zoom tries allow efficient accesses to the maps at different levels of resolution. They also allow efficient implementations of range queries. Furthermore, this trie organization provides good data compression. We implement four operations on maps to allow user interaction. We define a link between a map and another map or picture, by a position in the plane, a resolution level and a pointer to a target document. These links are represented as buttons on the maps where they are defined. Zoom tries are used to store and index the position and resolution parts of the link information. The choice of zoom tries as the data structure to store the position information of the links allows the definition of operations on the buttons that integrate naturally with those defined on maps. The contribution of this thesis is the representation of buttons as a zoom trie structure.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p020v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x338g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
