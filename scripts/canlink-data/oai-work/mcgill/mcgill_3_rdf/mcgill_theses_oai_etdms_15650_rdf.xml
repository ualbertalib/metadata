It was known that the U235 isotope, present in 0.72% abundance in natural uranium, was fissionable with thermal neutrons but that the U238 isotope present in 99.28% abundance could only be caused to fission with neutrons of higher energy. In addition, the U238 nucleus was capable of capturing thermal neutrons and would therefore act as a parasite in the nuclear chain reaction. This parasitic capture was soon recognized to lead to the formation of Pu239 in the following way.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yaffe, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sh156.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57nv42q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35tc79s"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics and Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Federal representation in the Canadian Cabinet July 1, 1867 – June 21, 1957</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marko, Anne.

A cabinet minister may represent more than one of these aspects. This practice is followed regardless of which party is in power and usually supersedes such considerations as political or administrative experience. The pattern of representation in the Canadian federal cabinet has changed considerably since Confederation. In the immediate post Confederation era, the first consideration was provincial representation. A certain number of cabinet ministers were appointed to represent each of the four provinces according to their population using Quebec’s and Ontario’s populations as the basis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mallory, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qn28c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tc79s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics and Political Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247dw90h"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Electrographic studies of the caudate nucleus in the cat</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marco, Luis.

Perhaps the best known of this latter type of studies, certainly the ones most rigorously controlled, are those usually described under the label of "stimulus generalization”. Though the concept of stimulus generalization was derived from experiments on conditioning (Pavlov, 1927; Bass and Hull, 1934; Hovland, 1937a, 1937b), it has also been used to describe, and sometimes to explain the results of studies in a wide variety of research areas.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bindra, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sf01r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tz78t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A47429d95w"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sensitivity of a photomagnetometer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacKinnon, John.

The system described here is a source-modulated detector. The solid being studied is fixed in the presence of a uniform magnetic field and radiation in the optical region modulated at a low frequency (1000 c.p.s.) is allowed to strike the solid. Any changes in the magnetic moment are measured by the voltage induced in detection coils suitably arranged adjacent to the sample. These signals are detected by a phase sensitive electronics system. The sensitivity, frequency response, and thermal noise level of the system were measured. Studies were made of the spurious signals which can arise from vibration of the detection coils in the magnetic field, irregularities in modulation due to imperfections in the chopping disc, and stray light falling on the detection coils. The bandwidth of the electronic detection system, and the photomagentism to be expected in a small parallelepiped of solid arising from the photogeneration of free carriers were calculated.

The method of presentation requires some explanation. Part I deals briefly with the nature of the problem, a short review of the background and the objectives and scope of the investigations. The main experimental work is presented in Parts II, III, and IV. These parts have been written to achieve brevity without loss of clarity and to permit publication in the scientific literature without further modification.. For this reason certain experimental and technical details have been omitted from the main text and presented in Appendices V to VIII. Concluding Remarks and Suggestions for Further \iork are given in Part V. Some results of experiments on the effect of emulsifiers on coalescence and the action of defoamers are contained in Appendices I and II, and the experimental verification of a previously derived theoretical equation for the approach of a sphere to a plane interface is given in Appendices III and IV.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pavlasek, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75rc47b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nj29f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av692t988m"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hemispheric analysis of total ozone observations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacDonald, Violet.

Wright (1). The sole parallel between this case and those immediately concerning the aircraft manufacturer is that both are derived from allegedly defective vehicles: for the rest, Winterbottom v. Wright did not involve a manufacturer, and was not tried on the issue of the tort of negligence. Its importance in the law of products liability, and the solution to the paradox, lie not in what was decided in the case but in the misinterpretation of the decision by later courts, and in their application of that misinterpretation to cases which were properly based on the tort of negligence.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rosevear, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h079w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rh931</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Air and Space Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v6328"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Diffraction-aberration theory of microwave optical image formation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lum, Yun. F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This is a study of the formation of the microwave optical image, based on diffraction and aberration theories. The work is essentially in two parts. The first part is concerned with the Kirchhoff vector and scalar diffraction theories. Expressions are derived for the vector image fields and for the time-averaged Poynting power flow in the image region of an ideal system. A plot of the power flow is given. The second part considers the effects of aberrations on the image structure. A new general diffraction integral is developed and ''diffraction aberrations" are found to arise from the inclined aperture. It is shown that there exists a unique relation between the shape and positions of the Airy dark rings and the various aberrations. Methods of measuring the aberrations in a physical system are proposed. A general theorem concerning the phase change round a closed path linked with the Airy rings is proved rigorously, and finally the axial wavelength is shown to be longer than the free-space wavelength. Microwave measurements at X-band confirm the validity of the General Diffraction Integral and of the Airy ring versus aberrations relationships. The three-dimensional structure of the image field for a system with astigmatism is presented in full, in terms of contour maps of phase and intensity. Agreement between theory and experiment is good.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pavlasek, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z7091240.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v6328</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electrical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63t044s"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The sulphur status of Quebec soils with particular reference to the amount of organically combined sulphur and the nature of its combinations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lowe, Lawrence.

Light scattered from the interface at a shallow angle is proportional to the area of optical contact lying within the spot, and is detected by a sensitive photomultiplier tube. A frequency analysis of this time-varying photomultiplier signal yields a band-limited noise spectrum corresponding to the random distribution of optical contact areas, along with distinct peaks at the frequencies corresponding to the regular patterns of the woven wire screen upon which the paper was initially formed, (the wire mark).

The antibody thus demonstrated in an in vitro system against a microbial antigen cannot necessarily be equated with a measure of immunity against the infection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vas, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k868d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935647q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bacteriology and Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apv63g366k"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics and Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An institutional model of the term structure of interest rates</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lermer, George</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite the accepted synthesis between the “real" and “monetary" economies, questions remain unanswered in the financial sector of the economy. Though these sectors were once considered separate, "real" or “value theory" methodology has dominated study of both areas. This thesis advances the proposition that the “financial sector” cannot be studied using the analytic tools of "value theory” alone. In particular, controversy continues concerning the relevance of the "expectations” hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates as opposed to the “institutional” hypothesis. Our thesis attempts a rigourous exposition of the “institutional” hypothesis. We describe how this hypothesis is a logical implication of the “balance effect”.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Weldon, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pr32q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g366k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics and Political Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1n79h795w"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le caractère des canadiens français vus dans quelques œuvres du terroir</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lebel, Sister Mary</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cette étude, fondée sur l'analyse de certains contes du terroir de la région de Québec, vise à présenter le portrait des Canadiens français tel qu'il a été esquissé par le Frère Marie-Victorin, Mgr Camille Roy, l’abbé Lionel Groulx, le Frère Gilles, Georges Bouchard et le plus important de tous, Adjutor Rivard.

The work forms part of a current series of macromolecular etudies in Wood and Cellulose Chemistry. After a Preface and General Introduction, the work is presented as a series of Parts written in the form of scientific papers and are to be submitted for publication with little modification. Part I deals with the preparation and properties of various xylan fractions. Part II is a study of the molecular weight and configuration of the polysaccharide in solution. Part III is an investigation on the viscosity-temperature relationships tor dilute solutions of xylan in dimethyl sulfoxide. The main text ot the thesis ends with concluding remarks, suggestions tor further work and claims for original research. Additional details are given in a series of Appendices. Appendix I is a report on some physical properties of dimethyl sulfoxide-water mixtures and has already been published by Dr. D.A.I.

One of the explanations of this apparent lack of interest in diseases of this tree species is the very important infestation by the larch sawfly (Pristiphora Erichsonii Htg.), which, at the beginning of the present century, greatly reduced the best stands of larch in Northeast America. Usually the Eastern larch, commonly called tamarack, provides a hard, heavy and non-porous wood of high technical value.

L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although much information has accumulated in recent years on the cellular origin and mechanism of antibody synthesis, very little is known about the way in which antigens exert their effect on the induction of antibody formation. A number of investigators (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) feel that antigens probably must be split into fragments to initiate antibody production and that these subunits may correspond in size to the dimensions of the antibody-combining sites (3). Antibodies reacting with antigenic fragments prepared in vitro have been found in rabbit antisera against human and bovine serum albumin (4, 7, 8, 9) and some of these antibodies appeared to be directed against antigenic groups not present on the surface of the native protein (9).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rose, B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42nc38w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n204261f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k869p"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Siluro-Devonian stratigraphy of the Matapedia-Temiscouata area</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lajoie, Jean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis discusses correlation of the Silurian and Devonian rocks between the Lake Temiscouata and the Lake Matapedia areas. In certain correlations, two solutions are possible; the writer has proposed those which appear most logical at the present. The area is located in the Northern Appalachian Highlands, between the Matapedia and Temiscouata river valleys. The writer has not mapped this entire area by himself, his main work has been directed in the center part of the area. However, for a better understanding of the correlation of Silurian strata between the two extremities, it became necessary to include work done by other workers in both the Matapedia valley, and Lake Temiscouata valley.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stearn, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fq42x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k869p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
