Comparisons are made of gas and liquid permeability measurements with fiberglass, wool fibers, acetylene black and respirator filter pads. Satisfactory correlation is obtained for all materials except acetylene black.

The term shock is in itself a controversial one, mainly because the condition which it describes is not capable of concise definition but rather of description of its unmistakable attributes. Since one of the main features is a circulatory deficiency, Cannon suggested the use of the term “exemia” rather than shock. Latta, in 1795, is reported to have first used the term shock, and other early workers made general reference to the condition, describing it in such terms as “complete depression of all the vital functions.” Numerous reviews and books have been published on the subject, among which may be mentioned those of Cannon and Bayliss (1919), Cannon (1923), Moon (1938), Blalock (1940), Scudder (1940), Harkins (1941) and Wiggers (1942). In a good deal of the early work the major interest centred on the clinical findings in shock rather than on any investigation of the fundamental physiological or biochemical changes involved.

The diets were mixtures of milk powder, flour, shortening, bone meal, and salt. The proportion of these ingredients was adjusted to maintain protein at 16% by weight. Gains decreased with increasing fat level apparently due to a reduction of the proportion of protein to non-protein calories from the replacement of carbohydrate by fat. Lard was slightly more digestible than the other fats but produced lowest gains and carcass fat deposition. The other types of shortening were nutritionally equivalent. Slower gains were produced on diets baked at 425° F., than at 375° F.

Thus since the last war the cracking of high boiling petroleum constituents into gasoline has developed into an exact science. The polymerization of hydrocarbons (especially olefins) into liquid products suitable as motor fuel has been extensively utilized in recent years. Alcohols, esters, acids, ethers, resins and rubber-like materials are today made from light unsaturated hydrocarbons, which in turn may be produced from gasphase pyrolysis. Carbon black, hydrogen, and benzene are the direct products of pyrolysis. [...] It is hoped that this study of the catalytic activity of activated Morden Bentonite on organic compounds will serve as a basis for more extended research on its uses and finally for its industrial application. Clays such as kaolin, kieselguhr, Japanese acid earth already are widely used in industry. Until the present time these catalysts have been imported into Canada particularly by the petroleum industry as a drilling mud, for percolation and for filtration.

He called it “oxidized prussic acid”, but did not apply any formula to it. Gay-Lussac(l) in 1815 made a more complete investigation of this compound, assigning it the formula CNCl from a consideration of its chemical properties. He found that cyanogen chloride could be prepared by reacting moist hydrocyanic acid with chlorine, or by the action of chlorine on dry mercuric cyanide. The physical constants determined by him for cyanogen chloride are not accurate, because his product was impure. [...] Cyanogen chloride was used as a war gas in October, 1916 by the French. It was employed alone, and also mixed with AsCl3,  which was alleged to stabilize it, under the name “Vivrite”. It has fair lachrymatory action, and is a very toxic substance, poisoning by cyanogen chloride being similar to that of cyanides, but more severe. Owing to its non-persistent character it was difficult to obtain a lethal concentration in the field. Recent interest in cyanogen chloride has been aroused by the discovery that most service respirators offer very limited protection against this gas when the charcoal contains moisture, that is, under ordinary conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bx591.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rx790</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57nv08d"><ual:graduationDate>1943</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Viscosity instability in high polymeric systems : B.)

Iron has been shown to cause large viscose changes with ageing. Precipitation of the polymer solution has revealed that a molecular weight change occurs with ageing. An investigation of the structure of gelling solutions has indicated that the molecular weight change in a solution with increasing viscosity is a result of cross bridging between polymer chains. A cell has been designed to determine the osmotic pressures of heterogeneous polyvinyl acetate samples. The molecular weight of Gelva 15 was found to be higher then that expected from intrinsic viscosity measurements. It is shown that the discrepancy is due to the Staudinger constant assigned to polyvinyl acetate. A study of the pro-knock activity of various compounds revealed that this action is mainly a counteraction of the lead tetraethyl in the fuel. The results indicate that the pro-knock molecules preferentially attack the lead tetraethyl-hydrocarbon complex associated with chain branching. A few compounds such as chloropicrin exhibit a small effect on unleaded gasolines.

In addition, completely distillable hydroaromatic products amounting to 60 - 65% calculated on the original Klason lignin content of the wood were obtained. Aromatic and hydroaromatic dimeric units of the (C6-C3 ) types were isolated and proof has been obtained that a carbon to carbon linkage between these units exists to a considerable extent in the simple lignin structures isolated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hibbert, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483n43h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655k66v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apk02cf15b"><ual:graduationDate>1943</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Reactions of tetrahydrolinalool. : The conversion of N.N. diethylaniline to N. ethylaniline.

The preparation of RDX</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Robinson, Donald Barker Wellington</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Reactions of tetrahydrolinalool with hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide at 25°C. and -78°C. were studied. The effect on the reaction of added substances, e.g. benzoyl peroxide, aluminum bromide, was observed under various conditions. The results obtained indicated a catalytic effect not unlike that exerted by peroxides and metal halides on addition to unsaturated compounds. No claim is made for a true “peroxide effect,” but it is concluded that rate studies, as a means of  clarifying the reaction mechanism for substitution reactions of this type are unreliable, on account of the apparent complexity of the reaction. Various phases of the preparation of pure picric acid were studied and a postulate presented for the reaction mechanism. N.N.diethylaniline was converted to N.ethylaniline under the influence of various catalysts. The best results were obtained when N.N.diethylaniline hydrochloride was distilled at atmospheric pressure in the presence of a 5% excess of the amine. The use of ammonium chloride offered a promising field for further development. The mechanism of RDX preparation was investigated, but no concrete results were obtained. The Heat of Reaction for the McGill Process was determined. Other phases of RDX research were followed, e.g. Estimation of Total Formaldehyde used in the reaction, and HMX-RDX mixed melting points.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicholls, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128f220.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cf15b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av692t956b"><ual:graduationDate>1943</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>War research problems.

However, stabilization of the compound has been found difficult. Naturally it was desirable to obtain a good knowledge of the chemistry involved in the degradation process. When investigations were commenced in this laboratory there was little concrete information available, as is indicated in the introduction to the first section. The subject is conveniently treated as a series of topics:- 1. The reactions of “S” in absolute menthol were studied in an attempt to obtain information on the kinetics of its conversion process. 2. &amp; 3. The kinetics or displacement reactions of the isolatable product, designated as the dimer of “S”, were investigated with the view of confirming the stability of the remaining et atomic chlorine. 4. The reactions of “S” in various acid solutions were then studied in an attempt to gain information about the hydrolysis or “S” and SH+ ion. 5. The program was completed with an investigation of the reactions of “S” in acetone-water mixtures. A general discussion sets the various topics in their proper relationship.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88ck840.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t956b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nf33n"><ual:graduationDate>1943</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A.)

The original problem of investigating the nature of a charcoal surface by x-ray diffraction studies failed to develop along the anticipated lines and became rather a study of the mechanism and kinetics of the decomposition of nickel carbonyl on charcoal surfaces, which, however, did not seem to be justified under existing conditions of urgency. A study to which highest priority has been conceded, namely kinetics of formation of R.D.X, was undertaken therefore, concurrently with which a study was also made x-ray diffraction pictures of H.M.X. crystals with particular reference to differences from R.D.X. Since the investigations were entirely unrelated they have been separated into independent sections. This would necessitate some duplication in the description of the x-ray equipment used in both sections so that this has been overcome by describing the apparatus and its adjustment and calibration separately. Thereafter only such details as are necessary to designate the steps will be described in each section.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kr230.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nf33n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d310k"><ual:graduationDate>1944</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The preparation of disulphur decafluoride</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bishinsky, Charles</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In 1940 an investigation of gaseous fluorides was undertaken in this laboratory as part of a search for new toxic respirator penetrants. A sample of supposedly pure sulphur hexafluoride, prepared by the passage of fluorine over sulphur, was found to be surprisingly toxic to mice. Fractionation of the gas yielded about 1% of a high molecular weight impurity, identified as disulphur decafluoride, S2F10, which proved to be the toxic ingredient. Importantly enough, lethal concentrations for small animals were odourless. Studies on the toxicity of S2F10 have been reported by Noble (1) and Geiling (2). [...] The work was therefore concentrated upon obtaining an appreciable yield from the sulphur-fluorine reaction. Otherwise the expense of the starting material, fluorine, would render the cost of S2F10 prohibitive. Early work at McGill showed that yields as high as 25% based on sulphur could be obtained if inert solid and gaseous diluents were used in the fluorine-sulphur reaction. The object of the investigation reported here was to obtain a thorough understanding of the factors affecting the S2F10 yield for ultimate application to large scale production. Although the emphasis of the work has at all times been of a practical nature, enough data have been collected to furnish a basis for postulating a mechanism tor the formation of S2F10 from the sulphur-fluorine reaction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mcintosh, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107223s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d310k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w786t"><ual:graduationDate>1944</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The preparation of disulphur decafluoride</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McLeod, Lloyd Alexander</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The investigations reported in this thesis were carried out as one of the extramural problems of the Directorate of Chemical Warfare under the project number C.E.3. The project was initially planned as an investigation of various fluorine compounds, particularly the fluorides of sulphur. Attention was early focussed on S2F10 when its value as a chemical warfare agent was shown by Noble (1) and McIntosh (2), and attempts were made to discover the conditions for optimum yield of this compound with a view to commercial production. Early results at McGill showed that the reaction of gaseous fluorine and solid sulphur produced S2F10 in yields as high as 28% based on sulphur reacted. The experiments utilised both solid and gaseous diluents. The present problem was concerned with a more thorough investigation of the factors affecting the yield of S2F10 and, if possible, with an elimination of certain laboratory procedures which were not adaptable to large scale production. Throughout the course of this research, the emphasis has been placed on results of practical value and many experiments of purely theoretical interest have been abandoned while still incomplete, or have been omitted entirely. The result has been that, although a relatively complete picture has been established of those faotors which might involve production difficulties, the theoretical background remains somewhat obscure. An attempt will, however, be made to interprete the results from a theoretical viewpoint.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mcintosh, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hn49m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w786t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bf887"><ual:graduationDate>1944</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Preparation of disulphur decafluoride</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Siminovitch, Louis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In 1940 attempts were made at McGill University to produce samples of pure sulphur hexafluoride as part of a search for possible toxic respirator penetrants (1). Surprisingly, the samples of supposedly pure hexafluoride, formed by passing fluorine over sulphur, were found to be toxic in small concentrations. Purification and fractionation of the sample resulted in the isolation of a high molecular weight component identical in properties with the compound disulphur decafluoride (S2F10 ) discovered and described by Denbigh and Whytlaw-Gray in 1934 (2,3). It was then shown that the poisonous effects exhibited by the sulphur hexafluoride were due to the relatively small concentrations of s2F1o present as impurity. Toxicity studies soon indicated that the remarkable physiological properties of S2F10 made it very valuable as a potential chemical warfare agent (4). Since that time extensive research has been carried out in Canada, United States, and Great Britain on the production and properties of s2F1o. [...] This thesis embodies the investigation of the solid sulphur-gaseous fluorine reaction, and the effect of several variables on this system. An attempt has been made to postulate a mechanism for the reaction although the data obtained are much more useful from a production viewpoint.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mcintosh, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72pb53c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bf887</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sg81k"><ual:graduationDate>1945</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The recovery of glacial acetic acid from the residual liquors of the Bachmann process : the development of a continuous reactor with which to investigate the Bachmann reaction; a.) the U-tube reactor, b.) the rotating tube reactor</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Boyer, Thomas William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A process has been devised for the recovery of glacial acetic acid from the waste products of the Bachmann reaction.

Often these disquisitions are as exhausting as they are exhaustive; if the subject is generally included in school courses, the justification is scarcely warranted, and if not, the justification becomes an apology. This is hardly true of music, however. Unlike algebra, Greek and botany, music is an integral part of the daily life of millions, regardless of their age, intellectual attainments, social position, or economic affluence. In spite of this -- or perhaps because of it -- some educators today allow music little or no place in the modern curriculum. But surely education is to be a preparation for a full life in later years, tempered by what Dr. A.B. Currie of McGill has so aptly termed a “cooperative humanism”. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the specific aims of music education, and its contribution to a more comprehensive humanism. The approach has necessarily been eclectic. The historical survey has been included to show the dual relationship of music education to education in general, and of the latter to history. This survey provides a factual basis for the later discussions of the aims of music education and the means by which they are realized.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hughes, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kd852.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v887q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music -- Instruction and study</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
