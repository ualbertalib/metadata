Control treatments were yellow nutsedge growing in a pure stand and complete yellow nutsedge control. After two growing seasons in experiment #1, the tuber population had decreased in all cropping systems. Yellow nutsedge was reduced to 9% of the initial population under perfect control while it tripled in the pure stand. After the first growing season in the second experiment, only corn intercropped with red clover significantly reduced yellow nutsedge population by 17%. When the systems were not treated with herbicides, the yellow nutsedge population increased between 41 to 180% in all cropping systems. There was a significant relation between yellow nutsedge, broadleaf weed and grass densities and yellow nutsedge tuber production. Corn was the most profitable cropping system. The least economically advantageous cropping system was barley.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zc273.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816n70k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chufa -- Control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Weeds -- Control -- Economic aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s161740d"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pure consciousness and "cognitive alternation" : a study in the psychology of mysticism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>LaPointe, Jean Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Contextual theories of language and experience have been introduced in religious studies at the end of the 1970's to undermine the thesis of a common core in mystical experiences.

We will then examine how the most consequential attempts to extract intelligible models from the mystics' testimonies have been reflecting, to a large extent, the philosophical assessments of science. We will justify the approach of modern psychology in the general endeavor of erecting an integrated epistemological model of human awareness, since this approach is better positioned to respect both the subjective contribution of the subject and the revised concept of objectivity in empirical methodology. We will discuss the psychological process known as "cognitive alternation" or "cognitive adaptiveness" and its role in the creative process, and examine how this process reveals the essential structural orientation of consciousness.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cm22p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161740d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mysticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Knowledge, Theory of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology and religion</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah128nf78r"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>"Athénaïse" de Kate Chopin ; suivi de, Prismes de la traduction littéraire</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McKay, Sylvie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The creative section of this thesis is a translation of the short story "Athenaise" drawn from the anthology A Night in Acadie by the American author Kate Chopin.

This translation conveys the cultural and stylistic features of the original text by taking into account the author's literary style. In the segment of this thesis devoted to the critique, we propose to demonstrate how to bring the particularities of the original text into the finished work. It is through various prisms of literary translation that we can convey some of the original's specificity: knowledge of Kate Chopin (the author), her work, her culture and an analysis of her literary style and writing technique. We will also analyze the translation through a systematic critique as developed by Antoine Berman in his work on three traditional devices of translation in the Western hemisphere.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bg19s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nf78r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Translating and interpreting</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967488f"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La politique commune des transports routiers de marchandises</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lavenne, Frédéric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Single European Act's purpose is to set up a single free trade area by the 1st of January 1993 where there would exist a freedom of movement of persons, goods, services and capital.

First and foremost the adoption of a common policy in the sphere of transport as defined in the article 3 of the Treaty of ROME will be necessary.

We have applied these techniques in cell locomotion and tracking studies. First, we consider the segmentation of a noisy intensity image and the tracking of a nonrigid object. Second, we consider the shape analysis of an amorphous object. In evaluating these problems, we explore a new technique based on an active contour model commonly called a "snake". We present a detailed analysis of the snake model, emphasizing its limitations and shortcomings, and propose various improvements to the original description of the model. Then, we study the two complementary types of shape descriptors: boundary- and region-based. We propose to combine these within the context of the grassfire transform. Two new algorithms are described. First, we present a contour segmentation technique using mathematical morphology on the curvature function. Accurate localization for different scales of curvature features is achieved. Second, the snake model is used to simulate the grassfire transform using the previously extracted contour features.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bj384.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945s03p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9k41zf63t"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dietary fat supplementation for dairy cows in early lactation injected with somatotropin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marty, Bruno Josef</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Dairy cows fed diets supplemented with 2.5% calcium-salt fatty acids (CSFA) (DM basis) during early lactation produced more 4% FCM than cows fed the control diet.

The Direct Elicitation of Utility function was employed to determine producers' degree of aversion to risk. The Delphi technique was also introduced as a means of obtaining more refined and realistic information. The highly diverse risk attitudes which vary between extremely concave and extremely convex utility functions indicate, on average, a slightly risk averse behaviour for both farming groups. Dairy producers have 69% risk-averse, 10% close to risk-neutrality and 21% risk-loving individuals for the $100,000 investment game in the EP format. These figures are respectively 69 %, 6 % and 23 % for hog producers. Hog farmers are found more averse to risk than dairy producers, but more significantly at higher levels of investment.

Microinjection of IL-3 directly into mouse fetuses (day 13) via the yolk sac, allowed us to evaluate the effects on morphogenetic events and more specifically on fetal liver populations using quantitative in vitro clonal assays for hemopoietic precursors. Control studies, required to distinguish stress effects of surgical laparotomy and microinjection, clearly revealed that the fetal liver is a sensitive organ responding with limited tissue disorganization, reduced cellularity and erythropoietic activity as identified 24 h after experimental intervention. Microinjection of 15 units of IL-3 promoted significant expansion of the depleted fetal liver hemopoietic cell populations and had stimulatory effects on connective tissue mast cells, absolute cell numbers including hemopoietic precursors (erythroid, granulocyte, macrophage, megakaryocyte) compared to controls. These studies suggest that fetal liver cells acquire a responsiveness to IL-3 early in development and that, IL-3 has a positive stimulatory effect on fetal liver cell populations, promoting the recovery of normal liver hemopoiesis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qn151.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k35695605</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz806098t"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fibres et papier à propriétés magnétiques</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ricard, Serge</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The fundamental objectives of this research is to produce and study magnetically loaded fibers and magnetic paper.

Our experiments resulted in the determination of the "kraft pulp/$ gamma$-Fe$ sb2$O$ sb3$ pigment" composite as an optimal combination of optical, mechanical and magnetic properties. We have also developed a "chemical" process for the preparation of magnetic fibers which consists of using a cellulosic substrate with ion-exchange properties for Fe(II), i.e. Na-carboxymethylcellulose, as a host matrix for the growth of very small iron oxide particles. The in situ oxidation reaction of Fe(OH)$ sb2$ in the fiber cell walls yielded to superparamagnetic ferrite particles of about 100 A.

The troubadours who refine these compositions do not limit themselves to composing cantigas of only one genre. They write cantigas of all types. For thematic and formal purposes, the common practice is to divide the cantigas into four genres. These divisions are not always very clear. Because they were in touch with all sorts of cantigas, the poets included in their poems characteristics which blended from one genre to another. This may or may not have been done intentionally. Critics later studied these cantigas. They found that cantigas of one genre shared peculiarities common to cantigas of other genres, but they did not explore further into this trait. This study analyzes characteristics found commonly in one genre of cantiga and, as well, by placing together those cantigas with related attributes, it establishes the overlapping that takes place between the cantigas of different genres.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193b174.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cf45s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Portuguese poetry -- To 1500 -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajh343t38v"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of Taurine depletion on rat heart electrophysiology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Roode, Michael R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Taurine is an amino acid found in high concentration (20-30 mM) in mammalian heart.

A comparison of the biology and energetic parameters between sea run and freshwater brook trout was made in the same system. Anadromous brook trout started their downstream movements in May and displacements peaked in June, but some also occurred in fall. Downstream movements were correlated with spring and fall freshets. Important interannual variation was observed in the movement pattern. Seaward movements of anadromous trout were limited to the brackish waters, as fish congregated at the river mouth. I suggest that movements into brackish waters are passive. Upstream movements began in late July and continued until freezing (November), with the intensity of movement varying annually according to climatic conditions. Comparison between anadromous and freshwater trout showed very little difference in mean length at age, age at maturity, egg size and fecundity between the two groups. However, examination of energetic parameters indicated that sea run brook trout had a greater increase in condition factor during the summer than the freshwater residents. This raise in condition factor is accompanied by a decrease in water content and a lower water content in the eggs of anadromous fish. These results indicate that benefits associated with anadromous migrations in brook trout reside in the seasonal pattern of energy storage, which is important for the recovery from energy expenditure associated with spawning and overwintering.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xm950.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g4063</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Brook trout -- Québec (Province) -- Rivière au Saumon</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brook trout -- Seasonal distribution</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anadromous fishes -- Québec (Province) -- Rivière au Saumon</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajh343t394"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An evaluation of the efficacy of three functional de-rotational knee braces in controlling instabilities characteristic of an ACL deficiency</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Matthews, Sonya Lynn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this investigation was to objectively evaluate whether three functional de-rotational knee braces stabilize an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency.

The reinforcement, throughout the national territory, of an urban life-style brought about by this growing urbanization has somehow decreased the cultural distance between the country's urban and rural environments. In spite of that, cultural differences between the two environments do exist, and it is not wrong to assume that a cultural change occurs along the rural-urban migration process. The present research deals with the issue of urbanization and cultural change in Brazil. It focuses specifically on informal urban housing, built by rural immigrants to the city. This was done through a case study of an unplanned settlement, in Natal RN, Northeast Brazil. The study points out the dwellings' physical references to both tradition, that is, to the rural world from where the dwellers have come, and to change due to the urban environment, where they now live. The study also analyzes the socio-cultural causes for tradition and change of the dwellings. Its main finding is that this whole process leads to the formation of a hybrid type of urban house.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s360p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g137q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dwellings -- Brazil -- Natal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Housing -- Brazil -- Natal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture, Domestic -- Brazil -- Natal -- Designs and plans</dc:subject><dc:subject>Urbanization -- Brazil -- Natal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zv53p"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ethnic origin and the use of social services : the experience of a hospital social service department</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vaughan, Glenys</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The importance of ethnic origin as a factor in delivery of social services has been recognised internationally as relevant at different levels of organization. This study examined 500 dossiers, a random sample of clients referred in 1985 to one hospital social service department in Montreal. Age, gender, status of children, referring hospital service, problems experienced and involvement with community social service agencies were found to be related to ethnic origin, using the Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson chi-squared test. After accounting for differences between ethnic groups in age, type of problem and referring hospital service by the use of logit analysis, ethnic origin significantly affected the changes of involvement with Social Service Centres and Departments of Youth Protection. Among the implications of the results for social services in Montreal were the need for the following: recognition that some ethnic minorities have very different social service needs than the larger ethnic groups; development of skills in cross-cultural social service provision because of the clientele's varied ethnic background; consideration of the impact, desirability and viability of ethnic/socioculturally specific agencies and services. The urgent need for further research is emphasised.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq79r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zv53p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Health Care Management</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nc43g"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Anatomical and functional changes between terrestrial varanoid lizards and aquatic mosasaurs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Debraga, Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The transition between terrestrial varanoid lizards and aquatic mosasaurs through the intermediate, semi-aquatic aigialosaurs is fully documented. Aigialosaurs are shown to possess a mosaic of mosasaurian (configuration of the skull, jaw and tail) and terrestrial varanoid characters (appendicular skeleton and trunk). The taxonomic position of the Aigialosauridae within the superfamily Varanoidea is evaluated. Based on character states previously used to define the Varanoidea, neither the specific affinities of aigialosaurs nor the sister-group relationships of earlier members of the terrestrial varanoid assemblage can be securely established. For this reason, the specific character states involved have been reexamined and alternative hypotheses of relationship have been considered.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000117c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nc43g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lizards -- Classification</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mosasauridae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lizards -- Evolution</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jf96x"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Architect-user communication process through the use of computers in multi-unit housing design</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Baharoon, Walid A.

Attempts have been made in several countries to include users in the design process of their units using different communication media including computers. However, today computers have been implemented primarily for the use of architects. This study aims at narrowing the architect-user communication gap by using computers in multi-unit housing design. The author reviews past work in user involvement in the design process through the use of computers and the possibility of introducing computers into the North American homebuilding Industry. Through an algorithm the author will demonstrate how the communication process can take place. Two simulations were conducted in order to test the proposed system in a realistic situation. The results of the study suggest that the user is able to make his own decisions, control his budget and satisfy his needs independently within a reasonable amount of time. These results could have further positive impact on the architect, user, building industry and the built environment.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gm00d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf96x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architectural practice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architectural design -- Data processing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture, Domestic -- Designs and plans -- Data processing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36tz778"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pathways, patterns and dynamics of dissolved organic carbon in a temperate forested swamp catchment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dalva, Moshe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Inputs of DOC in precipitation were low and increased with the passage of rainfall through different canopies. Throughfall, stemflow, leachates from A horizons and litterfall were identified as sources of DOC, while B and C horizons in upland areas provide a sink. Throughfall and stemflow displayed high temporal variability in DOC concentrations, while soil leachates and peat waters exhibited strong seasonal patterns. DOC concentrations in throughfall, stemflow and A horizons were highest in the predominantly coniferous site. In the fall, DOC concentrations from A horizons in the deciduous site were significantly higher than those from the coniferous site. Factors influencing DOC in peat waters are: (1) peat thermal regime, (2) water chemistry, and (3) water table position. Large storms ($&gt;$30 mm precipitation) appear to be the primary factor influencing exports of DOC in streamflow, particularly following dry antecedant soil moisture conditions. Slow rates of water movement through compact deep peats ($&gt;$60 cm depth) and adsorption of DOC in B and C horizons of this catchment obstruct exports of DOC, which over the 5.5 month study period, were minimal in comparison to inputs.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fx954.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz778</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Swamps -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Carbon content</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbon cycle (Biogeochemistry)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awd375x47b"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A theoretical analysis of the impact of privatization upon corrections in Canada from a critical perspective</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Johnston, Sarah Ann</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Privatization of federal correctional services in Canada is extensive. It has gained considerable momentum since the present Conservative government came into power in 1984. Privatization has allowed the government to cut costs, but has not addressed the underlying issue: the high rate of delinquency. The author argues that, in the future, correctional services will not be purely private, but neither will they be wholly public. Correctional services and the operational aspects of corrections will involve a mix of the public and private sectors. Privatization will have its largest impact on concrete auxiliary services of the Correctional Service of Canada; to a lesser degree it will have an impact upon all or most post-release programmes. However, privatization should not affect penitentiaries that are classified as medium security and higher.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz8060993.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375x47b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Privatization -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corrections -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Correctional institutions -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hg68c"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Spontaneous genetic instabilities in a chromosomally-located HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) gene in a transformed human cell line</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gupta, Kalpana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have studied spontaneous mutations in a chromosomally-located, single copy HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) gene in a human AK 143 TK$ sp-$ cell line.

By placing the issue of Hopkins' influence on Thomas within critical, historical, and literary contexts, this study explores the issue and demonstrates Hopkins' influence. Summary and assessment of previous critical work on the issue of Hopkins' influence establish the ways in which this study continues, diverges from or completes work done in the past. Evidence from biographical work on Thomas, as well as his letters and prose, outlines his contact with Hopkins' poems. A discussion of Thomas' Welsh background relates his experience of Wales and Welsh prosody to Hopkins' corresponding experiences. The literary context of the issue of Hopkins' influence on Thomas is established by means of a two-part foundation. First, the possible influence of W. B. Yeats, Wilfred Owen, Hart Crane, and James Joyce on Thomas is distinguished from Hopkins' influence. Second, specifically Hopkinsian areas of influence on Thomas are discussed. These areas of influence serve as a critical framework within which six Thomas poems dating from 1934 to 1951 are analyzed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qn169.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t041q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hopkins, Gerard Manley, 1844-1889 -- Influence</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thomas, Dylan, 1914-1953 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thomas, Dylan, 1914-1953 -- Knowledge -- Literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418p42t"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Integration of finite-state morphological models to top-down syntactic parsers in prolog</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Simard, Michel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Finite-state morphological models are formalisms for describing the set of valid word-forms of a natural language. Being well-suited for computer implementations, they have typically been used for creating systems that efficiently recognize and generate isolated word-forms. DCGs (Definite-clause Grammars) on the other hand, like many other syntactic formalisms closely connected with the programming language Prolog, are less suitable for describing morphological and orthographical phenomena (or phonological phenomena, in speech). This thesis describes a general method for combining the DCG syntactic formalism and a finite-state morphological model within a single Prolog implementation. The resulting system is a natural language processing environment that employs distinct formalisms for the descriptions of the syntax, morphology and orthography. The proposed method can readily be extended to other morphological models and syntactic formalisms (Metamorphosis Grammars, Extraposition Grammars). Modifications are discussed to improve the performance of the system, and a complete example illustrating the application of the proposed method is presented.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k6281.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418p42t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920fx97p"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The impact of computers in architectural practice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Laplante, Marc A.

Pressure exerted by clients and peers, as well as the promise of better design capabilities and faster design cycles, has fuelled the integration of CAD into architectural practice. This thesis investigates the implications of CAD acquisition and integration through an analysis of the changes experienced by firms which have acquired this technology. We will look at the effects of CAD on office organization, staff, drawings and models and the design process. We will examine CAD as a means of replacing and surpassing traditional methods of representation and documentation, and consider its impact on the managerial aspects of professional practice. Although this study is not exhaustive, it can serve the architect as a primer for a better understanding of the use of computers and their impact on architectural practice.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z901t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fx97p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architectural design -- Data processing</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
