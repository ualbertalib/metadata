A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pines, spruces, and firs constitute the presently most important conifers. Firs, members of the genus Abies have so far not been studied with respect to their hemicellulosic constituents. The present investigation is concerned with the isolation and detailed structure of the three main hemicelluloses in amabilis fir (Abies amabilis), namely an arabino-glucurono-xylan (7.0% of the wood), a galactoglucomannan (4.1 %), and a glucomannan (8.1). These polysaccharides were obtained by a series of fractional extractions and precipitaions with alkali from chlorite holocellulose. The techniques used for establishing their structure included the classical methylation method, partial acid hydrolysis and identification of oligosaccharide fragments, and oxidation with periodate. Molecular weights were determined osmometrically.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Timell, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g3659.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010t58v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
