The importance of this work can scarcely be overemphasized, since forages make up a large portion of the rations of cattle and sheep. A completely adequate method of evaluating forage feeding value has yet to be described. At present, forages are evaluated primarily according to their chemical composition and their content of total digestible nutrients (TDN). Criteria such as these are adequate when forages of equal acceptability to the animal are being evaluated. However, if forages are voluntarily consumed in different amounts by the animal, the percentage content of TDN, protein, calcium, etc., will not provide a true evaluation since the total intake of any one of these entities over a specific period of time will be unknown.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lloyd, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w349p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89db163</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nutrition</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
