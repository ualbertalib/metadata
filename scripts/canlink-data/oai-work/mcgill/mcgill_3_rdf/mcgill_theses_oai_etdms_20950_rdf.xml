It has been hypothesized that during slip flow in a die neither the wall shear stress nor the slip velocity is constant along the length of the die. For this reason, a slit die rheometer was developed to monitor directly the shear stress distribution of a molten polyethylene by means of two shear stress transducers mounted at different axial locations along the length of the slit. Previous transducers used at McGill do not perform well at high pressures. Therefore, a new disk-bar shear stress transducer was designed for use at high pressure. However, experimental evaluation of the slit die rheometer suggests that the large pressure gradient present in the slit affects the operation of this transducer. It is hypothesized that the pressure gradient across the active face of the shear stress transducer and the disk element impose a torque opposite to that of the applied shear stress on the active face. This pressure gradient effect was unanticipated because no shear stress transducer has ever been used in a pressure driven flow. Before the research on wall slip can proceed a new shear stress transducer that is unaffected by either high pressure or large pressure gradients must be developed. Possible ways of meeting this need are proposed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214q24r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vc60d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920fx88q"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Les pestilences du naturalisme : Zola descripteur des odeurs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sicotte, Geneviève</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The description of odour, frequent in Zola's work, has been little studied, most researchers having focused only on the visual description of this novelist. This dissertation, taking as its corpus Les Rougon-Macquart, explores this issue. The working hypothesis is that Zola reveals his impressionist tendencies in this type of description. The first chapter presents a brief history of the status of olfaction and description of odour in its philosophical, social as well as in literary context. The following chapter, after having defined a few concepts (notions from Hamon and Adam), presents the status of the description of odour in Zola's work. Four recurrent devices emerge: redundancy, multi-sensorial description, clausulae and turning points. The third chapter begins the study of the internal working of the description by examining the lexicon of odour. The lexicon of odour as used by Zola resorts mostly to the emotional and poetical functions of language. The final chapter continues the examination of modes of structuration, using Adam's notion of plan of text. The text concludes by maintaining that Zola's uniqueness is based on his marriage of impressionism and realism-naturalism.

During this reheating operation, hot steel surfaces react with the in-furnace oxidizing atmosphere resulting in the formation of an iron oxides layer (scale). The yield loss due to this phenomenon depends on furnace operating conditions, i.e. steel temperature, excess combustion air, steel residence time in the furnace, etc., and ranges between 1.5 to 3% of reheated steel. In this research, the oxidation of a mild steel during reheating cycles as function of furnace atmosphere, steel residence time in the furnace and steel temperature was investigated. It has been found that scale formation was most sensitive to oxygen levels in the furnace, steel residence time and temperature. A saving of up to 35% of steel lost to scale was achieved by reducing the excess air in the furnace from 70% to 20%. Also, longer residence time and higher temperatures of the steel in the furnace resulted in the formation of excessive amounts of scale.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311q38b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qn11x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35t963g"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Access to education for handicapped children in Thailand</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hanko, Johanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Thailand is one of the South East Asian countries undergoing major economical and social changes. On the verge of becoming industrialized, it has a literacy rate of 91% which is well above international standards. Yet, handicapped people have very limited educational opportunities. Less than 4% of handicapped children in Thailand have access to education. The purpose of this study is to determine specific needs of special education by comparing findings from agencies visited such as schools, foundations, government and non government organizations, with government policies. The educational system is studied and special education policies described. A look at implemented laws shows that the government recognizes its responsibility towards the handicapped; it is also pointed out that the major causes for handicaps are generally due to avoidable situations. Finally, special government projects are highlighted and suggestions are submitted for future developments.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4305894.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35t963g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education, Special</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education, Administration</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b5919491"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Deposition of clay particles in packed beds of pulp fibers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Al-Jabari, Maher</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The kinetics of deposition of clay particles in packed beds of pulp fibers is investigated theoretically and experimentally for different operating conditions that might be encountered in the industry. A theoretical model is developed to predict the clay concentration within and at the exit of the bed. The bed is modeled by the plug flow model together with Langmuir kinetics; the solution is integrated over the residence time distribution function which is specified by the mathematical solution of the axial dispersion plug flow model. A stimulus response experiment was performed to measure the real residence time distribution of the fluid in the bed using sucrose as inert tracer. The partial differential equations of the model were solved numerically using the Galerkin finite element method. The theoretical breakthrough curves predicted from the model are compared to those obtained from experiments to estimate the dimensionless parameters of the model. For fast and "ultrafast" deposition the deposition rates are in fair agreement with the theoretical values for deposition in beds of uniform cylinders.

James's detective novels within the historical and critical framework of the detective genre, and explores her particular contributions to it. James's awareness of the implications of a police investigation, coupled with her strikingly bleak and moralistic representation of our contemporary world are two of the main reasons she has achieved such widespread critical acclaim. Her novels also have a didactic dimension that ranges from an assertion of morally-correct modes of behaviour in an age without religion, to the constant reminder that, although they provide entertainment, murder mysteries must never be taken too lightly. These signature features of James's fiction have become more pronounced over the years, and reached their apotheosis in such novels as Death of an Expert Witness, A Taste for Death, and Devices and Desires. As a result, these texts are the principal analytic focus of this thesis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv9354126.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236315f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>James, P.

Currently, sulfiting agents are used to control melanosis in shrimp. However, with increasing regulatory and consumer concerns about the safety of sulphites as a method of melanosis control, the shrimp processing industry is actively seeking alternative methods to control melanosis on, and extend the shelf life of, fresh shrimp. One method which has the potential to fulfill both objectives is glucose oxidase (GOX)/glucose dipping solutions in conjunction with Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP). Preliminary studies have shown that black spot development can be controlled for 14 days at 4$ sp circ$C in white shrimp (Pandalus occidentalis) and pink shrimp (Pandalus borealis) using GOX/glucose or GOX/glucose/ascorbic acid in conjunction with gas packaging (60% CO$ sb2$: 40% N$ sb2$). This dipping/packaging treatment also improves the physical, chemical and microbiological changes in white shrimp compared to samples dipped only in water and air packaged. This study has shown that the combined use of two or more "barriers" can be used to extend the shelf life of, and control melanosis on, fresh shrimp. This novel process of "dipping" shrimp in GOX/glucose solutions in conjunction with MAP will have a significant effect in the area of shrimp hygiene and will have the potential to minimize shrimp spoilage incurred through melanosis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qt23x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w358d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Protective atmospheres</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shrimps -- Packaging</dc:subject><dc:subject>Melanosis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shrimps -- Spoilage</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw37638099"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Agronomic evaluation of short season quality protein maize</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Spaner, Dean Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The introduction of Quality Protein Maize (QPM), hard endosperm opaque-2 maize, into northern temperate maize growing areas is a desirable breeding objective. In topcrosses with opaque-2 testers, in diallel combination, as inbreds per se, and in inbred disease screening nurseries, some QPM lines performed better than or equal to the best local checks. In general, while agronomic potential is high for some lines and gains from selection are statistically possible, longer days to flowering intervals and higher levels of moisture at harvest than check hybrids indicated a need to improve adaptation for the locations studied. Methodology experiments indicated that detasselling of check hybrids is a suitable experimental method to facilitate the inclusion of normal endosperm local checks into QPM performance tests.

Damage to the dorsal striatum impaired acquisition of the win-stay task but not the win-shift or CCP. Damage to the lateral amygdala impaired acquisition of the CCP but not the win-shift or win-stay task. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the mammalian brain may be capable of acquiring different kinds of information with different, more-or-less independent neural systems. A neural system that includes the hippocampus may acquire information about the relationships among stimuli and events. A neural system that includes the dorsal striatum may mediate the formation of reinforced stimulus-response associations.

This thesis assesses the EEA within the historical context of discrimination remedies. The thesis argues that the solution to systemic discrimination in employment cannot consist merely of measures that increase the representation of minorities in the workplace. Rather, the solution must also include measures designed to change traditional attitudes and stereotypes about the employment of minority groups, whether these attitudes take the from of prejudice, paternalism, or inhibitions. A change in attitudes among employers will also help to eliminate apparently neutral employment policies and practices that nevertheless have an adverse effect on the opportunities of women and minorities. The EEA incorporates aspects of all three strategies in a hands-off approach that invites employers to become equal partners in the quest to overcome discrimination in the work place.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289k25p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xg17b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20st83j"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The evolving international regime of trade in financial services under the auspices of the GATT</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Weber, Christoph</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is designed to verify the potential for an efficient multilateral agreement on trade in financial services.

Spice is the de facto standard for circuit analysis programs. Its lack of clear definition leads to incompatibility between the programs that nominally can share files. Taking the early 2G6 dialect of Spice as its basic form, a Backus-Naur grammar of the language is developed from the informal published descriptions of the language. Since published descriptions are unclear, reference is made to the Berkeley Spice parser (the Fortran source code of this parser is available). Spice is in widespread use, but there is no formal definition of any of its 30-40 documented dialects and variations. Consequently, there are many ambiguities and contradictions at the lexical as well as syntactic levels. Major issues in this thesis include lexical disambiguation and precise syntactic definition. A parser is also developed concurrently with the language definition, using the LEX and YACC compiler writing tools. The long-term objective is to establish a reference standard against which deviations of the individual dialects can be measured, and to provide easily used translation tools for conversion between dialects.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hd32t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j919h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73px13f"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Numerical properties of the Euler operator in digital control</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Comeau, Raymond</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis compares the numerical performance of digital control laws implemented in the Z operator, z, and the Euler operator, $ epsilon$ = ${z-1 over T}$ where T is the sampling period, and provides some useful guidelines for estimating the conservative wordlength for relatively low order controllers which are implemented using floating point arithmetic. The relative merits of these two discrete-time operators are studied analytically with regard to coefficient representation and roundoff errors, which are two major sources of numerical error. It is shown in this thesis that the $ epsilon$ operator form has superior performance in the coefficient representation to the z operator form for the sampling rates often used in practice. It is also shown that control laws implemented in the $ epsilon$ operator provide superior performance in the introduction of roundoff errors and in the propagation of these errors through subsequent sampling instants than the z operator, at least for high sampling rates. Extensive numerical simulations are also performed to compare the $ epsilon$ and z forms to obtain useful rules of thumb for estimating the wordlength required by a controller based on the sampling rate and the dynamic characteristics of the controller.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f243h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73px13f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Operations Research</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hd333"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of the ʻUlamāʾ during the French rule of Egypt 1798-1801</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Burke, Jeffrey Charles</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This is a study of the role of the 'ulama' during the French occupation of Egypt: 1798-1801. Bonaparte penetrated Islamic Egypt, marking the beginnings of the modern era. The French military brilliance dominated the East-West confrontation. Napoleon's military victories were short-lived when prominent 'ulama', whom he thought had been wooed to his side, organized rebellions against him from Al-Azhar. Although his attempt to raise the status of the Egyptian 'ulama' to assist him in governing the people was successful, it was not enough to prevent his own hasty exodus from Egypt. The French left lasting cultural influences in Egypt: the latent concept of nationalism; and a systematic mode of study. But the French could not establish a long-lasting rule in Egypt due to outside military pressures and the fact that Egyptians looked to the 'ulama' as the true leaders of the people.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fj20f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hd333</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Egypt -- History -- French occupation, 1798-1801</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ulama -- Egypt</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644s700"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An introduction to dendritic growth with convection</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wu, Gang, 1962 June 18</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis I intend to summarize several theories dealing with dendritic growth with convection.

Despite recent advances in the understanding of the neurochemistry and neurocytology of this condition (1), effective therapy is not yet available. The purpose of this study is to examine the possible neurobehavioral effects of Somatostatin (SS) or its long acting analogue, Sandostatin$ sp{ circler}$ (SMS), when injected acutely or chronically in the intracranial subarachnoid space of sub-human primates. Acute infusion of SS or SMS as high as 50 mcg/kg did not produce any notable change in behaviour but, chronic infusions of SMS led to dramatic neurobehavioral changes such as: truncal ataxia, dysmetria, severe bradykinesia, and death occurring 24-36 hours following the initiation of infusion of 16 mcg/kg/day and at two weeks following the initiation of infusion of 4 mcg/kg/day. These effects could be reversed by apomorphine, a dopamine analogue. We conclude that the chronic intrathecal intracranial infusion of SMS can have marked toxic effects in such subhuman primates possibly through interference with dopaminic system.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784m89h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687j640</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956h11d"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The language of food in the fiction of Barbara Pym</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Collu, Gabrielle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Descriptions of food are very prominent in Barbara Pym's twelve novels. They are used on one hand for purely comic purposes. But more significantly, they evolve into a language with a structure and set of rules. To expose the language of food inherent in Pym's fiction, I have employed a combination of social history, structural anthropology and semiology. Roland Barthes' application of structural linguistics to food, and his concern with its' symbolic nature hold particular bearing to this study. The language of food functions on three interrelated levels in Pym: a social level where groups are defined and hierarchised; a gendered level where the sexes are defined and differentiated; and a more personal level where an individual either communes or alienates him/herself from a given group. Identity, whether national, social, sexual or individual, is confirmed in relation to eating habits and roles surrounding food preparation and consumption. With the help of complex strategies of irony, Pym uses the language of food to signal an interest in social and gender reform by presenting the artificiality of social constructs and gender stereotypes.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px150.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956h11d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pym, Barbara -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Food in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97kr64z"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Airway responsiveness to methacholine and airway smooth muscle in the guinea pig</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Opazo Saez, Anabelle M.

In summary: (1) the quantity of airway smooth muscle (ASM) does not appear to determine differences in maximal bronchoconstriction among normal guinea pigs; the lack of a correlation between responsiveness and amount of ASM may be explained by the heterogenous distribution of bronchoconstriction among the airways studied or the modality of challenge; (2) the sensitivity to MCh appears to be related to differences in the amount of ASM in intraparenchymal cartilaginous airways; (3) variability in the EC$ sb{50}$ may also reflect differences in airway cross-sectional area; (4) lung resistance appears to be a good measure of constriction since the morphometric measure of airway narrowing correlated well with resistance; (5) the heterogeneity of airway narrowing does not appear to be determined by differences in ASM.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kt963.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97kr64z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4m90dw649"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Epileptiform activity induced by low chloride medium in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampal slice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Drapeau, Christian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present thesis is a study of the low-Cl model of epileptogenesis in the rat hippocampal slice maintained "in vitro". Perfusion of the slices with low-Cl artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) induced short and long lasting stimulus-induced epileptiform bursts. The short lasting bursts (SB) represented a mixture of EPSP and inverted IPSP. The long lasting bursts (LB) were totally dependent on GABA-mediated chloride conductances and were probably generated by the sustained firing of interneurons synapsing on the soma of the pyramidal neurons. NMDA antagonist could block the late part of the LB, but not the SB nor the early part of the LB. However, when the intensity of the stimulation was increased, the late part of the LB reappeared. The present work demonstrates that the maintenance of the physiological chloride equilibrium is essential for the integrity of GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms, and that any physiopathological condition susceptible to alter the chloride equilibrium may induce epileptogenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf670.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dw649</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720d975"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Enhancement of interfacial adhesion in polymer blends of polypropylene and poly (ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hozhabr, Sassan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the present study a blend system containing polypropylene (PP) and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) was considered. Maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAH-g-PP) was used to improve adhesion at the interface. The preliminary work was conducted in a batch mixer and then extended to a single and a twin screw extruders. The results in the batch mixer demonstrated that blends containing high levels of MAH have well bonded morphology and impact strengths comparable to pure materials. Statistical analysis of the results showed that at processing temperature of 200$ sp circ$C and mixing time of 13 minutes, the highest impact strength and largest elongation at break were obtained. In the extruder the morphological studies revealed the presence of a layered structure in the core region of the samples when a slit die was employed. The oxygen permeability of extruded samples with EVOH content higher than 20vol% resembled multi-layer systems. Impact strength of extruded ribbons drastically improved by increasing the maleation level to 0.2wt% and precompounding the virgin resins in a twin screw extruder. Morphological observations however, revealed some disruption in the layered structure and consequently decline of oxygen barrier properties.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n9155.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720d975</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plastics Technology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
