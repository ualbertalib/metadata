The concept of investigating upper atmosphere physics using guns was proposed by Dr. G.V. Bull. The early history and technique is described in various references. Initially, the program concentrated on launching pure ballistic vehicles. It became apparent by the spring of 1963 that, with the available launching system, the pure ballistic vehicle had attained its maximum performance which was in the region of 120 kilometers. In order to achieve better performance, in terms of payload and apogee, it became necessary to investigate other concepts.

With the jet discharging at an angle and subsequently reattaching to the surface a separation bubble of low pressure was formed downstream of the slot which reduced the nose-up pitching moment about the guarter-chord point. The reattachment distances for this bubble have been successfully predicted by an extension of the Bourque-Newman theory for reattaching jets. The lift and moment coefficients before the stall were compared with Spence's jet flap theory which has been extended within the context of thin aerofoil theory, to include the effect of jet entrainment. It is predicted that the entrainment tends to increase the lift by increasing the effective camber of the aerofoil and the detailed agreement between this theory and experiment is good.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Molder, S.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Newman, B.

The designation, Dutch elm disease, should be avoided, according to Westenberg (1932), because it is misleading. The name elm disease is used in this work, following in this respect the nomenclature adopted in the Annual Report of the Quebec Society for the Protection of Plants (Pomerleau, 1961).

In particular, spectroscopy can be applied to reactions involving chemiluminescence in the visible and infrared regions. This thesis is concerned with two reactions of ozone. The first reaction, ozone with nitric oxide, forms an excited N02 molecule which is chemiluminescent. A study of the emission spectrum gives information, not only on the mechanisms involved, but also on the state of the excited species.

Two approaches to this investigation are made: comparative and deductive. The comparative method is possible because many studies have been made on temperate-zone populations of the species; modified behaviour observed in the present study are consequently viewed as probably adaptive to the different environmental conditions of the north.
