In the first experiment, subjects from both groups walked uphill at three different inclinations (5, 10 and 15º) while holding on to the handrails on the treadmill. The goal of this first experiment was to characterize changes in lower limb movements and muscle activity patterns required for up-slope walking. The results showed that the key mechanism when adapting to uphill walking in healthy subjects was to lift up the swinging limb by performing a simultaneous increase in hip and knee flexion of that limb. An increase in ankle dorsiflexion was also required to place the foot properly on the inclined surface. Modifications in lower limb movements were accompanied by progressive increases in the peak amplitude of electromyographic activity of lower limb muscles as the treadmill grade went steeper. The most important increase was observed in the plantarflexor muscles during push off. This increase in muscle activity was necessary to propel the body forward and upward and counteract the resistance due to gravity in uphill conditions. In SCI subjects, a similar trend of adaptation was found only at the hip during uphill walking. Furthermore, the majority of lower limb muscles, including ankle plantarflexors, showed very limited adaptation during uphill walking. The limited changes observed in lower limb movements and muscle activity suggest that SCI subjects have to used different strategies than healthy subjects to adapt to uphill walking. These strategies could involve movements from the trunk and pelvis to compensate for lower limb deficits. The second experiment specifically focused on the role of the trunk and pelvis in the strategies of adaptation to uphill and downhill treadmill walking in healthy and SCI subjects. Results from healthy subjects showed that walking on an inclined surface required modifications in trunk and pelvic vertical alignment in the sagittal plane. Uphill walking induced a progressive forward inclination of both trunk and pelvis whereas the opposite trend was found in downhill conditions. These modifications in trunk and pelvic alignment are necessary to counteract the effects of gravity on forward momentum at different slope conditions. In contrast to healthy subjects, SCI subjects with minor deficits in lower limb kinematic patterns showed a greater forward inclination of both trunk and pelvis during level and inclined walking, especially in downhill conditions where both segments were maintained at similar inclination as in level gait. SCI subjects with major deficits revealed analogous (but more pronounced) feature in trunk and pelvic orientation during walking. The whole group of subjects with SCI seemed to adopt this anterior posture to benefit from greater stability during level and inclined walking. Results from frontal and transverse plane motions revealed that compensatory movements from trunk and pelvis were performed only by subjects with SCI showing severe mobility dysfunctions. These compensatory movements were maintained similar across treadmill grades. Results from subjects with SCI and healthy subjects did not show any significant changes in trunk and pelvic total angular excursions in the three planes of motion when comparing level and inclined walking. This absence of changes suggests that lower limbs are mainly responsible for generating or absorbing more energy during uphill and downhill walking in these two groups of subjects.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barbeau, Hugues</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mh28b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zg21h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407z849"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of texture on the reliability of aluminum and copper interconnects</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lee, Kitae, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Texture in films develops during deposition processes and annealing of patterned wafers. Recent studies show that texture influences the performance and reliability of both aluminum and copper interconnects. To improve the current understanding of this matter, the influence of texture on reliability was studied. The influence of texture on electromigration and stress-induced failures in aluminum interconnects was studied since these are the most often responsible for failures observed in aluminum interconnects. Results obtained showed that a strong {111} texture in aluminum interconnects improves their median time-to-failure. The grain boundary character distribution and percentage of coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundaries, was quantified using orientation imaging microscopy. It was found that the median time-to-failure of specimens increased as the number of low angle and CSL boundaries increased. These boundaries are known to have low diffusivity. It was also demonstrated that while the investigated specimens had grains of comparable size, the grains of similar orientations were clustered in the specimens having the stronger {111} texture. This phenomenon contributed to the longer median time-to-failure of the interconnects by reducing the frequency of high angle grain boundaries. The experimental data obtained shows that the residual stress in films decreases as the intensity of the {111} texture increases. A model based on Monte-Carlo simulation of texture formation during the deposition of aluminum film was proposed to suggest the optimum conditions for a growth of a strong {111} texture component. A low deposition rate and a high mobility of atoms on the surface, which corresponds to a high substrate temperature, can strengthen {111} texture. Copper has been recently used as an interconnecting material because of its good electromigration resistance and low electrical resistivity. One of the major problems of copper as an interconnecting material is that it easily oxidizes at relatively low temperatures. The formation of oxide degrades the electrical and mechanical properties of copper interconnects. The influence of substrate texture on the oxidation kinetics was studied to suggest methods to reduce copper oxidation. Copper single crystals having (100), (110), (123), (314), (111) and (311) orientations were oxidized at 200ºC in air. Only the Cu2O phase was formed during oxidation. The oxidation of the (100) single crystal substrate was much faster than that of the others. This is attributed to a large number of fine oxide grains on the (100) crystal in the initial stages of oxidation. It is recommended that the {100} texture in copper interconnects should be avoided in order to reduce oxidation rate. A quantitative model was proposed to predict the oxidation kinetics of copper from the texture of the specimens. Reasonable agreement was obtained comparing the model predictions and the experimental results obtained from the test of oxidation of polycrystalline copper specimens. However, further improvement of the model can be done if more data from single crystal experiments are obtained.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Szpunar, J.

The process involves three steps: (1) modifying the particulate surface by metal coating, (2) forming a particulate porous compact; and (3) introducing metal into the channel network by vacuum infiltration. MMCs with different reinforcements, volume fractions, and sizes can be produced by this technique. Powders of alumina and silicon carbide were successfully coated with nickel and copper in preparation for infiltration with molten aluminum. Electroless Ni and Cu deposition was used since it enhances the wettability of the reinforcements for composite fabrication. While Cu deposits were polycrystalline, traces of phosphorous co-deposited from the electroless bath gave an amorphous Ni-P coating. The effect of metal coating on wetting behavior was evaluated at 800ºC on plain and metal-coated ceramic plates using a sessile drop technique. The metallic films eliminated the non-wetting behavior of the uncoated ceramics, leading to equilibrium contact angles in the order of 12º and below 58º for Ni and Cu coated ceramics, respectively. The spreading data indicated that local diffusion at the triple junction was the governing mechanism of the wetting process. Precipitation of intermetallic phases in the drop/ceramic interface delayed the formation of Al4C3. Infiltration with molten Al showed that the coated-particulates are suitable as reinforcing materials for fabricating MMCs, giving porosity-free components with a homogeneously distributed reinforcing phase. The coating promoted easy metal flow through the preform, compared to the non-infiltration behavior of the uncoated counterparts. Liquid state diffusion kinetics due to temperature dependent viscosity forces controlled the infiltration process. Microstructural analysis indicated the formation of intermetallic phases such as CuAl 2, in the case of Cu coating, and Ni2Al3 and NiAl 3 when Ni-coated powders were infiltrated. The overall Ni and Cu content increased from bottom to top of the samples due to dissolution of the metal film by the stream of liquid Al during infiltration. The strengths of the Al/Ni-SiC composites, measured by four-point bending, were 205 and 225 MPa for samples reinforced with 78 mum and 49 mum Ni-SiC, respectively. The mode of fracture was mainly controlled by SiC particle fracture.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>ew, Robin A.

Si3N4 is one of the most important ceramics used as structural material for high temperature applications. The practical use of advanced ceramics depends on the reliability of ceramic/metal joining techniques and the properties of the resulting interfaces. This work focuses on various aspects of diffusion bonding of Si3N4 to Ti as well as on the use of Ti-foil interlayer during the self-joining of Si3N4. Si3N4/Ti and Si3N 4/Ti-foil/Si3N4 combinations were diffusion joined by hot-uniaxial pressing and the microstructural characterization of the resulting interfaces was carried out by SEM, EPMA, and X-ray diffraction. Diffusion bonding was carried out at temperatures ranging from 1200 to 1500ºC using different holding times, pressures, and surface roughness of the joining materials. The results showed that Si3N4 could not be bonded to Ti at temperatures lower than 1400ºC, however successful joining at higher temperatures. Joining occurred by the formation of a reactive interface on the Ti side of the joint. At temperatures greater than 1330ºC, liquid formation occurred by the interaction of Ti with Si promoting bonding, as well as the high affinity of Ti for Si resulted in rapid interface formation of silicides, initially Ti5Si3. EPMA and X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of Ti5Si3, TiSi, and TiN at the interface. The surface roughness of the joining materials plays an important role since thicker interfaces were obtained for polished samples compared to as-ground samples. The interfaces grew in a parabolic fashion with the formation of various Ti-silicides (Ti5Si3 and TiSi) as well as Ti-nitride (TiN) at the interface. Evaluation of joint strengths as a function of the experimental parameters such as, joining temperature and time was obtained by four-point bending test performed on Si3N4/Ti/Si3N4 joints. Strong joints were produced at joining temperatures greater than 1450ºC with average bend strength of more than 100 MPa. The maximum joint strength was obtained in samples hot-pressed at 1500ºC and 120 minutes reaching a value of 147 MPa.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>ew, Robin A.

In the process, they often read characters in multi-ethnic American literatures as agents of resistance and counter-discourse. While it is valuable to recognize the subversive potential in these writings, it is equally important to expose their distinct, individual attributes. Accordingly, this dissertation explores the neglected double nature and "bi-cultural" presence of the subject in a branch of contemporary American literature that I designate as "emergent." Through its "re-accentuation" (Bakhtin) of sign systems, writers of emergent fiction strive not to simply reintonate already established cultural paradigms from either recent or ancient homelands but, instead, to engage an active and ongoing cultural exchange in the context of America as (new) homeland. Presenting the individual and social subject as hybrid, emergent writers examine its dynamic involvement in both private and public spheres. My close readings of this literature focus on the representation of self-other interrelationships. I introduce and situate my analysis with a theoretical overview of the subject in cross-cultural or "liminal" zones (Bhabha). I also consider the significance of "dialogism" (Bakhtin) in the multi-ethnic, often female, subject's experience of "estrangement" (Felski). My choice of both established and lesser-known of new writers, born (or raised) in the United States but of diverse ethnic backgrounds, includes Cristina Garcia (Hispanic), Louise Erdrich (Native), Julia Shigekuni (Japanese), Sandra Cisneros (Chicana), Askold Melnyczuk (Ukrainian), Charlotte Sherman (African), and Amy Tan (Chinese). Situating the individual and social subject at various crossroads---both physical and psychological---emergent writers examine the changing nature of self identity and social expression. Through their "border pedagogy" (Giroux), they traverse axiologic discourses and socio-cultural boundaries and attend to ensuing dialectical tensions between inner and outer worlds, and among peoples, cultures, and social hierarchies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Werd, William C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515p96c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pc11t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biculturalism</dc:subject><dc:subject>American literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ethnic groups in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117q58b"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An analysis of argument structure in expert and student persuasive writing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Crammond, Joanna G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigated differences among student writers at three grade levels (i.e., 6, 8, and 10), and between expert writers and students, in terms of (a) the extent to which argument structures were used in their persuasive texts, (b) the complexity of these argument structures (as measured by depth and elaboration), and (c) the use of general semantic structures and conjunctive ties to represent argument substructures. In addition, the study determined the predictive relationship between the holistic scores assigned to student texts and argument structure measures. To identify and analyze argument structure a model was developed that could account for the variability in structure observed across a range of persuasive writing situations. The model was a modified version of Toulmin's (1958) schematic, and its characteristics were defined using categories derived from a theory of semantic representation in discourse. Results of the structural analyses indicated that (a) argument was the predominant organizational structure for expert and student writers, (b) over 80% of students produced elaborated arguments involving some form of opposition, (c) experts produced more arguments and more complex arguments than students, and (d) expert texts contained relatively higher frequencies for warrants, countered rebuttals, and modals, and student use of these argument substructures increased with grade level. The general semantic and linguistic analyses revealed the following patterns particular to experts: (a) the use of identification types of claims, (b) an increased use of modals and decreased use of opinions as marks of argumentation, and (c) an infrequent use of causal conjunctions to mark data structures. Results of a forward stepwise regression analysis revealed that argument structure complexity accounted for 40% of the variance associated with quality ratings assigned to students' texts. Two other variables were significant predictors: number of supporting structures and number of opposing structures. The results were interpreted from a rhetorical perspective: the developmental and expertise-related patterns of performance associated with the use of particular argument substructures, and the representation of these substructures were seen as reflecting an awareness of and ability to manipulate one's audience---skills that are necessary to achieve the goals of persuasive discourse.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bracewell, Robert J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r9443.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117q58b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reasoning</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exposition (Rhetoric)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab2773x33t"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of the miniature seismic reflection (MSR) system for nondestructive evaluation of concrete shaft and tunnel linings by Afshin Sadri</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sadri, Afshin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nondestructive evaluation of the structural integrity of shaft and tunnel concrete linings is the focus of this thesis. A nondestructive testing system was assembled based on the principle of miniature seismic reflection (MSR). The MSR system consists of spherical tip impactors and a pair of vertical and tangential displacement transducers. Mechanical impact causes generation of stress P- and S-waves in the test object. The elastic waveforms undergo multiple reflections between the top and bottom of the testing layer. The surface displacements are captured by a vertical and tangential displacement transducer. The signals are transformed from time domain waveforms to frequency spectra. The vertical displacement transducer is sensitive to normal surface displacements and the highest amplitude peak on the computed frequency spectrum is related to the resonance of the P-wave between the top and the bottom layer. Similarly, the tangential displacement transducer is sensitive to the horizontal surface displacements, and the maximum peak value in the generated frequency spectrum corresponds to the resonance of the S-wave between the two layers of the testing object. Thus, knowing the thickness of the given layer, as well as the measured frequencies, allows P- and S-wave velocities to be calculated. Alternatively, if the thickness is unknown, the time-distance graph of the primary surface wave arrivals can be used to calculate the P-wave velocities and, subsequently, the thickness of the layer. The MSR response depends on the material properties of the testing object. The elastic wave velocities can be used to calculate directly the dynamic elastic properties of the test object. In this study, simulated fractures and steel reinforcement bars were detected and located using the reflected P-waves. In addition, the changes in elastic properties of various types of concrete mixes were monitored for a 28-day curing period.

Sodium di-(n-octyl) phosphinate was used both as a surfactant to form reverse micelles and as a precipitating agent to remove heavy metals from aqueous nitrate and chloride solutions. The heavy metals lead, cadmium, and zinc were precipitated from aqueous solutions with sodium di-(n-octyl) phosphinate (NaL) in the form of PbL 2(s), CdL2(s), and ZnL2(s). The mole ratio of NaL to lead in the feed was varied from 0.1 to 6.5, depending on the acidity of the feed. The effects of the feed pH, concentration of chloride, concentration of calcium, and of the chain length of the precipitating agent on the removal of lead, were investigated. Adding acid to the feed solution reduced the removal of lead as some of the phosphinate precipitated in the acid form as HL(s). The presence of chloride or calcium in the feed solution, up to mole ratios to lead of 250 and 2.75, respectively, had no effect on the removal of lead. The solubility of the precipitate PbL 2(s) was reduced by increasing the length of the alkyl group of the phosphinate. The removal of cadmium, zinc, and a mixture of lead, cadmium and zinc was investigated. Behavior similar to that of lead was observed. The selectivity of the precipitating agent for the three metals was in the order Zn &gt; Pb &gt; Cd. The precipitating agent was completely regenerated by adding NaOH to the precipitate, and then contacted with diethyl ether to extract the reagent. The lead was completely recovered from the PbL2(s). Pure lead-free precipitating agent, and an aqueous solution of lead at a concentration 100 times its concentration in the feed, were obtained. Using measured solubility products of the precipitates and literature values of the stability constants for the other expected reactions, the removal of metal, the loss of precipitating agent, and the equilibrium pH were predicted.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vera, J.

By extension, the study is also about explaining and predicting the direction of change. Put simply, the study postulates that political institutions will change in order to be congruent with the society. Change is analysed within the context of two federal structures, the Federal Republic of Germany and Belgium. During the same time period from 1949 to 1993, one transformed from a unitary state into a loose federation while the decentralised federation consolidated and became central. The puzzle which the research project deals with is about this change: Why did the institutions of 1949 fail to survive? The prevailing institutionalist logic in comparative politics would suggest that once in place, institutions would have socialised the political actors into the existing structure by providing veto points in such a way that institutions would have been reproduced over time, but this has not been the case. Furthermore, why has change come about in two opposing directions, centralising and decentralising, despite many common characteristics between the two cases? This study is based on a theory of congruence which argues that political institutions change in order to reflect underlying societal structures. More specifically, the argument is that political institutions in federal structures change to correspond to the ethno-linguistic make-up of the country. Accordingly, the unitary state of Belgium has changed its political institutions in order to accommodate the Flemings, Walloons and Bruxellois; while Federal Germany has centralised many issues despite explicit constitutional clauses against such changes. According to the theory of congruence, when confronted with an ethno-linguistic structure that does not match the political one, the political structure changes; not automatically, but through the pressure of public policy concerns pursued by political actors. The ethno-linguistic community is the primary collectivity for which public policy decisions are made. The choices available to political actors are constrained by the demarcations of this societal composition. Decision makers might disagree over the substance of the policies, but they share the choice of venue in the form of the ethnolinguistic 'nation'. In case of a discrepancy between the ethno-linguistic societal structure and the political structure, public policy concerns wold exert a pressure towards congruence by demarcating a social collectivity for which policies are made different from the one set up by the political institutions. Thus, if the 'nation' is bigger than the unit that marked off by political institutions, the tendency would be towards amalgamation with the other subunits of the 'nation' and centralisation. If, on the other hand, the 'nation' is smaller than the unit defined by the political institutions, there would be devolutionary pressures on the unitary institutions. The empirical research was carried out on two policy areas, education and mass media, through a paired comparison of Flanders and Wallonia in Belgium and Baden-Wurttemberg and North Rhine Westphalia in the Federal Republic of Germany.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Meadwell, Hudson</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Brawley, Mark R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720f475.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w6507</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Germany (West) -- Politics and government</dc:subject><dc:subject>Belgium -- Politics and government -- 1914-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Federal government -- Belgium</dc:subject><dc:subject>Federal government -- Germany, West</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asf268681j"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of basal forebrain neurons in the modulation of cortical activity : a physiological and anatomical examination</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Manns, Ian Douglas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The basal forebrain is essential for stimulating the cortical activation associated with waking and paradoxical sleep, yet it is also important for attenuating cortical activation and promoting SWS. Heterogeneous neuronal groups of this region, which include cortically projecting cholinergic, GABAergic and other noncholinergic/nonGABAergic possibly glutamatergic neurons, may mediate these different processes. In order to understand this differential modulation, the discharge profiles of the neuronal groups must be studied in association with cortical activity. Juxtacellular recording and labeling of neurons in the magnocellular preoptic area (MCPO) and substantia innominata (SI) of the basal forebrain with Neurobiotin (Nb) followed by immunohistochemical staining for neurotransmitter enzymes revealed the discharge properties of identified neurons during slow irregular electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and stimulation-induced cortical activation in urethane-anesthetized rats. Choline acetyltransferase immunopositive (ChAT+) neurons increased their average discharge rate with stimulation, and the majority shifted from an irregular tonic discharge during slow irregular EEG activity to a rhythmic burst discharge during activated and rhythmic EEG activity. In contrast, a minority of glutamic acid decarboxylase immunopositive (GAD+) neurons increased their average discharge rate, while the majority made up of specific subgroups decreased their average discharge rate in association with stimulation-induced cortical activation. Another group of neurons that discharged in rhythmic clusters during cortical activation was both ChAT and GAD immunonegative. The possibility that these were glutamatergic was investigated by immuno-staining for phosphate-activated-glutaminase (PAG), the synthetic enzyme for neurotransmitter glutamate. A parallel study determined that a significant proportion of cortically projecting basal forebrain neurons contained PAG. The rhythmically discharging ChAT and GAD immunonegative cells were PAG+. Their rhythmic discharge occurred at the same frequency as that of the cholinergic and GABAergic neurons and was simultaneously correlated with the activity of the olfactory bulb and that of other limbic neocortical regions. Together these findings indicate that cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, together with glutamatergic neurons function in a parallel manner to mediate cortical activation including rhythmic theta and high frequency gamma activity. Distinct subgroups of GABAergic neurons may be involved in dampening cortical activation and mediating the slow irregular cortical activity of slow wave sleep.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jones, Barbara E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hb373.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf268681j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rm99g"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular characterization of the OPMD gene product, poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fan, Xueping, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset disorder characterized by progressive eyelid drooping, swallowing difficulties, and proximal limb weakness. The autosomal dominant form of this disease is caused by the expansion of a polyalanine stretch from 10 to 12--17 alanines in the N-terminus of PABPN1. Mutated PABPN1 (mPABPN1) is able to induce the formation of filamentous intranuclear inclusions that are the pathological hallmark of OPMD. PABPN1 is predominantly localized to the nucleus, binds RNA poly(A) tail, forms oliogmers, and is involved in polyadenylation. In this study we first demonstrated that oligomerization of PABPN1 is mediated by two potential oligomerization domains (OD), while inactivating oligomerization of mPABPN1 by deletions of 6--8 residues in either of the ODs prevents intranuclear protein aggregation. Expression of mPABPN1 in COS-7 cells is associated with cell death, whereas preventing nuclear protein aggregation by inactivating oligomerization of mPABPN1 significantly reduces cell death. We then identified two PABPN1 interacting proteins, hnRNP A1 and A/B, using a yeast two-hybrid library screen. The interaction between PABPN1 and hnRNP A1 or A/B was confirmed by GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. When coexpressed with mPABPN1 in COS-7 cells, predominantly nuclear localized hnRNP A1 and A/B co-localize with mPABPN1 to the insoluble intranuclear aggregates. Patient studies showed that hnRNP A1 is sequestered in OPMD nuclear inclusions. We finally found a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in PABPN1 that is not homologous to any known NLSs. The 18 amino acids 289RGRVYRGRARATSWYSPY 306 in PABPN1 are necessary and sufficient for nuclear translocation. Attaching this sequence to cytoplasmic protein PKM2 completely re-localizes it to the nucleus.

In the brain, NO has been shown to possess various neurophysiological roles, including its involvement in cognitive functioning. NO can also be neurotoxic and has been implicated in neurodegenerative processes. The present thesis examined the effects of aging on the NO producing systems in the brain and the putative associations between NO, cognitive impairments, aging, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that neuronal NOS (nNOS) mRNA expression was significantly increased in aged rats, and that cognitively impaired aged rats showed higher nNOS mRNA expression than aged animals without cognitive deficits. Moreover, mRNA expression of heme oxygenase 2 (HO-2) also showed age-related changes. Western blotting experiments and NOS assays showed that cortical and hippocampal nNOS expressions and activities were decreased in aged animals. In a primary rat cortical mixed neuronal and glial culture model, amyloid (Abeta) peptide increased NO production by nNOS and inducible NOS (iNOS) significantly. Furthermore, NO was neurotoxic in this model, and specific iNOS inhibitors, a NO scavenger, as well as an antioxidant were able to prevent and reverse NO and peroxynitrite toxicity. Western blotting and NOS assay experiments on the brains of patients with AD revealed significant decline in hippocampal nNOS expression along with increased hippocampal and frontal cortical iNOS expressions, as well as the predominance of iNOS activity. Taken together, the studies presented here have indicated the existence of complex relationships between aging, cognitive impairments, and NOS. Moreover, iNOS could be a significant "intermediate" element in AD pathogenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gauthier, Serge</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Quirion, Remi</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dp01w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kj076</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asq87bw18k"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae endo-exonuclease NUDI gene expression and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition on homologous recombination in mammalian cells : potential application to gene targeting</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Semionov, Alexandre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In eukaryotes homologous recombination is the basis of such important biological events as meiotic recombination, generation of the antigen recognition molecule repertoire of the immune system and repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Homologous recombination between an exogenous DNA sequence and a chromosomal sequence is termed "gene targeting". In the future, gene therapy will predictably become the treatment of choice for a number of inherited and acquired genetic diseases. The main obstacle to the application of gene targeting to gene therapy is the low frequency of homologous recombination in mammalian somatic cells. The ability to specifically increase the frequency of homologous recombination in mammalian cells could make gene targeting applicable to gene therapy of hereditary genetic disorders and cancer. Here, we present the results of our studies in which we explored two approaches for transient increase of the frequency of homologous recombination in mammalian somatic cells: expression of the S. cerevisiae endo-exonuclease (EE) NUD1 gene, and inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) with 1,5-isoquinolinediol (ISQ). We have demonstrated that transient expression of NUD1 in HeLa cells increased the resistance of the latter to ionizing radiation and cis-platin, two agents known to cause DNA DSBs, whereas it had no effect on cells' resistance to DNA-methylating agents. We have also shown that transient expression of NUD1 enhanced the frequency of extrachromosomal homologous recombination in mouse Ltk-cells. These results provide additional evidence for the involvement of EEs in homologous recombination in mammalian cells. They also demonstrate that overexpression of EEs, such as Nud1p, can potentially be used as a means of selectively increasing the frequency of homologous recombination in mammalian cells without a concomitant increase in the frequency of illegitimate recombination. Our studies of PARP inhibition showed that treatment of cells with 0.622 mM ISQ results in an average 4.6-fold increase in the frequency of extrachromosomal homologous recombination in mouse Ltk-fibroblasts. We have also demonstrated that treatment of mouse Ltk-cells with ISQ leads to an increase of up to 8-fold in the absolute frequency of gene targeting of the stably integrated HSV tk gene. We believe that our results concerning the effect of ISQ on gene targeting may have potential application for the improvement of such technologies as the generation of genetic knock-outs and the ex vivo gene therapy. Our findings also appear to solve the conflict in the previously reported results that PARP inhibition stimulates chromosomal recombination but not extrachromosomal homologous recombination or gene targeting.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cournoyer, Denis</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Chow, Terry</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354g953.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bw18k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah128ng33m"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulation of apoptosis-induction in thymocytes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lesage, Sylvie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most T cells are produced in the thymus, where they proceed through several differentiation steps to shape the TCR repertoire. The first thymocyte subset to express a TCR complex is characterized by the expression of CD4 and CD8 co-receptors, CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. At this stage, the CD4+CD8+ thymocytes' fate relies on the affinity/avidity of their TCR towards self-peptide/MHC complexes. Indeed, elimination of thymocytes by apoptosis occurs in death by neglect, due to the absence of TCR-peptide/MHC interactions of sufficient affinity/avidity, and during negative selection, upon interactions of strong affinity/avidity. In contrast, weak affinity/avidity binding of TCR with its ligand would lead to positive selection followed by thymocyte maturation. This dissertation centers on understanding the factors involved in the elimination of thymocytes at the CD4+CD8+ stage of thymic differentiation, namely death by neglect and negative selection. Particularly, we address the role of CD45 in thymocyte deletion. Ligation of CD45 in the absence of TCR signaling has been shown to induce mature T cell death. Thus, we have evaluated the consequences of CD45 ligation on thymocytes in the absence of TCR triggering, and shown that it induces the death of thymocytes with rapid kinetics. Moreover, this non-necrotic form of cell death is independent of caspases and does not lead to DNA fragmentation. Based on these results, we propose a role for CD45 in the induction of death by neglect. Next, we have evaluated the contribution of factors involved in negative selection. In particular, the individual impact of TCR-ligand affinity, TCR-ligand density, and costimulation in the process of negative selection was studied, We found that, with ligands of physiological affinity, costimulation is required for the induction of negative selection. In addition, our results suggest that increasing TCR ligand density or costimulation does not always promote thymocyte deletion. Finally, we studied some aspects of the intracellular activation signaling pathways leading to thymocyte apoptosis. Specifically, caspase-3 was shown to participate in negative selection, and regulation of Nur77 activity on a physiological mammalian DNA response element was identified, In summary, this work contributes to understanding the regulation of the apoptosis-induction in developing thymocytes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hugo, Patrice</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526d98z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128ng33m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zj42d"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of multidrug resistance modulators on activity against Haemonchus contortus and pharmacokinetics of ivermectin and moxidectin in sheep</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Molento, Marcelo Beltrão</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Resistance to the avermectin/milbemycin class of anthelmintics in nematodes has become a serious problem worldwide due to their unrestricted usage. Resistance to these compounds is attributed to the over-expression of the transport protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp acts by pumping drug molecules out from the cell or organism, P-gp efflux activity can be blocked using multidrug resistance (MDR) modulators associated with chemotherapy to enhance their therapeutic effect. A series of experiments was undertaken to determine if the association of the anthelmintics, ivermectin (IVM) and moxidectin (MOX), and MDR modulators would increase the anthelmintics' efficacy against resistant parasites. Using an in vitro migration assay, IVM and MOX in the presence or absence of verapamil (VRP), CL347,099 and cyclosporin A (CyA) were used against IVM- and MOX-selected strains of H. contortus. The modulators alone had no effect on reducing the number of migrating larvae, IVM and MOX had a significant increase in efficacy of 52.7 and 58,3% respectively, when used in association with VRP, above that obtained with the anthelmintics alone. CL347,099 was also able to significantly increase the IVM and MOX efficacy by 24.2 and 38.9%, respectively. The effect of IVM and MOX in combination with VRP and CL347,099 was determined in jirds infected with selected strains of H. contortus. The combinations of VRP with either IVM or MOX significantly reduced worm counts of the selected strains compared with the untreated controls, whereas IVM or MOX alone did not. CL347,099 plus MOX combination was significantly more efficacious than moxidectin alone against the selected strains. To evaluate the effect of VRP on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the anthelmintics IVM and MOX, the drug combination was given to sheep.

Student classroom interactions were audio-taped and filmed during the course of the 199711998 school year. Ethnographic methods and a qualitative research approach were used for gathering, analyzing and interpreting the data. The questions that guided the study were: (1) how children solve problems and (2) what tools and symbols systems do they use. The purpose was to understand the problem-solving process better. The underlying assumptions were that: (1) most students can generate their own strategies and problem-solving theories; (2) many students can solve complex mathematical problems. The findings revealed that students generate problem-solving strategies and symbol systems that resemble the tools that they chose to use and their individual learning styles. Most students needed to talk about their proceedings and often used a personalized language form and nomenclatures that were uniquely creative as place holders for the more exact terminology, which replaced the invented language. The data also captured highly creative moments when the students experienced a heightened sense of awareness and sensibility while they explored their problem spaces. It was also evident that there is a transfer from the child's personal problem-solving style, choice of tools and creative symbol systems into his unique representation of the problem's solution. This transfer supports Vygotskian notions that language mediates thought and that social interaction mediates language.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Beer, Ann</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634551j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sx58j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Problem solving in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mathematics -- Study and teaching (Elementary)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0g354g96c"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulatory and aberrant phosphorylation of neuronal intermediate filament proteins</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Giasson, Benoit I.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures, treated concomitantly with low concentrations of okadaic acid that selectively inhibit protein phosphatase-2A, enhanced the disassembly of neuronal intermediate filaments (IFs). The latter disassembly correlated with phosphorylation of the peripherin head domain and a novel, identified PKA site, Ser-2, in the low molecular mass neurofilament (NF) subunit (NFL). On the other hand. insignificant levels of 32P were incorporated into alpha-internxin under control and experimental conditions that promote disassembly. These findings indicate that phosphorylation of the latter protein is not directly involved in the fragmentation of neuronal IFs Phosphopeptide mapping of the mid-size (NF) subunit (NFM) revealed that 32P-labelling of one of its many phosphopeptides is correlated with neuronal IF fragmentation. The expression and Triton X-100 (Triton) solubility of neuronal IF proteins were determined in the developing rat cerebral cortex. The level of expression of alpha-internexin was unchanged from embryonic day 15 (E15) to postnatal day 15 (P15), whereas expression of (NF) subunits increased during this time interval. NFL was largely insoluble in Triton from the time, P5, when there were sufficient amounts for its solubility to be assayed. There was a continual reduction in the Triton solubility of NFM and alpha-internexin during the E15-P15 developmental period. Similar expression patterns and Triton solubility profiles were obtained for neuronal IF proteins in cultured neurons from E15 cerebral cortex. These results suggest that alpha-internexin is expressed earlier than (NF) proteins to provide a more plastic network in the early developing brain. Correlative studies and direct, in vivo activation of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) were used to demonstrate that SAPKs are involved in aberrant phosphorylation of the perikaryal high molecular mass (NF) subunit (NFH). It was also shown that hyperphosphorylation of perikaryal NFH is a reversible process that does not involve p38 kinases or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). The use of defined peptide substrates indicated that SAPKgamma preferentially phosphorylates KSPXE motifs in NFH. SAPKgamma was shown to be located both in the cell body and neurites of cultured DRG neurons, suggesting that it is likely to be involved in the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins. Collectively, these findings strongly support the notion that activation of SAPKs causes the aberrant hyperphosphorylation of perikaryal NFH reported in many neurological diseases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mushynski, Walter E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/736666226.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354g96c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33rz34k"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of a cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase in Drosophila melanogaster</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Larochelle, Stéphane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Protein phosphorylation is now recognized to be one of the most important means of regulating protein activity. An approach was taken that was aimed at identifying new protein Serine/Threonine kinase genes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Three of the kinases identified were chosen for molecular characterization: a Map kinase-activated protein kinase-2 homolog (DmMAPKAPK-2); a novel female germline specific kinase ( loki); and the homolog of the vertebrate cdk7 genes (Dmcdk7). Among those, Dmcdk7 was chosen for in depth molecular and genetic characterization. Cdk7 has previously been shown in vertebrate systems to phosphorylate and activate many different Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) in vitro. However, conclusive evidence that Cdk7 could act as a Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) in vivo had remained elusive, and became even controversial. Adding to the controversy was the fact that in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, CAK activity is provided by the CAK1/Civ1 protein which is unrelated to Cdk7. It was therefore proposed that the CAK activity of Cdk7 may be an in vitro artefact. In an attempt to resolve this issue null and temperature sensitive mutations of the Dmcdk7 gene have been created. The results obtained using these mutant alleles of Dmcdk7 demonstrate that cdk7 is necessary for CAK activity in vivo in a multicellular organism. It is shown that cdk7 activity is required for the activation of both Cdc2/Cyclin A and Cdc2/Cyclin B complexes, and for cell division. In addition to validate the function of Cdk7 as a bona fide regulator of the cell cycle, these results suggest that there may be a fundamental difference in the way metazoans and budding yeast effect a key modification of Cdks. Phosphorylation events at different sites (including the T-loop) are also known to be involved in stabilizing the Cdk7/Cyclin H dimer in vitro, and have been shown to occur in vivo.

The magnitude and direction of the pressure-induced shift of the Raman-active nu(CO) and nu(CS) vibrational modes of (eta6-C6H 5CO2CH3)Cr(CO)3 and (eta6 -C6H5CO2CH3)Cr(CO) 2(CS) indicate an increase in the amount of pi-backbonding to the CO and CS ligands, under pressure, the increase being greater to the CO ligand than to the CS ligand. Wavenumber vs. pressure plots revealed a phase transition in both the tricarbonyl and thiocarbonyl complexes between 10--15 kbar. For CpCo(C64H4), discontinuities in the wavenumber vs. pressure plots at 10 kbar indicate a phase transition at this pressure, most likely involving rotation of the Cp ring. Insertion of the Co atom into the cage does not occur under compression; a shift to higher wavenumbers was observed for all the Raman and IR vibrational modes of CpCo(C64H4) and the parent fulleride, C 64H4. Phenyl ring rotation is thought to occur in ReH 7(dppe) under compression.

The new rheometer is capable of generating hydrostatic pressures of 68.9 MPa (10.000 psi) and 225°C. The sample is subjected to simple shear flow, and the resulting shear stress is measured locally using a shear stress transducer. This design eliminates the inhomogeneities in pressure and shear rate that occur in high-pressure capillary and slit rheometers. Preliminary testing and calibration were carried out using a linear low density polyethylene. Flow curves were generated at six pressures, ranging from atmospheric pressure to 68.9 MPa (10,000 psi), and the pressure coefficient of viscosity was determined. High shear rate experiments revealed that polyethylene slips cohesively over steel surfaces. Pressure dependent flow curves were also generated for an unfilled polyisobutylene using grooved "Mooney" plates to prevent slip. The viscosity was fitted to a Cross model. Visual experiments with smooth plates demonstrated that polyisobutylene slips over a broad range of shear stresses. TeflonTM, glass, and steel plates were then used to generate flow curves over eight decades of shear rate. These curves exhibit four distinct regions: a no slip zone, a dominant adhesive slip zone, an adhesive and cohesive zone, and a terminal dominant cohesive slip zone. High-pressure experiments revealed that the effect of pressure on cohesive slip scales with the pressure dependence of viscosity, while adhesive slip does not. The results shed some light on the flow behavior of polyisobutylene and demonstrate the usefulness of the new rheometer in determining the rheological and slip properties of rubbers and elastomers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dealy, J.

Liver vitamin A reserve was also found to be low in 41.0% of the children using the Modified Relative Dose Response (MRDR) and in about 85% of the children, the daily vitamin A intake was below the FAO/WHO basal requirement (&lt;250 RE/day). The second study found that in comparison with children with adequate vitamin A reserve (MRDR &lt; 0.06), those with low reserve (MRDR ≥ 0.06) had forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 48.8 ml (p = 0.006) lower when unadjusted, 23.1 ml (p = 0.04) when partially adjusted for age, gender and height and 14.1 ml (p = 0.20) when fully adjusted for demographic, general health, lung function and household related characteristics. The third study describes the results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of vitamin A supplementation on respiratory health as assessed by change in FEV1 at 4 months. The average change was 53.3 ml (n = 496) and 53.8 ml (n = 501) in the vitamin A and placebo groups respectively. After adjusting for baseline covariates, the difference between them was -3.6 ml (95%CI: -21.6, 14.4). In sub-analysis of the data, gender and vitamin A status subcategories were found to be effect modifiers. In conclusion, high dose vitamin A supplementation did not show an effect on change in FEV1 at 4 months in children aged 6--9 years with high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency. Sub-analysis findings suggest that the benefits to vitamin A intervention in the study setting can probably be achieved if the other nutritional deficiencies such as zinc are addressed. Moreover, the results also suggest that the effects of vitamin A supplementation on respiratory health status are complex and these need to be taken into account in future studies to assess the clinical and public health implications of vitamin A supplementation in this age group.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Johns, Timothy</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w651h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq183</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vitamin A deficiency in children -- Ethiopia -- Tigray Kifle Hāger</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pulmonary function tests -- Ethiopia -- Tigray Kifle Hāger</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pediatric respiratory diseases -- Ethiopia -- Tigray Kifle Hāger</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jg55w"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Empire, federalism and civil society : liberal nationalists in Scotland and Québec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kennedy, James, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis seeks to relate the forms of liberal nationalism, which emerged in Scotland and Quebec between 1899 and 1914, to the character of the institutions which governed. The substantive focus is on two liberal nationalist groupings: the Young Scots' Society and the more loosely grouped Ligue nationaliste canadienne. Their emergence is examined at three levels: imperial, federal and local civil society. The British Empire exerted an overarching influence on both Scotland and Quebec. Yet each enjoyed a very different relationship to the empire. Liberal nationalists responded differently to the same policies---the South African War, Tariff Reform and the Naval Question. The Young Scots invoked Liberal principles: freedom of speech, free trade and disarmament. The Nationalistes' response was nationalist: these were encroachments on Canadian sovereignty. Yet both groupings shared a liberal conception of empire, characterised by autonomy and decentralisation. Scotland and Quebec enjoyed a 'federal' relationship to their states (Britain/Canada). Deficiencies in these systems prompted different responses. The Young Scots campaigned in support of a Scottish Home Rule Parliament. The Nationalistes favoured a Canadian federation which was avowedly consociational, one which recognised Canadian duality. These were liberal measures of accommodating difference. Finally, Scotland and Quebec possessed distinctive civil societies. Yet they differed in the degree to which they were governed by liberal norms. In Scotland a liberal ethos was sustained by both the dominant Liberalism and Presbyterianism. However in Quebec the dominant Catholic church sought to preserve its hegemony over francophone society against Liberal challenges. Liberal nationalists not only reflected the distinct national character of their civil societies but also the degree to which those societies were governed by liberal norms. It was these configurations of institutions and norms which ensured that the nationalisms which emerged in Scotland and Quebec were liberal in character. Yet there were important differences: greater emphasis was placed on Liberalism in Scotland ("Liberal nationalists") while the emphasis was on Nationalism in Quebec ("liberal Nationalists"). The character of empire, federalism and civil society in Scotland and Quebec shaped the nationalisms that emerged between the Boer War and the First World War.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hall, John A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801ph99z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jg55w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Québec (Province) -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Scotland</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Scotland -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v466p"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Translational control by the mRNA 5' cap and 3'poly (A) tail interacting proteins</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khaleghpour, Kianoush</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An important aspect of the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression is the modulation of translation rates, which is most often controlled at the level of initiation. The interaction of proteins of the translational machinery with the mRNA cis-acting elements, governs mRNA translatability. Although both the 5' cap structure and 3' poly(A) tail act independently to stimulate translation, together they synergistically enhance translation. Therefore, an in-depth study of translation initiation would require examining the role of regulatory proteins acting on the 5' and 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA, and their influence on translation rates. A study of proteins interacting with the mRNA 5' UTR, reveals that translational homeostasis is induced by eIF4E through control of the 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase activities. In an eIF4E tetracycline inducible system, overexpression of eIF4E leads to dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase (but not Akt), with the extent of dephosphorylation proportional to the expression level of eIF4E. Therefore, a negative feedback loop is engendered by eIF4E expression that targets a downstream component of PI 3-kinase. The mechanisms of translational control imparted via the 3' UTR of the mRNA was studied by cloning a novel PABP interacting protein-2 (Paip2). Paip2 inhibited translation both in vivo and in vitro, in a dose dependent manner. The dual mechanism by which Paip2 inhibits the stimulatory role of PABP on translation is through (i) preventing the interaction of PABP with the poly(A) and disrupting the repeating structure of the poly(A) ribonucleoprotein structure and (ii) through direct competition with the translational co-activator Paip1 for PABP binding. BIACore data indicates that Paip2 binds PABP using a two site simple fit model. Consistent with this, two Paip2 molecules may be associated with one PABP molecule in vivo . Thus, the functional significance of interaction of Paip2 with PABP acting at the 3' UTR is a</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sonenberg, Nahum</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214q76h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v466p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m3466"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Experimental studies on the fate of diversity in heterogeneous environments</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kassen, Rees M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Environmental heterogeneity has often been suggested as a general explanation for patterns of diversity at scales ranging from individuals within populations to communities within landscapes. I evaluate this proposition using laboratory experiments with two microbial species, the unicellular chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the common bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. These experiments contrast the fate of diversity following selection in heterogeneous and homogeneous environments. Specifically, I show that (1) an individual's breadth of adaptation evolves to match the amount of environmental variation, specialists evolving in environments that remain constant through time and generalists evolving in environments that vary through time irrespective of the scale at which environmental variation occurs relative to the lifetime of an individual; (2) the maintenance of diversity in a spatially heterogeneous environment is context-dependent, diversity being more readily maintained when environmental conditions are very different and genotypes are widely divergent; (3) selection in heterogeneous environments represents a plausible mechanism for two well-known patterns of diversity at large spatial scales, namely that between species diversity and both productivity and disturbance. This thesis thus demonstrates that environmental heterogeneity is a plausible, and perhaps very general, factor responsible for the diversity of natural communities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bell, Graham</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jw30v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m3466</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Species diversity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ecological heterogeneity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii -- Variation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pseudomonas fluorescens -- Variation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p096875c"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Interaction of hepatitis B virus with cellular defense : mechanisms in relation to liver carcinogenesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Groisman, Iris Jaitovich</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major causes of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, its incidence is subject to variations: high incidence in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, intermediate in Mediterranean countries and the Middle East, and low in Western European countries and North America. While different etiological factors have been implicated in the development of HCC, infection with the hepatotropic viruses hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and exposure to liver carcinogens are the most frequently addressed as directly implicated in HCC development. Epidemiological studies indicate that infection with HBV and exposure to the cyclic mycotoxin Aflatoxin B1 constitute the major risk factors in some regions where the incidence of HCC is elevated. Strikingly, in areas were there is coexistent exposure to both these agents, the incidence of HCC is even higher. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that may lead to a concomitant effect of both HBV and Aflatoxin B1 in HCC development, I hypothesized that HBV may decrease cellular defense mechanisms such as detoxification of active metabolites and/or DNA repair processes increasing the likelihood of mutations. Detoxification of reactive compounds by phase II enzymes is an important cellular defense process involved in cell susceptibility to carcinogens. I have demonstrated that the activity of human Glutathione Transferase A1 (hGSTAl) enzyme is down-regulated in HBV infected cells. This data correlates with a decrease in protein and mRNA levels. I linked this inhibition---at least partially---to a transcriptional down-regulation of hGSTAl gene expression by the x protein of the HBV (HBx). Strikingly, Oltipraz (4-methyl-5-pyrazinyl-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione), which has been found to have cancer chemoprotective properties, overcomes the effect of HBx on the hGSTAl promoter in in-vitro experiments. This result adds new evidence for the importance of the use of Oltipraz as an HCC chemoprotective agent. I have demonstrated that the HBx is directly involved in the decrease of Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) activity. Although HBx direct interaction with the tumor suppressor protein p53 was postulated to lead to decreased DNA repair mechanisms, I have shown that this process occurs in both p53-proficient and p53-deficient cells. The results of my work provide evidence that HBx-induced NER inhibition is associated with down-regulation of the expression of the TFIIH factors XPB and XPD. The decreased expression of both genes is regulated by HBx at the transcriptional level. These results were observed in both p53-proficient and p53-deficient cell lines. Interestingly, HBx was found to be capable of transcriptional down-regulation while maintaining its transactivation capacity. In addition, liver tissue from transgenic mice for HBx show decreased levels of XPB and XPD corroborating the results obtained in vitro. Hence, the HBx protein seems to alter two cellular defense mechanisms that can increase susceptibility to liver carcinogenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alaoui-Jamali, Moulay A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67js86m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096875c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
