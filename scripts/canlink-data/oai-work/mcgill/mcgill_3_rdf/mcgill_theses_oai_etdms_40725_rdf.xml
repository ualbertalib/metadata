The normal variation in testis content of gonadotropin receptors was mapped out in relation to changes in (1) testis size, (2) testis responsiveness to LH stimulation and (3) mean serum concentration of LH, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone and prolactin (PRL). The increase in gonadotropin receptor numbers during testicular redevelopment was preceded by elevated serum concentrations of PRL and associated with increases in both the frequency of endogenous pulses of LH and the responsiveness of the testis to LH stimulation. When serum PRL concentrations displayed abnormal variations in relation to photoperiod, the normal patterns of change in testis LH receptors and responsiveness to LH stimulation were altered. To determine if the increase in gonadotropin receptors was due to increased frequency of LH pulses up regulating homologous receptors, rams were injected, in the nonbreeding season with small, frequent doses of LH. Testis responsiveness was greatly enhanced but occurred independently of changes in gonadotropin receptor numbers or their binding affinities. To determine if the seasonal rise in serum PRL concentration was influencing gonadotropin receptors, endogenous secretion was suppressed by treatment with 2-bromo-X-ergocryptine (CB154) prior to and during testicular redevelopment. This resulted in delayed testicular redevelopment and reduced numbers of testicular LH receptors. Reduced numbers of LH receptors was associated with reduced responsiveness of the testis to LH stimulation. These results support the hypothesis that the seasonal increase in serum PRL concentration initiates testicular redevelopment by increasing LH receptors. Increases in LH peak frequency enhance responsiveness but this occurs independently of changes in gonadotropin receptors.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773w398.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp152</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gonadotropin</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rams</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sheep -- Reproduction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Testis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246s773"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identified, sound-sensitive interneurons in the cricket : response properties, morphology, and relationships between structure and function</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Atkins, Gordon J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The responses and morphology of nine sound-sensitive interneurons are described in the cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus. Each of the neurons receives direction-specific input in the prothoracic ganglion, and each projects at least one interganglionic axon. Five of the neurons respond best to high frequencies ($&gt;$10 kHz); four are most sensitive to low frequencies (3-10 kHz). Responsiveness to model calling songs was examined in addition to testing sensitivity to wind and light. Anatomical observations reveal that seven of the neurons receive auditory input via polysynaptic pathways, and that at least five of the neurons have morphology consistent with them providing input to mesothoracic motor neurons which are involved in behavioral responses to sound. Correlations between structure, topographic organization, and spectral sensitivity were found. The structure of one previously identified, auditory neuron was examined and found to change during late post-embryonic life. This represents a novel developmental pattern.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r1730.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246s773</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neurons</dc:subject><dc:subject>Invertebrates -- Nervous system</dc:subject><dc:subject>Crickets</dc:subject><dc:subject>Insects -- Morphology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583xv78z"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cards, dice and lifestyles : gaming a guaranteed annual income</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Duder, Sydney</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A simulation game was designed to examine the impact of a guaranteed annual income (GAI). The sample of 158 player-objects included factory and clerical workers, high school dropouts, single mothers, and CEGEP and university social work students. To establish the validity of the game, the working and spending behaviour of players was compared with results reported for the New Jersey negative income tax experiment, and found to be similar in a number of respects. The game also simulated two features not present in the New Jersey experiment: (a) variable labour-market conditions, and (b) comparison of a partial, time-limited GAI with a permanent, universal plan. For players on a GAI, working hours were significantly lower when fellow-players were not on a GAI than when they were. Results suggest that work effort may be related to comparisions with a reference group on visible consumer goods.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nx78p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583xv78z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social sciences -- Simulation methods</dc:subject><dc:subject>Guaranteed annual income</dc:subject><dc:subject>Employment (Economic theory)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak35695274"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of the CAN1 gene and its product in S. cerevisiae</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ahmad, Margaret</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work describes the characterization of the CAN1 gene, thought to encode the arginine permease of yeast. I have identified the RNA transcript of this gene and obtained the DNA sequence, which specifies a highly hydrophobic protein with multiple potential membrane-spanning domains. I use a gene fusion approach to identify sequences within the CAN1 protein that can translocate adjacent sequences across the E.R. membrane in vitro and extend these observations by finding that the topology of E.R. insertion is conserved up to the plasma membrane in vivo. Using a series of CAN1 gene fusions to the secreted yeast killer toxin, I find that the pathway of membrane protein export to the cell surface need not be functionally distinct from that of secreted proteins. Finally, I describe a mutation in the CAN1 gene that leads to altered rates of lysine uptake and results in growth inhibition and rapid plasmid loss in the presence of lysine.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913q66n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k35695274</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mutation (Biology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetic epidemiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protein engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1n79h519n"><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Corrosion inhibition of mild steel in acid environment using heterocyclic compounds</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ali, Shakir A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present work represents an attempt to study the inhibition of corrosion of mild steel in acid media by seventeen furan derivatives, at 17 to 30 different inhibitor concentrations, from 0 up to 20 mMole per liter. One of the techniques used to correlate the inhibitive action of organic compounds is based on the Linear Free Energy Relationship (LFER). The relationship is used to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition, by studying the effects of physico-chemical characteristics of the inhibitor molecules, such as functional group, polar function electron density, steric effects, and (pi)-orbital character of the donating electrons on the corrosion inhibition of mild steel in acid solution. The results show that furfuryl alcohol, 2,5-furan dimethanol, and 2-furonitrile act as excellent inhibitors over the entire concentration range covered in this study, whereas the remaining investigated compounds exhibit substantial fluctuations in the inhibitive action with concentration. Frequent maxima and minima of inhibitive action have been observed. This behaviour can be explained on the basis of the different reaction mechanisms of the absorbed intermediate inhibitor complex at the metal surface. The results of the study suggest that the inhibitive action of ortho-substituted compounds is influenced by steric effect. Although LFER is a valuable tool for comparing inhibitive actions of various compounds, other criteria should be considered. These criterion or special effects include polymerization, (pi)-orbital electrondelocalization, and mesomeric effects. Such effects could cause a compound to act as a good inhibitor, irrespective of considerations relating to electron affinity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq32v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h519n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemical inhibitors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heterocyclic compounds</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel -- Corrosion</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
