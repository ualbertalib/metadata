Furthermore, the relationship between perceived and actual fitness was investigated, as well as the relationship between actual fitness and basic interviewing skills. The interviewing skills were eye contact, talk time, verbal following (topic change) and focus of subject verbalization. The study consists of two parts. The first part explored the viability of altering an individual's perception of personal physical fitness. Fifty-four subjects were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control condition. Experimental subjects received positive feedback related to their physical fitness during a bicycle ergometer test of actual fitness. Control subjects received only neutral feedback. Results indicated that positive feedback worked to successfully alter perception of fitness among experimental subjects. The second part of the study explored the effect of fitness perception on interviewing skill acquisition. Results indicated that increasing an individual's perception of personal fitness did not enhance skill acquisition. There was also no significant difference in skill acquisition among subjects with higher and lower levels of perceived fitness. It was further determined that no significant relationship existed between actual fitness and the acquisition of basic interviewing skills used in the study. Additionally, it was determined that although a significant relationship between perceived and actual fitness was evident for female subjects in the study, this relationship did not hold true for male subjects.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fh88w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117p70d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physical fitness</dc:subject><dc:subject>Interviewing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health attitudes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Counselor and client</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930bx96n"><ual:graduationDate>1986</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structural characterization and biological activities of the amino-terminal fragments of pro-opiomelanocortin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Seger, Monica Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of these studies was to examine in detail selected post-translational modifications of the biosynthetic derivatives of pro-opiomelanocortin (31K POMC) in the rat intermediate pituitary gland, and to study effects that these modifications have on biological activity. Partial processing of the N-terminal fragment of POMC (or 16K) resulted in three derivatives: 16K$ sb{1-49},$ 16K$ sb{50-74}$ and 16K$ sb{1-74}.$ Lys$ gamma sb3$MSH, i.e. 16K$ sb{50-74},$ was completely N-glycosylated at asparagine-65 (with 4 N-acetyl-glucosamine residues). All forms of 16K$ sb{1-74}$ contained N-linked sugars in the $ gamma$-MSH portion and most have O-linked carbohydrate structures at threonine-45 (with 2 N-acetyl-galactosamine residues). The remaining 16K$ sb{1-74}$ lacked O-linked sugars, and the 1 to 49 fragment was devoid of amino sugars. All N-terminal derivatives had the same disulfide bridge arrangement. These N-terminal peptides had no intrinsic corticotropic activities in a dispersed rat adrenal cell bioassay, but they had synergistic effects with ACTH. Nanomolar concentrations of Lys$ gamma sb3$MSH increased the steroidogenic response induced by ACTH. The O-glycosylated form of 16K$ sb{1-74}$ had greater potentiating actions which may be due to increased resistance to degradation. These findings suggest that the extent of O-glycosylation in the N-terminal fragment may direct proteolytic processing and enhance its biological activity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386k06q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bx96n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bq08m"><ual:graduationDate>1986</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evaluating intensity of physical therapy for children with cerebral palsy : problems and solutions in a clinical trial</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mayo, Nancy Elizabeth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Physical therapists recommend neurodevelopmental therapy (NDT) for cerebral palsy, but its effectiveness is unknown. A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to compare the effects, over six months, of intensive (weekly) NDT therapy and basic (monthly) NDT, on the motor development of young children with suspected cerebral palsy. The trial soon strayed from its plans, but it was continued in order to identify all problem areas, to allow refinement of the measurement system and to plan a "trial proper" with good internal validity. In this, statistical power had to be sacrificed; nevertheless, the average outcome for the 17 infants on the intensive regimen was substantially better than that for the 12 on the basic regimen, after adjusting for the child's age, term birth or not, and mother's education (the equivalent of a t-statistic with 24 df was 3.49; p =.0019).

Coyne described an interpersonal process in which the depressed person elicits a negative response from significant others that serves to maintain the depression. Depressed, test anxious, and normal female college students interacted with a close same-sex friend; the dependent variables included measures of mood, perceptions, and behavior. Subject pairs were given several self-report measures before and after a 15-minute interaction with their friend. This interaction was videotaped and coded for several verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Depressed subjects reported lower levels of perceived social support, less satisfaction with the friendship, and more negative perceptions of their friend than did nondepressed subjects. No differences were found between the three groups of friends on any of the self-report measures. As well, none of the verbal or nonverbal behaviors were found to differentiate subjects or friends.

cross-flow</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kuran, Sermet</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Over the past decade, theoretical investigations have revealed the possible existence of two distinct mechanisms, a fluid-damping controlled one requiring only a single degree-of-freedom system and a fluid-stiffness controlled one requiring two or more degree-of-freedom system, instrumental in causing fluidelastic instability of cylinder arrays subjected to fluid cross-flow. As yet, the existence of these mechanisms has not been verified experimentally, and some researchers tend to neglect one or the other of these mechanisms in their theoretical studies. In this thesis, with the objective of obtaining further insight into the nature of fluidelastic instability mechanisms, experimental and theoretical studies have been performed on a rotated square array with $P/d$ = 2.12. Previous theoretical and experimental studies on this array have established the fact that a single flexible cylinder, in an otherwise rigid array, is fluidelastically stable. However, multiple flexible cylinder dynamic (vibration) experiments undertaken in this study show that fluidelastic instability develops when the array incorporates three of more flexible cylinders. This result verifies the duality of the instability mechanisms and suggests that the cylinder motion in the present array is dominated by the fluid-stiffness controlled mechanism, rather than the fluid-damping controlled mechanism. Involved dynamic (vibration) experiments have been undertaken to elucidate the effect of various parameters such as, number of cylinders, cylinder position, cylinder mass, frequency detuning and fluidelastic coupling on the instability threshold of this array, in which the fluid-stiffness controlled mechanism prevails. It has been determined that varying mechanical damping has a small effect on the critical velocity, whereas, varying cylinder mass generates, relatively, large changes in the critical velocity. A "Connors type" instability equation, or versions of it, are shown not to be applicable in this array, mainly due to the strong dependence of the mass exponent on the actual value of the non-dimensional mass. Frequency detuning of adjacent cylinders is also shown to have a significant effect on the critical velocity. Further dynamic (vibration) experiments revealed the co-existence of dynamic and static instabilities within close proximity to each other. It was possible to switch from one type of instability to the other, by varying one, or more, of the mechanical properties of the flexible cylinders. Next, the time averaged fluid forces acting on static cylinders were measured as a function of monitored, and surrounding, cylinder displacements at different Reynold numbers, to attain a physical understanding of the flow pattern in the array. The results complemented and verified the various dynamic and static instability findings of the vibration (dynamic) experiments. Finally, the fluid forces were incorporated in a quasi-steady, multiple degree-of-freedom model for comparison with experimental results.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d7309.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289j823</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb397911m"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>In vitro mass rearing of the knapweed nematode, Subanguina dicridis and its use as a bioherbicide</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ou, Xiu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A culture system was established for mass rearing of the Russian knapweed nematode, Subanguina picridis (Kirjanova) Brzeski. This system consisted of two parts; a shoot culture system used as the host plant source for the nematode culture, and a monoxenic nematode culture system. The nematode developed and reproduced in this system. Galls were induced on the leaves, stems, and shoot tips of cultured Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens (L.) DC.) shoots. After 3 months in culture, the nematode number per petri dish increased from the initial 50 inoculated to 7,000-10,000, a 140 to 200 fold increase. This study represents the first time that an above-ground gall forming nematode has been propagated in vitro. It also represents a unique monoxenic nematode culture system to mass rear above-ground endoparasitic plant nematodes. Various factors, including tissue type, tissue age, medium, and temperature, which affect the formation and development of galls, were examined. The nematode failed to reproduce in callus tissues, and it could not develop beyond the 4th stage in excised root cultures. The optimum incubation conditions determined were: 60-80 $ mu$molm$ sp{-2}$s$ sp{-1}$ light intensity, 20 C temperature, and 4-8 mm for shoot length. The virulence of cultured nematodes was tested in the greenhouse on Russian knapweed seedlings and vegetative shoots from root segments. The results demonstrated the feasibility and application of this novel mass production system. Nematodes produced in this system were virulent and the growth rate of infested Russian knapweed were reduced.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z9030779.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397911m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Subanguina picridis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Russian knapweed -- Biological control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plant nematodes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Weeds -- Biological control</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wd50x"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular analysis of the multifunctional ferrichrome-iron receptor of Escherichia coli K-12</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Carmel, Gilles</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The ferrichrome-iron receptor of Escherichia coli K-12 encoded by the fhuA gene is a multifunctional outer membrane receptor required for the binding and uptake of ferrichrome and is the receptor for the bacteriophages T5, T1 $ phi$80, and UC-1 as well as for colicin M. The complete nucleotide sequence of the fhuA gene was determined from a 2,902-base-pair fragment of DNA. A single open reading frame was found which translated into a 747-amino acid polypeptide. A signal sequence of 33 amino acids was followed by a mature protein with a molecular weight of 78,992. To identify domains of the protein which are important for FhuA activities, libraries of insertion and deletion mutants were constructed. Export of the mutant FhuA proteins to the outer membrane and receptor functions of the mutant proteins were analyzed. All of the linker insertion mutant proteins and all but three of the deletion mutant FhuA proteins co-fractionated with the outer membrane. Five linker insertion proteins and most deletion proteins were susceptible to cleavage by endogenous proteolytic activity. Some of the mutant receptors conferred wild-type phenotypes: they demonstrated growth promotion by ferrichrome and the same efficiency of plating as that of wild-type FhuA; killing by colicin M was also unaffected. Several mutants were altered in their sensitivities to the lethal agents. The results designated selected regions of the FhuA protein for receptor functions and demonstrate the presence of both shared and unique ligand-responsive domains.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935381d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wd50x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gt43w"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cleavage of benzyl aryl ethers by chlorine</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fruteau de Laclos, Anne-Marie F.

Catalytic amounts of Cl$ sb2$ cleaved benzyl aryl ether bonds (OR=2-methoxy-4-methylphenoxy) before any ring chlorination occurred. Yields of cleavage decreased in the order: R$ sp prime$=H; R$ sp prime$=$-$CH$ sb2$-2-methoxyphenoxy; R$ sp prime$=$-$CH(CH$ sb2$OH)-2-methoxyphenoxy. These results support the concept that the delignification of wood pulp by chlorine results from benzyl aryl ether cleavage. The conditions of the reaction, as well as control reactions with hydrochloric acid, suggest that the cleavage is due to conventional acid hydrolysis induced by chlorine. The experimental evidence does not rule out another possible mechanism in which the cleavage is initiated by molecular chlorine. Benzyl ether links were generally stable in models of the benzyl alkyl type, whose primary reactions were ring chlorination. A large excess of chlorine caused side-chain displacement, hitherto considered the primary reaction in the solubilization of lignin.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z1605.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gt43w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g835h"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The dark mirror : American literary response to Russia, 1860-1917</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wilkinson, Myler, 1953-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an intercultural and intertextual study of the ways in which an American literary identity has emerged out of an intense imaginative and political dialogue with Russian culture. Early portions of this study trace the historical connections which have drawn American writers into the orbit of Russian literature and culture during the period, 1860-1917. A theoretical chapter attempts to explain the intensity of this dialogue on several related levels: the figural relationship between two literatures which constantly transform each other; the psychic experience of an otherness between individuals and cultures which leads to provisional patterns of literary identity; and the transformation of a purely literary dialogue into the realm of social praxis. The second half of the thesis examines the careers of three major American writers--Henry James, Willa Carter, and Sherwood Anderson--as each reads the figures of Russian literature against a native American tradition, and in the process incorporates this "other" literature into that tradition. A concluding chapter initiates a discussion of the ways in which literary influence is also bound up with the dialogue of politics and power.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qs878.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g835h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>American literature -- 19th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Russia -- In literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bm49h"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Analysis of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase genes from Tetrahymena thermophila and Saccharomyces cerevisiae</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Csank, Csilla J.

To this end, simulated trajectories and EMG patterns, generated with hypothetical central commands, were compared to empirical trajectories and EMG patterns. In general, the model was able to predict trajectories but was less successful in predicting EMG patterns. The results indicated that, in general, motions to both single- and double-step targets are generated by shifting the EP of the hand in a straight line towards the present target. Thus, a common control strategy underlying movements to single-step targets and trajectory modifications to double-step targets is proposed. Whereas the direction of shift of the EP is specified at the level of the hand, the rate of shift may be limited at the joint level.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kn96w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903079v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Movement, Psychology of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arm</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k5799"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of environmental heterogeneity in the evolution of life history strategies of the striped ground cricket</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bradford, Michael J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I examined the effect of heterogeneity in the thermal environment on the life history of the cricket Allonemobius fasciatus. Variation in the life cycle was the result of a mixture of phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation in phenology-related traits along a latitudinal cline in growing season. Females from a partially bivoltine population have a conditional life history because they can adjust the proportion of diapause eggs in accordance with the likelihood that a second generation will grow and reproduce before winter. The thermal environment is not variable enough to result in the evolution of a marked bet hedging response, as is predicted by theory. A quantitative genetic analysis of the diapause reaction norm revealed significant heritabilities as well as correlations with other traits that could be related to common physiological mechanisms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085k98v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k5799</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Crickets -- Evolution</dc:subject><dc:subject>Crickets -- Development</dc:subject><dc:subject>Temperature -- Physiological effect</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p800x"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>J.L.

Austin's analysis of truth and its accompanying analysis of sentence structure. This involves a discussion and refinement of Austin's notions of the demonstrative and descriptive conventions of language and of the demonstrative and descriptive devices of sentences. The main point of the thesis is that ordinary language must be treated as an historical phenomenon: one that has evolved its more complex features through a long series of variations upon a small number of rudimentary conventions and locutions. The utility of Austin's analysis is shown to lie in the description that it provides of the functions of these rudimentary conventions and locutions. The analysis is used to illuminate a number of problematic sentences and expressions of ordinary language, including identity sentences, definite descriptions, existential sentences, and conditionals.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w3107.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p800x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Truth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Austin, J.

In the model, the turbulence motions of the two distinct length scales are computed separately. The small-scale turbulence is treated as a background component locally in equilibrium while the large-scale turbulence is simulated using a second-order closure procedure. The development of the turbulent shear flows depends on the rate of energy transfer from the large-scale to the small-scale turbulence. Two mechanisms are identified to have a significant effect on the rate of this energy transfer. On one hand, the rate is reduced due to the confinement of the large-scale turbulence to two-dimensional motion, since the nonlinear energy cascade process is less efficient in two-dimensional turbulent motion. On the other hand, the rate is enhanced due to the work done by the large-scale turbulent motion against the friction forces. The energy transfer rate due to friction is derived in the model using a two-step averaging procedure, whereas the transfer rate due to nonlinear cascade process is determined using a model equation. The data from a number of experimental investigations of quasi-two-dimensional turbulent shear flows are analyzed. These data support the notion of the two-length-scale turbulence model, that (i) the maintenance of the turbulent motion depends on the transfer of energy from the large-scale turbulence to the small-scale turbulence, and (ii) the transfer rate is subjected to confinement and friction influences as specified in the model. Numerical computations are conducted using the two-length-scale model and a single-length-scale model. The results are compared with the experimental data. The two-length-scale model is superior in performance compared with the single-length-scale model, particularly in the intermediate region of the flow where both length scales of the turbule</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676w38r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fh895</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Applied Mechanics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jf60j"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of origin-enriched sequences from early-replicating human cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McAlear, Michael A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to research at the molecular level the mechanisms involved in the initiation of mammalian DNA replication. Human WI-38 cells were synchronized to the G1/S border by serum starvation and aphidicolin block. Cells were relased from arrest and followed as they progressed into S phase by microfluorometric analysis. Early replicating DNA was extruded from replication bubbles, purified from the high molecular weight parental DNA and cloned into the NruI site of pBR322. The recombinant plasmids were surveyed for properties previously associated with origins of replication. In a random sample of 10 human origin enriched sequences (hors) that were analyzed, 5 were capable of autonomous replication in a transient BrdU substitution assay. Two clones contained DNA fragments that migrate anomalously on acrylamide gels suggestive of bent DNA. One clone contained a weak DNA unwinding element as judged by sensitivity to the single strand specific enzyme mung bean nuclease. Primary sequence analyses of five of the hors clones (hors 98, 106, 112, 129 and 133) revealed that they were enriched for the AP2-A, NF-1 related and iron response consensus sequences. The replicating clones also contained potential cruciform structures within 50 bp of an A/T rich region. A DNA binding activity was identified in HeLa nuclear extracts that binds to a sub-fragment of one of the replicating clones (hors106) by bandshift assays and it was partially purified by DEAE and PC-11 column chromatography.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085k994.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf60j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45q976s"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An evaluation of the Canadian 200-mile fisheries zone : benefits,problems and constraints</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Parsons, L. S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis evaluates the impact of the Canadian 200-mile fisheries zone from biological, economic and social perspectives. The factors and events leading to the 200-mile zone are examined. The Canadian management regime post-extension is described. Canada derived significant benefits from the 200-mile zone including increased management authority over a vast area with major fish resources, the displacement of foreign fisheries, the development of Canadian fisheries in areas and for species not previously utilized by Canada, and the opportunity to rebuild overfished fish stocks. However, various problems and constraints have led to continued fisheries instability. These include: (1) Natural resource variability, (2) The common property nature of the resource and resultant overcapacity, (3) Fluctuations in market conditions, (4) Heavy dependence on the fisheries in isolated coastal communities, and (5) Recurrent conflict among competing users and conflicting objectives for fisheries management. Despite Canada's abundant marine fishery resources, various combinations of these factors have contributed to a recurrent boom-and-bust pattern in many marine fisheries. Extended jurisdiction did not provide a panacea for the problems of the fisheries sector. Continued periodic fluctuations in Canada's marine fisheries and demands for government assistance can be expected unless viable alternative economic opportunities can be developed in the coastal regions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634452m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45q976s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fishery management, International -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fishery law and legislation -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economic zones (Law of the sea) -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603qz252"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Against the grain : accommodation to conflict in labour-capital relations in Prairie agriculture, 1880-1930</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Danysk, Cecilia, 1945-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Between the 1880s and the Great Depression agriculture emerged and matured as the mainstay of the prairie economy. Farm workers were essential to the developing economy and society, but their place in the rural west was ambiguous. During the pioneering period, labour shortages and accessible land gave farm workers bargaining strength in the labour market and a niche in prairie society. A cooperative working relationship and a shared ideology resulted in a lack of overt conflict between labour and capital. But as lands were taken, farm workers faced more and more the necessity of remaining as wage labourers. Their position became institutionalized. The First World War highlighted the conflict that was fundamental to labour-capital relations, as farm workers and farmers alike bolstered their economic positions. Labour and capital entered the post-war decade recognizing the increasing divergence of their aims. Their relationship became more overtly conflictual. Throughout this transformation, farm workers used strategies to influence the shape and rate of change in the industry and to maintain significant control over their own working lives. They responded as members of the working class, as active agents in relationships with their employers and with capitalism.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494931b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603qz252</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agriculture -- Prairie Provinces</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prairie Provinces -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Industrial relations -- Prairie Provinces</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z1648"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Classics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La préhistoire de Khóstia</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Morin, Jacques, archiviste</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of the present dissertation is to present an analysis of the site of Khostia in South West Boiotia during prehistory. The material under consideration comes from two excavation campaigns and survey seasons. An analysis of the site and its territory is presented first (chapter 2): the site itself is limited to the summit of a kastron located on a spur of the Helikon at the head of a small coastal plain which it dominates; it is integrated within largely mountainous terrain suitable mostly for herding. The limited area covered by the territory as a whole suggests that the site was never more than a village. The analysis of the pottery (chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6) proves that the site was inhabited continuously from the Early Helladic period (starting probably within EHI) to the Mykenaian period (the most recent material dates from the earliest phase of LHIIIC), the site was abandoned thereafter. Complete pottery catalogues are integrated into the appropriate analytical chapters. An analysis of the frequency of the various types of ceramics (chapter 6) suggest that the population of the site reached its maximum density during Mykenaian times (LHIIIA-B). Finally (chapter 7) Khostia is considered within its regional context through an overview of the prehistoric occupation of the coastal area of South West Boiotia and of the communication axes linking it with its immediate neighbours.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s1002.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z1648</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chorsiai (Extinct city)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Voiōtia (Greece) -- Antiquities</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
