Cumulus clouds with tops above the freezing level often fail to precipitate. Theoretical studies show that snow trails could act as seeding agents for cumulus clouds, entrainment providing the mechanism whereby snow enters a cloud. Certain observed radar patterns suggest strongly that showers were produced in this manner. As a check, polar diagrams can be used to organize observations made on different bearings. Those constructed show showers occurring in regions of snow trails more frequently than elsewhere. This is further evidence that snow can act as a seeding agent in cumulus clouds.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bz41s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827g910</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hh251"><ual:graduationDate>1953</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of physical effort on mechanization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Deitcher, Samuel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Studies on the phenomenon of mechanization have demonstrated that under certain conditions, excessive effort rather than economy of effort is often characteristic of the organism’s adjustment to even relatively simple situations.

Probably the best example has been furnished by pituitary growth hormone, due perhaps to its multiple metabolic effects and complex mechanism of action. In the case of this hormone, man illustrates perfectly the species idiosyncrasy. The promising therapeutic values expected from experimental work in animals have not been obtained in human subjects.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mackenzie, K.
