(Giorgio Giovanni)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Novel heteroanthracycline antitumor drugs were designed based on structure activity relationship studies and known mechanisms of drug action. Their preparation required the development of a general synthetic approach. After extensive studies, three methodologies were developed for the general synthetic plan. The first method involved photoenolisation of 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde and SO$ sb2$ entrapment of the o-quinodimethane to give 4,7-dimethoxy-1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo(2,3-c) thiophene-2,2-dioxide. This compound served as a general intermediate towards the synthesis of several heteroanthracyclinones. It could be reduced to the oxathiin-2-oxide derivative which thermally extruded SO$ sb2$ to yield the o-quinodimethane. Reentrapment of this latter intermediate with various glyoxalates gave key isochroman derivatives. The second method is an improvement over the first. Isochromandiones with a C-1 hydroxyl functionality were prepared from oxidative demethylation of 1-hydroxyisochromans. These were obtained after acid hydrolysis of the coupling products between epoxides and the cuprate of 2,5-dimethoxy-6-methylbenzaldehydedioxane acetal. The third method involved a sequential cycloaddition routine with two o-quinodimethanes. By combining newly developed techniques with known methods, a general synthetic plan was developed. Consequently, the total synthesis of six tetracyclic structural hybrids of the naphthoquinone(2,3-c) pyranyl class of antibiotics was accomplished; along with the total synthesis of (R) and (S) 1-(4$ sp prime$-O-p-nitrobenzoyl-N-trifluoroacetyldaunosamine)-$ 1,3$-dihydrothioxantho(2,3-c) thiophene-2,2-dioxide, p-nitrobenzyl(5,12-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrothioxantho(2,3-c) and (3,2-c) pyran-3-yl)formate, and eight novel heteroanthracyclines with the 5,12-dioxo-2,3,5,12-tetrahydroanthraceno(2,3-c) pyranyl backbone. The diastereomeric mixture of (1$ sp prime$S, 1R, 3S) and (1$ sp prime$S, 1S, 3R) methyl(11-hydroxy-1-$(2 sp prime,3 sp prime,6 sp prime $-trideoxy-3-trifluoroacetamido-L-lyxohexopyranose)-$5,12 $-dioxo-3,4,5,12-tetrahydroanthraceno(2,3-c) pyran-3-yl) formate was found to possess equipotent antileukemic activity to doxorubicin with no cross resistance.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gt36g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cx02x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Pharmaceutical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj96021388"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Inferential reasoning during the psychodiagnostic assessment : attribution, hypothesis-testing strategies, and final inferences as a function of theoretical orientation, level of experience, and temporal order</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Goodin Waxman, Tina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Psychological problem representation, a complex task, is underpinned by clinicians' inferential processes, processes which are not immune to bias and logical error. Problem representation influenced by faulty reasoning can have deleterious effects on treatment planning and consequently on treatment outcome. Using a think-aloud procedure, 32 clinical and counselling psychologists examined a case file of the initial interview. The following three variables thought to contribute to clinicians' conceptualization of clients' problems were investigated: (1) theoretical orientation, (2) level of experience, and (3) temporal order of client information. The reasoning processes of psychodynamically-oriented and behaviourally-oriented clinicians were studied. The existence of expertise in psychotherapy was examined. Comparison of hypothesis generation among novices and experts was made. The impact of the temporal order of client information on the inferential processes of clinicians was also investigated. Subjects processed one of two versions of the case file. Levels of theoretical orientation, experience, and temporal order were compared in order to determine (1) whether clinicians posit significantly more dispositional hypotheses than contextual hypotheses, (2) whether initial hypotheses of a dispositional or contextual nature are confirmed or disconfirmed, and (3) whether initial hypotheses of a dispositional or contextual nature are retained or rejected. Based on absolute numbers, psychodynamicists posited more contextual inferences than behaviourists. Novices confirmed more dispositional inferences than experts. Clinicians rarely disconfirmed or rejected their initial hypotheses. Behaviourists retained more dispositional inferences than psychodynamicists. The order of the case material significantly affected the types of hypotheses generated and the hypothesis-testing strategies utilized.

The MT genes in this species are members of a small gene family composed of 7 to 10 copies per haploid genome. A genomic library was constructed and 81 clones containing MT sequences were isolated of which 8 were analyzed. The complete sequence of one clone (LpMT1) and the promoter region of 7 others was determined. LpMT1 encodes a primary transcript of 3042 bp composed of 4 exons which is processed into a mRNA of 605 bases. The promoter regions of all the genes analyzed are highly conserved and contain multiple copies of the metal responsive enhancer element consensus sequence. L. pictus eggs injected with MT promoter fused to a CAT reporter gene, and cultured to various stages of development, directed transcription in a metal inducible fashion. The promoters also direct transcription in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and in a human HeLa cell line. Deletion analysis indicates that the LpMT1 promoter requires regulatory elements other than the two metal responsive elements.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq44w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128b60s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Metallothionein</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lytechinus -- Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3t945r450"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Planar modelling for tall building structures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cruvellier, Mark R.

The organism was found to metabolize glucose via acetate- and succinate-producing pathways and a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle was absent. As compared with the oxygen-sufficient organism, oxygen-restricted H. parasuis synthesized higher amounts of high and low potential cytochromes c, exhibited higher activities of the enzymes of the succinate-producing pathway and excreted less acetate and more formate and succinate. The low potential cytochromes c were reduced by NADH and oxidized by fumarate and were situated on both sides of the HOQNO inhibition site of the low potential portion of the electron transport chain, but did not seem strictly required for the NADH:fumarate oxidoreductase activity. It is suggested that the low potential cytochromes c might act as an electron buffer permitting the regeneration of NAD under conditions of scarcity of the final electron acceptor.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k06988217.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nh761</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hemophilus -- Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oxygen -- Physiological effect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Swine -- Pathogens</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atd96k328n"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Towards a critical history of the 35mm still photographic camera in North America 1896-1980</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wollheim, Peter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study analyses certain aspects of the relationship between culture and technology by using the example of the 35mm still photographic camera. Methodologically, the study integrates two perspectives in communication theory, namely diffusion of innovation and cultural studies. The study consists of five segments. First, the need for technological innovation is defined in terms of developing social formations. Secondly, the history of photographic research and development is traced in terms of various models of industrial development, and in terms of the horizontal and vertical integration of manufacturing. The commercialization of the camera is treated in relation to the history of markets, and their disturbances by war and other political developments. Next, the study provides an analysis of specialty magazine advertising as it relates to the 35mm camera. Finally, the adoption and utilization of this new technology are discussed in terms of the competing interests of various social formations in modern society.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25x929x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k328n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>35mm cameras -- North America -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afx719n115"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Renewable Resources</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Age and stage based analysis of the population dynamics of beluga whales, Delphinapterus leucas, with particular reference to the northern Quebec population</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Doidge, D. W. (David William)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The vital rates of beluga, Delphinapterus leucas, harvested in northern Quebec are within the range reported by previous studies in Alaska and the Canadian and Soviet Arctic. Small sample size and inadequate estimates of survivorship rates prevent meaningful calculation of population growth rate. The pattern of changes in vital rates over the life cycle of beluga and analysis of errors associated with stage classification indicate that the demographic information in a 6 x 6 age-grouped Lefkovitch matrix is similar to that in a 38 x 38 age class Leslie matrix. A 3 stage, length-based model composed of newborns, juveniles and adults contains less demographic information than the larger matrices, but is superior to a juvenile/adult classification scheme. The 3 stage model applied to length frequency data from aerial photographic censuses should provide an alternate method of demographic analysis when harvests are small or absent. Colour is a poor criterion for stage classification. Sensitivity analysis of fecundity and survivorship indicates that survival of gray animals (older juveniles and early breeders) has the most influence on population growth rate. Changes in fecundity have little effect on growth rate. The high sensitivity of population growth rate to juvenile and early adult survival demonstrates that these estimates should be improved if more precise knowledge of beluga demography is required for management purposes. The age-length data used to evaluate errors associated with stage classification indicate that belugas in Hudson Bay are smaller than those elsewhere, but not to the large degree previously reported. Beluga in estuaries are represented by all size classes. Examination of the integumentary heat loss show beluga and narwhal, Monodon monoceros, to be equally insulated, but only belugas frequent warmer estuarine waters.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676w29s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719n115</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>White whale -- Hudson Bay</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap5547s14d"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Vascular capacitance and the control of venous return : effect of heat stress, baroreceptor stimulation, and neuropeptide Y</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Deschamps, Alain</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The role of capacitance vessels and blood flow distribution (BFD) in the control of venous return and cardiac output were examined. First, saline infusion during exercise in humans maintained plasma volume, reduced heart rate and core temperature, but did not change endurance time. Second, the vascular mechanics of the skin were studied in dogs. The skin has a large venous compliance (C$ sb{ rm v})$ and a long time constant of venous drainage $( tau sb{ rm v}),$ and may act as a blood reservoir during heat stress. A rise in core or skin temperature increases C$ sb{ rm v}$ and decreases venous resistance (R$ sb{ rm v}),$ but does not change $ tau sb{ rm v}.$ The last three studies were performed in dogs on circulatory bypass. The third study examined the mechanisms of increase in venous return during heat stress. Splanchnic (SPL) unstressed volume (V$ sb{ rm u})$ decreases with no change in R$ sb{ rm v},$ C$ sb{ rm v},$ $ tau sb{ rm v}$ or BFD during heat stress. This decrease in V$ sb{ rm u}$ is abolished by ganglionic blockade but not by $ alpha$ or $ beta$-receptor blockade. The fourth study looked at the effects of the baroreflex on capacitance vessels and BFD. A decreases in carotid sinus pressure from 200 to 50 mm Hg increases SPL blood flow and C$ sb{ rm v},$ and decreases SPL R$ sb{ rm v},$ $ tau sb{ rm v}$ and V$ sb{ rm u}.$ The decrease in V$ sb{ rm u}$ is abolished by ganglionic blockade, but is only partially reversed by $ alpha$-receptor blockade. The last study examined the effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on capacitance vessels and BFD. NPY decreases SPL V$ sb{ rm u}$ with no change in R$ sb{ rm v},$ C$ sb{ rm v},$ $ tau sb{ rm v}$ or BFD. Thus, NPY may play a role in the control of venous return.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x2060.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547s14d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0v838127z"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Russian and Slavic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Compilation in the art of Fazil' Iskander and as a key to Sandro iz Chegema</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Beraha, Laura</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Fazil' Iskander's Sandro iz Chegema, an eclectic compilation, reflects the diversity of its literary age. It compiles on the thematic, stylistic, and narrative levels, combining a surface conventionality with a potentially innovative disregard for the niceties of form. The first chapter retraces the piecemeal emergence of Sandro and the often contradictory critical response. The second focuses on the period's proclaimed goal of expanding into larger and ultimately epic forms. A compilative impulse based on recurrence and a quasi-oral tone is shown in the third to run throughout Iskander's work. Chapters Four and Five compare parallel cycles with Sandro to demonstrate the compartmentalization effect of aphorism and autobiographical reminiscence. The final chapter discusses the I-narrator's compilative position within and without the narrated world. This structural isomorphism, together with a vertical dynamics replacing the more familiar linear development, is considered to lend to Iskander's compilative method its own, open-ended unity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r47j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v838127z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Iskander, Fazilʹ.

Our model Hamiltonian is quite different from the Anderson tight-binding Hamiltonian which has been most commonly used in studies of electronic structure and properties of disordered systems. It is reminiscent of the Kronig-Penney model in that $ delta$-like atomic potentials are specified by a single parameter. Our model structures range from substitutional binary alloys to topologically disordered "glasses", and include systems where the disorder is caused by random small displacements of atoms from their crystalline lattice positions. We test the universal nature of conductance fluctuations for the model with substitutional disorder. We study systems which are always larger than the elastic mean free path, but not always smaller than the localization length of the electron wavefunctions. In those systems where universality is expected, we confirm the ergodic theorem of Lee and Stone and observe the universal amplitudes of the fluctuations both in two-dimensional systems with and without a magnetic field, and in quasi-one-dimensional geometry. We have also performed the first studies of conductance fluctuations in strongly disordered systems and observed a universal relationship between the amplitude of the fluctuations and the value of the conductance itself: this relationship does not depend upon the nature of the disorder.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f189x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296wz765</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Electricity and Magnetism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zp09x"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Entomology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A phylogenetic study and taxonomic revision of the tribe Phisidini (Grylloptera:Tettigonioidea)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jin, Xing-Bao</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A thorough taxonomic revision of the tribe Phisidini is completed.
