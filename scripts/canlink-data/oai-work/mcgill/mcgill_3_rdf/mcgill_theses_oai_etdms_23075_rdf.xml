These traditions are investigated through an exhaustive analysis of Rabbinic exegesis of Deuteronomy 32:47. The Rabbis interpreted the initial clause of this verse ("for it is no empty thing for you") as referring to midrash and employed the verse to support a wide range of assertions about midrashic procedures. The techniques validated by the verse are interpretation of particles according to the hermeneutical principle of limitation and extension and narrative expansions that embellish biblical events. The idea of the Sinaitic authority of Rabbinic teachings is another aspect of midrash that finds expression through exegesis of Deuteronomy 32:47. Finally, the verse occurs in association with the concept of reward for derash. A study of the motives and attitudes that lay behind Rabbinic teachings will contribute to our understanding of midrashic literature.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722h995s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns064701g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Midrash in rabbinical literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Midrash</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hq84b"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Meaning and the built environment : an ethnographic approach to architectural programming</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bertrand, Raymond, docteur en droit</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The importance of programming the built environment is increasingly recognized, mostly because of the growing complexity of architecture.

Following ACTH administration, PGF2$ alpha$ concentrations in FF tended to be lower than in controls. Injections of betamethasone partially suppressed the preovulatory rise of PGF2$ alpha$ in FF at 40h, although the effect was less marked than that produced by indomethacin. While no ovulations occurred in the indomethacin-treated group at any time, betamethasone resulted in a lower number of ovulated follicles at 44h than in the control animals. Progesterone concentrations were unaffected by the treatments. In vitro studies were conducted with a spontaneously established cell line developed through continuous culturing of primary granulosa cells collected from prepuberal gilts six hours after they had received PMSG. Characterization of these cells revealed that aromatase and steroidogenesis were functional but gonadotropin receptors were not present. When extracellular PGF2$ alpha$ levels were measured, dexamethasone was able to significantly suppress PGF$ sb{2 alpha}$ concentrations, but not as effectively as with indomethacin.

In the linear theory, the normal mode approach is used where we introduce a small wavelike perturbation to the mean parallel flow to obtain the Rayleigh-Kuo equation. Together with its boundary conditions, this equation is solved as an eigenvalue problem. As a result, new linear unstable sinuous modes are obtained within the narrow region bounded by two known neutral modes. We also locate a sinuous neutral mode which is singular and radiating, near the stability limit of $ beta=-2$. An integral part of the thesis involves the application of the weakly nonlinear theory. The temporal evolution of the perturbation amplitude about the varicose neutral mode is studied by means of the Landau equation. Consequently, the value of the Landau constant is deduced which indicates a frequency reduction to the linear perturbation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644s66d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d769h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Fluid and Plasma</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62f9507"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An on-line measurement of residence time distribution in a twin-screw extruder</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chen, Dong</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The importance of the residence time distribution (RTD) in polymer extrusion has been recognized for along time, however, it is very difficult to measure.

A He-Ne laser beam was the light source, and carbon black was the tracer and detection was performed by a photomultiplier. The RTD of a ZSK-30 twin-screw extruder was measured with and without an in-line rheometer installed. Various operating conditions were used to examine their effects on the RTD curve. It was found that the mean residence time of the system decreased linearly with screw speed and exponentially with the feed rate. The temperature effect was minuscule. The in-line rheometer increased the mean residence time of the system by 80%.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hd308.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f9507</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abz60cx567"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Design considerations of a planar cross channel optical demultiplexer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chen, Jian-yao</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, several simple and accurate techniques applicable to the analyses of diffused slab and channel optical waveguide are discussed.

(Canada thistle) is a persistent perennial pasture weed in Eastern Canada. Single control measures such as cultural, chemical, and biological methods are not effective in long term reduction of the weed population. The objectives of this research project were to evaluate the efficacy of various traditional control methods and to attempt to integrate them. The effectiveness of Urophora cardui L. as a biological control agent is limited due to a lack of synchrony between the agent and the weed. This can be improved through integration with herbicides or mowing in time or space. Other biological control agents such as Orellia ruficauda Fab., Cassida rubiginosa Muell., and Puccinia punctiformis (Str.) Rhol. resulted in limited suppression of the weed population. Mowing was not effective in sustaining weed reductions for longer than one year. Application of clopyralid or 2,4-D/dicamba effectively reduced the weed population. The application of 3.37 kg a.i. ha$ sp{-1}$ 2,4-D/dicamba or 0.3 kg a.i. ha$ sp{-1}$ clopyralid with the spring and summer mowings were the most effective mowing/herbicide combinations over the two-year period.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn009z93f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z894m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pastures -- Weed control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada thistle -- Integrated control</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603qz61x"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Human Communication Disorders</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evidence of syntactic rule use in the language of severely physically impaired adults</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sutton, Ann Elizabeth Colquhoun</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The development of language in physically handicapped individuals using augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems has not been described. Therefore our understanding of the role of AAC language encoding limitations in the development of syntax is limited. This study examined adult AAC system users' knowledge of an English grammatical process which cannot be encoded in lexically based AAC systems. Because it is not possible to mark past tense with affixation in Blissymbolics, a meaning based graphic communication system, past and future tense are neutralized syntactically. The subjects, two congenitally physically handicapped adults with normal hearing, vision, and intelligence, accessed their Blissymbol displays using four-digit eyegaze number codes. The subjects were shown a novel mechanism to enable use of affixation through manipulation of the four-digit codes. Results indicate that the subjects had developed knowledge of this grammatical rule despite the encoding limitations of their AAC systems. Clinical implications are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x79s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603qz61x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Language, General</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Speech Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apr76f4587"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies at the HEXA locus : Chinese mutations and a search for polymorphisms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Akalin, Nur</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis describes a search for DNA polymorphisms at the HEXA locus as well as the characterization of three Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) mutations in the Chinese population. No polymorphisms were detected in the HEXA gene by three different methods: (1) Southern blotting; (2) PCR amplification and restriction enzyme digestion of intronic sequences; (3) single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of introns. The apparent deficiency of accessible polymorphisms is a handicap in studying the origin, distribution, and frequency of mutant HEXA alleles in human populations. I have characterized five of six infantile TSD alleles segregating in three unrelated Chinese families in which there is no known consanguinity. Two of the mutations described are novel, the third is a transition previously reported in an Italian patient (Nakano et al, 1988). The two novel mutations occur in homozygous form in the affected individuals investigated. They are: (1) an insertion of an A at nucleotide 547 (Family 1) and (2) a T1453C transition (Family 2).

A scaling symmetry of the four-dimensional field T that represents the breathing mode on of internal manifold is introduced. This symmetry, being valid at each order in both perturbative series of the theory (string-loop and sigma model expansions), is used to find restrictions on the terms that can correct the truncated supersymmetric functions entering the effective action. We derive the general form of these corrections and show that, contrary to earlier conjectures in the literature, loops are not a priori counted by the ratio T/S, in which T and S represents the standard four-dimensional breathing mode and dilaton fields. Some other symmetry considerations allow us to restrict even more the corrections to the truncated results. Our conclusions are extended to the cases with matter fields, and more than one moduli for the internal manifold. Some regularization techniques for problems related to those encountered in the quantization of string theories are also presented in an appendix.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r416q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042v023</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xj807"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evaluation of whole soybeans in swine diets</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gotterbarm, Götz</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A laboratory assessment and three in vivo trials were conducted to measure the nutritive value of whole soybeans subjected to various methods of heat treatment. No significant differences were found for ADG and feed conversion ratio. There was a significant reduced proportion of saturated-to unsaturated fatty acids in the loin eye area of pigs fed whole soybean products, when compared to soybean meal control. Extruded whole soybeans resulted in a lower degree of unsaturation than the other heat treated whole soybeans. Whole soybean products were evaluated for their digestibility in weanling (21 days) piglets. Feces were collected daily during two 5-day periods. It was found that the ether extractable portion of extruded whole soybeans has a higher digestibility than that of the remaining four soybean treatments. It was also found that CP is more digestible in animals at 6 weeks of age than in animals at 4 weeks of age. In conclusion: heat treated whole soybeans do not adversly affect the performance of weaners nor that of growing and finishing pigs, even at high dietary levels (25%). Feeding whole soybeans results in a higher degree of unsaturation in the carcass. The EE fraction of extruded whole soybeans is more digestible than whole soybeans of other heat treatments.

The apparent affinity for Na$ sp+$, the Na$ sp+{:}$Pi stoichiometry, the response to membrane potential and the response to external pH are similar in BBMV from both normals and mutants. The Ki for phosphonoformic acid (PFA) inhibition of Na$ sp+$-Pi cotransport is lower in BBMV prepared from Hyp mice when compared to normal mice but not different in BBMV from Pi-deprived mice which are characterized by an increase in Vmax of the high affinity Na$ sp+$-Pi cotransport system.

A mutant virus had previously been constructed. Results did not reveal any termination of transcription just upstream of the late promoter in the mutant A3-ins 5 when compared to the wild type A3 strain of polyomavirus. The effect of time of in vitro elongation on results is shown. RNA polymerases may traverse the entire genome and terminate shortly downstream of the late promoter, or termination in the region upstream of the late promoter is being masked. Alternatively, certain second termination signal(s) could be missing on the A3-ins 5 DNA leading to inefficient termination in spite of efficient cleavage and polyadenylation of the transcript. The extent of premature termination downstream of the late promoter of polyomavirus was also studied. In vitro run-on experiments revealed that with increasing distance from the late promoter the density of RNA polymerase gradually decreased. The level of premature termination at the late promoter is not dependent on the presence of either a functional large T ag or an efficient polyadenylation signal.

Calorimeters, however, do not provide information on the nature of particles and their multiplicity. Particle identification is important to understand the expansion phase of the hot nuclear matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In the present 814 experiment the charged particle multiplicity is measured at forward angles only, by a Si pad detector. The addition of a similar Si detector in the target rapidity region, overlapping the Target Calorimeter, is being considered. Initial calculations have shown a possibility of particle identification by using the signals from a silicon detector and from the highly segmented Target Calorimeter. In this thesis, the potential for particle identification of an upgraded silicon multiplicity detector at target rapidity is evaluated using a silicon surface barrier detector and part of the Target Calorimeter. The measured response is compared to the predictions of the event generator HIJET followed by complete tracking using the code GEANT.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193b11g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns0647031</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bc79v"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An analysis of the critical discourse on the work of Eva Hesse</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Millard, Michèle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an analytical study of the various critical approaches taken to the work of Eva Hesse and their underlying methodologies and theoretical assumptions. Its purpose is to determine in a general way how and why the nature of criticism has changed from positions strongly influenced by Modernism as defined by Clement Greenberg to those that involved a separation of criticism from consideration of artworks as individual phenomena. For the most part, Chapter One concerns critics' Modernist analyses of Hesse's relationship to Minimalism and their progression towards a criticism based on non-formalist, non-hierarchical theories of style. There is also a short discussion on the linkage created between Hesse's art and specific psychological traumas in her life. Included as well is an explanation of the changing conception of originality and the critic's dilemma in confronting private content through the strictures of public dialogue. Chapter Two investigates critical discussions of experience, how art was apprehended and how meaning was transmitted. Chapter III involves a feminist debate on the issues of gender. The content of Hesse's work was analyzed in psycho-biographical terms and within the framework of her identity as a female artist in western culture. And finally, the thesis concludes by pointing out the evolution of criticism into a distinct, independent discipline whereby the critic articulates the theoretical contexts in which the artwork exists, but then extends in into a broader cultural setting where the critic analyzes the significance of such positions taken, its relationship to the past and future implications.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053h10d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc79v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hesse, Eva, 1936-1970 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Art criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fq11p"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structural organization in selected songs from Charles Ives's 114 songs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wiens, Carl K.

His music also anticipated many of the stylistic features which characterize later twentieth-century music. This study begins with an examination of secondary literature to show how other scholars have interpreted Ives's music. Few projects have dealt with the question of coherence in Ives's music, in large part due to the seemingly disjunct nature of the music. Unity and coherence were overriding concerns to Ives, as is evident in his writings which are strongly steeped in transcendental philosophy. The second part of the thesis presents analyses of four songs from the 114 Songs: "The Cage," "Ann Street," "Like a Sick Eagle," and "At the River." Linear techniques in concert with the labelling system of pitch-class set theory are the principal analytical tools used to investigate the songs. The analyses begin from the premise that each song contains an underlying compositional plan and is a coherent whole.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f459h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq11p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ives, Charles, 1874-1954.

However, while a number of studies have acknowledged the importance of textbooks used within the school curriculum, few have examined novels that are studied within the high school English program. Thus this thesis focuses on gender-bias found in a study of 21 novels identified as those most commonly used in the high schools of the Lakeshore School Board. The results show significant gender imbalance in all categories: the number of female authors, characters, voices, and perspectives. The recommendations that arise from this study are (1) that English teachers be aware of the issue of gender bias when they select novels for their students. (2) that strategies be developed in the classroom to address gender-bias in literature, and (3) that a balanced literature curriculum be developed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483k45n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247dt22z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sex discrimination in education -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sexism in textbooks -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4m90dw631"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le réalisme magique; suivi de, Nouvelles orientales et désorientées</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chung, Ook, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Created in 1925 by the art critic Franz Roh, the term magic realism originally meant a form of post-expressionist painting. Soon thereafter, writers such as Massimo Bontempelli, Johan Daisne, and Franz Hellens applied it to literature and made it a genre combining elements of realism with a fantastic inner world. It is that "interiority" which distinguishes magic realism from conventional fantastic literature. With Alejo Carpentier's "real maravilloso", this interiority takes on collective dimension and that is perhaps why magic realism is nowadays linked to South American fiction. The second part of this thesis is made up of short stories, most of which are inspired by magic realism.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784m87z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dw631</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Realism in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah702q749s"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Adaptive control of robots for cutting and drilling processes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ali, Naseer A. (Naseer Ahmad)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Drilling and cutting operations are required in many industrial applications. For example an advanced flexible manufacturing system using robotics technologies may be required to perform such operations. Variation in the mechanical properties of a material to be processed, and compliance add complexity to the already nonlinear robotic system. Thus, these tasks are difficult to perform. For cutting and drilling processes, it is often desirable to maintain a constant cutting force to maintain productivity and also to maintain the quality of the finished workpiece. To counter the effect of the material variations while maintaining a constant cutting force, a controller mechanism is necessary which will react to these variations, and adjust the robot controller's parameters to minimize the effects of the variations on the system's performance. A single-input/single-output (SISO) model-reference adaptive control (MRAC) scheme to cope with varying material hardness, sensor compliance, and non-rigid body dynamics in the control of cutting forces is presented. The controller is formulated to maintain stable, damped, force control when rigid body and rigid contact assumptions are not valid, and when material hardness is variable, in discrete-time and Cartesian-space. It is suited to super-position on a Cartesian-space hybrid control scheme, and implementation on a multiprocessor control system.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs994.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q749s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Marine and Ocean</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apn89d7708"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Control of coordinated multiple robot manipulators</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kalaycioglu, Banu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates the issues of dynamical modelling, control and load distribution for coordinated multiple robot manipulators. An analysis of the load distribution problem for k coordinating robots handling a single payload is carried out and an optimal load sharing algorithm is developed. The algorithm calculates the minimum norms of the joint torques and the contact forces. The algorithm is based on an optimization scheme which minimizes a quadratic cost function associated with the joint torques and contact force vectors for the coordinating robot arms with the constraint of robot equations for a given trajectory of the payload. The developed algorithm is found to be very efficient in terms of computational requirements in comparison with the existing load distribution algorithms. Some of the comparative simulation results are provided. The developed scheme is very attractive for real time applications. The theory of position control for coordinated multiple manipulator is studied. The main objective of this study is to develop a multiple arm load sharing (with minimum norms) position controller.

Past proposals concerning the syntactic structure of sentential complements in Romance languages (and English) are explored in Mohawk. It is claimed that Mohawk only has full CP complements and no distinct types of embedded clauses (such as a subjunctive or infinitival). This is due to a morphological requirement (specified by the Minimal Word Constraint) on Mohawk verbs which dictates the need for obligatory agreement morphology. Tense/aspect co-occurrence restrictions are given to show what type of CP complements a verb can take. The evidence indicates that selection of complements is due to semantic and not syntactic reasons.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hw56c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cv14w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mohawk language -- Complement</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Syntax</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac821gk961"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Jules Renard et le journal intime</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Laporte, Jean-Yves</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis attempts to retrace the conditions of birth of the diary as a literary genre.

Findings are based on results of a panel study of Ontario high school students. Using human capital theory and comparing and contrasting it with the radical and credentialist arguments, I create a model to further specify the contributing factors to the already well established link between education and jobs. The results produced from the interactive causal model indicate that past research has neglected certain variables while confounding others. Specifically, while the findings are generally consistent with other empirical work, they suggest that (i) education should be treated as a more differentiated variable, (ii) the role of networks in job search behaviour should be included, (iii) gender differences should be considered and, (iv) that non additive models will often provide a better description of the data. Finally, it is also suggested that future work explore the possibility that the relationship between job search behaviour and discipline choice can best be described using a non-recursive causal model.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv33f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gh42t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>College graduates -- Employment -- Ontario</dc:subject><dc:subject>College graduates -- Ontario</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afx719n47j"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Joseph Schacht's contribution to the study of Islamic law</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Minhaji, Akh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Joseph Schacht has devoted a considerable part of his career to study the early history and development of Islamic juristic thought. His thesis about the formation of Islamic law in which the Prophetic traditions played a decisive role has constituted a basis for subsequent research on the subject; and, what is more, it possesses all the attributes of originality and profound thought. Some responses, sometimes severely critical, have been addressed to Schacht's thesis. Some even accuse him of fostering a "misconception" of the position of law in Islam and of paying little attention to the Qur'anic legislation. It is no wonder, they maintain, that Schacht upholds a view which clearly deviates from the common belief of the majority of Muslims. On the other hand, certain scholars have thought highly of Schacht's thesis. The broad outlines of his thesis, his e silentio argument and his backward-projection and common link theories, have won high acclaim among leading scholars, both Orientalists and non-Orientalists. It is not an exaggeration therefore when Hourani writes: "Joseph Schacht resurrected the intellectual life of Medieval Islam by his powerful intelligence, learning and concentration."</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w37638081.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719n47j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islamic law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Schacht, Joseph, 1902-1969</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qq687"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Uranium-lead geochronology of metamorphic accessory minerals south of the Grenville Front, western Québec, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Childe, Fiona</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>U-Pb ages were determined on single grains of monazite and xenotime as well as small populations of rutile from amphibolite to granulite facies metasediments of the Quebec Gneiss Segment of the Grenville Province in an area extending 45 to 135 km south of the Grenville Front in La Verendrye Park, Quebec. Recent geochronological studies include Pb-isotope ratios of metamorphic minerals corresponding to ages of 2.5 to 2.65 Ga and U-Pb monazite ages to 2649 to 2655 Ma, which define a lower discordia intercept of approximately 1.01 Ga. Recent thermobarometric studies indicate the presence of two metamorphic episodes in the region. Monazite and xenotime grains obtained from high grade metasediments at five locations between 45 and 70 km southeast of the Grenville Front yielded $ sp{207}$Pb/$ sp{206}$Pb ages of 999 $ pm$ 5 Ma to 1021 $ pm$ 2 Ma. Monazite from the norther part of this terrane also defined an upper intercept age of 2596 $ pm$ 3 Ma. The southernmost sample location, 135 km south of the Grenville Front, yielded both monazite and rutile. Monazite gave an age of 1072 $ pm$ 2 Ma. Small populations of rutile yielded an age of 916 $ pm$ 2 Ma.
