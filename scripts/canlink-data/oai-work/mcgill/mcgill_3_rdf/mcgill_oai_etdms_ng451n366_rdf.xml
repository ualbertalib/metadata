D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Inspite of the claims of some shopping centre promoters that their modern supercentres date back in idea to the Greek agora, the Roman Forum or what you will, the plain fact remains that it stems from no further back than the 19th. century department store, the chain store, the 20th. century supermarket and real estate speculator and, most important of all, the car. It is therefore merely for historical comparison that we look further back than the 19th. century and maybe for moral lesson and inspiration. Ever since man has been bartering exchanging or buying goods he has set up market places as a common ground for this purpose either by proclamation of the lord of the land or by common agreement or both, or by custom.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Spence-Sales, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053k954.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451n366</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
