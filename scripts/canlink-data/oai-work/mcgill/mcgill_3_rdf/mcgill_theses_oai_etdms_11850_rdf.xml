The generator is designed to be used principally for acceleration of ions or protons for use in nuclear reactions. Voltages of this nature may be used quite efficiently for producing low energy neutrons in a deuteron-deuterium reaction. Other reactions which are of interest in this r√§nge are the proton-lithium, protonboron and proton-fluorine reactions. (10). In addition to the above uses, the generator may be used in any apparatus which requires high DC potentials but does not draw more than a few hundred microamperes. The apparatus is of a semi-portable nature capable of being transported from one room to another like a laboratory tool. This portability is a radical departure from previous apparatus of this type. The circuit used is a form of the Cockcroft- Walton (6) or Greinacher (7) voltage multiplier.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Terroux, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dg847.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js060</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab2773z82z"><ual:graduationDate>1948</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The theory of elasticity of aeolotropic materials</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Goldfarb, Lionel J.

Data show evidence of the complexity of phenomena involved in5 the competition between s-necies in mixture, brought about by such factors as varieties, proportions, stations and vears. Gains in one species were made usually at the other1s detriment. The barlev species has benefited generally from being grown in mixture.

In this method, the Chamber is filled with deuterium gas and the gamma rays to be measured are allowed to pass through the Chamber. The lengths of the proton tracks resulting from the photodisintegration of the deuterium are measured. From the lengths of these tracks, the energy of the protons can be found by means of the r√§nge energy relation. From this energy, and the fact that the neutron resulting from the photodisintegration will have the same energy, and the known binding energy of the deuteron, the energy of the incident gamma ray can be calculated.[...] </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Terroux, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sk51x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sx01p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k8364"><ual:graduationDate>1948</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Introduction to the generalized theory of multi-system macroeconomics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chipman, John Somerset</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is largely original.
