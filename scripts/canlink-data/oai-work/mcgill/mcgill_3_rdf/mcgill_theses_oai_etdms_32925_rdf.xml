Also, the relationship of the composition of the evolved gases from alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching of mechanical pulp to the reaction kinetics was elucidated. We have shown that the only gas being evolved into the bleaching headspace is oxygen; whereas, carbon dioxide is produced and fixed in solution as carbonate. A new non-invasive technique for measuring the amount of oxygen evolved throughout the bleaching reaction was developed. This technique is able to be used in laboratory bleaching experiments that simulated most industrial parameters except consistency, which is limited to hand mixing at medium (10--12%) consistencies. With this method, we have shown that pulp washing, caustic charge and addition of chelating agent play key roles in the rates of oxygen evolution due to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Better washing and higher chelating agent additions result in significant lowering of the rates of oxygen evolution. The rate of decomposition has been related to the dissociation of hydrogen peroxide which is dependent on pH. The effect of transition metal ions on the kinetics of hydrogen peroxide decomposition during alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching of mechanical pulps was investigated. Iron, whether added or native to the pulp, did not contribute to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of lignin. Manganese is the main catalyst for peroxide decomposition, whether added or native to the pulp. The initial rate of oxygen evolution, in the presence of manganese, varies linearly with manganese concentration. Although alkali itself does decompose hydrogen peroxide, increased caustic charge results in an increase in the manganese induced decomposition rate. Kinetic equations are presented, which account for manganese concentration and caustic charge. The effect of DTPA on reducing the rate of hydrogen peroxide decomposition has been attributed to the chelation of manganese. The relationship between hydrogen peroxide decomposition and the oxidation state of iron and manganese was determined visually. The effect of other bleaching additives on the catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide were also evaluated. Manganese is unreactive in the +II state, yet very reactive in the +III and +IV forms. Iron is not reactive in the presence of lignin. The presence of cellulose acts to prevent the formation of large low surface area precipitates of manganese III and IV. Manganese IV is the most likely reactive species in alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching. DTPA will bind Mn(II) but not the other oxidation states. The DTPA-manganese complex once formed is stable even after the pH is increased. A new technique for the determination of carbon dioxide produced during hydrogen peroxide bleaching is presented. Carbon dioxide is produced during alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching, from reactions of hydrogen peroxide and lignin. The rate of carbon dioxide evolution varies linearly with lignin concentration. Kinetic equations are presented and rate constants have been calculated. The source of carbon dioxide is most likely decarboxylation of carboxylic acid groups formed in lignin by alkaline hydrogen peroxide oxidation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>van de Ven, T. G.

I examine three conventional satirical depictions of women as deviant speakers in medieval literature---as loquacious gossips, scolding shrews and cursing witches---to reveal how medieval perceptions of oral and textual discursive modes influenced literary representations of women. The dissertation demonstrates that our comprehension of the literary battle between the sexes requires a recognition and understanding of how discursive modes were gendered in a culture increasingly defining itself in terms of textuality. My work pursues the juxtaposition of the rational, literate male and the irrational, oral female across a wide range of texts, from Dunbar and Chaucer's courtly literature, to more socially diffused works, such as carols, sermon exempla and the Deluge mystery plays, as well as texts, like Margery Kempe's autobiography and witchcraft documents, that pertain to historical women. I demonstrate the social impact of this convention by anchoring these literary texts in their socio-historical context. The significance of my identification of this nexus of orality and femininity is that I am able to delineate an ideology profoundly affecting the way women's speech and writings have been received and perceived for centuries. This notion of gendered discourse can also redefine how we perceive medieval literature. Mikhail Bakhtin's discursive principles---ideas that stem from his application of the dynamics of oral communication and performance to the literary text---help to liberate new meanings from old texts by allowing us to read against the grain of convention. Both Bakhtin's theory of dialogism and Walter Ong's summary of the psychodynamics of orality suggest that orally influenced discourse is less interested in monolithic truth than in the art of tellin</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Westphal, S.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Bray, Dorothy Ann</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wr89j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s641h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English literature -- Middle English, 1100-1500 -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oral communication in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feminist literary criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r0156"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Examination of the mechanisms of PTHRP cytosolic relocation and nuclear import</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nguyen, Minh Trang Audrey</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is a factor with numerous biological functions elicited either by secreted isoforms activating the cell surface type 1 PTH receptor or by intracrine species mediating actions at the level of the cell nucleus/nucleolus. To gain insight into the mechanism(s) whereby PTHrP, normally a secreted protein, bypasses the secretory pathway and enters the cytosol for subsequent nuclear import, we characterized its nuclear forms. In transfected COS-1 cells, three nuclear PTHrP isoforms were identified, which were larger than the mature protein but smaller than preproPTHrP and comprised both the peptide's amino and carboxyl termini. These also encompassed part of the prepro domain, suggesting that they likely arise from alternate initiation of translation at downstream non-AUG codons. Indeed, PTHrP cDNAs in which either the unique initiator AUG was inactivated or that encompassed an engineered N-linked glycosylation site, were capable of generating nuclear PTHrP isoforms that were inefficiently targeted to the ER, bypassed ER transit, and localized exclusively to the nucleus/nucleolus. Codons involved in the generation of nuclear PTHrP forms were delineated using site-directed mutagenesis analysis of nucleotides within the prepro region. Indirect immunofluorescence, in vitro transcription/translation, and radiosequencing studies of various mutants established that nuclear PTHrP peptides are concurrently translated from internal CUG -32 and -25, and GUG -24 triplets. In addition, we examined PTHrP phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase and its role in nuclear translocation. Bacterial recombinant and in vitro translated PTHrP, and a peptide encompassing a consensus cdc2 kinase target sequence were phosphorylated by purified enzyme. Using mutant forms of PTHrP that could not be phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase at individual target residues or at all putative sites, it was demonstrated that the protein's subcellular distribution was unaltered.

Highest levels of this protein are produced in oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system possess lower levels, followed by non-neural cells, such as lymphocytes, retinal cells and thymocytes. There are two isoforms of CNP: CNP1 (46kDa) and CNP2 (48kDa). CNP2 differs from CNP1 only by a 20 amino acid N-terminal extension. In addition, CNP2 is more heavily phosphorylated than CNP1. Although a messenger RNA is produced for each, the CNP2 message contains both translation initiation codons, in frame. This message was found to give rise to both CNP polypeptides through alternative translation initiation. A mutation at the CNP1 initiation codon (M21L) abrogates synthesis of CNP1. This construct was used to selectively introduce CNP2 into cultured cells in order to identify the sites of CNP2 phosphorylation as serines 9 and 22, within the unique N-terminal region. Moreover, expression of CNP2 in transfected cells resulted in partial mitochondrial localization. The unique region, when fused to green fluorescent protein (N2-GFP) is capable of targeting the fusion to mitochondria. Targeting of N2-GFP and full-length CNP2 appears to be regulated by phosphorylation because mutation of the phosphorylated serine residues to alanines increased targeting, and substitution with aspartic acid residues abrogated it. Finally, expression of CNP2 in cells suggested that the protein is imported into mitochondria and the unique region is cleaved upon complete translocation into the matrix. Hence, my data suggest that the N-terminal domain of CNP2 is a functional mitochondrial matrix-targeting signal and that targeting is regulated by phosphorylation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Braun, Peter E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zq12f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz8061514</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924d35g"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of nitric oixde [i.e. oxide] in macrophage iron metabolism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kim, Sangwon, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Iron (Fe) is essential for the activity of many proteins and enzymes, such as [Fe-S] proteins, ribonucleotide reductase and innumerable other non-heme iron proteins as well as heme proteins, such as hemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochromes. In mammals iron is transported in plasma by a glycoprotein, transferrin (Tf), which contains two specific high affinity Fe3+ binding sites. Physiologically, most cells in the organism acquire iron from Tf following its binding to a specific membrane protein, Tf receptor (TfR). Iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) control the synthesis of TfR and ferritin by binding to iron-responsive elements (IREs) which are located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and the 5 ' UTR of their respective mRNAs. In this study, I investigated various aspects of iron metabolism in inflammatory macrophages treated with NO donors or cytokines, since in activated macrophages NO is one of the major effector molecules produced by the enzyme called NO synthase. I stimulated RAW 264.7 cells (a murine macrophage cell line) with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LIPS), a treatment that induces NO synthase and NO production in these cells. I showed that LIPS and IFN-gamma increased IRP1 binding, but decreased RNA-binding of IRP2, followed by its degradation. Moreover, the decrease of IRP2 binding/protein levels was associated with a decrease in TfR mRNA levels and an increase in ferritin synthesis in LPS/IFN-gamma treated cells, and these changes could be prevented by inhibitors of inducible NO synthase. I also showed that IRP2 is a target for nitrosonium ion (NO+) which causes S-nitrosylation of this protein, leading to its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. NO+-mediated IRP2 degradation was associated with a dramatic decrease in TfR mRNA levels and an increase in ferritin synthesis associated with an increase in iron incorporation into ferritin. These changes occurred without any change in the IRE binding activity of IRP1, strongly suggesting that IRP2 alone can play a key role in controlling iron metabolism. Importantly, the unique 73 amino acid region of IRP2 contains 5 cysteines, and I showed that mutation of one of these cysteine (Cys178) blocked the degradation of IRP2 in NO+-treated cells. Taken together, these observations suggest that S-nitrosylation represents a signal for IRP2 ubiquitination and consequent proteasomal degradation, and that this may be an important mechanism in controlling iron homeostasis in macrophages.

This he describes as the gathering, upbuilding and sending of the Christian community. His work, Church Dogmatics, will be examined, and then an attempt will be made to identify how Barth's Christocentric ecclesiology was indigenized and is still received in Korea by examining Korean Christian thought. This will include an investigation of Sung-Bum Yun's theology of Sung. The secondary purpose of this thesis is: (1) the description of a unique relationship between Christianity and Confucianism, because Korean Confucianism has played an important role in both the explosive growth of the Christian community and provided a basic foundation for the reception of Barth's theology in Korea; (2) the inquiry whether Barth's ecclesiology, especially his theology of mission (the sending of the Christian community), pays sufficient attention to different cultures and religions; and consequently (3) the justification that the indigenization of Barth's Christocentric theology was, and is, genuinely possible with Korean Confucianism, though Barth's theology is typically confined within the European context. This thesis will be divided into three chapters. Chapter One is designed as a brief sketch of the historical development of early Korean Protestantism and its impact on cultural and religious changes in Korea. This will include a detailed introduction to Korean Confucianism and its community concept and structure. In the second chapter, an analysis of Barth's ecclesiology is presented by providing a discussion of what constitutes the true church, the upbuilding of the Christian community, and the missionary task of the Christian community. Chapter Three indicates why Barth's Christocentric ecclesiology can still make an impact on contemporary Korean ecclesiological theology and practice, by exploring a specific overview of the Korean reception of Barth's theology. On this basis, this chapter critically examines and analyzes Sung-Bum Yun's appropriation and misappropriation of Barth's theology.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Klempa, William</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j959g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z701p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Theology -- Korea</dc:subject><dc:subject>Barth, Karl, 1886-1968 -- Influence</dc:subject><dc:subject>Barth, Karl, 1886-1968</dc:subject><dc:subject>Yun, Sŏng-bŏm, 1916-</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97ks050"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Polyphasic examination of microbial communities in soils contaminated with organic pollutants</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Juck, David F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A polyphasic approach was used to examine the impact of contamination on soil microbial community structure. Two systems were examined using a combined biochemical and molecular biological approach. Petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soils from two Northern Canadian sites, representing long-term contamination, were examined using Biolog GN plates and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of total community 16S rDNA. Results obtained using both methods demonstrated a positive correlation between samples that was based on the geographical origin of the samples, not on contamination level. In the second system, non-contaminated soil was contaminated with the explosive hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) to monitor the effect of short- to medium-term contamination. Changes in the soil microbial community were examined using PCR-DGGE of total community 16S rDNA combined with RDX mineralization and chemical analysis of intermediates. The non-contaminated loam soil had an inherent RDX degradative capability and contamination of soil columns with 1000 mg RDX/kg soil did not significantly change the 16S rDNA bacterial community profile. The bacterial diversity remained high as estimated by the number of bands present in the DGGE and by NQ-78704 statistical rarefaction analysis of 16S rDNA clone RFLPs. The same soil, used in 10% soil slurries (w/v), demonstrated two apparently different RDX degradation mechanisms based on mineralization and chemical analysis. The differences were based on aerobic versus anaerobic conditions and the presence/absence of Na3 citrate. PCR-DGGE performed on 16S rDNA from aerobic slurries amended with Na3-citrate detected the stimulation of 3 operational taxonomic units, identified as Stenotrophomonas sp., Sphingomonas sp. and a member of the Alcaligenaceae.

It examines the role of the passions or emotions in Shakespearean tragedy and in early modern politics. Shakespeare can be seen to share a perspective on tragedy and political thought with a number of other writers, some of whom were his contemporaries, and some of whom---like Thucydides and Tacitus---were classical writers. What these figures, here called 'politic historians,' have in common is an interest in using the passions as an explanatory category to reveal the states of mind of tyrants, princes and also other agents, including manipulative Machiavellians. Shakespeare's use of this politics of the passions is shown to be more acute and insightful than the rival treatments given by Stoicism, Hobbes and Machiavelli, in terms of explaining motives, agency and action. It is also argued that an understanding of the passions tells us something about tragedy, necessity and chance: namely, the need for realism about the dangers posed by those who seek to fashion or shape our minds. However, this dissertation proposes that this political realism does not go so far as to become the cynicism of realpolitik. A discussion of a number of important passages and themes in the tragedies---in particular, Hamlet, Macbeth and Coriolanus---shows how the notion of a rich and vividly articulated self plays a significant role in Shakespearean tragedy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bristol, Michael D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x307g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q571d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Emotions in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v462k"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Destination nation : writing the railway in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Flynn, Kevin, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Since the completion of the CPR, the railway has held an important place in the Canadian imagination as a symbol of national unity, industry, and cooperation. It would seem to follow, given the widely held belief that national literatures help to engender national self-recognition in their readers, that Canadian literature would make incessant use of the railway to address themes of national community and identity. This assumption is false. With a few notable exceptions, Canadian literature has in fact made very little deliberate effort to propagate the idea that the railway is a vital symbol of Canadian unity and identity. Literary depictions of the railway do, however, exhibit a tension between communitarian and individualist values that may itself lie at the heart of the Canadian character. Some of the earliest representations of the railway, in travel narratives of the late nineteenth century, make explicit reference to the notion that the railway was a sign and a product of a common national imagination. But poets of this period virtually ignored the railway for fear that its presence would disturb the peaceful contemplation, and thus the identity, of the individuals who populated the pastoral spaces of their verse. Modern poets did eventually manage to include the train in their work, but used it most often as a vehicle to continue the private musings of their individual lyric speakers rather than to explore the terrain of the national consciousness. One prominent exception to this tendency is E. J. Pratt's Towards the Last Spike, in which imposing individuals such as Sir John A. Macdonald and William Van Horne and thousands of unnamed rail workers combine their efforts in order to construct the railway, which stands as a symbol of how individuals and communities can work together in the national interest. Canadian fiction demonstrates the same impulses as Canadian poetry by using the railway as a means of depicting the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of individuals, but it also challenges the myth of the railway's creation of a unitary national culture by showing how diverse communities---of race, class, and region---imagine their relationship to the railway in very different ways. The varied character of Canada's literary treatment of one of the country's central national symbols suggests that a tension between individualism and communitarianism also informs Canadian literature itself, whose writers have used the railway to fulfill their goals in individual texts but have rarely employed it as a symbol of national community.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lecker, Robert</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801ph98p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v462k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Railroads in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pratt, E.

CD45 plays an essential role in signal transduction through the antigen receptor in T and B lymphocytes, mainly through the regulation of Src-family tyrosine kinase activity. Previous work has shown that cross-linking CD45 with monoclonal antibodies can induce caspase-independent apoptosis in murine immature T cells. The exact mechanism whereby CD45 cross-linking can lead to cell death, and whether the PTP activity of CD45 is involved in this process have not been determined. In this study, a CD45-deficient T-cell line was transduced with either wild-type or phosphatase-dead CD45 retroviral constructs, to show that the PTP activity of CD45 was totally dispensable for apoptosis triggering after cross-linking of the molecule. Noteworthy, a T-cell line expressing a truncated form of CD45, lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain, could readily be killed by CD45 cross-linking. It was also demonstrated that LPAP, a protein of undefined function interacting specifically with the transmembrane domain of CD45, does not play an essential role in CD45-triggered apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that the extracellular and/or transmembrane domains of CD45 are endowed with unique properties in apoptosis signaling. To our knowledge, apoptosis induction is the only function reported to date for CD45 for which PTP activity is not required. Sensitivity towards CD45-mediated cell death had been shown to be modulated during T cell differentiation in the thymus. Hence, a parallel in the susceptibility towards CD45-induced apoptosis was found for the various stages of T and B cell development in primary lymphoid organs. Moreover, it was also demonstrated that mature T-cells from peripheral lymphoid organs readily underwent cell death upon CD45 engagement, whereas peripheral B-cells showed to be resistant to this treatm</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hugo, Patrice</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cs08k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jc971</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930bz885"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Respiratory response of healthy and diseased potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) under real and experimental storage conditions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fennir, Mohamed A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigates respiration rate of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) under real and experimental storage conditions. Real storage conditions were obtained by building a small-scale storage facility equipped with two independent storage bins including all controls. Each bin was filled with 2.5 metric tons of potatoes and these were stored for five months. Temperature, relative humidity, air flowrate and other operational parameters were collected. Also, mass loss and CO2 analyses were performed. A heat and moisture balance was applied to quantify heat and moisture rates produced by potatoes and were converted to respiration rates as CO 2 produced (ml.kg-1.h-1). Evaporation rates were also determined (g.kg-1.h -1). The balance was mainly applied on data collected from specific periods in which steady conditions were imposed; heaters and humidifiers were turned off and fans were operated to circulate air at a given flowrate for more than 8 h/day over a two month period. Respiration rates were determined as rates of heat produced (W) with stability and acceptable accuracy for a relatively large facility. Respiration rates were converted to CO2 production (ml.kg-1.h-1), and these agreed fairly with ranges reported in the literature. Simultaneously, respiration rates were measured by in-store CO2 analysis, and later they were measured under laboratory conditions using a closed gas analysis system. Comparing these with rates obtained by the heat and moisture balance, the later were slightly higher. Mass losses were also obtained by both weight losses and moisture balance; results from the two methods were quite similar and comparable with those reported in the literature. Under experimental conditions, respiration rates were measured for healthy, diseased and sprouted tubers using a gas analysis method. This experiment demonstrated the need for a more extensive investigation of disease development and its relation to respiration rates, and the need for a faster and more convenient gas analysis system.

In order to provide further insight into the mechanical behavior of the respiratory systems of different sized small animals, accurate measurements of respiratory impedance (Zrs) were made in four different rodent species and in the developing rat over a broad range of frequencies at various levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). PEEP dependencies of airway and tissue properties were interpreted in terms of physiological phenomena such as airway closure and airway-parenchymal interdependence forces. In adult animals, Zrs was fitted to a model including a Newtonian resistance (R) in series with a constant-phase tissue compartment. In general, rodent respiratory parameters obeyed the same scaling laws described in other species, but rabbits had a relatively higher elastance than one would predict from previously published allometric relationships. This is probably due to the rabbit's proportionately smaller airspace volume. R normalized to body weight was lower in smaller species suggesting that they have proportionately wider airways compared to larger animals. By using computer models of the asymmetric airway tree to estimate airway resistance (Raw), we confirmed that the larger of two isomorphic rodent species has relatively higher Raw. Moreover, we showed that both the airway dimensional scaling differences and the asymmetric arrangement of the individual airways are responsible for the relative differences in Raw between smaller and larger animals. Finally, in the developing rat, elastance and resistance normalized to lung weight decreased progressively with age, suggesting that intrinsic changes in the mechanical properties of the respiratory system occur with development.

Interhemispheric exchanges of atmospheric mass occur with considerable regularity on intraseasonal time-scales. Observational evidence from previous studies indicates that anomalous and persistent regional atmospheric mass distributions (e.g., atmospheric blocking) may often be related to interhemispheric atmospheric mass exchange. Using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis, we identify significant events when the northern hemisphere (NH) loses dry atmospheric mass on subseasonal time-scales during the boreal winter from 1968 to 1997. A total of 25 events is found, with a preferred time-scale of 9 days. The linear correlation coefficient between the dry atmospheric mass anomalies for the NH and southern hemisphere (SH) is -0.91 for the 25 significant events, indicating very strong interhemispheric compensation and increasing our confidence in the suitability of this dataset for the study of interhemispheric dry atmospheric mass exchange. Positive sea-level pressure anomalies are found over northern Eurasia, the North Pacific and the North Atlantic prior to the onset of the composite NH dry atmospheric mass collapse event. Over northern Eurasia the positive atmospheric mass anomaly associated with the building of the Siberian high is found to be a statistically significant precursor to the events. The breakdown of NH dry atmospheric mass occurs in association with the decay of the positive atmospheric mass anomaly in the North Pacific as a cyclone deepens explosively in the Gulf of Alaska. Pressure surges over Southeast Asia and North America, associated with statistically significant positive atmospheric mass anomalies, are mechanisms that act to channel the atmospheric mass equatorward on a rapid time-scale (~4 days). The dry atmospheric mass increase in the SH is manifested as enhanced surface ridging over the South Pacific and South Indian Oceans. Preferential interhemispheric interaction is found in the region between 100°E and 130°E, and over the central Pacific in the vicinity of the dateline. A prominent channel of southeastward dry atmospheric mass flux, emanating from the Australian continent, combined with a southward channel from the equatorial central Pacific, contribute to the atmospheric mass buildup over the South Pacific. The role of a Southeast Asian pressure surge was examined for a representative event. A large evacuation of atmospheric mass from northern Eurasia occurs as the atmospheric mass surges equatorward and into the SH. Along the west coast of Australia, a southerly pressure surge extends equatorward and converges with the northerly surge to create a pronounced near equatorial zonal pressure gradient. A low-level westerly wind burst develops in response to this enhanced zonal pressure gradient as part of the onset of an active phase of the Australian summer monsoon. We show that three prominent anticyclonic circulations intensify in the southern hemisphere extratropics, stretching from the South Indian Ocean to the South Pacific, beneath regions of upper tropospheric dry atmospheric mass convergence, originating from the monsoon convection outflow. These anticyclonic circulations are largely responsible for the dry atmospheric mass increase in the SH.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gyakum, John R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n958z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cs09v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physical Oceanography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33rz321"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization and biological effects of wear particles from metal-metal hip implants</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Catelas, Isabelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Polyethylene wear particles have been the main culprit in initiating osteolysis and aseptic failure of conventional metal-polyethylene total hip arthroplasties. There has been a revived interest in metal-metal (MM) bearings, made of CoCrMo alloys; because of their very high wear resistance compared with conventional bearings. The work that forms the basis of this thesis attempts to examine MM bearings as one potential solution to the problem of osteolysis. The results provide important new information on MM particle characteristics and their effects on tissue, as well as the effects of their corrosion products (Co2+ and Cr3+) on macrophage response in vitro. An enzymatic protocol for isolation and characterization of metal particles was first developed in order to minimize particle changes due to the reagents. Metal particles isolated from a hip simulator and from human tissues around MM implants using this protocol were found to be mainly round to oval and more occasionally needle-shaped, extremely small (~50 nm), and surprisingly, mostly chromium oxides. In vitro and in vivo run-in wear periods did not exactly correlate, but MM wear particles from both sources were quite similar at specific periods of comparison. Alloy composition and number of running cycles in vitro influenced the overall characteristics of the particles, although the observed differences were relatively small and would probably not induce a difference in the biological response. Tissue response to metal wear particles revealed the presence of IL-1beta and IL-6, two major inflammatory mediators implicated in periprosthetic osteolysis. There was also a high correlation between the amount of these cytokines and the quantity of metal particles. The amounts of cytokines decreased when the quantities of particles increased, most likely due to the high toxicity of the metal particles when present in larger quantities. There was more IL-6 than IL-1beta and TNF-alpha remained at low levels. Apoptosis was clearly observed in some tissues from the patients analyzed, but results were highly variable depending on the tissues analyzed. More patients would be necessary to complete this study on apoptosis. In vitro, Co2+ and Cr3+ ions induced the secretion of TNF-alpha, another major inflammatory mediator implicated in periprosthetic osteolysis, and macrophage mortality in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Co2+ was more toxic than Cr 3+. Macrophage apoptosis was predominant at 24h with both ions, and with the lowest concentrations at 48h. Necrosis was more prevalent with the highest concentrations at 48h. The implication of caspase-3 pathway was also identified in macrophage apoptosis. These results suggest how specific therapeutic treatments could modulate macrophage response to these ions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Huk, O. L.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Bobyn, J.

In recent years research activity has gained importance with outstanding contributions made on estimation and testing of a wide variety of long memory processes, together with many interesting and imaginative applications over a wide variety of different fields of economics and finance. For these reasons, this study provides empirical evidence to an aspect of fractional differencing and long memory processes, or the long memory of volatility. Evidence of long memory persistence is explored using stock price indices for eight emerging economies in both Asian and Latin American markets. The concern with the presence of long memory in higher moments of return series was first drawn by Ding, Granger and Engle (1993), using asset returns. Baillie, Bollerslev and Mikkelsen (1996) developed the fractionally integrated GARCH, or FIGARCH, process to represent long memory in volatility. The measure of long-memory persistence in the volatility is employed either using the original rescaled range statistic by Hurst (1951) and its modified version proposed by Lo (1991). Further analysis of the presence of long memory persistence is conducted using autocorrelation analysis. All the findings point in the same direction, that is, the existence of long memory in volatility irrespective of the measure chosen. Estimation of different models of volatility is undertaken beginning with the ARCH specification and until the FIGARCH model. The results show the effects to be higher in Latin American countries than in the Asian ones. This result seems consistent with the degree of intervention in the Latin American markets, known to be much higher. Other possible explanations for the occurrence of long term persistence are also pursued such as the Regime Switching modelisation proposed first by Hamilton and Susnel (1994) with the SWARCH approach. Results show that this approach can bring another possible explanation for persistence, specially in economies like Brazil that, have very different regimes for the period covered in this study.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galbraith, John W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z252p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mh26s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stocks -- Prices -- Econometric models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wf440"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>From the other oil field : Mendeleev, the West and the Russian oil industry</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Butorac, Mark</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis attempts to determine whether the Russian chemist, Dmitrii Ivanovich Mendeleev, was open to Western ideas and capital in the Russian petroleum industry. It does so by examining five of his trips to study this business, as either an advisor to the Russian government or a private consultant. These voyages took place between 1863 and 1886 and saw Mendeleev in France, the United States and the Caucasus. Each trip produced a combination of personal letters, diaries, and published articles. This work employs a mixture of published and unpublished archival documents. In the process, much is revealed about the history of this industry, its industrialists, as well as Mendeleev's personality. The introduction outlines the general questions that this thesis aims to answer. Chapter one summarizes Mendeleev's life until he first worked in the oil industry in 1863. These formative years were crucial for Mendeleev. His youthful travels around Europe, studies in Germany and personal inclinations, made him a multi-lingual and cosmopolitan individual. The remaining five chapters examine Mendeleev's trips to study the industry. An epilogue briefly recounts his final years. The conclusion of this thesis is that contrary to Soviet scholarship, Mendeleev was open to the West. His only requirement was that Western ideas and capital assist in the growth of the Russian oil industry and result in abundant and cheap kerosene for the Russian population.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boss, V.

Flow properties are transported in the direction of the velocity following a Lagrangian procedure. The computational elements of the LBM are systems of blocks. These blocks are utilized in the method as containers for the storage of the flow properties (masses). During the computation, the masses in the blocks remain positive, and the total mass in the system is conserved. The resolution of the method is accurate to within one to two computational blocks. The LBM is also unconditionally stable. Accurate results can be obtained with the method using a value of the Courant number very close to unity. To demonstrate the general applicability of the LBM, simulations of advection-dominant flows using the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model and diffusion-dominant flows using the K-epsilon turbulence model were conducted. The LES of turbulent flows were conducted using two levels of implementation of the LBM. In full implementation of the method, both velocity and concentration are calculated using the LBM. In the partial implementation of the method, only the concentration is calculated by the LBM whereas the velocity field is calculated using a conventional Central-Differencing Scheme (CDS). Compared with the LBM, the requirement for the sub-grid scale viscosity in the velocity simulation using the CDS was significantly lower. Simulations of turbulent flows using K-epsilon turbulence model were conducted using the same two levels of implementations. Numerical results obtained from the simulations using the CDS were more oscillatory, and they converged to the asymptotic solutions at a slower rate than those obtained from the simulations using the LBM. The results from both the K-epsilon model simulation and the LES suggest that the LBM advects and diffuses the flow properties more accurately than by the conventional CDS. The LBM is also approximately three times faster than the CDS. LBM is mass conserving, non-negative, unconditionally stable, and relatively free of numerical oscillations. These outstanding attributes of the method have contributed to the success of the turbulent flow simulations. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chu, V.

By capitalizing on the methodologies of cognitive science and adapting data analytic techniques borrowed from the medical decision-making literature, the clinical assessment behaviours of psychology undergraduate students, clinical psychology graduate students, and professional psychologists were compared. The results demonstrate that professional psychologists took longest to develop their diagnostic formulations, divide their questioning evenly between close and open-ended questions, provide more information to the patient, provide diagnoses that are fully consistent with the clinical data, and demonstrate an increase in diagnostic accuracy using the MultiAxial Form (APA, 1994). Finally, extensive clinical experience affords clinicians with a greater degree of case comprehension that may impact the quality of treatment. Graduate students in clinical psychology demonstrate the same degree of test familiarity as the psychologists, adhere to empirical recommendations by conducting comprehensive clinical interviews and asking about DSM-IV criteria during the clinical interview, evidence a reliance on open-ended questions during the clinical interview, and also show an increase in diagnostic accuracy using the MultiAxial Form (APA, 1994). There were no significant differences in accuracy rates between professional psychologists and graduate students; however, some graduate students included diagnoses that were inconsistent with the clinical data. The undergraduate students tended to cover many of the same topics in the interview as the other groups; however, they did so by posing significantly more close-ended questions. Further, none of the undergraduate students provided an accurate diagnosis of the case. There were no differences in confidence ratings across levels of experience. A model of clinical assessment behaviour is proposed that can function as a framework for future studies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Patel, Vimla L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429b84z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mn92c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Clinical psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychodiagnostics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anp193b56t"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Treatment of children with problem behaviors : the efficacy of conjoint behavioral consultation versus videotape therapy and the impact on parent-teacher collaboration</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wayland, Leigh Ann Louise</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of three indirect models of service delivery in treating children with externalizing and internalizing behavior problems: the highly individualized behavioral consultation model (CBC); minimal consultation with videotape therapy (GVT); and self-administered videotape therapy only (VT). This study also sought to ascertain whether parent and teacher consultation increases parental involvement in their children's education. Specifically, the relationship between perceived self-efficacy and mothers' involvement in their children's education was examined. Thirty-five preschool and elementary school children, their mothers, and teachers were assigned to one of the three treatment conditions. An A-B repeated measures group research design was used to analyze the effectiveness of consultation. Outcome variables included mothers' and teachers' direct observation of target behavior, their ratings of social skills, internalizing, externalizing, and general problem behaviors, and an observational measure of child deviance behaviors and parenting skills. Results indicated that children's target behaviors improved from baseline to treatment in all three treatment conditions. Overall, children's social skills increased and behavior problems decreased over the course of treatment. Pretreatment and posttreatment self-efficacy was assessed via rating scales. Although results suggest that parent and teacher self-efficacy did not change as a result of treatment, self-efficacy ratings were associated with more hours of mother involvement in educational activities per week. These results are discussed in light of their practical and theoretical implications.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sladeczek, Ingrid</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xd387.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193b56t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Behavior therapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Behavior disorders in children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d152p"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains and mutants allow improved soybean nodulation, nitrogen fixation and yield in a short season (cool spring) area</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Hao, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the soybean nitrogen fixing symbiosis, suboptimal root zone temperatures (RZTs) inhibit the inception and development of nodules, leading to reduced nitrogen fixation and soybean yield.

Pgps are encoded by a small family of three genes in rodents (mdr1, mdr2, mdr3 ) and two in humans (MDR1, MDR2), and belong to the larger superfamily of ABC transporters, characterized by their ability to transport various substrates at the expense of ATP. Pgps are comprised of 12 transmembrane (TM) domains, some of which are involved in the binding of these drugs, and two intracellular nucleotide-binding (NB) domains that catalyze ATP hydrolysis. Communication occurs between these two regions as drug binding can significantly activate the ATPase activity, and the signalling is thought to occur through the highly conserved intracellular (IC) loops linking the individual TM domains. Using a random mutagenesis approach, mutations were identified in IC1 affecting both substrate specificity and drug-stimulated ATPase activity of Pgp. The finding that mutations in IC1 can modulate the activities of two separate and distinct regions supports the proposed role for the IC loops. Purification of Pgp mutants to a high degree allowed for the further biochemical characterization of selected mutants in IC1. The findings support a role for IC1 in signalling between the two regions: (1) from the TM domains to the NB sites to activate ATPase activity, and (2) in the opposite direction to effect drug release. The analysis of mutations in TM11 provides more support that this helix is involved in protein-substrate interactions and forms part of the drug-binding site. The formation and maintenance of an active drug-binding site through the proper organization and orientation of TM helices are critical to the function of Pgp.

D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Protein synthesis is one of the multiple levels at which gene expression is regulated. The rate-limiting steps of protein synthesis occur during initiation. The binding of the ribosome to the mRNA in translation initiation is catalyzed by the proteins of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4 (eIF4) group. In mammals, the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E is present in limiting levels and is regulated by several mechanisms. This thesis examines the regulation of eIF4E during the development of the genetically tractable organism, Drosophila melanogaster. A Drosophila eIF4E gene was cloned, its position was mapped cytologically, and this gene was shown to encode two cap-binding protein isoforms via alternative splicing. Antisera specific to the eIF4E isoforms were raised and purified to characterize the expression of eIF4E during development. Several mutant alleles of eIF4E were identified and demonstrate that this gene is essential for the viability of Drosophila. Furthermore, eIF4E mutants arrest in growth during early larval stages. The lethality and growth defects of eIF4E mutant alleles were rescued by a transgene containing a wild-type copy of eIF4E expressed under the control of its endogenous promoter. Ser251 of Drosophila eIF4E is in a sequence context identical to site on which eIF4E is phosphorylated in response to extracellular stimuli in other organisms. To examine the biological significance of the phosphorylation of eIF4E, transgenic flies were generated in which Ser251 was mutated. We show that eIF4E from Ser251 mutant lines cannot incorporate labeled orthophosphate. Interestingly, flies in which the only source of eIF4E is non-phosphorylatable are semi-lethal and escapers are small in size. These results are evidence that Ser251 of eIF4E is required for the normal growth of a multicellular organism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lasko, Paul</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cj26w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hh16t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Proteins -- Synthesis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peptide Initiation Factors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811km33q"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Design, analysis and implementation of free-space optical interconnects</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lacroix, Frédéric, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Optical interconnects represent an attractive alternative technology for the implementation of dense, high-speed interconnects, as they do not suffer from many of the problems plaguing electrical interconnects such as frequency-dependent crosstalk and attenuation. However, optics has still not been accepted commercially as an interconnect technology. There is concern regarding the cost and complexity of the optomechanics needed to achieve the very fine alignments necessary to guarantee that the light emitted from the source actually falls on the receiver. The demonstration of a simple-to-assemble, dense and robust optical interconnect would constitute an important proof of the practicality of this technology. The photonic backplane demonstrator system presented in this thesis addresses these issues through a novel approach; the system uses slow Gaussian beams (f/16) and a clustered design to maximize misalignment tolerances. This in turn relaxes the positioning and packaging requirements for the components, thus simplifying assembly. This thesis pursues two sets of complementary goals; the first set is concerned with the demonstration of some desirable optomechanical characteristics for optical interconnects such as passive alignment, repeatability and stability while the second set of goals is concerned with a verification of hypotheses often used in the design and implementation of optical interconnects. Such hypotheses are often used in practice to design optical interconnects despite the fact that little data exists in the literature to warrant their use. It therefore makes good sense to spend some time verifying the accuracy of these models. This will provide a solid engineering foundation for the design of future systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kirk, Andrew G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rw10v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km33q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Optics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s1617861"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Training for service : the Bible school movement in western Canada, 1909-1960</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guenther, Bruce L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation explores the origins of, and the developments among, the approximately one hundred Bible schools that existed in western Canada prior to 1960. Although these schools influenced thousands of people, they have been almost entirely ignored by scholars, thereby leaving a significant lacuna within Canadian religious historiography. This study demonstrates the vital role played by the Bible schools in the development of evangelical Protestantism in western Canada. The numerous Bible schools in the region are divided into six clusters based on denominational or theological similarities. A representative school (or schools) is selected from each cluster to serve as the focus of an institutional biography. These biographies explore the circumstances surrounding the origin, and subsequent developments (up to 1960) within, each school. The multiple institutional biographies create a collage that is both comprehensive enough to provide an understanding of the movement as a composite whole, and sufficiently varied to illustrate the movement's dynamic diversity. This dissertation, therefore, presents a more multi-faceted explanation of the movement than previous characterizations that have generally depicted it as a part of an American fundamentalist reaction to Protestant liberalism. Although fundamentalism was a significant influence within some, particularly the transdenominational, Bible schools, at least as important in understanding the movement in western Canada were the particular ethnic, theological and denominational concerns that were prominent within the denominational clusters. The Bible schools typically offered a Bible-centred, intensely practical, lay-oriented program of post-secondary theological training. They were an innovative and practical response to the many challenges, created by massive immigration, rugged frontier conditions, geographical isolation, economic hardship, ethnicity and cultural assimilation, facing evangelical Protestants during the first half of the twentieth century. The Bible schools represent an institutional embodiment of the ethos and emphases of their respective constituencies. They served the multiple denominational and transdenominational constituencies, which made up the larger evangelical Protestant network, as centres of influence by preparing future generations for church leadership and participation in Canadian society. The Bible school movement offers a unique window into the diversity, complexity, dynamism and flexibility that characterized the development of evangelical Protestantism in western Canada.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stackhouse, John G., Jr.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386m05n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s1617861</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bible colleges -- Canada, Western -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religious education -- Canada, Western -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1z40kv53h"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Culture, genderization and science practice in Japan</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ghezzi, Beverley J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study of Japanese women scientists recognizes that their workplaces are those in which the traditional culture of Japan meets the practices of a modern scientific laboratory. In many ways, the two places, Japan and the laboratory, hold contradictory values. Which values will subsume which? Having asked this question, I have attempted to determine the implications of this clash of values for Japanese women working in science. 85 non-Japanese postdoctoral researchers working in Japan were asked their opinions about the distinct characteristics of Japanese laboratory practice, and 62 Japanese women in science in Japan and abroad were asked to comment on a variety of issues in relation to their situation. Results of this survey indicate that Japanese cultural values predominate in science practice in Japan. This predominance has implications both for the scientists and for scientific results. Japan's science laboratories are psychologically less cold than they otherwise might be, but the warm human connections helpful on a social level are in some ways inimical to getting scientific tasks done. The vertical social structure, moreover, means that women who leave scientific work temporarily to fulfill home duties may find it difficult to return to their workplaces later, when these duties become less pressing. Individual needs relating to role models, mentoring, family issues, and to the cultivation of critical thought and independent thinking appear to be the most pressing for women scientists. Implications are: Japan needs a method of allowing field-independent discussion without reference to considerations of rank, seniority, or age. The government of Japan can be supportive of women in science in various ways. For example, they can adjust the gendered division of labour in the scientific workplace and in the Japanese home to include both masculine and feminine participation at both sites. They can also compose a new governmental word descriptive of the present</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ghosh, Ratna</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b4932.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kv53h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Science -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex role -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women scientists -- Japan</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
