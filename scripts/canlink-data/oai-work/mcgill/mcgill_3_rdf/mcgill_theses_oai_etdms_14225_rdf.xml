This phenomenon, termed habituation, is distinguishable from fatigue and receptor adaptation in that it is long-lasting and in that the habituation is fairly specific to the repeated stimulus. The prevailing view of habituation is that it, like learning in general, results from an increase in the efficacy of neural transmission, but, unlike learning, this increased efficacy primarily affects inhibitory interneurons (e.g., Soko1ov, 1960; Hernandez-Peon, 1960; Jouvet, 1961). Within this broad framework, disagreements exist regarding the source of the inhibitory influences.

It saw the last great attempt, after the anti-aristocratic reaction of the eighth century, to reorganize the Empire on lines similar to those of the occidental world. The founder of the Comnenian dynasty granted pronoiai, land for military purposes, and gave immunities which increased the intrusion of the landed aristocracy into the rights of the State.

A keen interest in this disorder has developed due to reports of increased incidence in the last decade (Giles and Shuttleworth, 1958; Ainley, 1961). Research has shown that most patients with megaloblastic bone marrow changes have either a low serum concentration of vitamin B12 or a low serum folate(1) activity, or both, which appear to be reasonably well correlated with the megaloblastic bone marrow changes (Lowenstein et al., 1962).
