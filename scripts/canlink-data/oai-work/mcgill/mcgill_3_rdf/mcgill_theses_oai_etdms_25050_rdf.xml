P. radiata was selected for fed-batch  reactor experiments due to its early laccase production, which was determined to be  growth-associated. A second peak in laccase activity was observed after several days  of nutrient deprivation and was attributed to autolysis of the culture. The effect  of protease activity on the accumulation of extracellular laccase activity differed  during primary and secondary metabolism, as observed under various conditions of  nitrogen and glucose availability. A mixed culture of P. radiata and P.  chrysosporium was grown on ammonium lignosulfonate, a by-product of the pulp and  paper industry, as sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Under these conditions,  laccase production appeared to exceed laccase production by P. radiata in defined  culture medium.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicell, J.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Cooper, D.

On the basis of Levi's conviction that language and  communication are an essential part of civilized human existence, such critics as  Brian Cliff, Patricia Sayre and Linnea Vacca have focused on the role of language in  the destruction of the human being in concentration camps, while Valerio Ferme and  Fabio Girelli-Carasi have also underlined the power of language to regenerate a  sense of humanity in Auschwitz and after. This paper attempts to integrate these two  approaches to the early work of Primo Levi, and illustrates the process of  linguistic destruction in Auschwitz on the one hand, and the subsequent rebirth of  communication both within Auschwitz and on Levi's long journey home, on the other.  Levi's attention to language and communication provides a focus which separates his  work from that of other witnesses and provides a unique vantage point from which to  view his Auschwitz experience.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kroha, L.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r154s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp01q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Levi, Primo.

Since the suppression of the marabout instances in the 19th and 20th  centuries, the population was never able to find the right role of religion in  society. The "second war of Algeria" does not only represent the climax of  a series of identity crises, but also the result, the consequence, of all the ones  which preceded it. The 1980 decade, which had preceded the civil war, was propitious  to the growth of social protest in Algeria. Like in most of the social crises that  Algeria had known, Islam was then the main vehicle for social  protest. This thesis intends to bring out the historical elements which  had led to the civil war opposing religious groups and the government. Through four  periods of the Algerian Islamic history, we will attempt to understand the evolution  of the Algerian religiosity. A link between these four periods emerges: the quest  for the national identity, to which a particular attention will be given. The goal  of this thesis is then to bring out the principal events of the Algerian Islamic  history in order to understand how a personal and dogmatic Islam became an  ideological and political Islam in the 1980's and 1990's. Therefore, this thesis will focus on Islam as a mobilisation,  protestation and resistance agent for the Algerian civil society. More precisely  this thesis will analyse how and why the Algerian Islam has been  "instrumentalised" either by the government and the religious leaders of  the society.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ormsby, Eric</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f4081.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dq288</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islam and politics -- Algeria</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- Algeria</dc:subject><dc:subject>Algeria -- Politics and government</dc:subject><dc:subject>Algeria -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801pg85d"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Récritures de récits criminels en France sous l'Ancien Régime</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Monette, Isabelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Three original stories are the basis for our study of rewriting  during the French Ancien Regime: the story of Thibaud de la Jacquiere, that of the  "sorcier Gaufridy" and that of the Marquise de Ganges, which Sade will  rewrite as a novel. Having all originated from a "canard", they appear in  the 1679 edition of the Histoires tragiques of Francois de Rosset, and two of them  can also be found in Francois Gayot de Pitaval's Causes celebres. Each of these  stories was rewritten by different authors at least three times. Using Gerard  Genette's theory of the narrative, we will analyse the processes of transformation  that the rewriting operates in the text, as well as the changes it imposes to its  original meaning. The number of rewritings of each text---up to five for the  Marquise de Gange---is a testament to the importance of textual reappropriation as  much as it shows the relevance of a study which brings to light the role of  rewriting in the survival of these stories.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Charbonneau, Frederic</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r39v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pg85d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>French literature -- 18th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Crime writing</dc:subject><dc:subject>French literature -- 17th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924c32f"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ita</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Italian</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>L'amor cortese provenzale fra hohe Minne e dolce stil novo</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hostert, Thomas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, a literary historic path on the development of  the lyric expression of courtly love will be created.

Tolkien's Middle-earth as elegiac romance</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hopkins-Utter, Shane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Tolkien's aesthetic enjoyment of distance and antiquity in  literature, his interest in the power of imagination, and his use of medieval  romances and ancient fairy-tales as a means of rediscovering an enchanted vision of  the world are analogous to the literary endeavours of the Romantics. Like them, he  perceives that the real world is inherently different from how he imagines an ideal  world. This thesis discovers that Tolkien's writings correspond in numerous ways to  the modern form of elegiac romance, most notably because of their positive  portrayals of mortality, and their depictions of intense yearning. The moral  imperative to accept death, exemplified by the heroic ethos of Old English  literature, clarifies why the effect of historicity is often noted in Tolkien's  fictions: time is mimetic rather than mythological. Tolkien demonstrates that  Fantasy is capable of reflecting the most sombre issues of the real world,  particularly the inevitability of death.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Borris, Kenneth</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dw143.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tp92v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tolkien, J.

Collected interviews---conducted with recently  diagnosed psychotic patients using the Turning Point Interview (TPI) grid---were  approached from a phenomenological and hermeneutical perspective in order to  illustrate the processual manner in which patients' insight (into the cause and  reason of illness) was the cognitive and epistemic derivative of dialogical  relations with other persons set within a socio-cultural matrix. The results of this  research indicate that the production of patients' insight in psychosis is an  inherently intersubjective and dialogic phenomenon which, in the clinical context,  occurs at two points of juncture: (1) a synchronic juncture where the patient is  interpellated by the clinician and hence positioned as a speaking subject, and (2) a  diachronic juncture where the patient, as a result of having been called into a  speaking position, constructs and authors a narrative account of significant events  related to his/her illness experience based on biographical memory. Insight was  shown to consist of 3 stages: (1) Detection of alteration of lived experience, (2)  Causal attribution, and (3) Global construction of meaning . Each stage was shown to  form the intersubjective and dialogic basis for the production of a subjectively  meaningful account of insight, using the lifeworid of the patients and the patients'  entourage as subjective frames of reference.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Corin, Ellen E.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pq91d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn106z75r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Insight in psychotherapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychoses -- Patients</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apv63g0812"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ita</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Italian</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nino Ricci's Lives of the saints : le ambiguità dell'immigrato</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Diadamo, Fiona</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A large part of Canadian literature being produced today is  being done by immigrants and the children of immigrants. Struggling between the  dominant culture and the history and traditions of their parents, whom they desire  to honor, these writers adopt modes of representation ranging from the elegiac to  the ironic. Nino Ricci's first book Lives of the Saints begins from the  perspective of Vittorio as an adult, but the narrative that the reader follows is  developed from his perspective as a child focusing on his ethnic roots. The  narrative structure is two-fold: it is a combination of the objectivity of a child's  innocent observations with a child's sense of wonder and magic and a strong  influence from the adult narrator's voice. This thesis will examine the narrative approach, the rhetorical  devices and the use of myth that Ricci harnesses in his novel in order to show how  his work is marked with ambiguity and paradox which points to the psychological  condition of immigrants in Canada. The discussion will also focus on some of the  literary models that influenced Ricci's narrative, such as Alice Munro, Carlo Levi  and Corrado Alvaro.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Predelli, Maria</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b45q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g0812</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ricci, Nino.

They embark on a  collaborative journey of empowerment and through the process reciprocally influence  each other's growth and emancipation. Through an autobiographical exploration of my experiences as a  student and as a teacher, I present an exploration of the concept of empowerment. I  explore its significance not only on the level of literacy development in my  kindergarten classroom, where I teach French in an Armenian heritage language  setting, but also on a more personal and professional level. Working in the  theoretical framework of teacher self-study, I present an epistemological  exploration of postmodern feminist research paradigms and discuss the various  aspects of autobiographical research. I build my thesis on the context of the  heritage language school and the critical analysis of my past experiences. I present  an account of the reflexive process I have engaged in during the past five years,  which, coupled with the theories of critical and feminist pedagogy, has brought  forth the main thesis of my dissertation: the interconnectivity of teacher and  student empowerment. In the hope of providing some practical material, I include an  appendix where I describe a collection of literacy activities from my kindergarten  classroom. My work provides insight into a teacher's journey of  meaning-making and empowerment, which will, I hope, be useful as part of a larger  exploration of teachers' work and students' experiences in  classrooms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Beer, Ann</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg31z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w7883</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reading (Preschool)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language arts (Preschool)</dc:subject><dc:subject>French language -- Study and teaching (Preschool) -- Armenian speakers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kh01b"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Quatre poètes au jardin des Oliviers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Baril, Joselle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the course of the romantic movement, the vision of the poetic  ministry has been expressed by several poets through the figure of Jesus at the  Mount of Olives. While Lamartine appropriates the suffering of Christ in order to  proclaim himself to be a poet-prophet, Vigny refuses the silence of God. He, thus,  accomplishes his poetic mission against God. Whereas Hugo does not take into  consideration the meaning of Jesus' agony in order to make the Gethsemane a place of  glory, Nerval rejects the notion of a Christlike mission. Hence, by putting into  words the death of God, he foretells what Hugo Friedrich will later call an  "empty transcendence", which is the very sign of modern poetics.  Romanticism carried within itself the signs of the end of transcendence of poetics.  Therefore, we will analyse the transition of romanticism to modernity in these four  poems1 through the representation of Jesus Christ at Gethsemane.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>1"Gethsemani ou la mort de Julia" d'Alphonse de  Lamartine, "Le Mont des Oliviers" d'Alfred de Vigny, un extrait (strophes  VI, VII et VIII du Chapitre intitule Jesus-Christ) de La Fin de Satan de Victor Hugo  et "Le Jardin des Oliviers" de Gerard de Nerval.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rivard, Yvon</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mm861.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kh01b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Romanticism -- France</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jesus Christ -- In literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>French poetry -- 19th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25x924j"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Promises made? : variance and liberalization in the Middle East</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Procyshen, Crystal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent events suggest Islamism is a relatively new trend;  however, Islamist organizations have functioned in the Middle East as entrenched  social movements, religious groups, and even political parties since the onset of  the 20th century. Moreover, the portrayal of these organizations as stagnant or  reified is inaccurate; these groups often display both verbal and behavioural signs  of tactical, strategic, and in some cases, ideological change over time. This study  explores if and how Islamist organizations change their platforms and pattern of  action in the context of the state-led liberalization (and its aftermath) that swept  the Middle East in the 1970s and 80s. This period of time is quite revealing with  respect to state-Islamist relations due to economic constraints compelling the state  to negotiate with domestic social forces that it would have otherwise repressed. In  many of these phases of controlled liberalization, the state and prominent Islamist  groups entered into an informal 'pact', which delineated the demands, promises, and  boundaries involved in this process of 'opening'. This study suggests that it is not  solely the violent or non-violent approach by the state to these groups that  determines whether Islamists employ conflictive or cooperative patterns of action.  Instead, this study hypothesizes that it is the convergence or divergence of the  state from the 'pact' that determines the Islamist response; this allows us to  better understand Islamist activity that seems 'unexpectedly' cooperative or  conflictive vis-a-vis the state. The case studies of the Muslim Brotherhood in  Jordan and Egypt, and the Front Islamique du Salut in Algeria allow for a  comparative exploration of this phenomenon.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brynen, Rex</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s542k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x924j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Jamʻīyat al-Ikhwān al-Muslimīn (Egypt)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam and state</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jabhah al-Islāmīyah lil-Inqādh (Algeria)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214p726"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Why political reform is likely in China : challenges to political stability</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Phaneuf, Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This paper suggests that a critical mass of elements is forming  in China which, if not better controlled, will lead to some form of political regime  change.

Those twenty years are set as  a sample both sufficiently rich and narrowly delimited as to permit a synchronic  analysis. The analysis itself is a close inspection of a large quantity of  poetry and fiction read in search of pan-textual recurrences. Constant features  found as such are presented in a quasi-index of characteristics and  quasi-characters-like figures, both seen as cliche, or topoi, and both linked to  various imaginary constructs about cruelty, fear and security, forestry, religion,  womanhood, alcoholism, etc. The poetics constraints in which those figures take  place are considered: for example, what role may or may not play an Amerindian  character in a narrative? Also analysed are underlying micro-narratives,  particularly those linked to progress and decay. The whole is not a unified system which would account for every  possibility; it may instead be conceptualized as series of trends which may or may  not combine or clash. Those cliches are read as signs of larger and collective  questionings, most notably about Quebec's self-image.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Di Stefano, Giuseppe</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903057t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bh841</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>French-Canadian literature -- 19th century -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indians in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988k51p"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Modalités de lecture du nouveau roman</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Macklovitch, David Nathaniel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we examine theories of reading as they apply to  three examples of the French New Novel. We begin with a detailed theoretical expose  in which we compare and attempt to reconcile the reading models of Umberto  Eco, Wolfgang Iser, Stanley Fish, Bertrand Gervais and Richard Saint-Gelais. The  hybrid theory thus obtained is then tested on three works in order to underscore the  modalities of reading that are particular to the New Novel, while insisting on these  modalities' inherent variability. We focus on the reader's reconstructing of the  narrative in L'Emploi du temps , on the impossibility of structuring the plot in La  Maison de rendez-vous, and on the paradigmatic mode of reading La Bataille de  Pharsale. In so doing, we hope to demonstrate how an analysis of the reading process  allows for a heightened appreciation of the essential indeterminacy of the New  Novel, of its fundamental otherness. We conclude with tentative remarks on the  heuristic function of these texts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lane-Mercier, Gillian</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st187.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988k51p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>New novel (Literary movement)</dc:subject><dc:subject>French fiction -- 20th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bf59j"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>L'autre féminin dans les traités de démonologie (1550-1620)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hotton, Hélène</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Between the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the 17th  century, western Europe is the stage for one of history's demonological crisis. Many  critics associated this witch hunt with an episode of collective delirium and  perhaps also irrationality on the rise. Nevertheless, witchcraft is first and  foremost an object of knowledge---demonology---, which many writers, jurists and  theologians attempted to construct, define and constantly re-evaluate. Demonology  was progressively elaborated in the midst of a culture where multiples beliefs and  ideologies were interpreted to be the language, or the Christian testimony of a  universe troubled by the signs of devil. As we progress towards the 17th century, the demonological  discourse tends to distance itself from the traditional knowledge, searching for its  truth in facts and experience. Shifting towards empiricism, the witch's body becomes  the privileged stage for a confrontation between the devil and the judge. However,  in order for this body to reveal its monstrosity, the demonologist must become both  exegete and producer of words, which in turn, he finds in the witch as tangible  signs of her otherness. Moreover, in his desire to interrogate the witch, the  scholar wishes mostly to question the feminine nature, cloaking her with an  otherness of problematic and dangerous attributes. Through scholarly language,  Renaissance demonology wishes to significantly organize the divided world of  witchcraft and in the process, a certain feminine identity, diabolically  other. Through the works of two demonologists having had a direct  experience with trials, the Discours execrable des sorciers by Henri Boguet (1602)  and the Tableau de l'inconstance des mauvais anges et demons (1612) by Pierre de  Lancre, we explore the link between malefic femininity and witchcraft: the images  they convey, the fascination they trigger and their mirroring through and in  writing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qs64z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bf59j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Demonology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Boguet, Henry, d. 1619.

Questioning the assumption that  washback occurs automatically, without the basis of empirical research, studies have  been conducted in various contexts of English teaching and learning. No research,  however, on the washback effect of tests within the Korean English as a Foreign  Language (EFL) context has been carried out. The present study was designed to  examine the washback effect of the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT), a  university entrance exam, on EFL teaching and learning in Korean secondary  schools. This study first investigates the relationships among the  curriculum, the school textbooks, and the CSAT: (1) the relationship between the  curriculum and the textbooks and (2) the relationship between the curriculum and the  CSAT. Second, this study examines if a washback effect from the CSAT exists. This  study further discerns the nature of washback and the variable(s) influenced by the  washback effect. The results indicate that the curriculum corresponds to the  textbooks, while the CSAT does not represent the curriculum, and that there is a  negative washback effect of the CSAT on EFL teaching and learning. The variable(s)  influenced by the washback effect are negative attitudes that the participants of  the study have toward the test.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turner, Carolyn E.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483j933.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xs28m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Educational tests and measurements</dc:subject><dc:subject>Examinations</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching (Secondary) -- South Korea</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching (Secondary) -- Korean speakers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82k787t"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of East Asian Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A preliminary study of electronic commerce and its implications for China</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ding, Jie, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although China is removing barriers to the development of  electronic commerce, little systematic research has been undertaken on what  strategies it should adopt from the perspective of the government.

Based on comparisons in the  selected areas, bottlenecks in the development of electronic commerce in China are  identified as the following: the backwardness of the IT infrastructure, a  fragmentary payment system, an inadequate delivery system, and an insufficient tax  and legal framework. A tentative suggestion is that a strategic alliance be formed  between two existing technology and distribution trade networks.

In the second chapter, we analyze certain stylistic aspects of Ernaux's  writing in L'evenement (verb tenses, choice of words, syntax) which indicate that  she tries to be as authentic as possible while telling her story. In the third and  final chapter, we examine Ernaux's comments---in the text itself---on the writing of  L'evenement.

In his work, mechanization, sexuality, gender and animality are  recurring themes that cue the viewer to the profound anxiety that modernity had  unleashed a chaotic force into the city. Using an ecofeminist analysis, I show how  the disorder of the city was imagined as a primordial human condition in which a  previously disavowed connection to nature was suddenly foregrounded. Though Grosz's  renditions of Berlin scenes are ironic, they also revel in the demise of social  order. In this thesis, I argue that Grosz's art deploys the conceptual force of  unmastered nature as a critical tool, at the same time showing how nature was  integrated into the cultural fabric of urban life.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sloan, Johanne</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zt94q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm879</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Grosz, George, 1893-1959 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Berlin (Germany) -- In art</dc:subject><dc:subject>Germany -- History -- 1918-1933 -- Caricatures and cartoons</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neue Sachlichkeit (Art) -- Germany</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d034j"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language/><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Streamlined : for chamber orchestra with electric guitar and digital audio</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ledroit, Christien</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Streamlined is a musical composition for chamber orchestra.

SONET based systems at 10 Gb/s are under commercial  development, and it is likely that systems based on higher SONET hierarchies will  soon be required for further broadband communications networks. This thesis describes a low-noise and low-power Si-bipolar  transimpedance preamplifier for the front-end of an optical-fibre receiver using a  0.5 mum 25 GHz self-aligned double poly silicon bipolar process. Design  specifications are met through trade-offs between input noise current, speed,  transimpedance gain, power dissipation, impedance matching, and supply voltage. This  was achieved by (1) using inductors to enhance the bandwidth, (2) using a tuned  noise-matching network at the input to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), (3)  and using frequency compensation techniques to improve stability and to further  enhance the bandwidth of the preamplifier. In this thesis, the design of the amplifier is preceded by an  analysis of four different circuit topologies, with focus on three main design  parameters: bandwidth, input-referred noise, and power dissipation. This is followed  by a discussion of the specific bipolar transimpedance amplifier (TIA) designed and  fabricated, and the integration of an optoelectronic device model with the  preamplifier for the purpose of testing. Design, simulation, layout and test data of  the preamplifier are presented in detail. The performance of the TIA is finally  discussed based on measurements.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>El-Gamal, Mourad</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881m58r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jp31q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fm07q"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Human arm gesture detection and recognition in a classroom environment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yao, Jie, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Detecting (and recognizing) human arm motion in a typical  classroom environment is a challenging task due to the noisy and highly dynamic  background, varying light conditions, as well as the small size and multiple number  of possible matched objects.

The cylinder was  oscillated at small peak-to-peak amplitudes and frequencies lower than and near the  natural Kannan frequency. The shear layers responded in a way such that their  characteristics were modified depending on the frequency and amplitude of  oscillation. Results showed that as the oscillation frequency increased, the shear  layers were highly disturbed, the shear-layer instability was promoted upstream and  its frequency increased, the shear-layer vortices formed antisymmetrically and  closer to the cylinder, the vortex formation region characteristics changed and the  vortex formation process was enhanced. Consequent effects on the near-wake flow  structure were observed; these ranged from variations in the wake width to reduction  in the drag on the cylinder. The wake width increased to a maximum at subharmonic  forcing, only to decrease again to values close to that of the stationary cylinder  case at harmonic forcing. Further increase in the oscillation frequency resulted in  the narrowing of the wake. Reduction in the drag on the cylinder as well as an  indication of an increase in the vortex strength was observed at several  oscillations frequencies. These effects suggest a potential and promising means of  controlling the vortex formation mechanism and the near-wake flow structure by  controlling the behavior of the shear layers through rotational  oscillations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lee, Tim</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j61b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365572m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21tg02z"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation into the multiple equilibria of the load flow problem</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rodriguez, Cuauhtemoc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The load flow problem consists of finding the bus complex  voltages that balance the power injections and power flows in a transmission  network. Two linear formulations using continuous and integer variables are  developed in order to find all the multiple equilibria of the load flow  problem. The thesis begins with an analysis of the load flow equations  together with the notions of feasibility regions and multiple  equilibria. Two new load flow formulations in polar coordinates are  presented as mixed-integer linear problems. In the first one, the nonlinear nature  of the equations is represented by segmenting the sinusoidal terms into a large  number of linear components each of which is assigned a binary variable. In the  second formulation, the sinusoidal terms are approximated with a large number of  tangent planes, with each transmission line being assigned a single binary variable  to denote whether the angle difference is positive or negative. A combinatorial  approach is used to identify all the load flow solutions. Both formulations are tested on two systems: a 3-bus, 3-line and  a 6-bus, 7-line. The former has been widely studied and its multiple equilibria are  known. The latter represents a larger system with up to 64 load flow solutions,  whose exact number is parameter-dependent and generally unknown.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galiana, Francisco D.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fx45x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tg02z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
