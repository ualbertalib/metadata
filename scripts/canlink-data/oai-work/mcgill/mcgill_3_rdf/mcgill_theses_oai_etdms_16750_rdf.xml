This boom, involving the reticular system of the brain, has encompassed diverse fields of study, including psychology. Several symposia, numerous reviews and hundreds of papers devoted to this system emphasize its increasing popularity among those interested in cerebral function. The inclusion, in a recent introductory textbook of psychology (Hebb, 1958), of the roles which the reticular system may play in behavior, is an indication of its importance in present psychological thinking.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hebb, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kk81p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784q13s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247dx04n"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An antiviral substance from penicillium cyaneo-fulvum</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cooke, Patricia.

High-grade migmatitic plagioclase gneisses and amphibolites, with quartzites and metamorphic pyroxenites, were intruded sub-concordantly by gabbro. These older rocks were intruded by magmatic plutons of pyroxene-microperthite quartz-monzonite, with hornblende-microperthite quartz-monzonite and migmatitic microcline granite. Late basic sills and granite dykes occur. </dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mg56k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053k85w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajw827g39r"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>the Measurement and Analysis of Acoustical Impulse Noise</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bradley, C.W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In order that acoustical impulse noise may be studied to determine the relationship between the effects of the noise on man and his exposure, a detailed analysis of the noise is required.

What was the nature of the early social life in French Canada, where the dominant form of social grouping was to be the parish? Much has been written of the early French seigneurs-- the noblemen who came to the wilderness that was Canada, and who established their large estates, or seigneuries.
