The analysis of Aflaq's published essays and speeches focuses upon his treatment of religion in general and of Islam in particular. In order to present a valid analysis of his writlngs, the origins of Aflaq's thinking are traced to the experiences and influences he underwent. It is shown that, although Aflaq uses religious terms and concepts, he deprives them of all supra-human implications. Thus, the particularism engendered by different religious modes of worshlp loses much of its significance. Since Islam is, for Aflaq, the greatest expression of Arabism at its partlcular time, therefore, all Arabs, including Christians, can find themselves only through Islam. Arab nationalism, as expressed by Michel Aflaq, is secular only to the extent of subsuming Islam wlthin Arabism while resurrecting the philosophical and ethical principles of Islam suitable to the present time. For Aflaq, the principles suitable to the present lie in freedom, unity, and socialism.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vm986.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784q48w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arab nationalism -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aflaq, Michel, 1910-</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gh90s"><ual:graduationDate>1974</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Muslim-Christian relations during the reign of the Mamlūk Sultan Al-Malik Al-Manṣur Qalā'ūn (6781279-6891290)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Northrup, Linda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most modern studies have portrayed the Mamluk period as that in which the Christian population of the Mamluk empire reached its demise. Two reasons are most often given for this situatoon: 1) the effect of the Crusades in arousing anti-Chrtstian sentiment and 2) the Mongol invasions to which  several Christian powers gave active assistance. This study which is limited to the contemporary and later Arabic chronicles and which examines the reign of Qala'un as a case study for the Mamluk period, indicates that contrary to this view, no correlation exists between these two historical factors and the treatment of Christians in the Mamluk period during the relgn of Qala'un. In fact, the situation of the indigenous Christians seems to have been relatively stable. Those measures which were instituted were taken against a particular category of Christians, not against the populatlon as a whole. Not only do the Mamluks of this period seem to have distinguished between various Christian parties in their treatment of them, but a variety of opinion concerning Christians seems to have existed among various elements of the Muslim population as well. Furthermore, Mamluk policy at this period toward foreign Christian powers does not seem to have been motivated by purely religious considerations. Thus, our views concerning the Mamluk period must be revised to recognlze that, although the Mamluk period was certalnly a period of decline for Christianity, it should, nevertheless, not be described uniformly as being one of disaster for the Christian community.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t321v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gh90s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mamelukes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Christianity and other religions -- Islam</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- Relations -- Christianity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Egypt -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jz465"><ual:graduationDate>1973</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le rôle d'Abraham dans le Coran et l'Islam : une religion universelle?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Malka, Jacques</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The question of the important role played by Abraham in the Qur'an has rais d many controversies between the Orientalists. For some of them, such as Snouck-Hurgronje, Abraham holds in the Our'an a quasi-political role which gives some independance and some authenticity to Mohammed's Mission. For others, such as youakim Mubarak, Muhammad followed Abraham because he saw him as the perfect religious pattern, responding to his own ideal. As for us, our opinion is that Abraham is, the "universal Father of all the Believers" (Qùr'an II. 118). He is consequently a personage with a universalist character. We wonder then that Muhammad, who made of Islam an abrahamic religion, was not looking for an answer to his own oecumenical vocation; moreover, did not he try, through Islam to structure a religion with universal character? Our study consists of two parts. In the first one, we expose the principal thesis and the textual criticism about Abraham's role in the Qur'an. In the second part, we expose the different aspects which attract us to see in Islam a universal religion. And, while in our introduction, after a short analysis of the subject, we present Abraham such as he appears in the Qur'an, our conclusion calls for both judeo-christian religions to reconsider positively the messianic elements contained in the Mohammed's Message, in view of a final and oecumenical dialogue.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806415w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jz465</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Abraham (Biblical patriarch) -- In the Koran</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903408q"><ual:graduationDate>1973</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The origin and development of the mosque in pre-colonial West Africa</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mala, Samuel Babs</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This survey investigates the origin and growth of the mosque in pre-colonial West Africa emphasizing both the traditional and Islamic context. Initially the traditional West African society is observed with special emphasis on those features which were to affect the mosque. The origin of Muslim places of worship is examined, indicating the types of people and places involved. The various activities performed in the mosque and the role of the mosque personnel are seen to cover every aspect of Muslim life and to be similar to what obtained in other Muslim lands. It is discovered that because the mosque is an institution introduced from without, conflict took place between Muslims and traditional worshippers with regard to the use of places of worship. Nevertheless, the interaction between the old and the new faiths is still a remarkable feature of West African Islam.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>R. N.

In the West major work on Tradition was undertaken first by Ignaz Goldziher in his Muhammedanische Studien (1888). His investigation into Umayyad history convinced him the period allowed the influx of numerous forgeries. These Traditionserdichtungen so overcame Tradition that no attempt in the Abbasid era could ever repair the damage. The second major scholar of Tradition was Joseph Schacht. Though his book The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence (1950), treated the legal work of al-Shafi'i in particular, his evaluation of al-Shafi'i's fight for the position of Tradition in law led Professor Schacht to make numerous conclusions about the authenticity and growth of traditions. Most recently Nabia Abbott in her Qur'anic Commentary and Tradition (1967) has taken a fresh look at Tradition. With the aid of early papyri fragments and an intensive combing of the sources on the scholarly practices of early traditionists, Miss Abbott was able to identify certain types of traditions as authentic and to show the genesis of scholarly interest in traditions from the time of the prophet himself. These three represent the best scholarship on Tradition available. They represent too varying approaches and evaluations. In short, their work points to more fruitful scholarship.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72pc287.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386p59c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Schacht, Joseph, 1902-1969</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- Study and teaching -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Goldziher, Ignác, 1850-1921</dc:subject><dc:subject>Abbott, Nabia, 1897-1981</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- Study and teaching -- 19th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2n49t6126"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The conflict between Muhammad and the Jewish tribes of Medina</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Watters, John F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis represents the result of a close study of the early Arabic sources concerning the long and violent conflict between Muhammad and the three Jewish tribes of Medina: the B. Qaynuqa, B. al-Nadir and B. Qurayzah. It is discovered that in his actions against these tribes the Prophet was not acting from a simple anti-Jewish bias but in order to protect himself and his community from these potentially very dangerous centers of opposition. Thus the elimination of the Jewish tribes from the oasis is the result of Muhammad's efforts to break up centers of opposition and thereby make secure his own community. In his long struggle with the Jewish tribes Muhammad skillfully isolated the three tribes--from each other as well as from their Arab allies-- and eliminated their dangerous presence one by one, beginning with the weakest of the three tribes. The  justifications set forth by Muhammad for actions against the Jews are almost without exception political in nature (although the Jewish opposition was primarily religious in nature), and redress was usually called for under the traditional tribal law. On the rare occasions when the tribal law would not support his actions, Muhammad used revelation as justification.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816r596.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t6126</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Jews -- Saudi Arabia -- Medina</dc:subject><dc:subject>Muḥammad, Prophet, d. 632 -- Campaigns</dc:subject><dc:subject>Judaism -- Relations -- Islam</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- Relations -- Judaism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247dx47f"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Christian missionary attitudes towards Islam in India : Catholic missionaries, 1580-1700; Protestant missionaries, 1790-1850</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Skaff, Joseph A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis begins with a brief survey of Christian-Muslim interaction in India.

As there exists an essential relationship between authority and society, we have presented the social and economic organization and the ideal values of the pre-Islamic Arabs which might have influenced their conception of authority. That is why we discuss the Bedouin and the urban settlements separately. As a possible origin and justification of authority, we discuss its connection with religion, in particular, whether in pre-Islamic times there ever existed a theocratic rulership.

Arab scholar who was among the first of his race to interest himself in strictly philosophical questions. Al-Kindi's writings were among the first fruits of the translation of Greek philosophical and scientific works into Arabic. It is under that aspect that this thesis approaches his views on soul and intellect - as an instance of the passage of Greek philosophical ideas to the Muslim Arabs. Apart from his specifically Islamic position on the nature and value of divine revelation, nearly all of al-Kindi's ideas on psychology can be traced to Greek sources, and the version of that philosophy with which he was directly familiar was that of the late Greek schools. This thesis is an attempt to understand and present al-Kindi's psychology in the light of the Greek sources from which it was derived.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nabil Shehaby</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xn68k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3015491</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kindī, d. ca. 873</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metaphysics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islamic philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap5547w469"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A historiographical study of four works of al-Ḥājj ʻUmar ibn Abī Bakr of Kete-Krachi</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mustapha, Talatu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Modern African historians have agreed that the use of indigenous African Muslim historical writings is an important tool for modern interpretation of African history because the majority of source materials that have been previously relied on for the interpretation of African history are for the most part inadequate in giving Africa's view point of its past.

The Hadith literature introduces an image of Jesus as the prophet-messiah who will descend at the end of history, destroy false religion and confirm the truth of Islam. This concept of the descent of Jesus is studied in this thesis, both in relation to the Qur'an and as part of a wider eschatological development in which Muslims, after Muhammad's death, expressed various views on the meaning and end of history.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wh591.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956m03b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Jesus Christ -- In the Koran</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jesus Christ -- Islamic interpretations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hadith -- Criticism, interpetation, etc</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arb68xh03r"><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The spread of the Satpanth Ismāʻīlī Daʻwa in India to the fifteenth century</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nanji, Azim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is concerned with tracing the rise and spread of that section of the Nizari Ismaili Da'wa which eventually gave rise to what has come to be known as Satpanth Ismailism. The spread in turn involves studying the activities and identifying the various da'is or pirs who came to India and spread the Satpanth doctrine. It is fundamental to the study of movements like Ismailism, that the historical context in which they spread be understood clearly and it is only in this way that one can hope to understand the intellectual assumptions of the movement, in relation to the technique of propagation adopted by the da'wa. Hence the thesis is also concerned, as far as possible, to set out systematically the historical context within which Satpanth Ismailism spread, in order to establish some sort of an identity for it.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rj431.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xh03r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ismailites -- India</dc:subject><dc:subject>Da'wah</dc:subject><dc:subject>Khojahs -- India</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sm247"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The spread of Islām in Bengal in the pre-Mughul period (1204-1583 A.D.) : context and trends</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Milot, Jean-René</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The origin of the Bengali Muslims became a much debated question after it was found out that they formed the majority of the population of Bengal, especially in the rural areas. This thesis does not tackle the whole problem (origin of the Bengali Muslims); it is primarily concerned with one aspect of it, viewed over a limited period of history which seems peculiarly significant. It starts with the question: how did Islam spread into Bengal during the pre-Mughul period (1204-1538 A.D.)? The attention is focused on Islam as a religious belief, in an attempt to review and assess different factors which may account for its spread in Bengal. Chapter I ("Pre-Islamic Bengal") surveys the past history of Bengal and its condition at the time of the Muslim conquest, in order to suggest a link between some trends of that history and the developments of the Muslim period.  Chapter II ("Socio-political factors") summarizes the political history of the Muslim period undar review, pointing out features which form the context of the religious developments; it examines the part played by the immigration of Muslims from other areas, and discusses the situation of the non-Muslim subjects in relation with the phenomenon of conversion to Islam. Chapter III ("Religious factors") tries to describe and assess the prominent role played by the Sufi saints in the spread of Islam in Bengal. Their activities are related to the general background of Sufism in India, to the features of Islâm in Bengal as well as to pre-Islamic history; this suggests a reassessment of the modern idea of "conversion" as applied to the phenomenon recorded in Bengal during that period.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935706p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sm247</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bengal (India) -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- India -- Bengal -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h365w"><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The path of Subud : a study of 20th century Javanese mysticism founded by Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjoja</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kafrawi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the origins, nature, and characteristics of the Subud mystical order which is an expression of Javanese Red (abangan) Muslim mysticism.

There was a similar struggle among the ghilman, the class to which Munis belonged. From the start, those ghilman particularly the Hujariya and the Masaffiva appeared as armed political groups rather than apolitical military units.  The purpose of this thesis is to deal with Munis' political and military career at the 'Abbasi court between 296-321/908-933. Three focal areas were chosen for this study. (1) The struggle for power between the military class and the kuttab as exemplified by Munis' struggle with the wazir Ibn al-Furat. (2) The struggle for power within the military class itself as it appears through Munis' struggle with Harun b. Gharib and Yaqut. (3) The struggle between the military class and the khalifa as shown hy Munis' conflict with al-Muqtadir and al-Qahir.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Richard N.
