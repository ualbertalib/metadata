Grounded in her account of moral agency and her analysis of force, Simone Weil's critique of rights language goes beyond, although it contains, the Marxist view of rights language as ideological, as masking power relations. Weil argued not only that humans are unable to extract themselves from social and economic relations in order to appear equal on the political level, but also they are unable to extract themselves from the consequences of force. The thesis clarifies the Weilian appeal to examine in detail the consequences of force as a precondition to justice. Failure to conduct such an examination Weil views as a flight from reality, a consolation. Weil argued that facing the consequences of force is a virtue and requires the exercise of attention, a pivotal concept of her paradigm of renunciation. Weil's ethical category of affliction represents the psycho-social dimensions of extreme forms of victimization. Weil distinguished three objects of violation that compose reification: the body, self-interpretation and relatedness. The capacity to articulate, Weil argues, is impaired by practices which result in affliction. The recognition of muteness engenders understanding of the depth of violation. The impact of the muteness of the afflicted on the public sphere, discourse, and conceptions of justice is disclosed by the ethical category of affliction. The category of affliction discloses, not the absent voice but, the absence of a voice.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g14n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zr939</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human rights</dc:subject><dc:subject>Weil, Simone, 1909-1943</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language and languages -- Moral and ethical aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ethics, Modern -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613mz62f"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation on the solvent extraction of rhodium from aqueous chloride solutions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Benguerel, Elyse</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aqueous behaviour of rhodium (III) (Rh) in chloride solutions was investigated with the objective of evaluating its response to solvent extraction with 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives. A theoretical analysis of the abundance of the various chloro-complexes in solution revealed that monoaquo-pentachlororhodate and hexachlororhodate are the most common forms of Rh(III) in chloride solutions ($&gt;$0.5M Cl$ sp{-}$) and that the relative abundance of hexachlororhodate may be lower than was previously reported. The extraction degree of Rh(III) with 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives from solutions ranging in acidity from 0.7 to 8.0M and in chloride concentration from 0.7 to 4M was found to follow the calculated abundance of hexachlororhodate (about 5 to 40% in the region investigated). Also, the extraction mechanism was deduced to be ion-pair formation. The extraction degree of Rh(III) from similar solutions but previously treated with SnCl$ sb2$, was also investigated, and in this case the extraction was quantitative throughout the acidity and chloride concentration ranges tested. Virtual quantitative stripping can be achieved with four five-minute contacts with 1.7M H$ sb2$SO$ sb4$ + 1M Na$ sb2$SO$ sb4$. A preliminary flowsheet for the industrial application of this solvent extraction process for Rh is presented.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rm47q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mz62f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jv89b"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Human Communication Disorders</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Utilisation des contextes semantique et syntaxique chez des patients dements de type Alzheimer : evidence à partir de taches de lecture et d'epellation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bergeron, Mylène</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Syntactic and semantic abilities were compared in 12 patients with mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer-Type (DAT) and matched controls.

These responses are particularly viewed in light of the recent discovery of de Man's World War II journalist writings. Through this critical survey, the thesis approaches a reading of deconstruction through the debate surrounding the authority of one of the theory's principal practitioners. The thesis is organized into three chapters, with each analyzing an important term in the debate on de Man. The first chapter, "Name", considers the linguistic positing of authorial identity. The second, "Autobiography", reads the rhetorical transformation from an author's life to text. "Responsibility", the third chapter, outlines the ethical aspect to de Man's critical theory as it occurs through his definition of allegory.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gf10f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz72w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>De Man, Paul</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s357c"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of a broadband microwave interferometer for diagnostic measurements of detonations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lee, Julian, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the present study, the microwave interferogram is digitized and analyzed using computer software developed to facilitate the extraction of velocity information from the microwave Doppler interference signals by applying digital signal processing techniques. The waveguide or detonation tube of the present microwave interferometer consisted of a copper tube 38.4 mm in diameter, 3.5 m long, with a thin wire stretched along the center axis acting as a center conductor for the coaxial configuration. The system was tested at microwave frequencies of 6.70GHz and 9.21GHz by performing a number of detonation experiments in explosive gaseous mixtures of C$ sb2$H$ sb2$ + 2.5O$ sb2$ and C$ sb3$H$ sb8$ + 5O$ sb2$, at low initial pressures (6torr to 80torr). Average velocity measurements obtained by the microwave method generally agreed with independent photodetector measurements to within 2%. In this study, the present technique has been used to explore unstable detonations near the limit. This demonstrates that the improved microwave Doppler interferometer is particularly well suited for unstable detonations where the large scale velocity fluctuations must be monitored continuously. It may be concluded that the present coaxial configuration microwave Doppler interferometry technique shows promise as a useful diagnostic tool for studying unstable detonations.

It was found from the experiments that (1) vacuum chamber pressure had a significant effect on the rate of decarburization when the carbon content was below 35 ppm; (2) sulfur did not show any significant effect on the rate of decarburization due to the strong stirring inside the droplet caused by magnetic levitation field; (3) the rate of decarburization of levitated droplets was 3 ppm/sec at (C) = 30 ppm which was 40 times higher than the overall rate of decarburization in the RH process at (C) 30 ppm; (4) high initial oxygen contents improved the rate of decarburization at high carbon contents. The following suggestions are made: (1) increase the amount of liquid steel droplets without increasing the size of the droplets; (2) increase the fraction of the amount of decarburization reaction inside the molten steel by gas and powder injection; (3) further reduce the partial pressure of CO and CO$ sb2$ gas in the gas phase.

The hidden question is: "Can Lipman's program withstand McPeck's critique?" Is there anything that can be salvaged? Though McPeck's critique undermines Lipman's claims regarding the use of generic thinking skills as a means of educating a critical thinker, this thesis suggests that the skills that Lipman calls "generic" seem to exist. In addition it is suggested that what is needed is to find out what impedes their transference. This thesis suggests that McPeck's reflections and critique should send us to prepetual inquiry which is the very heart of "Philosophy for Children" where Lipman's program should be viewed simply as a resting place out of which to jump on to better answers.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r2141.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j670f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Philosophy -- Study and teaching (Elementary)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57ns15d"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Social mix and quality of life issues in residential environments</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shoiry, Nancy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible relationship between social mix and the quality of life in housing. Quality of life is measured by levels of satisfaction, social integration, mobility and freedom of choice, etc. This study has identified some factors which may have an effect on the quality of life in socially mixed housing projects. This study has formulated general observations from these factors which could influence the way the built environment is shaped, especially ways in which residents, can or cannot, appreciate and tolerate social mix. The evidence indicates that design, quality of construction, good management, and the overall environment are much more important for the acceptance and satisfaction of the residents than the question of social mix. Even so, the findings indicate that some of the positive and negative quality of life aspects derive from social mix.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jp894.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57ns15d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Housing -- Resident satisfaction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak0698860x"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Land and water appraisal for irrigation in Richelieu and St-Hyacinthe counties, Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Papineau, France</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Suitable areas for subirrigation and sprinkler irrigation were identified in Richelieu and St-Hyacinthe counties. Land suitable for subirrigation includes uniform sandy textured profiles deeper than 1 m, with hydraulic conductivities greater than 0.5 m/d and lying on a clay layer at approximately 2 m from the surface, and with slopes less than 0.5% and little or no microrelief. Soils that failed to satisfy the subirrigation criteria and that would most benefit from sprinkler irrigation were identified. These soils had available water holding capacities of less than 7.5 cm per 100 cm of soil. Most of the soils suitable for sprinkler irrigation were shallow sand (50 cm) over clay. Both the Richelieu and St-Lawrence Rivers could meet the flow demand for the total irrigated area. However, 57% of the subirrigable land is located at more than 20 km from the Richelieu and St-Lawrence and could be more economically supplied by the Yamaska River. The Yamaska River could supply all the subirrigated land in its vicinity (4 900 ha) and part of the land suited for sprinkler irrigation (1 000 ha) 4 out of 5 years.

The immediate origins of the Pact were studied in order to put into context the individual responses of the various countries, known as the Axis Powers. Each of these countries was confronted with a dramatic change in the European situation and each had to adjust its relations with Germany in accordance with its own interests and expectations for the question of war or peace in Europe. With the exception of Hungary, all were opposed to the Pact because it seemed to run contrary to their national interests and promised to upset the Balance of Power on the European, and indeed, the Asian continent. The thesis thus illustrates the special character of Hitler's diplomacy, in the last year of peace before the Second World War, which did not consider the interests of his partners when concluding his arrangements with the Soviet Union.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s5932.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712m772t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Germany -- Foreign relations -- Soviet Union</dc:subject><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- Diplomatic history</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soviet Union -- Foreign relations -- Germany</dc:subject><dc:subject>Germany.

Job scarcity, that is the inadequate quantity of available jobs relative to the number of persons able to hold them, which is a chronic problem, has played an important role in the development of discrimination. The hypothesis of the thesis is that a positive relation exists between discrimination against women and job scarcity: as employment opportunities deteriorate discrimination intensifies. The thesis verifies the discriminatory effects of job scarcity by examining the process of job allocation in the economy. An historical study covering the end of the last century to the crisis of the 1930's is the vehicle used to examine the employment rationing mechanisms that consolidated discriminatory practices.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p830n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t036v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- Employment -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex discrimination against women -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Unemployment -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Discrimination in employment -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex discrimination in employment -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak06988616"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regional hog supply response to stabilization programmes in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Churches, Malcolm C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this research was to determine the nature of hog supply response in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta over the period 1968-1986. Special emphasis was placed on the role of government stabilization programmes. The research examined the development of the North American hog industry and described the various federal and provincial assistance programmes that were available to hog producers over this period. Using an adaptive expectation framework, separate linear equations for each province and three pooled data equations were specified. The equations were estimated using four procedures namely, Hildreth-Lu, instrumental variables, quasi-generalized least squares and augmented least squares. Results indicate that (1) stabilization programmes exhibit positive effects in Quebec and negative effects in Alberta and Ontario, although in no province are these coefficients statistically significant and (2) that response to risk varies across provinces. This research concludes that other factors including vertical integration and western grain market conditions may have been important factors in production shifts during this period.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343t33g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k06988616</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Animal industry -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Swine -- Canada -- Marketing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Swine -- Services for</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33rx78f"><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The reliability and validity of the Erhardt Developmental Prehension Assessment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pollock, Nancy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Erhardt Developmental Prehension Assessment (EDPA) was designed as a measure of hand function for use with developmentally and physically disabled children.

The EDPA was initially revised by standardizing the procedures for administering the test and developing an objective scoring system. Thirty developmentally disabled children ranging in age from 3 to 18 months were tested in this study. The results indicate that the EDPA has high levels of inter-observer reliability, and that it has concurrent validity with the PDMS in this population.

The generic, as well as socio-aesthetic discussion of Camp Concentration, 334, and On Wings of Song, traces Disch's development of a characteristically "Dischtopian" paradigm of social SF.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g79m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602191s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Disch, Thomas M</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dystopias in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Science fiction -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f240p"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>In-Situ vadose-zone monitoring and hydrologic evaluation of sulfide-mine mill-tailings wastes at Waite Amulet, Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Woyshner, Mark R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A thorough review of soil-water energy theories and soil-moisture measurement techniques are presented. Monitoring of piezometric head and soil-moisture potential and content at 3 vertical profiles was conducted along a cross section through Waite Amulet tailings, Quebec. Results characterized the subsurface hydrology during the fall of 1990, a recharge period, which shed light on the hydrologic controls of tailings oxidation. Infiltration rates, wetting front velocities, hydraulic conductivities, and field capacity were determined. The presence of a tree cover increases infiltration by a factor of three. Recharge peaks reflected the conversion of tension-saturated to pressure-saturated porewaters. And, a water balance showed soil-moisture storage was 53% of precipitation, saturated-zone recharge 31%, evapotranspiration 12%, and runoff 4%. The reliability of time-domain reflectometry to predict gravimetric water content of oxidized tailings was 88%. Heat dissipation sensors detected small dial fluctuations in response to evapotranspiration. Gypsum blocks proved valuable in detecting wetting fronts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yong, R.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kp318.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f240p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j333330s"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Large scale carbothermal synthesis of submicron silicon nitride powder</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Grenier, Serge</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The synthesis of silicon nitride (Si$ sb3$N$ sb4$) by carbothermal reduction of silica was sensitive to the processing steps used for the starting materials (SiO$ sb2$, C) and to the reaction conditions. A good degree of intimacy between the starting materials was required in order to obtain fine ceramic powders. The formation of Si$ sb3$N$ sb4$ was known to occur over a narrow temperature range (1450-1550$ sp circ$C). The morphology of the silicon nitride powder produced was also shown to vary widely depending on the reaction temperature. The amount and morphology of the silicon carbide formed was sensitive to impurities present in the precursors prior to the reaction. The nitrogen flow rate during reaction as well as the position of pellets in the reactor played a key role in the final SiC content of the powder. Results showed that the strength values of two carbothermal powders were excellent (507 and 577 MPa) considering their lower sintered densities which was the result of residual carbon present in the powder.

The principal task of this study is to analyze and measure the effects and impacts of population and housing intensification in the Toronto Central Area on travel demand during the morning peak period associated with this Toronto Central Area for the period 1975-90. The findings could prove to be a very valuable tool in managing growth and development in the Central Area. Detailed time series analysis from 1975 to 1989 is performed using the Metro Cordon Count data. A cross-sectional analysis for 1987 was also conducted using the 1987 Travel Diary Survey data. A simple travel demand model for the Central Area is developed to evaluate Cordon Count data.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px11w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193b106</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Urban and Regional Planning</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21tg50m"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Human Communication Disorders</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Rhyme priming in aphasia : the role of phonology in lexical access</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gordon, Jean K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present experiment was conducted to explore the facilitory effects of rhyme in lexical processing in brain-damaged individuals. Normal subjects and non-fluent and fluent aphasic subjects performed auditory lexical decision and rhyme judgement tasks, in which prime-target pairs were phonologically related (either identical or rhyming) or unrelated. Results revealed rhyme facilitation of lexical decisions to real-word targets for normal and non-fluent aphasic subjects; for fluent aphasic subjects, results were equivocal. In the rhyme judgement task, facilitory effects of rhyme were found for all three groups with real-word targets. None of the groups showed clear rhyme facilitation effects with non-word targets in either task. Findings are discussed with reference to models of lexical access and the role of phonology in lexical processing in normal and aphasic populations.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zh87j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tg50m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Speech Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rm498"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of nominal shocks on the real exchange rate</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abbey, Laurie-Ann Cecilia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study focuses on the effects of nominal shocks on the real exchange rate. The model used to determine the effects of a monetary expansion on the real exchange rate assumes instantaneously clearing asset markets and sticky goods prices. A monetary expansion causes the nominal exchange rate to initially overshoot its long run equilibrium value followed by a series of appreciations. The real exchange rate depreciates sharply and then appreciates until its initial value is restored. A simple monetary model, a sticky price monetary model and a random walk model are empirically tested with Canadian/U.S. data over the 1972-1989 time period. Both monetary models were rejected and the random walk model represented the best fit to the data. This evidence supports the hypothesis that the Canadian/U.S. nominal exchange rate follows a random walk process. An empirical examination of the Canadian real exchange rate over the 1970-1989 period confirms the hypothesis that since the advent of the floating exchange rate period, the Canadian real exchange rate movements have been much larger than most economists predicted.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w13f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rm498</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Foreign exchange rates -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Foreign exchange rates -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r217v"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An analysis of the temporal and spatial variability of the rainfall and runoff regimes of drainage basins in Trinidad</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dupigny, Lesley-Ann</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The interannual variability of tropical climates, including the tropical Marine climate, is best reflected in the rainfall activity of a given area. The effects of such variability are manifested in a number of ways on the physical landscape. However, this study focused on the ways in which the variability of the rainfall received on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, influenced the resulting streamflow discharges for different basins on the island. Various techniques such as time series analysis and spectral analysis, were used to identify the physical mechanisms, both local and non-variations in the regimes, such that the effects of easterly waves were observed in the rainfall; the Madden-Julian wave was identified in both the precipitation and streamflow regimes; there was evidence of a faster 14-25 day oscillation; and finally, the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone was found to be quasi-periodic in nature.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988m151.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r217v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rain and rainfall -- Trinidad and Tobago -- Periodicity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Runoff -- Trinidad and Tobago</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9k41zf62j"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Problèmes soulevés par le VIHSIDA en santé mentale au Québéc et en Ontario</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Locas, Lorraine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>HIV attacks the health of infected persons. Some of them will develop psychiatric illnesses. The first chapter examines two of the many possible consequences on mental health. First, an increased incidence of suicide on the part of infected persons and second, the influence of HIV/AIDS on their decisions concerning treatment, in particular when they are terminally ill. Some mentally ill persons with HIV/AIDS will be involuntarily hospitalized. The second chapter compares the mental health law of Quebec and Ontario governing involuntary hospitalization. The third chapter examines consent to or refusal of treatment by mentally ill persons with HIV/AIDS in particular with respect to their competence. It explores the law governing substitute decision-making for incompetent persons. The last chapter considers what protections of the rights of mentally ill people with HIV/AIDS are provided under Quebec and Ontario human rights codes and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827c84z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zf62j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494962b"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Monte Carlo study of relative depth doses at diagnostic energies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bussière, Marc R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is concerned with the creation, verification and implementation of a computer programme for simulating photon transport in diagnostic radiology. The programme is based on the Monte Carlo technique in which probabilistic problems are solved using random numbers. For this reason mathematical number generators along with a few standard tests which enable the randomness of the numbers to be evaluated are introduced. A discussion on sampling from probability distributions is presented with emphasis on the physical aspects of the Monte Carlo technique applied to low energy photon transport. The validity of the computer programme is established by comparisons with previously published Monte Carlo work, with predictions from an analytical photon transport model and with experimental measurements. The application of Monte Carlo simulations to specific radiographic problems are illustrated by the modeling of percent depth doses.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451j669.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494962b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qt22n"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Motivation to return and subsequent satisfaction among high school students enrolled in Montreal area outreach schools</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hatfield, David J.

Statistical analysis of questionnaire data revealed that major motivating factors for return to school were related to a desire for academic success rather than social or personal reasons. Younger returned dropouts were more likely to be motivated by the desire to obtain job skills than their older counterparts. Age and sex did not account for significant differences in motivation or subsequent satisfaction with school. Returned dropouts were generally well-satisfied with their current school experience. Major components of satisfaction were academic success and a variety of items related to teacher empathy, and competence. While there were no signficiant differences in satisfaction among participating schools, satisfaction scores were higher for those mid-way through alternative schools than for those students just beginning or nearing graduation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mn28b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qt22n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>High school students -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>High school dropouts -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
