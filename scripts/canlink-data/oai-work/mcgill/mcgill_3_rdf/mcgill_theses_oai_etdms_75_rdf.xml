Recently SUSs tend to rely on robust matchers to perform this task. This thesis describes a new method using classification trees acting as a robust matcher for speech understanding. Classification trees are used as a learning method to learn rules automatically from training data. This thesis investigates uses of classification trees in speech system and some general algorithms applied on classification trees. The linguistic approach requires more human time because of the overhead associated with handling a large number of rules, whereas the proposed approach eliminates the need to handcode and debug the rules. Also, this approach is highly resistant to errors by the speaker or by the speech recognizer by depending on some semantically important words rather than entire word sequence. Furthermore, by re-training classification trees on a new set of training data later, system improvement is done easily and automatically. The thesis discusses a speech understanding system built at McGill University using the DARPA-sponsored Air Travel Information System (ATIS) task as training corpus and testbed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DeMori, Renato</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085n33f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c461d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j308k"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Experimental study of aqueous and mineral surface al-aniline and al-2-chloroaniline complexation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yane, Lawrence</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In order to model the transport and fate of aniline and chloroaniline in the subsurface, the geochemical reactions between these contaminants and important metals and minerals surfaces must be quantified. The thermodynamic stabilities of the aqueous and surface aluminum-aniline and aluminum-2-chloroaniline complexes were investigated at 55$ sp circ$C and 80$ sp circ$C. Solubility and adsorption experiments place quantitative constraints on the thermodynamic properties of these complexes. No evidence was found for stable Al-aniline or Al-2-chloroaniline aqueous complexes. Conversely, the adsorption data provide unequivocal evidence for the presence of two distinct surface Al-aniline and A-chloroaniline complexes according to the following reactions: (1) $Aniline sp circ + { equiv}Al(OH) sp circ leftrightarrow { equiv}(AlOH(Aniline) sp circ$; (2) $Aniline sp circ + { equiv}Al(O) sp- leftrightarrow { equiv}AlO(Aniline) sp-$; (3) $Chloroaniline sp circ + { equiv}Al(OH) sp circ leftrightarrow { equiv}AlOH(Chloroaniline) sp circ$; (4) $Chloroaniline sp circ + { equiv}Al(OH sb2) sp+ leftrightarrow { equiv}AlOH sb2(Chloroaniline) sp+$. A constant capacitance model is used to quantify the stability constants for reactions (1) - (4), and the results yield equilibrium constant values of 10$ sp{2.09}$, 10$ sp{2.67}$, 10$ sp{2.87}$ and 10$ sp{2.30}$ respectively. These results indicate that mineral surface complexation can significantly affect total aniline and chloroaniline budgets.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fein, Jeremy</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860887x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j308k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m138b"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The response of a simple model atmosphere to sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Pacific</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Xing, Zeda, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The responses to positive and negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Pacific are computed with a time-dependent, quasi-geostrophic, global spectral model with a T21 horizontal resolution and three levels in the vertical. The simplicity of the model allows a large number of cases starting from different initial conditions to be run. The model produces on average a ridge (low) downstream of the warm (cold) SST anomaly, but the average response to the warm anomaly is much weaker and statistically less significant than that to the cold anomaly. In the case of the warm SST anomaly, the storm track is displaced northward into the high-pressure atmospheric anomaly, whereas in the case of the cold SST anomaly, the storm track is moved southward, away from the atmospheric low-pressure anomaly. The higher level of atmospheric nonlinearity in the warm cases leads to more case-to-case variability in the model response to the SST anomaly than for the cold SST anomaly.

Fifteen ovarian tumors (1 benign, 7 borderline, and 7 malignant tumors) and one normal control were successfully characterized using conventional cytogenetic methods. Among simple karyotypic changes, trisomy 10, not previously reported in ovarian cancer, was confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This latter may be considered as a single causative event or as one among many other chromosomal alterations, being both associated with ovarian tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Among complex karyotypic abnormalities, one cell one (OV90) was further characterized using combined GTG banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques with painting probes from all the chromosomes, and chromosome specific centromeric probes, and a 10p telomeric probe derived from a half-YACs. The short arm of one chromosome 3 was deleted and replaced by a homogeneous staining region (HSR) which was demonstrated to be originated from amplification of yet unidentified genes on chromosome 22. We also identified a complex chromosome rearrangement (CCR) involving chromosome 9, 10 and 17. A dicentric chromosome, dic(9;17)(p11;p11), and a derivative chromosome, der(10)del(10)(pter)t(10;17)(p15;p11.1p11.2 or p13) were demonstrated, with a deletion in the short arm of chromosome 9, and a partial deletion of chromosome 17p. A translocation of chromosome 10p telomere to chromosome 1p was also observed. In addition, partial trisomy of chromosome 13q14-qter was also characterized and considered to result from a duplication and a pericentric inversion.

Although several mechanisms may contribute to the appearance of multidrug resistance phenotype (MDR) in tumour cells, reduced drug accumulation and the ability of cells to undergo apoptosis are thought to be very important in expression of MDR. The work in this thesis focuses on the mechanism responsible for the reduced drug accumulation in tumour cells, mainly the multidrug resistance protein (MRP1). The molecular mechanism underlying the binding and efflux of drugs by the MRP1 is currently not well understood. Several studies have now demonstrated that the cysteinyl leukotriene C$ sb4$ (LTC$ sb4$) and other glutathione (GSH) S-conjugated anions are substrates for the MRP. To learn more about MRP-drug interactions, we characterized the binding of MRP to a non-glutathione photoactive quinoline compound (abbreviated, ASA-AQ) (Chapter II). Since MRP mediated multi-drug resistance can be modulated by the anionic quinoline LTD$ sb4$ cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist (MK571), we speculated that other quinoline-based compounds are likely to interact with MRP. In Chapter III, we show that MDR cells that express MRP1 are more resistant to the antimalarial drug, chloroquine. We also show that. chloroquine is a substrate for MRP1 drug efflux. Taken together, the results of this thesis describe the interactions of MRP1 with a quinoline-based photoactive drug and the antimalarial drug chloroquine.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Georges, Elias</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429c268.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dr53t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Quinoline -- Therapeutic use</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chloroquine -- Therapeutic use</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multidrug resistance</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cancer -- Chemotherapy -- Complications</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak0698948v"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Survey of Internet security protocols</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tse, Kent</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Internet is becoming a widely used medium for communications and electronic commerce. However, in the current state of the Internet, user applications need to be installed to ensure that these kinds of communications are kept confidential and private. The long term solution is to use IPv6, the new Internet Protocol, which incorporates authentication and encryption in the lower part of the network layers, but until then there are higher level protocol such as SSL and SSH, to name a few. In this thesis, a general problem that can be used to "hack" into computer systems is outlined. This is usually a first step before packet sniffing is used to collect more passwords from other communications. The IPv6 authentication headers and encapsulating security payload are introduced as the long term solution to combat both of the above problems. Finally, two current protocols are described that can authenticate and encrypt packets during communications on the Internet in the TCP/IP protocol without the need of the security features in IP (versions 4 and 6).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Avis, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w991.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698948v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dh72d"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Orthopaedic Research Laboratory</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Biomechanical comparison of anterior lumbar interbody fusion devices</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tsantrizos, Anthony</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The author quantified the initial stability provided by five different anterior interbody fusion implants.

Changes in neutral zone, range of motion and stiffness were analyzed. None of the tested implants managed to achieve a neutral zone decrease compared to intact, suggesting that interbody implants fail to eliminate micromotion at the bone-implant interface. However, implants were effective in reducing range of motion and increasing stiffness. Differences between implants were observed for flexion/extension neutral zone and for lateral bending neutral zone, range of motion and stiffness.

Populations of Amsinckia spectabilis var. microcarpa and A. furcata, two outcrossing taxa, and their self-fertilizing relatives, A. spectabilis var. spectabilis and A. vernicosa were studied.

An important part of its definition is a signaling mechanism, which is used to set up and release ATM connections. ITU-T defined a signaling protocol Q.2931, which is designated as an official standard for call control in both public and private versions of the ATM User Network Interface (UNI). The main goal of this thesis is to specify formally the signaling protocol in Estelle--one of the Formal Description Techniques (FDT). A specification written in an FDT offers great advantages as compared to an informal one. It is unambiguous; it may be used for protocol simulation and validation; and it may also serve as a basis for an actual implementation. In this study, we design and create a formal specification of the Q.2931 ATM signaling protocol. To demonstrate its signaling functionalities, we develop a simulation model representing the working environment of the protocol. We propose a validation methodology, which we use to show the conformance of our description to the requirements of the official protocol definition.

Inherent decomposition rates and nutrient dynamics of the litter composites were followed for one year. Samples of forest floor and mineral soil collected from within each plot were used to determine organic matter accumulation, pH, total nutrient contents in the forest floor and extractable nutrient concentrations in the mineral soil.

The preparation of uniform membranes containing large quantities of magnetite particles (Fe$ sb2$O$ sb3$) of defined site was our specific objective. For that purpose, cellulosic substrates of two different kinds: one of bacterial origin bacterial cellulose--BC), the other (Lyocell) derived from dissolving-grade wood-pulp through a dissolution/coagulation process (film-casting) were used as never-dried gel membranes. BC has also been used in the form of a suspension of open fibrillar pellets which were dried to a parchment after the in situ treatment. Characterization of the resulting magnetic materials was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in imaging and diffraction mode, X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and Mossbauer spectroscopy. In BC membranes, needle-like lepidocrocite ($ gamma$-FeOOH) formed along the cellulose fibrils, using the crystalline surface as a nucleation site. Spherical magnetite particles subsequently formed around the needles. The less swollen Lyocell substrates produced needle-like feroxyhite ($ delta$-FeOOH) concentrated at the membrane surface while spherical magnetite particles formed within the membrane after several cycles of treatment. The treated BC and Lyocell membranes were both superparamagnetic at room temperature. The BC suspensions had no space constraint hence the treatment conditions were more critical for controlling the morphology of synthesized ferrites. These conditions could be defined to yield homogeneous membranes containing magnetite particles uniform in size, too large however to behave superparamagnetically at room temperature.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th44p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k9193</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20sv795"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification of critical areas of non-point source pollution from flat agricultural watersheds</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Singh, Rajesh Kumar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research was undertaken to simulate the surface transport of water and chemicals from a flat agricultural watershed at the Green Belt farm in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that glycoprotein 330 (gp330), a low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, can mediate the endocytosis of SGP-2 in the nonciliated cells of the efferent ducts and cultured cells (Kounnas et al., 1995; Morales et al., 1996). The purpose of the present study were in part to correlate the expression of SGP-2 with gp330 along the epididymis to determine if gp330 was essential for SGP-2 internalization. In addition, experiments were carried out to determine which factor(s) are involved in the regulation of expression of these two proteins. The epididymides were fixed by perfusion with Bouin's fixative and examined with anti-SGP-2 and anti-gp330 antibodies using light microscope immunocytochemistry.

A study was conducted to investigate the viability of sod suppression by sheep grazing or mowing, as alternatives to herbicide, during pasture renovation with no-till seeding of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) or white clover (Trifolium pratense L.). Sod suppression methods evaluated were: strategically timed mowing or sheep grazing to 5 or 10 cm at seeding and during legume establishment, or similarly managed mowing or sheep grazing with an additional defoliation to 5 cm the previous fall. Additional treatments included suppression by herbicide and, unsuppressed and unseeded controls. Treatments were evaluated by determining clover plant population, botanical composition, forage yield and quality. Physical (mowing or grazing) and herbicide sod suppression resulted in similar clover plant populations; clover yields tended to be higher with herbicide suppression. However, increasing the intensity of physical suppression increased clover yields. Forage quality was increased only with sod suppression by grazing or herbicide when compared with the unimproved control. Although, for grazing this was attributed to a more frequent defoliation regime and not to the renovation itself. Unlike suppression with herbicide, physical suppression did not decrease total seasonal forage yields in the renovation year when compared with controls.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Peterson, P.

This study was undertaken to determine the appropriateness of thrombolytic use by Emergency Physicians, and to determine complication rates of ED thrombolysis. The charts of 137 patients admitted from a tertiary care hospital ED with acute coronary syndromes were assessed for concordance with standard Canadian thrombolytic guidelines, based on a blinded review by two independent assessors. The adjusted Kappa statistic for the overall concordance with the guidelines was 0.85 (95% CI 0.76-0.94). Hierarchical modeling was used to estimate the distribution of physician-specific concordance rates. Complication rates for thrombolysis in the ED were similar to previously reported rates. A logistic regression was also carried out to identify other independent predictors of thrombolysis after controlling for eligibility for thrombolysis; none were found. The results indicate excellent agreement between Emergency Physicians' clinical decisions regarding thrombolysis and standard Canadian thrombolysis guidelines.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Battista, R.

The presence of important maritime activities, as well as dredging operations and natural slumpling events, contribute to the resuspension of the Fjord sediments and changes in their redox conditions. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of sediment resuspension on the remobilization of trace metals (e.g. Hg, Cu, Ni, Pb, As, Fe and Mn). in the water column. Once dissolved in the water column, the trace metals are subjected to a suite of geochemical processes, while remaining available for the uptake by the biota, until they find their way out of the fjord or back into the sediments. The results of the resuspension experiments conducted in the laboratory reflect the reactivity of these anoxic sediments as well as the trace metal desorption and readsorption kinetics. By monitoring the behaviour of different metals we were able to differentiate between the reactivity of those metals which are preferentially associated with the sulphides and organic matter.

CD44 glycoprotein is a main extracellular receptor for hyaluronic acid. A single CD44 gene composed of 20 exons encodes a variety of isoforms due to alternative splicing of 10 middle exons. Overexpression of CD44 and appearance of abnormal isoforms containing products of variant exons have been implicated in the origin and progression of cancer, including human colon carcinoma. Of two main parts comprising the dissertation, the first one ("CD44 and the adhesion of neoplastic cells" by Z. Rudzki and S. Jothy) reviews the current state of knowledge on CD44, emphasizing its role in neoplastic processes. The second part ("Changes in CD44 expression during carcinogenesis of the mouse colon" by Z. Rudzki, L. LeDuy and S. Jothy) reports an experimental study of CD44 expression in a murine model of colon cancer. The tumors were induced by subcutaneous injections of a colon--specific carcinogen (1,2-dimethylhydrazine). CD44 expression was studied by RT-PCR/Southern blot and immunohistochemistry. The CD44 transcripts were generally strongly overexpressed in tumors compared with normal colon. Both neoplastic and normal colon samples exhibited the same complex array of transcript bands representing the standard molecule (CD44s) and its variant isoforms. Immunohistochemistry revealed marked heterogeneity of tumor staining, contrasting with a rather uniform mRNA overexpression. There was a significant tendency towards the progressive loss of CD44 immunoreactivity in larger and invading tumors. It is concluded that CD44 isoforms are globally overexpressed at an early, premacroscopic stage of colonic carcinogenesis. Expression of CD44 in the murine model of colon cancer shows some similarities to its human counterpart.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jothy, Serge</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53k003f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j96022839</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wj000"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dipole source analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials in normal subjects and patients with disorders of cortical development</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Routhier, Nathalie, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The somatosensory representations of hands and feet were determined using spatio-temporal source analysis of median and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs).

For median nerve stimulation, the main generator was located 3.5 mm from the central sulcus on average (after correction for eccentricity) and was perpendicular to it. For posterior tibial nerve stimulation, the main generator was slightly anterior to the central sulcus (average distance 6.6 mm) and pointed predominantly posteriorly and towards the longitudinal fissure. In 3 patients with central dysgenetic lesions, all with normal somatosensory functions, modeled generators were located outside the lesion, 2 of these generators being unequivocally displaced to adjacent normal cortex. The only exception was one patient with small amplitude SEPs, possibly explained by misaligned pyramidal cells inside the dysgenetic cortex.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gotman, Jean</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vs895.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wj000</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zj69t"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Connections between descriptive set theory and HF-logic</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Romanovski, Iakov</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis we give a positive answer to the question "Is it true that the set of all definable elements of $ rm { bf R sp{f}} subset$ R, where R is the set of real numbers, is elementary substructure of R in HF-logics?"

That is, how can two autonomous exploring agents that cannot communicate with one another over long distances meet if they start exploring at different locations in an unknown environment. The intended application is collaborative map exploration. Ours is the first work to formalize the characteristics of the rendezvous problem, and we approach it by proposing several alternative algorithms that the robots could use in attempting to rendezvous quickly while continuing to explore. The algorithms are based on the assumption that potential rendezvous locations, called landmarks, can be selected by the robots as they explore; these locations are based on a distinctiveness measure computed with an arbitrary sensor. We consider the performance of our proposed algorithms analytically with respect to both expected- and worst-case behaviour. We then examine their behaviour under a wider set of conditions using numerical analysis. This numerical analysis is confirmed using realistic simulation of multi-agent exploration and rendezvous. We also examine the exploration speed, and show that a multi-robot system can explore an unknown environment faster than a single-agent system, even with the constraints of performing rendezvous to allow communication. We conclude with a demonstration of rendezvous implemented in the real world.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dudek, Gregory</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cv996.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qk77w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t1184"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation of the use of VAD analysis and UHF profiler data to obtain a 2-D wind field</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Reichheld, Dean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this work, we explore the possibility of combining information from the VAD technique, with data from a wind profiler, to obtain the kinematic properties of a linear 2-D wind field. The idea is first tested on an artificial test-bed wind field, and the results show that the procedure is limited by the degree of non-linearity of the wind field over the wind profiler. To overcome this problem, some modifications are made to our procedure, which is then applied to real cases of stratiform precipitation. We find that the non-linearities are important enough such that the linear approximation is only valid out to about 40 km from the radar. These non-linearities also affect the retrieval of the vorticity to the extent that we had to establish a maximum limit on the uncertainty of the vorticity. These results bring to question the assumptions that the non-linearities are relatively unimportant in stratiform cases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zawadzki, I.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085n34q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t1184</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c253j"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Comparison of SC dervied memory models and location consistency on shared memory architectures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Petry, Hisham Johnathon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>All methods of multi-processing need some form of processor to processor communication. In shared memory architectures this communication takes place through the shared global address space. A set of rules must be provided to control when and how updates to the shared memory made by one processor will be seen by another processor. These rules make up the memory model of the shared memory architecture. Since the memory model controls inter-processor communication and access to the shared memory, choosing these rules will be very important for efficiency in terms of memory access stalls. The first memory models were designed from a uniproeessor perspective. In these model every processor sees every update (write) to memory in the same order, which is referred to as coherence. By removing the requirement of coherence, new memory models arise which may be more efficient in terms of network usage, and in terms of cache hit ratios. The new memory model called Location Consistency (LC) will be shown to be more efficient than the coherent memory models. This thesis discusses the implementation and results of a Shared Memory Simulator (SHAMS). SHAMS supports several memory models, and provides a platform for running shared memory programs which previously did not exist at McGill. The importance of caching, a definition of LC and an outline of how the models are supported in simulated hardware will be presented. Finally a comparison of several memory models will be given, showing the improvements that LC has to offer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gao, Guang</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zw43n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c253j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75df51g"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Production grammars for the kinship terminologies of Burmese and several Indonesian languages</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Palmer, Blair D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previously, J.

The production grammars are then compared, noting differences between Burmese and the others, and differences within the group of Indonesian languages. Particular attention is paid to the reduction rules, as they are indicative of the structure of the grammar. It was found that although differing in the structure of its kinship descriptions, Burmese is quite similar to the Indonesian languages on the level of reduction rules.
