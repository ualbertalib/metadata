(STACEE)  is a ground based gamma ray telescope which studies active galatic nuclei (AGNs). As  a ground based experiment, data quality is directly related to atmospheric  conditions. This thesis describes the process of verifying the reliability of  astronomical weather predictions made by the Canadian Meteorological Service (CMS).  This includes a description of the construction, calibration, and operation of a  cloud detector at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Cloud cover data was  collected from the beginning of September, 2003, to the beginning of November 2003.  These data were compared to cloud cover weather predictions made by the CMS. A blind  analysis consisted of scaling the CMS and real data, and calculating the correlation  coefficient between these two sets of data. The correlation between the predictions  and real sky conditions was 0.4622, well above the 0.1% significance level of 0.1906  Thus the CMS is determined to be a reliable weather predictor, and useful to the  STACEE group.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ragan, K.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795828d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913q490</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dg28n"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulation and expression of the mdh-sucCDAB operon of Sinorhizobium meliloti</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Steven, Blaire</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The genes encoding malate dehydrogenase (mdh), succinyl-CoA  synthetase (sucCD), and subunits of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (sucAB) constitute  an operon in the order mdh-sucCDAB in Sinorhizobium meliloti.

A promoter upstream of the mdh gene was identified, and although the  promoter was active in S. meliloti it was not expressed in Escherichia coli. It was  demonstrated that the role of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGD) is minimal in  symbiosis, as nodules with no OGD activity formed nodules able to fix nitrogen.

Proteus syndrome comprises an association of asymmetrical  gigantism, verrucous epidermal naevi, vascular malformations, hamartomas and  hyperostosis. There is no known molecular basis for this overgrowth syndrome but  several reports have suggested abnormalities of chromosome 1 could play a role and  the abnormal regulation of growth factors could also be important. We obtained paired and unpaired DNA samples from seven cases of  Proteus syndrome from Montreal and Greenwood Genetics Center, South Carolina. In all  analyses, we compared simultaneously DNA from affected and unaffected areas from  these children. Direct sequencing was used to look at somatic mutation or other  alterations in growth, apoptosis or tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN, GPC3 and  CDKN1C. A genome-wide, 10cM 388 marker microsatellite screen were  performed to uncover putative somatic genomic microdeletions or other rearrangements  by comparing the allelotype of the affected and unaffected tissues from Proteus  syndrome patients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foulkes, William</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tp909.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hj67x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182k72z"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Inference of gene regulatory networks from large scale gene expression data</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Takane, Marina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>With the advent of the age of genomics, an increasing number of  genes have been identified and their functions documented. However, not as much is  known of specific regulatory relations among genes (e.g. gene A up-regulates gene  B). At the same time, there is an increasing number of large-scale gene expression  datasets, in which the mRNA transcript levels of tens of thousands of genes are  measured at a number of time points, or under a number of different conditions. A  number of studies have proposed to find gene regulatory networks from such datasets.  Our method is a modification of the continuous-time neural network method of Wahde  &amp; Hertz [25, 26]. The genetic algorithm used to update weights was replaced with  Levenberg-Marquardt optimization. We tested our method on artificial data as well as  Spellman's yeast cell cycle data [22].

In Chapter 1, I approach the question by studying a  simple food web model that can be modified to include different structural and  energetic features. In Chapter 2, I study stability and food web properties in  assembled webs that are structured by body-size restrictions and a  generalist-specialist tradeoff. The results of both chapters suggest that structure  and energetics must be considered to understand food web dynamics. In Chapter 1, I  find that food web structure can be modified by weak and strong energetic flows and  stabilize dynamics through asynchrony. In Chapter 2, I find that food web assembly  with different assemblages of generalists or specialists leads to structures that  have corresponding differences in the stability and properties of food webs. Hence,  my thesis reexamines the relationship of complexity and dynamics from a topological  and energetic framework.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McCann, K.

Results show strengths in families in spite of adversity, independence in the  perspectives of the different actors, and the centrality of the migration  experience.

We propose that Marrow Stromal Cells (MSC) may  serve as a useful Factor IX (FIX) delivery vehicle in vivo. As part of the  validation of this cellular delivery platform for gene therapy, we determined  whether MSCs endogenously express the GGCX gene. We demonstrated that GGCX was  present in MSCs and that it was upregulated as MSCs differentiate into osteoblasts.  These results will be of use in the rational development of Marrow Stromal Cells as  a delivery vehicle of synthetic gamma-carboxylated therapeutic proteins, including  FIX for therapy of Hemophilia B. Furthermore, we wanted to improve upon factor IX  gamma-glutamyl carboxylation by generating a fusion FIX protein with enhance  carboxylation capabilities. We interchanged the propeptide responsible of the  efficiency of this post-translational process of factor IX by the one of the most  efficiently gamma-carboxylated proteins, prothrombin.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galipeau, Jacques</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g241.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f4626081</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472x06b"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Measurement of Ξ¯ and Σ(1385) baryon production in deep inelastic scattering with the ZEUS detector at HERA</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lainesse, Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents the measurement of Ξ¯ and  Σ(1385) strange baryons in deep inelastic scattering of 27.5 GeV positrons on  920 GeV protons with the ZEUS detector at HERA in the 1999--2000 run period. The  kinematic range 20 &lt; Q2 &lt; 200 GeV 2, 0.0003 &lt; x &lt; 0.02,  0.04 &lt; y &lt; 0.7, and restricted kinematic regions in momentum pT and  pseudorapidity eta for Ξ¯ and Σ, are used.

The differential cross sections in bins of Q2, x,  pT and η are also measured.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Corriveau, Francois</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m231c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472x06b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415p9988"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Behavioural responses of fourth instar Aedes aegypti (Diptera:Culcidae) larvae to Plagiorchis elegans cercariae</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kioulos, Ilias P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Exposure of fourth instar Aedes aegypti larvae to graded  concentrations of the entomopathogenic cercariae of the digenean Plagiorchis  elegans, induced fundamental changes in the partitioning of time among a number of  major behavioural activities. In the absence of the parasite, swimming, breathing  and feeding remained stable over time. Grooming was rarely observed. In the presence  of cercariae, larvae increased grooming 26-fold. Concomitantly, feeding was reduced  to 33% of control values. Times spent swimming and breathing remained unchanged. The  increase in grooming activity was attributable to the attachment of cercariae to the  surface of the mosquito larvae, but was independent of infection. Grooming reduced  cercarial penetration. Seventy-five percent of cercariae were lost to predation by  larvae, but their caloric value was insignificant and failed to compensate for the  loss of feeding time due to grooming. The findings are discussed in the context of  their impact on larval growth, development and survival.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rau, M.

Both factors have been shown to function  as transcriptional activators and recognize the same DNA elements in vitro,  suggesting that they may be functionally equivalent. However, there is increasing  evidence, which suggest that they may play different roles in vivo. In order to  begin to address whether FoxA1 is equivalent to FoxA2 in vivo, I used a gene  targeting approach to replace the FoxA2 gene with the coding region of FoxA1, thus  placing FoxA1 under the control of the FoxA2 regulatory elements. Screening of over  1600 clones allowed the identification of two correctly targeted ES cell lines.  These ES cell lines will be an essential tool to address the functional equivalence  of FoxA1 and FoxA2 in vivo.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dufort, Daniel</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343s81x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wg52b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj430539x"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Differences in atrial vs. ventricular remodeling in dogs with ventricular tachypaced-induced congestive heart failure</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hanna, Nessrine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) causes arrhythmogenic  remodeling in both atria and ventricles, but potential differences between atrial  and ventricular remodeling in CHF have not been studied. Methods and results. We examined atrial and ventricular tissues  from dogs with CHF induced by ventricular tachypacing (VTP, 240/min) for 0 (control)  or 24 hrs, 1, 2, or 5 wks. Tissue angiotensin-II concentration (ELISA) increased to  steady state at 24 hrs, and was significantly higher in LA than LV. VTP caused  tissue apoptosis, inflammatory-cell infiltration and cell-death, with maximum  changes in LA being transient and larger than in LV. MAP kinase activation (Western  blot) was rapid (within 24 hrs) in LA, but smaller and slower (p38, JNK) or  non-significant (ERK) in LV. The 25-kDa activated form of TGFbeta1, a particularly  important profibrotic mediator in atria, increased significantly (Western blot) in  LA at 24 hrs and 1 wk, but was not changed in LV. Substantial fibrosis developed in  LA, but was much less important in LV. Conclusions. There are qualitative and quantitative differences  in LA and LV remodeling in experimental CHF, with important potential consequences  for underlying mechanisms and therapeutic approaches.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nattel, Stanley</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v838116f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430539x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085k730"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Graphical decision analysis of exploited fisheries</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hatton, Ian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The depletion of a great many conventional fish stocks is urgent  testimony for fisheries management to evaluate risk and uncertainty in an  interpretable manner. We propose a novel decision based approach to time-series  analysis that explores the spectrum of alternative population trajectories, each of  which can be formulated as hypotheses about the state of the fishery. In the first  chapter, we evaluate the ability of different regions of the surplus production  state space to describe the true state of three North American fisheries: Pacific  cod, porbeagle shark and yellowtail flounder. We consider how environmental  variability and life history traits may alter our assumptions about population  productivity, and we lay the foundation for a decision based age-structured  analysis. In the second chapter, the approach is extended further into the  ecological realm by considering how community interactions between Atlantic cod and  harp seals can be represented in state space. Our results indicate that since the  fishing moratorium in 1992, harp seals have potentially lowered cod productivity,  preventing their recovery.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McCann, Kevin</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dm92x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085k730</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fishery management -- Decision making</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fish populations -- Estimates</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pacific cod fisheries -- North America</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lamna -- North America</dc:subject><dc:subject>Limanda ferruginea -- North America</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hc833"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulation of microglial phagocytosis in the regenerating CNS of the goldfish</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Girolami, Elizabeth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Teleost retinal ganglion cells can regenerate severed axons  following injury, something their mammalian counterparts cannot do. In the teleost,  successful regeneration has been attributed in part to microglial cell activities  including the phagocytosis of myelin. Although the regulation of microglial  phagocytosis has been studied in mammals, in the teleost it is largely unexamined.  The present study was designed to identify mediators of microglial phagocytosis  released by injured goldfish optic nerve during the course of regeneration. We found  that microglial phagocytosis was significantly enhanced in the presence of a 7 day  regenerating nerve or medium conditioned by the nerve (CM). When either nerve or CM  was incubated with microglia along with an antibody against tumour necrosis factor  alpha (TNFalpha), this effect was neutralized. The L929 cell cytotoxicity assay  further demonstrated TNFalpha activity in the CM. However, Western blot analysis did  not confirm this result. Therefore, further work is necessary to clearly establish  the presence of TNFalpha.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levine, Robert</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053g65s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hc833</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Goldfish -- Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microglia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Optic nerve -- Regeneration</dc:subject><dc:subject>Axons -- Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Visual pathways</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phagocytosis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At148fh738"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mechanisms involved in HIV-1 dual resistance to AZT AND 3TC</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Girouard, Mélanie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) enzymes that  contain E44D and V118I either alone or in a background of different combinations of  AZT-resistance conferring mutations in order to study the underlying biochemical  mechanisms. We found that enzymes containing E44D in a background of these latter  mutations increase the efficiency of excision of 3TC-MP, while V118I-containing  enzymes show reductions in rates of incorporation of AZT-MP and 3TC-MP. The V118I  mutant is also associated with diminished rates of ATP-dependent primer unblocking.  The additional presence of AZT-mutations can partially neutralize this deficit,  which helps to explain the concurrent presence of these changes in resistant  isolates. These biochemical data suggest that mutations E44D and V118I play distinct  mechanistic roles in dual resistance to AZT and 3TC. Our findings are consistent  with an increasing number of clinical studies suggesting that E44D- and  V118I-containing clusters are sometimes associated with HIV resistance to multiple  nucleotide analogue RT inhibitors.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gotte, Matthias</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s0812.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fh738</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
