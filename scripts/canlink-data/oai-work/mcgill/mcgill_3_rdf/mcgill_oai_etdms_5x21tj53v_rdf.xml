A review of previous attempts at multineuronal recording is presented. An improved method for recording simultaneously from several neurons in an in vivo preparation was developed. The approach developed uses one microelectrode to record extracellularly from several neurons in close proximity. It can be assumed that the action potentials, originating from each neuron will exhibit different shapes. These shapes, recorded on one time varying voltage record, can be sorted as to which neuron produced which action potential. The method of sorting the action potentials and identifying their occurrence times uses an interactive pattern recognition program for a laboratory computer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mandl, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kt44w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tj53v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
