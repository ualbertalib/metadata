The present project adapted surface  irrigation as a more economical and sustainable method of disposing of this large  volume of DFE on cropped land near their storage facility. The experimental surface  irrigation system consisted of a gated pipe installed perpendicular to the slope of  the field allowing the discharged DFE to run down the slope. The adaptation of the system and the measurement of its  environmental impact were conducted on two dairy farms, A and B, in the region South  West of Montreal where their DFE were characterized. In 2003 and 2004, DFE was  applied on one of two 0.5 and 0.3ha plots, on each farm, to observe losses through  the subsurface drainage system, by means of sampling wells, and effects on soil  nutrient levels. The DFE collected in 2002 and 2003 had a lower nutrient content  than that collected in 2004 because of higher precipitations. The DFE generally  contained between 150-500 mg/L of TKN, 15 to 40 mg/L of TP and 500 to 700 mg/L of  TK. DFE losses through the subsurface drainage system were observed  on both farms during each irrigation test. Nevertheless, outlet losses were observed  only when irrigating under wet soil conditions or when applying more than 50mm of  DFE. Outlet losses represented at the most 1.2% of the total DFE volume applied and  0.32% of the nutrient and bacterial loads. Although only 65 to 75% of the soil surface was covered by the  applied DFE, the irrigation sessions did provide some additional soil moisture for  crops, increasing yield by 31% in 2004. Once absorbed by the soil, the applied DFE  did not increase the soil nutrient level and variability in the presence of crop.  Thus, the DFE contributed to the irrigation and fertilization of the  plots. Surface irrigation to spread low nutrient DFE, as compared to  the conventional tanker system reduced the application costs from $3.05/m3, to  $0.95/m3.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m4684.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085k58w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Manure -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sewage irrigation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n392k"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Factors regulating resting energy expenditure and thermic effect of food in elderly women</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khursigara, Zareen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hypothesis. We hypothesized that contrary to "normal  aging," frail elderly women would have a heightened resting energy expenditure  per kg fat free mass (REE/kg FFM) and thermic effect of food (TEF)  response. Methods. 13 healthy (H) [X +/- SEM: 81.4 +/- 1.1 yr] and 9 frail  elderly women (F) [84.7 +/- 1.6 yr], free from acute conditions underwent REE and  TEF measurements (liquid standard mixed meal: 720 kcal, 58% carbohydrate, 14%  protein, 28% fat) using ventilated hood indirect calorimetry. Anthropometric and  body composition measurements, thyroid hormones, cortisol, cytokines and  catecholamine concentrations, and physical activity (PASE) and mobility ("time  up and go" TUG) scores were related to the results obtained. Results. H had a faster TUG: 10.2 +/- 1.6 vs. 21.0 +/- 9.3 s  (p=0.001), greater PASE score: 179.2 +/- 116.1 vs. 47.1 +/- 26.2 (p=0.003), greater  triiodothyronine [T3]: 5.1 +/- 0.6 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.4 rhomol/L (p=0.003) and lower  cortisol concentrations: 351.1 +/- 19.9 vs. 474.5 +/- 43.6 nmol/L (p=0.011). In H  vs. F: REE/kg FFM was 1044 +/- 20.4, 1021 +/- 23.7 kcal/day (NS) and TEF response as  expressed as % of REE was 18.4 +/- 5.6, 19.5 +/- 4.2 (NS). The time course of  glucose (p=0.043) and insulin from 90 minutes onwards (P=0.013) suggested insulin  resistance in F. REE was positively correlated with FFM, percent body fat and [T3]  (r&gt;0.499, p&lt;0.021). Conclusion.

Close histological examination of the testis of HIP1-/- mice  from 7-30 wks of age revealed that HIP1-deficiency was particularly detrimental to  spermatids. The testis showed a significant decrease in the diameter of seminiferous  tubules, a reduction in the number of late spermatids and the sloughing of germ  cells, which were evident as round cells in the epididymal lumen. Major  abnormalities in spermatids included structural deformations of heads, bent  flagella, the presence of proacrosomic vesicles with the complete or partial absence  of an acrosome or its detachment from the nucleus, and retention of the cytoplasm  enveloping the spermatid head. Abnormalities with respect to the association of  elongating spermatids with ectoplasmic specializations of Sertoli cells were noted  as well. Sperm counts and sperm motility parameters were significantly decreased in  HIP1-/- mice compared to their wild-type littermates and these differences accounted  for reduced fertility levels noted in HIP1-/- mice. Taken together, differences in sperm counts, morphology and  their motility parameters suggest a functional role for HIP1 in relation to actin  and microtubules during sperm development in the testis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r145t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c099r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1z40kt37x"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Otolaryngology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Detection of human papillomavirus in primary site of oraloropharyngeal cancer and in cervical lymph nodes : correlation with clinico-pathological parameters and prognostic significance</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Al-Qahtani, Khalid Hussain</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objectives. (1) To Determine the presence of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18,  31, 33, 35, 52b, 58 subtypes in resected oral/oropharyngeal SCCA cancer and  associated lymph nodes. (2) To Determine if a relationship exists between  koilocytosis, tumor grade, stage, or prognosis. Methods. Retrospective analysis and pathology review of patients  with SCCA of the oral cavity at McGill in the last 5 years was performed. Age at  diagnosis, risk factors, tumor stage, grade, koilocytosis, treatment, outcome, and  presence of HPV by PCR were analysed. Results. 199 patients included were included in the analyses; 5  years mortality was 18.5%. 146 cases reviewed by pathology revealed 67%  koilocytosis. One sample was positive for HPV subtype 35 as determined by PCR.  Radiotherapy (p&lt;0,5) and complications from radiotherapy (p&lt;0.5)  significantly affected survival. Conclusions. Many oral SCCA's do not contain HPV 6, 11, 16, 18,  31, 33, 35, 52b, 58 subtypes. Given the high prevelence of koilocytosis, probe for  other subtypes should be utilized. Mortality rates and survival are similar to those  published in the literature. The presence of koilocytosis, it is not related grade,  stage or prognosis.

Accurate target volume delineation is essential  in achieving this goal to avoid inadequate tumor coverage and/or irradiation of an  unnecessary volume of healthy tissue. Respiratory motion is known to be the largest  intra-fractional organ motion and the most significant source of uncertainty in  treatment planning for chest lesions. A method to minimize effects of respiratory  motion is to use four-dimensional (4D) radiotherapy. A novel scanning procedure for 4D CT data acquisition is  described in this work. Three single-slice helical scans are acquired simultaneously  with the real-time tracking of several markers placed on a moving phantom. At the  end of the three scans. CT data is binned into different respiratory phases  according to the externally recorded respiratory signal and the scanned volume is  reconstructed for several respiratory phases. The 4D CT images obtained show an  overall improvement when compared to conventional CT images of a moving  phantom.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246s57m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g337</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m467v"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>CIS-regulatory elements driving muscle-specific expression of an ascidian troponin I gene</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khare, Parul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>My research goal was to functionally dissect the regulatory  region of the gene encoding the muscle protein troponin I (TnI) in the simple  chordate Ciona intestinalis.

Ideally, those interfaces would exploit the  same communication channels used in everyday life, which are speech, gestures or any  other expressive feature of the human body. In this thesis, a continuous dynamic  gesture recognition system is presented. Positioning devices such as a mouse, a data  glove or a video camera are used as input streams to the recognition module, from  which it extracts the most interesting features. Gestures are recognized  continuously, which means that no prior temporal segmentation is necessary. Training  facilities are also available in order to build gesture models from known segmented  gesture sequences. In order for users to effectively reuse code and build new  modules that share common interfaces, a software framework was built that allows for  multimodal inputs and outputs as well as configuring the virtual world and how will  data coming from the real world influence virtual world entities, The data flow  originating from the real world uses a common data format that is standard from the  configuration file to the network packets. The virtual world is modeled such that  the actions that affect the virtual entities given input data from the real world is  configurable and extensible. Sharing the environment through the network is also  possible, allowing users from different locations to work on the same virtual world.  Preliminary tests on the gesture recognition performance are presented given several  different input modalities and setups. An experimental application is also  described, showing the flexibility and extensibility features of the software  framework.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn72j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk36k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apr76f400t"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the evaluation of ductile behaviour of porous nickel-based superalloys using finite element method</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Després, Mélissa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present work aims to assess the ductile behaviour of porous  Inconel 625 nickel-based superalloys, produced by Metal Injection Moulding (MIM). A  qualitative study of the local behaviour was conducted through a series of simple  finite element models. Obtained results have been analyzed and compared to more  common materials. The following study focuses on the strain localization phenomenon  leading to ligament failure between 2 pores relative to their dimensions, their  orientation, the distance separating them and the triaxiality ratio. Obtained  results demonstrated that the dimensions of the plastic zone in the neighbourhood of  pores proportionally increase with pore diameter. Hence, it has been shown that in  the case of Inconel 625, the localization was more pronounced between 2 pores whose  relative orientation is 0º. Furthermore, it was possible to observe that the  critical far-field strain corresponding to the onset of flow localisation between  two pores was decreasing as the distance between them was diminishing. By comparing  the behaviour of Inconel 625 with that of aluminium 7075-T6, it has been shown that  the amplification of the plastic strains was lower in the case of Inconel 625 and  consequently the onset of strain localisation (i.e.ligament failure) was found to be  delayed in comparison with aluminium. Hence, the high work hardening coefficient of  Inconel 625 reduces its sensitivity to the presence of pores. It has thus been shown  that Inconel 625 MIM has mechanical properties superior to the equivalent cast  material.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jf27h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f400t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57nr50s"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Video portfolios as a tool in primary grade student evaluation and their potential in pre-service teacher training</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhou, Wenyan, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the potential for pre-service teacher  training of video portfolios of elementary students doing school tasks.

We also  determined that both the region encompassing amino acids 300 to 350 and the  C-terminus of Uga3 are required for activation. Additionally, activation by Uga3 can  occur in strains unable to completely degrade GABA or lacking the GABA permease  Uga4. Uga3 can form homodimers in vivo, both in the presence and in the absence of  GABA. However, it seems that Da181 cannot form heterodimers with Uga3 nor interact  with the UGA1 promoter. Furthermore, Dal81 is no longer required for activation if  Uga3 is overexpressed or mutated to a constitutively active form.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jb958.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q446v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v363n"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Relationship between a trial fibrillation and hypertension in rats</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Andalib, Ali</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The importance of hypertension as a risk factor for the  development of AF is well recognized.

Two  different sets of enzymes control the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of proteins:  the protein tyrosine kinases and the protein tyrosine phosphatases. The  identification of the cellular function of these enzymes is a key step in the  understanding of many biological processes, such as proliferation, differentiation  and apoptosis. We used a mouse model deficient in the protein tyrosine phosphatase  TC-PTP to identify its biological and biochemical functions. Analysis of the  phenotype of murine embryonic fibroblasts from TC-PTP-/- embryos revealed that  TC-PTP-/- cells have an impaired proliferation due to a slow progression during the  early G1-phase of the cell cycle. In these cells, there is a delayed expression of  cyclin D1 through a defective IKK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These data confirmed  that TC-PTP plays a positive role in cell proliferation. In the second part of this thesis, I studied the putative role  of TC-PTP in response to DNA damage. I demonstrated that mice and cells lacking  TC-PTP have a high sensitivity to genotoxic stress, which seems to be associated  with an increased stability and elevated phosphorylation of serine-15 of the tumor  suppressor p53. We found that the p53 inhibitor, Mdm2 is highly tyrosine  phosphorylated in TC-PTP-/- cells. High tyrosine phosphorylation levels on Mdm2 are  associated with more stability of p53. Although, it was not possible to show that  Mdm2 is a direct substrate for TC-PTP, this seems to be the most likely mechanism  used by TC-PTP to control p53. Interestingly, I also showed that double deficient  mice for both TC-PTP and p53 live longer and display a normal spleen compared with  the TC-PTP single knockout. However, another phenotype like the anemia is not  rescued in the double knockout mice. Murine embryonic fibroblasts from TC-PTP-/-  p53-/- embryos also have a better survival after genotoxic stress when compared with  the TC-PTP-/- cells. Thus, we propose that TC-PTP plays a role in response to DNA  damage by affecting the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Mdm2, and its associated  increased stability of the tumor suppressor p53 In the last part of my thesis, I tested the genetic interaction  between the protein kinase c-Abl and the protein tyrosine phosphatase TC-PTP. Taking  in account the knockout phenotypes of both enzymes, we generated double deficient  mice for both TC-PTP and cAbl. TC-PTP-/- c-Abl-/- mice are viable, but there was no  difference in the time of survival of these animals when compared with the single  knockouts. However, data obtained with primary fibroblasts indicated that indeed  there is a genetic interaction between TC-PTP and c-Abl. Double deficient primary  fibroblasts proliferate better than TC-PTP-/- cells, and also present a better  survival in response to genotoxic stress. The induction of p53 is also reduced in  comparison with TC-PTP-/- cells. These results indicate that a genetic interaction  between both enzymes exists and that this phenomenon is likely to be resulting from  the existence of at least one common substrate.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tremblay, Michel L.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q449p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w66344235</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407x843"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of polymer thin films : chain conformation, dynamics, and morphology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nasreddine, Victor Fuad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation presents solid-state NMR studies of the chain  conformation, dynamics and morphology of three adsorbed polymer systems: two random  semi-crystalline copolymers, poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) (PEA) and  poly(propylene-co-acrylic acid) (PPA), and an amorphous homopolymer, poly(n-butyl  methacrylate) (PnBMA). Zirconia (ZrO2) was chosen as the substrate for all three  polymers since the binding of carboxylic acids to this metal oxide is well  understood. The choice of polymers was based on their particular bulk conformational  and dynamic properties as well as their common use in polymer coatings. These  studies are motivated by the general lack of a microscopic picture of adsorbed  polymers, which can be provided by NMR, and the relevance of chain conformation and  dynamics to important polymer film properties such as adhesion. First the chain conformation and surface binding of adsorbed PEA  as a function of acrylic acid content are characterized by 13C cross polarization -  magic angle spinning (CP-MAS), 2D 1H- 13C wideline separation (WISE) and 1H spin  diffusion NMR experiments and FTIR-PAS (Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic  spectroscopy) measurements. The most important finding is that the chain  conformation of adsorbed PEA is determined primarily by the sticker group density  rather than the surface coverage. The second study of PEA concerns the chain  dynamics in the bulk and adsorbed states. Variable temperature NMR experiments  provide evidence that ethylene segments of adsorbed PEA form partially folded loops  rather than flat extended trains. Finally 129Xe NMR studies, used to probe the  morphology of adsorbed PEA, show a bulk-like signal only for the highest  loadings. The second system investigated, PPA, is another semi-crystalline  random copolymer which binds to zirconia via carboxylate linkages. The 13 C CP-MAS  NMR spectra of adsorbed PPAC unexpectedly show splittings normally associated with  chain-chain packing in the crystalline regions of bulk polypropylene (PP). The  splittings in the spectra of adsorbed PPAC, which are more resolved than in bulk  PPA, are proposed to arise from recrystallization of the PP segments between sticker  groups. Finally the interfacial properties of an amorphous homopolymer,  PnBMA were studied using 13C and 129Xe NMR to characterize adsorbed and filled  samples. PnBMA binds to zirconia via the partial hydrolysis of the ester side  chains. The remaining ester chains of adsorbed PnBMA are found to segregate to the  polymer/air interface. Both adsorbed and ZrO 2-filled PnBMA show enhanced local  segmental mobility. However, the 129Xe NMR measurements of the filled samples are  consistent with restricted motion on a larger length scale which may be due to  particle bridging.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reven, Linda</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kt407.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407x843</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Analytical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Physical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55z8302"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Processing and intracellular targeting of somatostatin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mouchantaf, Rania</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mammalian prosomatostatin (PSST) yields two bioactive peptides  SST-14 and SST-28 through C-terminal cleavage at basic residues by protein  convertases (PCs). Additionally, a second cleavage, mediated by an unknown enzyme at  a putative Lys13 residue at the NH2-termius generates PSST[1--10] (antrin). The  function of the PSST prosegment is unknown, but its high degree of sequence homology  throughout vertebrate evolution argues that it may harbor information for directing  PSST towards the regulated secretory pathway (RSP). Therefore, the PSST NH2-terminal  region has been extensively analyzed with the following questions asked: Does the  NH2-terminus play a role in targeting of PSST to the RSP? Is PSST cleaved at the  Lys13 site resulting in antrin production, and by the action of which enzyme? What  is the identity of the putative receptor in the trans-Golgi involved in properly  targeting PSST? To test the role of antrin in sorting function, alanine scanning and  deletional mutagenesis were constructed and stably expressed in AtT-20 cells. The  region Pro5 to Gln12 which constitutes an alpha-helix was identified as being  important in precursor targeting with Leu7 and Leu11 being critical. Earlier  morphological studies have implicated immature secretory granules as the site of  prohormone processing however, blockade of PSST targeting through disruption of the  helix did not hinder the ability of PSST to be processed at its C-terminus.  Furthermore, I find that PSST NH2-terminal cleavage does not take place at a basic  site but, most likely at the -R6-L 7-R8-Q9-F 10-L11↓ recognition motif.  Overexpression experiments in COS-1 and HEK-293 cells implicate the recently cloned  subtilase-kexin-isozyme 1 (SKI-1) in antrin production.

To identify the mechanism of EGF-induced Pl3-kinase activation, we  demonstrated that three distinct p85-associated complexes were formed following EGF:  ErbB3-p85, Shc-p85 and a large complex Gab2-Grb2-SHP2-p85. The latter accounted for  &gt;80% of total Pl3-kinase activity. Further experiments showed that these  complexes are differentially localized in rat liver following EGF treatment.  ErbB3-p85 and Shc-p85 complexes were localized to PM and Endosomes; whereas the  multimeric Gab2-Grb2-SHP2-p85 complex was formed rapidly and exclusively in cytosol.  A central role for Gab2 in EGF-induced Pl3-kinase activation and DNA synthesis was  established when we observed that over-expression of wild-type Gab2 augmented these  EGF actions, whereas a Gab2 mutant lacking p85 binding sites did not effect such  augmentation. Over-expression of the PH-domain of Gab2 did not affect EGF-induced  Gab2 phosphorylation, Pl3-kinase activation and DNA synthesis, whereas  over-expressed Gab2 lacking the PH-domain was comparable to wild-type Gab2 in  respect to these EGF-induced signals. These data demonstrated that Gab2 is  phosphorylated and mediates EGF signaling in a PH-domain independent manner. We then  explored the mechanism of Gab2 phosphorylation by EGF; our results demonstrated that  PP1, a selective inhibitor of Src family kinases, blocked EGF-induced Gab2 tyrosine  phosphorylation and downstream events. Moreover, Gab2 phosphorylation was increased  in Csk knock-out cells in which Src family kinases are constitutively activated. A  constitutive association between Gab2 and Src via proline rich sequences on Gab2 was  demonstrated since deletion of proline rich sequences in Gab2 prevented EGF-induced  association of Src with Gab2, Gab2 phosphorylation, Pl3-kinase/Akt activation, and  DNA synthesis.

Much less is known, however, about the assessment of ADHD, and about  the functional impairments associated with ADHD, in adults compared to children. The  objective of the present study was to characterize the functional impairments in  DSM-IV diagnosed ADHD adults compared to community control adults and  clinic-referred adults reporting symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and/or  impulsivity who did not meet symptom thresholds for the disorder. Method. The sample  for this study consisted of 120 adults: 47 adults with ADHD, 43 clinic-referred  adults who did not meet criteria for ADHD, and 30 community control adults. All were  assessed with a comprehensive battery assessing psychiatric, cognitive, school, and  driving impairment. Results. ADHD adults showed significantly more impairment than  community control adults on all outcome measures. ADHD adults had subtle cognitive  deficits, and higher rates of lifetime conduct problems compared to  clinic-comparison adults. ADHD adults did not differ reliably from clinic-comparison  adults on measures of internalizing disorders, school problems, or driving  impairment. Clinic-comparison adults showed significantly more impairment than  community control adults on measures of psychiatric functioning and school  impairment. Conclusions. DSM-IV diagnosed ADHD adults show a pattern of clinical  features that mirrors well-documented findings among children with the disorder, and  show significantly greater impairment than do community control adults. Adults  meeting some, but not all, criteria for ADHD fall in between ADHD adults and  community control adults, and may warrant treatment. Our results highlight the  importance of assessing ADHD in adults in a manner that attends to the potential  reduced sensitivity of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for use in adult populations  (Faraon</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Koestner, Richard</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Hechtman, Lily</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r34g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977v404</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cognition disorders</dc:subject><dc:subject>Attention-deficit disorder in adults</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526c834"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Irregular finite elements : constraint theory and techniques</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ma, Donglin, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Up until recently, the development and generalization of h-type  and hp-type refinement techniques and strategies for the efficient and effective  adaptive finite element analysis of continuum problems has been limited by the  widespread use of geometrically conforming mesh discretizations, designed to  maintain the continuity of the field model.
