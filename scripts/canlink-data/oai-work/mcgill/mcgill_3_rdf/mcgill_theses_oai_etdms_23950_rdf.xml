poor of the third world cities living in slums and squatter settlements often have to support themselves or augment their meagre and uncertain incomes with small-scale business enterprises. This deceptively marginal sector of the urban economy in reality plays a vital role as a major percentage of the urban population are poor. These enterprises are, more often than not, home-based due to their lack of resources. The squalid and congested living conditions in these settlements are thus further compromised by setting up these commercial endeavour, but it is essential for their livelihood as employment opportunities occupy a primary position in their list of priorities. This thesis studies the phenomenon of people in low-income housing settlements using their own homes for income generating activities and the compromise between the various uses of the same space. A field study was undertaken in a typical bustee in Calcutta, India to help illustrate this phenomenon. Sample surveys of a number of households where small-scale economic activity takes place were taken and studied in detail. How the integration of such activities in their daily living environment shapes, changes and influences their living patterns forms the main focus of the study.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Vikram</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n1983.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128b72k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Home-based businesses -- India -- Calcutta -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poor -- Housing -- India -- Calcutta -- Case studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hg29p"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The use of outdoor spaces in an informal settlement in Metropolitan Aba</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nwankama, Nwankama Wosu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In spite of its spontaneous and improvised character, the informal sector has provided virtually the only appropriate housing, in terms of the organization of the outdoor space, for the urban poor of the developing countries. Through an analysis of the outdoor spaces in Eziukwu-Aba, a low-income and informal settlement in Aba, Nigeria, this thesis investigates the organization and mode of use of outdoor spaces, in relation to the day-to-day activities of the urban poor. It focuses on the patterns of outdoor spaces, the categories of activities found in them and the periods of time of the occurrence of the activities. The findings of this study are compared with those of earlier studies, and the broader implications of these findings on contemporary low-income urban housing in the developing countries are briefly outlined. This study posits that for the urban low-income group of the developing countries, (a) usable space takes precedence over aesthetics and permanence and (b) housing and environmental quality in terms of construction standards are of little significance, compared with employment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Vikram</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wr02p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hg29p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Urban poor -- Housing -- Nigeria</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public spaces -- Nigeria -- Aba</dc:subject><dc:subject>Housing -- Nigeria -- Aba</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b6937"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The space of Kafka</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McDonald, Timothy E.

"The space of Kafka" is explored primarily through the "identity" of his characteristic monster figures and the temporally disjunctive narratives through which they travel. Monstrosity is qualified here as a principal mode of translation through which Kafka engaged the very terms of "identity" which an "individual" faces in the appearance of any "work". The intimations of a monstrous self are probed through Kafka's work in relation to human experience, intentionality, alterity and a "present" which is en-acted specifically as one form of the past. Through Kafka's paradigmatic "monster", "double" and "bachelor" figures, we find not "alternative" orientations of the "self" which contemporary literature and architecture may choose to undertake, but intrinsic re-presentations of the very relation which any self, any author, already is in the appearance of a "work".</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b694h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b6937</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture and literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kafka, Franz, 1883-1924 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw66344545"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Adolf Loos et Gustav Klimt ou de la différence</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>L'Heureux, Geneviève</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The reputation given to Adolf Loos and Gustav Klimt as opposites, as well as the understanding of Loos's writings as supporting this reputation, correspond less to the works as such than to the general dichotomic mode of understanding that we inherited from the so-called platonic dichotomy of being and appearance.

The absence of reactivity after step 11 is concomitant with nuclear condensation and transcriptional arrest (Monesi, 1964). Nuclear and cytoplasmic reactivity in pachytene spermatocytes reached a peak at stage XII, coincident with maximal rates of RNA synthesis (Monesi, 1964). Quantitative EM immunogold labeling of Lowicryl embedded testicular sections confirmed the light microscope observations. Immunogold speckles were observed along nuclear chromatin. The chromatoid bodies of spermatids and spermatocytes and the intermitochondrial material of spermatocytes were found to be additional sites of snRNP localization. This co-localization suggests that these dense cytoplasmic structures are related. Anti-U1 snRNP antibodies applied to frozen sections co-localized with spliceosome snRNPs. Anti-U3 snRNP antibodies applied to frozen sections stained nucleoli of germ cells where pre-rRNA is usually spliced.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Oko, R.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Hermo, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fx57q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j6731473m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418p05p"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Product liability of United States' aircraft and component manufacturers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Byrom, Robert M.

The cost of the legal diversity of more than fifty jurisdictions has been devastating to the American general aviation industry. This segment of American industry is no longer competitive, largely due to the cost of product liability litigation, and major corporations have abandoned the effort. At this time, the United Kingdom is forging ahead with its European Economic Community partners to achieve uniform products liability laws. In America, manufacturers must design, select materials for, manufacture, and test their aircraft according to uniform federal standards. This thesis examines the present law and proposes needed uniform federal tort reform for this industry, which must supply entry-level aircraft to train and develop young American pilots.

An opioid involvement in suppressing the response to substance P is also confirmed. In the second study, the role of angiotensin (AII) receptors (AT$ sb1$ and AT$ sb2$) in mediating the effects of intrathecally administered AII on sympathetic output was investigated using DuP 753 and PD 123319, the AT$ sb1$ and AT$ sb2$ receptor antagonists, respectively.

The emphasis in this thesis is on a class of coders which are referred to as Linear Prediction (LP) based analysis-by-synthesis coders, and more specifically on the Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) coder which is currently the most commonly used in low rate transmission. The experiments are performed on a CELP based coder developed by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and Bell Labs, with an output bit rate of 4.8 kbits/s. A multi-tap LTP outperforms a single-tap LTP, but at the expense of a greater number of bits. A single-tap LTP can be improved by increasing the time resolution of the LTP. This results in a fractional delay LTP, which produces a significant increase in prediction gain and perceived periodicity at the cost of more bits, but less than for the multi-tap case. The first new approach in this work is to use a pseudo-three-tap pitch filter with one or two degrees of freedom of the predictor coefficients, which gives a better quality reconstructed speech and also a more desirable frequency response than a one-tap pitch prediction filter. The pseudo-three-tap pitch filter with one degree of freedom is of particular interest as no extra bits are needed to code the pitch coefficients. The second new approach is to perform time scaling/shifting on the original speech minimizing further the minimum mean square error and allowing a smoother and more accurate reconstruction of the pitch structure. The time scaling technique allows a saving of 1 bit in coding the pitch parameters while maintaining very closely the quality of the reconstructed speech. In addition, no extra bits are needed for the time scaling operation as no extra side information has to be transmitted to the receiver.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c133v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wg74c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fm35w"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Nursing</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Factors predicting perceived impairment of function in patients with pain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Richards, Kandyce M. (Kandyce Marlene)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to identify the best set of variables measured at in-hospital interview to predict perceived pain-related impairment of function at three week follow-up in 361 hospitalized adult patients with pain (173 males, 188 females; mean age 48.3 years). Multiple regression analyses were performed on a subset of data from a large prospective pain prevalence study. Three models were developed to predict perceived overall function, physical function and psychological function on a training sample (n = 252) and tested for reliability on a cross validation sample (n = 109). Independent variables measured at the in-hospital interview included sociodemographic, cognitive, physical and psychological variables. The dependent function variables were assessed at three week follow-up. Overall functional impairment at three weeks was best predicted by perceived overall function, pain quality, nonsurgical pain, and hospital stay of one to three months in the past year. Impairment of physical function was predicted by perceived physical function, pain quality, one-to-three month hospital stay during the past year, and pain duration of greater than three months. Impairment of psychological function was best predicted by perceived psychological function, pain quality, and nonsurgical pain. The models explained 22%, 19% and 23% of the variance respectively. Statistical reliability was established for each model through the process of cross validation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jeans, Mary Ellen</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bc426.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm35w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m255z"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Data abstraction mechanisms in object-oriented programming</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Haitao</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Existing OO modeling methodologies prescribe notations, processes, and guidelines that, if followed, ensure that analysis-level OO model reflect application semantics. As we move into design, implementation-level considerations may distort analysis-level models, and the transition is seamless no more. In this thesis, we describe data definition facilities in SoftClass--an experimental CASE tool for software reuse--that aim at maintaining the integrity of application data models throughout the development lifecycle, while maximizing opportunities for code reuse. In SoftClass, analysis-level data models describe application-semantics and are organized in an inheritance hierarchy based on shared application-semantics. At the design-level, we maintain two kinds of data models: (1) generic data structures, used as implementation templates for analysis-level models, and organized along "implementation inheritance" hierarchies, and (2) realizations of analysis-level application models, which consist of mapping an analysis-level model to a generic data structure. Design-level representations of application objects may be seen as belonging to two independent hierarchies, and we show how each hierarchy offers some opportunities for reuse. We shoe how data abstraction supports a high-level program design language that is both easy-to-use and that supports some design validation. We conclude by outlining directions for further research.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Merrett, Tim</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Mili, Hafedh</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t2776.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m255z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870w718"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A practical interprocedural alias analysis for an optimizing/parallelizing C compiler</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Emami, Maryam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Accurate alias analysis is a crucial phase of optimizing/parallelizing compilers for languages which support pointer data structures. The result of the alias analysis is used by most of data-flow analyses and optimizing phases in a compiler to produce efficient code. In this thesis, we introduced a new approach for interprocedural alias analysis which determines the explicit points-to relationships between locations in an abstract stack at each program point. Two variables have a points-to relationship if one of them points, or may point, to the other one. To perform our interprocedural analysis, we have designed a new representation to capture the call-structure of the program, called the invocation graph. This is similar to the traditional call graph, with some additional properties for the recursive function calls. The invocation graph is used to follow the exact sequence of function calls and returns in the program. In this manner, the precise information is propagated to/from a function. This work has been integrated in the McCAT optimizing/parallelizing compiler for the C-language. The analysis handles both scalar variables and aggregate data structures (records and arrays). The results of the points-to analysis provides a base upon which other interprocedural analyses are built. This thesis provides both experimental results and examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the points-to analysis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendren, Laurie</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q7167.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870w718</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583xv83t"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Benthic bacterial production in Eastern Townships and Laurentian lakes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sander, Bettina Christa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The $ sp3$H thymidine incorporation (TTI) method has been frequently used to estimate benthic bacterial production rates in well oxygenated marine and river sediments, but not in the frequently more reduced lake sediments. In chapter 1, I evaluate the published sediment production literature and examine useful predictors of in situ bacterial production in mostly marine and riverine sediments. In chapters 2 and 3, I estimated and compared benthic production rates by TTI, frequency of dividing cells (FDC), the dilution method (DIL) and sediment respiration (SR) in 13 Quebec lakes to assess the reliability of the TTI based production rates. The TTI method was first calibrated, but despite keeping incubation times short and at in situ temperature, using optimal sediment volumes to saturate $ sp3$H thymidine (TdR) uptake rates, and correcting production rates for $ sp3$H-DNA recovery efficiencies, only a maximum of 10% of $ sp3$H TdR was incorporated into DNA and only extracellular isotope dilution could be accounted for (chapter 2). Most problematic, however, is the increasing presence of active bacteria unable to take up and incorporate TdR as lake sediments become more reduced (chapter 3). TTI based results are also not nearly as well correlated to environmental factors as those obtained from SR.

Ravi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The problem of speech recognition is one that lends itself to parallelization. A common method used for speech recognition is the Viterbi algorithm. Unfortunately, this method is computationally expensive for large vocabularies. A new two pass method has been proposed, using the Viterbi algorithm as the first pass and the A$ sp *$ algorithm as the second, making use of the results of the Viterbi algorithm. Both these algorithms can be made faster by parallelizing them. This thesis report describes the design and implementation of a parallel version of these algorithms on a BBN Butterfly multi-processor machine, and it also presents the outcome of the parallelization. It was observed that the parallel version of the Viterbi algorithm ran 8 times faster than the sequential version. This was observed for the recognition of both short words and long words. The A$ sp *$ algorithm, however, displayed different behaviour for short words as compared to long words. With a short word, the parallel version of the A$ sp *$ algorithm ran slightly slower than the sequential version; for a long word, it ran considerably faster than the sequential version--it was observed to run as much as 150 times faster. This thesis comments on the results thus obtained, and attempts to explain the behaviour of the different parallel implementations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gao, Guang R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73pw871.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r3866</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
