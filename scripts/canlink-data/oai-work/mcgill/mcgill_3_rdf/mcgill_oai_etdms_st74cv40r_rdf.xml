Some of these methods have withstood the effects of trial in time, and are still in use for clinical and experimental purposes. However, all of these methods have drawbacks of one sort or another. At present, there is need for a more efficient and less cumbersome means of occluding certain arteries for investigative and clinical purposes. One need has arisen from the desire to reproduce as realistically as possible many ominous disease states which result from aging and catastrophic vascular events.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rasmussen, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kk90n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cv40r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
