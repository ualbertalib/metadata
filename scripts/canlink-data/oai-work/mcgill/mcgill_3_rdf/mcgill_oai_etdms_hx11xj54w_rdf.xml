L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Among the theories offered to explain how pathogenic organisms induce pathic events in plants the toxin theory has gained much support especially in recent years. According to this theory the disease syndrome is not induced by the pathogen directly but by toxins formed by the pathogen itself. The host reactions which have been ascribed to the action of such toxic secretions of the pathogen include: (1) vein clearing, (2) epinasty of leaves, (3) production of adventitious roots on the stem, (4) yellowing of leaves, (5) vascular browning, (6) production of gum in vessels, (7) defoliation, (8) wilting of leaves followed by death and (9) alteration of photosynthesis, transpiration and respiration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Coulson, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g6260.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xj54w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plant Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
