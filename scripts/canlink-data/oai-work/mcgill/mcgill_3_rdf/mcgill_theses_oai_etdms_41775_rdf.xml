At the McGill University Health Centre, the characteristic angle beta concept was developed for the dosimetry and treatment planning of electron arc therapy. In this work, this concept was verified in dynamic mode with the new generation linac of Varian(TM), the Clinac-21 EX. Radial PDDs were measured for beta angles varying from 60º--120º of electron arc beams with energies of 6 MeV, 9 MeV, and 12 MeV and 2-D isodose distributions of electron arc beams were studied as well. Dose penumbral regions exist at the beam start area and stop area, and the size of these regions is a function of the beam energy and the field width. When shielded with a tertiary collimator, the size of the penumbral regions and the dose levels in the penumbral regions were reduced significantly, and it is sufficient for the shielding to cover exactly the start field and the stop field of the arc beam in a clinical setting. The dose rate of the electron arc beam was investigated. It was found that the dose rate at the depth of dose maximum linearly increased with the arc beam field width and was independent of the arc angle.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r955w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jz63t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Nuclear</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20sz093"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Modeling the Inuit diet to minimize contaminant while maintaining nutrient intakes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Ying Chun, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Arctic environment is changing rapidly. The purposes of this study were: (1) to predict the possible changes of diet composition and the subsequent changes in nutrient intakes as a result of environmental changes; (2) to explore the possibility of minimizing the contaminant exposure while maintaining the energy and nutrient intakes using liner modeling. It was found that a decrease of 10% or 50% of caribou or ringed seal will result in decreases for many key nutrients such as protein, zinc, and iron. It is theoretically feasible to minimize each contaminant intake while maintaining energy and nutrients at the levels of the CINE dietary survey in 2000 for Inuit in the Inuvialuit, Kitikmeot, and Kivalliq regions. However, it is theoretically infeasible for Inuit in the Labrador and Baffin regions under other hypothetical conditions.

Demand for fresh tuna fish is no exception, being a valuable source of nutrients with immense health benefits. However, this product is highly perishable and has been commonly implicated in scombroid (histamine) poisoning caused by microbial decarboxylation of histidine contained in high levels in the tissues of scombroid fishes. Current techniques are inadequate for the prevention of histamine formation in fresh fishery products and high pressure processing is a potential alternative for it can inactivate microorganisms and enzymes, without affecting (or only minimally altering) the quality characteristics of foodstuffs. Previous studies have shown a decrease in histamine formation after a high pressure treatment and this study focuses on the effect of high pressure on the histidine decarboxylase enzyme and selected histamine forming microorganisms involved in histamine formation. Commercial histidine decarboxylase suspended in different media (buffer solution and fish slurry with and without added histidine) was submitted to different high pressure treatments (200--400 MPa) with distinct time durations (0--60 min) at room temperature (20°C--25°C). Enzymatic activity of pressure treated and control samples were then compared by measuring histamine formation. Results were similar in all media; a 200 MPa treatment increased the enzymatic activity a little more than 20% as time increased; a 300 MPa treatment increased activity over 20% at first, followed by a decrease in activity as time increased only to reach a level of residual activity similar or only slightly lower than control samples; and a 400 MPa treatment reduced enzyme activity as time increased to a level of 55% residual activity in a buffer solution where the greatest inactivation was observed. Enzyme activation and inactivation were affected by a dual effect attributed to a pulse effect, which caused a shift in activity and was independent of the length of the treatment, and a pressure-hold effect, during which activation or inactivation followed first order kinetics. The enzyme appeared highly resistant to pressure in all media as observed from D-values (&gt;2700 min) and pressure sensitivity of destruction rate (zp) values (&gt;500 MPa). Inactivation of non-pathogen histamine forming bacteria (HFB) Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus megaterium was evaluated by inoculating cultures in a fish tissue homogenate. Surviving colonies were enumerated after the treatments observing inactivation described by the same dual effect described earlier. Pressures above 300 MPa achieved a significant destruction of E. coli K12 (&gt; 4 log-cycles) while B. megaterium appeared highly resistant for only a 2 log-cycle reduction was observed after at the highest pressure treatment conditions (400 MPa, 20 min). D-values for both microorganisms decreased as pressure increased being significantly smaller for E. coli K 12, which also appeared to be more sensitive to pressure changes as observed from the zp values (zp = 151.51 MPa and zp = 909.10 MPa for E. coli and B. megaterium respectively. Inactivation caused by the pulse effect appeared very effective for both microorganisms as pressure increased, particularly at 400 MPa (PE &gt; 1.25).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k667z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rq54r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fishery products -- Spoilage</dc:subject><dc:subject>High pressure (Technology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Decarboxylases</dc:subject><dc:subject>Escherichia coli</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tuna</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bacillus megaterium</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405sf85s"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A model-driven approach to design engineered physical systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sen, Sagar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The constant growth in complexity of engineered physical (electrical, mechanical etc.) systems has led to the development of software tools to store and reuse design knowledge to simplify the creation of such systems. Models that encode structure and behaviour of components in the system are currently being developed based on the techniques prescribed by Model Driven Engineering (MDE). We use MDE concepts to develop appropriate modelling formalisms to allow creation of models of a target Engineered Physical System ( EPS) at different levels of abstraction. Each level of abstraction presents a certain view of the EPS to a domain expert in the development team. For instance, a high-level view is suitable for a person in a managerial role. An engineer who deals with the same system at a lower level of abstraction develops a model using idealized physical components. A physicist's concern is the physical meaningfulness of the model. The physicist's model verifies if the model prescribed by the manager via the engineer adheres to the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. Finally, a mathematician or a computer scientist obtains a solution to the constrained equations imposed by the dynamical system by solving it analytically or numerically. This model usually takes the form of a set of Differential Algebraic Equations provided by the physicist. We design model transformations to transform models from a high-level modelling language to lower-level language. We present visual Graph Grammar rules to perform these transformations. We start with a high-level representation of the physical system which is a model in the High-level Physical System Model modelling language. This model is transformed in subsequent steps to a set of trajectories that describe the state of the physical system over time. We show that this hierarchy of transformations to encode knowledge about physical systems drastically reduces design space size at the high-level of abstraction. We search the space of an example EPS using a design heuristic based randomized algorithm to determine the speedup in search due to reduction in the number of design variables.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225g33z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sf85s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering design -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer-aided design</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z709194p"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Relative hyperbolicity of graphs of free groups with cyclic edge groups</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Richer, Émilie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We prove that any finitely generated group which splits as a graph of free groups with cyclic edge groups is hyperbolic relative to certain finitely generated subgroups, known as the peripheral subgroups. Each peripheral subgroup splits as a graph of cyclic groups. Any graph of free groups with cyclic edge groups is the fundamental group of a graph of spaces X where vertex spaces are graphs, edge spaces are cylinders and attaching maps are immersions. We approach our theorem geometrically using this graph of spaces. We apply a "coning-off" process to peripheral subgroups of the universal cover X̃ → X obtaining a space Cone(X̃) in order to prove that Cone (X̃) has a linear isoperimetric function and hence satisfies weak relative hyperbolicity with respect to peripheral subgroups. We then use a recent characterisation of relative hyperbolicity presented by D.V. Osin to serve as a bridge between our linear isoperimetric function for Cone(X̃) and a complete proof of relative hyperbolicity. This characterisation allows us to utilise geometric properties of X in order to show that pi1( X) has a linear relative isoperimetric function. This property is known to be equivalent to relative hyperbolicity. Keywords.

At still smaller scales, the behavior moderates to ∝ 1/q20 for q0 ≲ g4T, consistent with a finite electrical conductivity. An evaluation of the spectral weight in the q0 ~ g4 T region by kinetic theory techniques is carried out.

Much of the research in the field of driving and the elderly has focused on accident situations in which older drivers are over-involved, with little attention placed on developing and evaluating methods to enhance driving abilities. This thesis is comprised of two manuscripts, one examining the effectiveness of retraining programs for older drivers, and the other exploring older adults' perceptions of driving, concerns/difficulties associated with driving, and factors stimulating interest and participation in a driving program. The first manuscript presents a systematic review of the most recent literature on evidence regarding the effectiveness of retraining programs for older drivers. Reviewed articles were grouped according to the intervention studied: physical retraining, visual perception or education. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were appraised using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) Scale (PEDro, 2006) and interpreted following Foley's quality assessment (Foley, Teasell, Bhogal, &amp; Speechley, 2003). Each intervention was then rated for effectiveness based on Sackett's levels of evidence (Sackett, Richardson, Rosenberg, &amp; Haynes, 2000). Six RCTs, one pre- post-study design and one descriptive study met the inclusion criteria, one investigating physical retraining, one a visual perception intervention, five using an educational intervention and one examining a combination of all three, in addition to traffic engineering improvements. There is limited evidence that physical retraining (Level 2a) and visual perception retraining (Level 2a) improve driving related skills in older drivers. There is moderate evidence that educational interventions improve driving awareness and driving behavior (Level 1a), but do not reduce crashes (Level 1b) in older drivers. This suggests that while the evidence is limited, it is sufficiently encouraging to merit further research on interventions for healthy older drivers. In the second manuscript, the authors explore activities seniors use driving for, when and where they drive, importance of driving, perceived driving habits, behavioral changes as people age, and factors stimulating interest and participation in a driving program. Three focus groups (n=18), conducted using a structured format, were held with former and current drivers, 75 years and older, living in Montreal, Canada. Discussions were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed to identify themes/key points. Participants reported driving for short and long-distance trips, personal and leisure activities, or in situations where walking was not practical or possible. They indicated driving during days and evenings, on city streets and highways. Frequently reported changes and difficulties included reduced evening vision, slowing response times, and road signs not being clear or visible. The principle results indicated that participants were enthusiastic about a driving program and perceived a need for content such as: traffic law refreshers, retraining of driving-related skills, as well as an on-road driving component. An objective, comprehensive clinical assessment and on-road evaluation were also deemed important. Furthermore, participants expressed preference for a program offered sometime between 11am-to-5pm for one-to-two hours, once or twice weekly. This focus group research is the first step in a research agenda aimed at developing effective and practical driving interventions for healthy older drivers based on their desired needs and interests.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913v036.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3015644</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gerontology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988q06p"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Runoff simulation in the Canagagigue Creek watershed using the MIKE SHE model</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Oogathoo, Shalini</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Canagagigue Creek watershed, located in the Grand River Basin, is one of the fastest developing areas in Ontario. The watershed hydrology has changed considerably due to the increased anthropogenic activities, producing frequent floods and droughts as well as water quality problems. MIKE SHE, a watershed-scale model, was used to simulate surface runoff from the Canagagigue Creek watershed. Various management scenarios affecting the surface hydrology were also evaluated. The model was calibrated for four years (1994-95 to 1997-98) and validated for another four years (1990-91 to 19931-94). For the calibration period, the correlation between the observed and simulated daily runoff was satisfactory, as shown by the coefficient of determination value of 0.59. The coefficient of determination was 0.44 for the validation period. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients obtained were 59% and 40% for the calibration and validation period, respectively. Use of daily input data together with a simplistic snowmelt routine, was found to affect model performance during the winter/spring period. Henceforth, model performance can be greatly improved by adopting a more comprehensive method for simulating snowmelt and incorporating the frozen soil conditions. Overall, the model was able to simulate surface runoff reasonably well on annual, seasonal, monthly, and daily intervals, representing all the hydrological components adequately. With the various management scenarios simulated, it was found that the deforestation scenario considerably increased the total flow (11%). On the other hand, the high runoff peaks were decreased and low flows were increased considerably in the application of the tile drainage scenario. It was also observed that surface flow increased in wet years and decreased in normal and dry years in the climate change scenario. Though impacts of certain scenarios were almost negligible, their effects were significant when associated with the percentage area under transformation. Hence, it was concluded that the model can be used to simulate various management scenarios to solve hydrologic problems in the Southern Ontario climatic condition.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gq14c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988q06p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Runoff -- Ontario -- Canagagigue Creek Watershed -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jj74h"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Wet web strength development of paper</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Oliveira, Marcius Henrique de.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The adhesion of wet fibers is usually explained by the presence of capillary forces, which keep the swollen fibers together. These bonds are due to the free water present outside the wall of the swollen fibers. However, what happens when the free water is being removed and the tensile strength of the wet web continues to increase is not well understood. Tensile strength's measurements of refined fibers in presence of polyelectrolytes and mineral particles suggest that no enhancement of bonding occurs between the fibers when the free water is gone. The addition of microfibrils tends to enhance the wet web strength. This indicates strongly that fiber entanglement due to mechanical interactions may be the major interaction responsible for keeping the swollen fibers together in the transient region where neither capillary forces nor hydrogen bonding dominate. The interactions between fibers, precipitated calcium carbonated (PCC) and retention aids, revealed that the wet web strength of PCC-filled handsheets is detrimental in the presence of flocculated PCC particles, while no detrimental effect is observed in the presence of stable PCC particles. Friction generated by the deposition of small and/or single particles on the fiber surface can explain their enhancement of strength, whereas bigger particles may prevent the entanglement of fibers. Finally, the addition of polyelectrolytes to swollen fibers reduces the wet web strength. The presence of an additional polymer layer results in an increased electrosteric repulsion between fibers, which decreases the friction between fibers. This reduction of friction makes the fibers slide more easily over each other, resulting in poor wet web strength.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gq15n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jj74h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Papermaking -- Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n540h"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The price of anarchy and a priority-based model of routing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Olver, Neil</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The price of anarchy, a concept introduced by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [9], is the main topic of this thesis. It is a measure of the loss of efficiency that occurs when there is no central control over a system consisting of many "selfish" agents. We will be particularly interested in this in the context of network games, which can be used to model congestion in traffic and communication networks. After an introduction of the relevant concepts and review of related work, we proceed with the new results of this thesis. We provide a new upper bound for the price of anarchy in the case of atomic unsplittable agents with polynomial cost functions, and demonstrate that it is tight by an explicit construction. We then introduce a new model for network routing that introduces priorities; users with a higher priority on a link will be able to traverse the link more quickly. Our model is fairly general, and allows various different priority schemes for modelling different situations. One particularly interesting version, which we have dubbed the timestamp game, assigns priorities according to the order of arrival at the start of the link. We derive tight upper bounds for the price of anarchy in our model in the case of polynomial cost functions and nonatomic agents. We also obtain tight results in the unsplittable case with linear cost functions, and an upper bound with polynomial cost functions. While we concentrate on network games, most of the results carry through to the more general class of congestion games, which we also discuss.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vw22d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n540h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computational complexity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer networks -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92gc45c"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Inhibition of corrosion of steels by self-assembled-monolayers of caprylate</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ghareba, Saad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The interaction of a sodium salt of octanoic acid, sodium caprylate (SC), with a carbon steel (CS) and stainless steel (SS) surface was investigated over a wide pH and temperature range, using a range of experimental techniques. The aim of the research was to investigate the possibility of using SC as a corrosion inhibitor, and to determine the mechanism of its corrosion inhibition. It was shown that SC acts as a good CS and SS general and pitting corrosion inhibitor, respectively, yielding a maximum corrosion inhibition efficiency of 97% at pH 2. This high inhibition efficiency is maintained even at higher temperatures. Kinetic measurements demonstrated that inhibition efficiency of ca. 93% is achieved within fifteen minutes after the immersion of the CS surface in the SC solution, while complete equilibrium, and thus maximum efficiency, is achieved after one hour. It was determined that SC inhibits both partial corrosion reactions, and can thus be considered to be a mixed-type inhibitor. The corrosion inhibition efficiency was shown to be directly proportional to the surface coverage by SC. The adsorption of SC on the CS surface at low pH was described by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. It was found that this process is spontaneous, irreversible and driven by the entropy gain. It was postulated that SC forms a self-assembled-monolayer (SAM) on the steel surface. In an aqueous solution, a bi-layer structure is formed. The inner SAM layer is irreversibly attached to the CS surface through the carboxylate head group, with the hydrophobic tail oriented towards the aqueous phase. The outer SAM is physiosorbed on top of the inner SAM, through hydrophobic interactions of the two SAM tails. In this configuration, the bi-layer structure represents an effective barrier for the diffusion of charged (corrosive) species and water molecules to the metal surface, thus protecting the metal from corrosion.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bn676.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92gc45c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612s88j"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Poly(ethylene glycol-co-lactic acid) block copolymer micelles : synthesis, physicochemical characterization, and degradation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Godbout, Chris</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this thesis was to synthesize two poly(lactic acid)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) biodegradable amphiphilic block copolymers that can self-assemble in an aqueous environment into a micellar morphology.

Two copolymers were synthesized which had different sizes and relative block lengths. These copolymers were characterized using NMR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography and thermogravimetric analysis. With these two polymers the self-assembly conditions which lead to the most narrow size distribution as determined by dynamic light scattering, were found and micelles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and through the partitioning of pyrene between the core of the micelles and water. Finally, an investigation of the time scales of micelle degradation was performed by monitoring a solution of micelles over an extended period of time.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053m57x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612s88j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cv896"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Predictors of temporomandibular disorders : clinical variables and patient characteristics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ghanbari, Hedieh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This case control study was designed to investigate the contributing factors for the occurrence of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and its subgroups: myofascial pain (MFP) and disc displacement (DD). 178 patients with TMD were selected from the dental clinics of the Jewish General and Montreal General Hospitals, Montreal, Canada, and 100 concurrent controls selected only at the first clinic, participated in this study. The association with TMD, MFP and DD was evaluated for bruxism, trauma, psychological factors, and sociodemographic status using a logistic regression.

Many such genes were identified in genetic screens for homozygous mutant females that produce abnormal embryos. However, mutations in zygotically required maternal effect genes are homozygous lethal, and therefore viable females cannot be recovered using this screening approach. This limitation can be overcome by generating homozygous mutant follicle cell clones in heterozygous females using a system that induces site-specific mitotic recombination events. However, to date, eggs produced from egg chambers with complete follicle cell clones cannot be directly identified. We have developed an eggshell marker for follicle cell clones using a dominant negative (DN) allele of the gene defective chorion (dec). Females with a single copy of this allele, decDN, lay collapsed eggs and are therefore sterile. Site-specific mitotic recombination events induced in females heterozygous for decDN and a mutation on the homologous chromosome arm result in homozygous mutant follicle cells that have lost decDN. Therefore, egg chambers with the entire follicular epithelium homozygous mutant generate intact eggs that can be unambiguously identified amongst otherwise collapsed eggs.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655m64h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sm468</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Embryology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68km37b"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ovarian cancer cells exhibit aberrations in the Wnt signaling pathway, which affect cell proliferation and cadherin expression</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Falcone, Emilia Liana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from a gynecological malignancy in North America. It is an incomplete understanding of the early molecular events in ovarian carcinogenesis which limit our ability to diagnose and effectively treat this disease at a stage when it is still curable. The Wnt/beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway is involved in development, wound repair, and tumorigenesis. Studies examining the involvement of Wnt/canonical signaling in ovarian carcinogenesis, however, have only recently begun to emerge. In this study, we hypothesize that ovarian cancer cells exhibit aberrations in Wnt/canonical signaling, which may cause and/or effect ovarian tumorigenesis. Our objectives were therefore to (1) determine whether ovarian cancer cells exhibit alterations in the expression patterns of Wnt signaling pathway components, (2) determine whether ovarian cancer cells exhibit functional aberrations in response to Wnt/canonical stimulation and (3) determine whether these aberrations affect cell proliferation and cadherin expression. Our study shows that ovarian cancer cells exhibit alterations in the expression profiles of Wnt signaling pathway components and that these cells display aberrations at different levels of the Wnt/canonical signaling pathway, which in turn, modulate cell proliferation, and cadherin expression. These results suggest that Wnt/canonical signaling may be involved in ovarian tumorigenesis and that further study of this involvement may contribute to a better understanding of early molecular events in ovarian cancer.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd4731527.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68km37b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21tk74t"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Oxidative and nitrative stress biomarkers in amniotic fluid and their association with fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>El-Halabi, Dima</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The study objectives were to: (1) assess fetal exposure to oxidative stress by measuring amniotic fluid concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), thiobarbituric acid--reactive substances (TBARS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and (2) establish whether these concentrations were associated with infant birth weight, gestational age, or oxidative stress-related conditions arising during pregnancy.

In this work, we have investigated properties of a new liquid chamber, called the GLIC-03 (Guarded Liquid Ionization Chamber), including chamber stability, reproducibility, and establishing recombination corrections. The response varied by less than 1% over 10 hours, and was reproducible within 1.5% of the mean over different liquid fills. Recombination corrections were established, and were small for low dose rates and high voltages. The establishment of these characteristics allowed us to compare measurements of the GLIC-03 in a region of charged particle disequilibrium to those made with a diamond detector.

Moreover, both the scientific community and policymakers have recently shown a growing interest in the potential impacts of climate change on water resources management. Indeed, changes in the intensity and frequency of occurrence of extreme rainfall events may have serious impacts. As such, it is important to understand not only the current patterns of extreme rainfalls but also how they are likely to change in the future. The objective of the present research is therefore to find the best method for estimating accurately extreme rainfalls for the current time period and future periods in the context of climate change. The analysis of extreme rainfall data from the province of Quebec (Canada) revealed that, according to L-moment ratio diagrams, the data may be well described by the Generalized-Extreme-Value (GEV) distribution. Results also showed that a simple scaling relationship between non-central moments (NCM) and duration can be established and that a scaling method based on NCMs and scaling exponents can be used to generate accurate estimates of extreme rainfalls at Dorval station (Quebec, Canada). Other results demonstrated that the method of NCMs can accurately estimate distribution parameters and can be used to construct accurate Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves. Furthermore, a regional analysis was performed and homogenous regions of weather stations within Quebec were identified. A method for the estimation of missing data at ungauged sites based on regional NCMs was found to yield good estimates. In addition, the potential impacts of climate change on extreme rainfalls were assessed. Changes in the distribution of annual maximum (AM) precipitations were evaluated using simulations from two Global Climate Models (GCMs) under the A2 greenhouse gas emission scenario: the Coupled Global Climate Model version 2 (CGCM2A2) of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, and the Hadley Centre's Model version 3 (HadCM3A2). Simulations from these two models were downscaled spatially using the Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM). A bias-correction method to adjust the downscaled AM daily precipitations for Dorval station was tested and results showed that after adjustments, the values fit the observed AM daily precipitations well. The analysis of future AM precipitations revealed that, after adjustments, AM precipitations downscaled from CGCM2A2 increase from current to future periods, while AM precipitations downscaled from HadCM3A2 show a mild decrease from current to future periods, for daily and sub-daily scales.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kz09k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pf78m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rainfall probabilities -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rainfall anomalies -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494d59n"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Modulation of macrophage nitric oxide production by hemozoin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Contreras, Ana Paulina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Malaria is one of the most serious human infectious diseases. To date, the collection of studies suggest that the disease is determined by transmission dynamics and host age altogether with host genetics and immunological responses. The precise and direct contribution of parasite components to the activation of such immunological responses has not been fully unravelled. In addition to a role proposed for plasmodial GPI, different lines of evidence suggest that hemozoin (HZ) could also be a potential inflammatory agent. The role of HZ in the modulation of immune responses has remained a polemic subject, making it difficult to describe the contribution of this molecule in pathogenesis of malaria. However, our previous laboratory studies, suggest that HZ has a pro-inflammatory role. For this reason, our study was designed to further define the contribution of HZ to the pro-inflammatory events related to malaria immunopathology, and to identify the intracellular signals underlying the up-regulatory effects of HZ in the macrophage, one of the major sources of inflammatory mediators in malaria. In order to do that, we used a chemically characterized synthetic version of the native PfHZ, rcHZ; and evaluated its effects on macrophage nitric oxide (NO) production. Our first approach was to compare the effects of rcHZ with other morphologically different versions of this molecule (aHZ and scHZ) alone or in combination with IFN-gamma on macrophage NO production. In a second approach, we evaluated if the presence of serum proteins plays a role in the increased IFN-gamma induced-NO production by rcHZ. In the third part of our study, we explored if rcHZ is able to increase NO production by macrophages when incubated in combination with a molecule from another pathogen, such as gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccaride (LPS). The present study is a functional study that uses a synthetic and morphologically identical version of the native PfHZ. Our results suggests that intrinsic physical characteristics, such as shape and size; presence of host serum proteins, and presence of other pathogenic molecules, are important determinants for the macrophage response to HZ in the context of NO production. Besides, it describes part of the signaling pathways that are involved, which may contribute in the future, not only to understand mechanisms of regulation; but also, to find new therapeutic targets against malaria.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920g190j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494d59n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Malaria -- Immunological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Malaria -- Pathogenesis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hemoproteins</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atd96k6687"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Seasonal development and natural enemies of an invasive exotic species, the swede midge Contarinia nasturtii (Kieffer), in Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Corlay Herrera, Favio Raul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Quebec, the swede midge (Contarinia nasturtii), a newly invasive pest, was found for the first time in 2003. During a two year study (2004-2005) I studied the seasonal development of the swede midge, the presence of natural enemies and tested entomopathogenic nematodes for its control. Results showed that the overwintering generation of the swede midge emerged during the second half of June. Based on adult captures and abundance of larvae in the field, there were three to four overlapping generations. Late transplants were more heavily attacked by the swede midge and broccoli and cauliflower were the most susceptible crops. No parasitoids were found in the experimental sites during either year of the study and two polyphagous coccinellid predators (Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata) were field-collected for further evaluation under laboratory conditions. Although these two coccinellid species fed on swede midge larvae in plastic containers, further experiments demonstrated that H. axyridis was not able to prey on swede midge larvae on infested broccoli plants. The susceptibility of swede midge larvae to three species of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema feltiae, S. carpocapsae, and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) was also evaluated in laboratory assays. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was the only species that caused significant mortality to swede midge larvae and, at a concentration of 1000 IJs/larva, caused 90-100% mortality in loam, sandy loam, clay and muck soil. This is the first study describing the seasonal development of the swede midge in Quebec. In addition, the potential use of entomopathogenic nematodes as biological control agents against the swede midge is demonstrated.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gm64g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k6687</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cole crops -- Diseases and pests -- Biological control -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Contarinia nasturtii -- Biological control -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nonindigenous pests -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Contarinia nasturtii -- Predators of -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aff365932g"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>High aspect ratio cantilever tips for non-contact electrostatic force microscopy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cockins, Lynda Patricia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work focuses on the atomic force microscope: its hardware, modes of operation, and applications.

The methods included (1) sequential digestion of wood tissue to remove the elemental fraction that is mobile across tree rings leaving the structurally intrinsic, residual (or less mobile) ion fraction for analysis and (2) transformation of elemental concentrations into multivariate ratios (compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND)) over a time series. Sampling of trees represented a gradient in acidity resilience using three regions of southern Quebec (St. Lawrence Lowlands; Lower Laurentians; and Appalachian Highlands) and three species (red maple ( Acer rubrum L.); sugar maple (Acer sacharum Marsh.); and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). The elemental residual fraction had differences from the mobile fraction over time for Ca, Mg and Mn, but not for K or Al. The base rich Saint-Lawrence region had the highest and slightly increasing incremental stem xylem Al of the regions yet had stable or increasing growth. By contrast the acid sensitive Appalachian region had the greatest increase in Al accompanied by a decrease in growth beyond 1970. The Appalachians also had the highest Mn, which had an adverse effect on growth of sugar maple. The acid-resilient species American beech had stable or decreasing Al while having stable or increasing growth in contrast to the less resilient sugar and red maple. The nutrient poor Laurentian region had a persistent deficiency of K over time but no relationships with Al. Aluminium had a general negative correlation with the other canons. Although Mn had the highest levels in red maple for each region, it appears to be limiting growth. The changes in wood chemistry and growth over time appear to be driven by the resilience of the region or species to increasing acidic load in the ecosystems.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30px88s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dt68v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Red maple -- Québec (Province) -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>American beech -- Québec (Province) -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sugar maple -- Québec (Province) -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trees -- Effect of acid deposition on -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wood -- Québec (Province) -- Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
