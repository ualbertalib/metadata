Experimental surgery, as a branch of surgery, was at that time in its beginnings, both at McGill University and in other centers on this continent. It is, therefore, not surprising that several serious technical difficulties have prevented the completion of the proposed research at that time.

Isolates have been cultured on chunks of moist sterile calf hooves (Blank, 1951). An isolate has also been cultured in a distilled water medium containing glucose, salts and vitamins and containing particulate hoof keratin as sole source of nitrogen (Kapica and Blank, 1957).

The Expedition was not equipped with the instruments necessary to carry out a detailed micro climatological study, thus no quantitative measurements of heat balance were obtained.

Sociologists have studied many facets of this area of social behaviour and their insights and explanations add much to our knowledge of society. Through observing occupations, it is possible to learn about the world of work as a part of the social structure, and at the same time to gain understanding of the human beings who spend much of their lives in occupational milieux.
