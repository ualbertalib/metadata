Vestibular tests were performed on 19 normal adults which made up the control group. 9 Seizure Patients with temporal lobe lesions were also tested. It is thought that lesions of the temporal lobe may produce directional preponderance of nystagmus to calorie stimulation on the ipsilateral side. This means that the homolateral labyrinth is more sensitive to hot water and the contralateral labyrinth to cold water stimulation. In the control series of 19 cases, 63 percent showed directional preponderance in more than two parameters; the parameters used being: total time, latent period, total beats, total amplitude and maximum slow speed. In the 9 temporal lobe cases tested, 5 showed directional preponderance in more than two parameters.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gannon, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sh14x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gp43m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Otolaryngology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623h08n"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Equilibria in adsorbent – binary liquid systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wong, Sau.

It is a result of intermolecular attractive forces of the solid and the substance adsorbed. The attractive forces are different for each system. This variation of attractive forces causes an increased concentration of one molecular type on the solid surface when two different molecules are brought into contact with the solid. The process is reversible. In the chemical engineering sense, adsorption may be defined in terms of a unit operation which deals with the utilization of surface forces and the concentration of materials on the surfaces of solid bodies referred to as adsorbants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chon, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193d48j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623h08n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s3837"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Study of freezing phenomena in some arctic soils</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Windisch, Stephen.

However, the locus of "commonness” cannot be resolved by such techniques. In-vitro studies reported in this communication permit the application of Michaelis-Menten formulation to the kinetics of transport of these compounds in rat kidney cortex slices. The data indicate that L-proline, hydroxy-L-proline and glycine cannot be transported by identical mechanisms but that there is some aspect of these systems which is common. The order of affinity for transport in-vitro is proline &gt; hydroxyproline &gt; glycine, confirming in-vivo observations. The relation of these findings to the control of imino acid and glycine transport under certain genetic and maturational conditions in man, is discussed. A proposal as to the locus of commonness in transport generally, and more specifically in the transport of glycine and the imino acids, is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scriver, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nf65x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50h0762</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Investigative Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s384h"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the vitamin B6 requirement of exercise tomato roots grown in sterile culture</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Willemot, Claude</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main purpose of this work was to determine whether ethanolamine is a precursor of vitamin B6 in the excised tomato root. The suggestion that this might be the case arose from the fact that ethanolamine replaces the vitamin in the nutrition of excised tomato roots grown in sterile culture (Boll, 1954). Analytical data presented by Boll (1959) were interpreted to mean that ethanolamine is not a precursor of vitamin B6 in the excised tomato root. However, it became necessary to reexamine this question because of some recent work by Morris and Woods (1959), who reported that glycoladehyde (GA) gave good replacement for the vitamin in the nutrition of a vitamin B6 requiring mutant of Escherichia coli. According to several authors (Fruton and Simmonds, 1958), ethanolamine is converted to GA metabolically.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boll, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hn94f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s384h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Botany</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r6716"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On measurement in physical education with particular reference to motor abilities</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Widdop, James.

When too many entries precluded the running of the race at one time and at one place, then beats became necessary. At first only winners of beats went forward into the finals but because, in psychological terms, it would be too time consuming to get paired comparisons with every possible comparison being used, heats are run with the proviso that there must be some device for including people who, although they had lost their own heat, could, had they been placed in another beat, have possibly been winners. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wood, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397c78d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r6716</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s600v"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Glucuronide synthesis as a test of liver function</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Whittaker, Hyacinth.

About 50% of all newborn infants exhibit some degree of jaundice, which seldom exceeds 10 mg% and is maximal between the third and fourth days of life. This is generally referred to as “icterus neonatorum” or physiological jaundice. Superimposed on this "icterus neonatorum” are the more severe cases of jaundice for which there is a known cause.

What can be stated confidently, however, is that the circuitry which is the indispensable anatomical basis of vision does run in these tracts. Similarly, the occurrence of unconsciousness subsequent to a local lesion in the brain does not prove that consciousness resides in that area to the exclusion of any other area, but only that the integrity of the damaged region is essential to consciousness.

Today, the increased educational opportunities extended to the children of all social and economic classes, through compulsory public schooling and scholarship programs, have widened the scope of career choice immeasurably. Undoubtedly, this trend towards equal opportunities is a good thing; however, it contributes towards making the selection of a realistic educational program, and the choice of an ultimate career, a more difficult task. Moreover, as higher learning comes within the means of children of all classes, post-secondary school training institutions become more crowded, entrance standards rise, and students are forced to make vocational choices at a comparatively early age, in order that they may channel their efforts towards competing successfully to enter the advanced schools of their choice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Munroe, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053k72t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f714s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623h09x"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The secretory rate of aldosterone in man</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Watanabe, Mamoru</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>From 1927 to 1930 various groups of investigators demonstrated that adrenal cortical extracts were capable of prolonging the life of adrenalectomized cats (1-4) and dogs (5).

Practically all of contemporary mathematical evolution theory is encompassed by the field of population genetics, which takes the empirical facts of Mendelian genetics as given and infers their evolutionary consequences. The writer has approached the subject from the opposite direction. This thesis takes the occurrence of evolution by natural selection as a given fact, and emphasizes that mere chance could not have produced the highly adapted organisms we see around us within the limitations of time and space to which natural selection has been restricted. It then attempts to infer the properties of a genetic system, and other conditions, which are necessary and sufficient to allow natural selection to have yielded products so different from those which would have been yielded by chance alone.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Naylor, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q975t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wn88g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s6014"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Solvation effects in acidity function studies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wang, I.

It seeks to explore, by analyzing these experiences, whether the recreation agency can play a role in the prevention and prediction of juvenile delinquency. A sample group of ten delinquents, who had experiences in recreation agencies, were selected from among the residents of the Boys’ Farm and Training School in Shawbridge, Quebec. Records kept at the Boys’ Farm and Training School and interviews with the boys, were the sources of data. In the interviews, questions were designed to get factual information about agency participation, behaviour patterns demonstrated during participation, relationships with staff and other members, attitudes towards the agency and the manner and extent of parent contact with agency. The data was analyzed in light of what has been said in current literature about the causes and prevention of delinquency. The final chapter concludes that the recreation and informal education agency does have the potential for contributing to the prevention and prediction of juvenile delinquency, It offers suggestions for adaptations and additions in their service if they are to realize this potential. Furthermore, areas for future research are indicated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gifford, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h077b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644w22z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t286g"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Melting phenomena in rocks of the anorthosite suite</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vincent, John. S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Anorthosites and their associated rock types have been a subject of controversy for a considerable number of years. Several genetic theories have been suggested to explain the observed field characteristics, but none have been completely accepted by authorities on the subject. Theories on the origin of anorthosite may be classed as magnetic, metasomatic, and anatectic, and all contain useful ideas. Where an aspect of the problem appears to be successfully solved by one genetic theory, another remains embarrassingly unexplained. It is quite possible that a complex series of events is responsible for the formation of the anorthosites and their associated rock types. Kranck (1961) points out that, "The origin of the anorthosites is almost as controversial a subject as the granite problem.”</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kranck, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jv67t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t286g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wr31p"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The road towards a European common air market</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Verploeg, Elias. A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>After a brief discussion of the causes which gave rise to the existing protectionist aviation policies and their consequences in Western-Europe, "the Road towards a European Common Air Market” deals with the development of air law in Europe from the outset of aviation until the present days. Next there follows an analysis of the problems of civil aviation in Europe, emphasizing the need for closer co-operation between both governments and airlines, and of the various forms of collaboration and co-ordination between airlines. Mention is also made of a number of governmental and private efforts to facilitate civil air transport and to stimulate its development, i.a. of the plans submitted by Bonnefous, Sforza and Van de Kieft to the Council of Europe and the establishment of the European Civil Aviation Conference at Strasbourg in 1955 as a result of these plans.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cohen.

A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the first decades of this century, Professor Werner Sombart was regarded as one of the greatest German economists, but a controversial figure even within his own country. The task of these pages is to analyze his teachings and doctrines, to assess his contributions to economies, and to determine how his approach to economies differed from that of his great western contemporaries. Few economists have been as prolific as Sombart. He wrote many books and treatises and innumerable journal articles. This work, which culminated in his description of the economies of societies in all epochs from the Carolingians to his own, must be added to many compilations of a statistical kind. The total is enormous. It represents an amount of work and research seldom found in the lifetime of one man.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Weldon, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63t043h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494c80p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics and Political Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hn95q"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cell wall of amoebidium parasiticum</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Trotter, Margaret. J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study was undertaken to determine the nature of the cell wall of Amoebidium parasiticum Cienk. The walls of most fungi studied up to the present time have contained either chitin or cellulose. In one case, the wall contained both chitin and cellulose (Fuller and Barshad, 1960). Staining tests with the wall of Amoebidium parasiticum failed to reveal the presence of either chitin or cellulose (Schenk, 1858; Whisler, 1961). Therefore it was considered an interesting problem to determine exactly what materials were present in this cell wall.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Whisler, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sx41n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hn95q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Botany</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290f102"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Stimulus generalization of conceptual responses</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tripathi, Lal. B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It has been argued that the principles of stimulus generalization (SG) derived from conditioning experiments also apply to human voluntary responses (e.g., Gibson, 1939; Brown, et al., 1951; Andreas, 1954; Mednick &amp; Freedman, 1960). In order to prove this contention empirically, several experiments have been performed on a variety of voluntary responses, such as, verbal, perceptual, conceptual and judgmental. However, a critical survey of these studies, such as that reported in the following pages, reveals that they have failed to demonstrate convincingly any more than superficial similarities between their results and the results reported in conditioning experiments. Furthermore, their authors have typically shown such strong predilection for working within the framework of traditional formulations of SG that they have failed to analyze and report their results in such a way as to bring out their full significance for other areas of psychological investigation to which they are relevant.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bindra, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tc76z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290f102</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sk772"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Henry Balnaves: a study of a layman’s contribution to the Reformation in Scotland in the sixteenth century</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Trickey, Kenneth.

In spite of the tact that numerous authorities have dealt with the history or the Reformation in Scotland in the sixteenth century, very few have written about the people who supported, encouraged, and actively fought for the outstanding figures of the periode There are maey individuals who played important roles in the unt"olding of the events of the times who have been passed over by most authors.. Because so muoh attention bas been directed to the endeavours ot a few outstanding personalities, especially John Knox, the tull story of the Reformation bas not been told. Without the support and guidance of people like Henry Balnaves, Knox would not have been able to carry out his mission.
