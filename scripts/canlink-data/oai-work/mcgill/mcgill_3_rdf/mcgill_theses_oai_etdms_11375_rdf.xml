Incorporation of proline-3-4-H3 and its conversion to labelled hydroxyproline was used as an index of glomerular basement membrane synthesis in normal and nephrotoxic nephritic rats. 200 uc of proline-3-4-H3 was injected intraperitoneally into normal and nephrotoxic nephritic rats 48 hours after initiation of the disease. Ten rats from each group were killed 12 hours, 5 days, and 10 days after injection of proline-3-4-H3. Cell-free glomerular basement membrane was prepared by ultrasonic vibration of glomerular isolates and the content of labelled and non-labelled proline and hydroxyproline analyzed. Mean specific activities of proline and hydroxyproline expressed as dpm/u mole were significantly higher in the nephrotoxic nephritic rats at all the periods studied (p &lt; 0.01). No difference was seen in the plasma concentrations of proline-3-4-H3 between normal and nephrotoxic nephritic rats at the various stages. Changes by light microscopy were minimal or absent in the 12 hour and 5 day groups despite the detectable changes in specific activities of proline and hydroxyproline. These results suggest an early increase in glomerular basement membrane synthesis following injury induced by nephrotoxic serum.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>ummond, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52jc05k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w291g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wq94r"><ual:graduationDate>1947</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Anatole France devant la critique americaine</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tougas, Gérard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Depuis le début de la première guerre mondiale, un fait n’a cessé de piquer la curiosité de nombreux observateurs de la vie intellectuelle en Amérique, à savoir, la vogue extraordinaire que l’oeuvre d’Anatole France connut aux Etats-Unis. Il est en effet tort curieux que cet auteur,qui, de l’aveu de plusieurs critiques, possède des qualités essentiellement françaises et latines, ait pu susciter chez ses lecteurs anglo-saxons un intérêt aussi vif. Henri Peyre, un des étudiants les plus avisés de la question, nous dit: L’immense succès d’Anatole France dans les pays anglo-saxons et nordiques est un des phénomènes littéraires les plus surprenants de l’histoire intellectuelle de ce temps; cet écrivain, artiste et styliste avant tout, donc intraduisible; ironique et négateur; sensuel et plaisamment immoral, a pu séduire des peuples d’ordinaire médiocrement attentifs au poli de la forme, friands de didactisme ou d’effets un peu appuyés (voir le choix des Prix Nobel, par exemple) sérieux et puritains. Pour expliquer cet engouement surprenant, il est manifeste qu’une étude portant sur la réaction de la critique américaine à partir du moment où elle s’est intéressée à l’oeuvre d’Anatole France serait de la plus grande utilité à quiconque voudrait baser ses opinions et conclusions sur une documentation aussi complète que patiemment contrôlée.

This is natural as theories and counter-theories with hypothesis upon hypothesis are put forward to attempt to ellucidate an unknown or but little understood phenomenon.” (1) This statement applies precisely to the problem at hand. Experimental cancer research had its real conception approximately 50 years ago. The problem has turned out to be a large one - larger than anyone knew. The exact nature of the neoplastic process is still unknown today. Shimkin (2) in his consideration of the cancer problem emphasized the remarks of Oberling: “The present concept of cancer may be compared with the concept of acute inflammatory infections of one hundred years ago. Most of the inflammatory diseases then were designated as fevers and much speculation and thought was spent on the cause and nature of fever. We are still fundamentally unacquainted with what produces fever or inflammation but our advances are based on relative disregard of the question and on experimental work on specific problems of specific infections.” Such may prove to be the case in the search for the solution of the perplexing cancer problem. The literature on cancer is voluminous and is increasing each day as more and more investigators become interested in this mystery of nature which has not been fathomed as yet and which remains today still far from solution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Collip, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58ph11b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j3335552</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Endocrinology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418r48w"><ual:graduationDate>1967</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Relaxation method for open boundary field problems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cermak, Ivan A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Numerical methods for solving two-dimensional boundary-value problems of elliptic type are practically limited to the interior, or c10sed problem.

Certain clinicians utilize serum, harvested from severely burned patients, in the treatment of acute burns. The basis for the use of this convalescent serum is its presumed content of protective antibodies, produced in response to protein degradation at the level of the dermal injury. This investigation was an attempt to produce non-bacterial burn-specific heterologous antiserum, using as antigen, full-thickness burn wound extracts. The method of antibody demonstration was the Ouchterlony precipitation reaction. By this technique, no burn-specific antigen was demonstrable. Histopathological examination of the stomach and small bowel of lethally burned rodents up to six hours post-injury revealed a sequence of changes suggesting that mucin production in both organs is profoundly altered after severe burn in jury.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Woolhouse, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967683g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591c328</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182p23n"><ual:graduationDate>1967</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A radioautographic study of the distribution of labelled sugars in rat tissues</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bennett, Gary</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In various experiments, young rats were given single injections of labelled sugars, particularly 3H-1-galactose and 3 H-1-mannose, and sacrificed after various time intervals. Radioautographs showed that 3H-1-galactose and 3H-1-mannose were incorporated into a great variety of cells. Most mucous cells showed heavy reactions; label appeared first in the Golgi region, later in mucus. In reactions over chondrocytes, label appeared to migrate from Golgi region to surrounding matrix. Many cells utilized 3H-1-galactose and 3H-1-mannose to a different extent. After 3 H-1-galactose only, heavy reactions appeared over certain nonsecretory cells (duodenal columnar, various duct cells) in which label appeared to migrate to cell coat. Argentaffin and osteoclast cells showed intense, diffuse, cytoplasmic reactions, but only after 3H-1-mannose; no migration of label appeared within five hours. Amylase treatment reduced reaction over certain cells, indicating that some label was incorporated into glycogen. In conclusion, 3H-1-galactose and 3H-1-mannose incorporation, for synthesis of glycogen and presumably other complex carbohydrates, is widespread.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33s068s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182p23n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jx701"><ual:graduationDate>1967</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of stimulation on ionic changes in canine gastric pouches</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Adair, Ross K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The stomach has the unique ability of being able to contain an acid solution as distinct from the property of the parietal cell mass to secrete acid.

Feeding in Heidenhain pouches produced an increased competency of the gastric mucosal barrier as measured by the decreased exchange of hydrogen for sodium ions. Antrectomy did not reduce this effect significantly indicating that intestinal or pancreatic factors may be important in addition to gastrin. A comparison of the effect of insulin and gastrin on the mucosal barrier in Pavlov pouches indicated that vagal stimulation probably has no influence on the competency of the mucosal barrier while gastrin significantly increases this competency.

Beginning in the 1960s, leading composers includingWayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock began stretching the boundaries set by this standardrepertoire, with the goal of introducing new compositional elements in order to expandthat model. Trumpeter, composer, and arranger Kenny Wheeler has been at the forefrontof European jazz music since the late 1960s and his works exemplify a contemporaryapproach to jazz composition. This paper investigates six pieces from Wheeler'ssongbook and identifies the compositional elements of his language and how he hasdeveloped an original voice through the use and adaptation of these elements. In order toidentify these traits, I analyzed the melodic, harmonic, structural and textural aspects ofthese works by studying both the scores and recordings. Each of the pieces I analyzeddemonstrates qualities consistent with Wheeler's compositional style, such as theexpansion oftonality through the use of mode mixture, non-functional harmonicprogressions, melodic composition through intervallic sequence, use of metric changeswithin a song form, and structural variation. Finally, the demands of Wheeler's music onthe performer are examined.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>La composition jazz est enracinee dans le Grand repertoire American de lachanson, ou "Great American Songbook", qui constitue la plus grande partie du repertoirestandard de jazz, et en a defini les principes compositionnels.

Pierre Baillot, an eminent violinist and pedagogue, was especially influential in this regard, as he co-wrote and edited the first official violin method of theConservatoire, the Methode de violon (1803). He revised and expanded this method as L 'art du violon (1834) to account for technological breakthroughs and new repertoire.This study revisits this groundbreaking violin method from a performer's perspective and applies it to Pierre Boulez's Anthemes I pour violon seul (1991-1992) and Anthemes2 pour violon et dispositif electronique ( 1997). The study is divided into five parts. First, it discusses the historical and cultural link between Baillot and Boulez. Second, it elaborates on the history of the violin and bow and their construction from the eighteen century to the present day. Parts three and four then illustrate how Baillot's L 'art du violon addresses technical challenges in Boulez's Anthemes I. This explanation accounts for Baillot's methodology and etudes, and is divided into right- and left-hand techniques, respectively. Finally, part five, investigates how the live electronics in Anthemes 2 redefine the violin's sound, as well as the violinist herself.
