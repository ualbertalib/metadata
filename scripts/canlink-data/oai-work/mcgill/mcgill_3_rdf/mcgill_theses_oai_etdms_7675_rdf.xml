Reclaimed peat soils are often quite valuable, particularly for certain crops. In districts near large commercial centers, where land is high priced, the development of new areas more difficult to handle is becoming practicable, and if means of reclaiming these deposits at a reduced cost are discovered, or of increasing their value as a crop producing medium found, a distinct forward step will have been taken.

The great tendency is to plant the corn very thickly, the growers claiming that in this way they get the most succulent silage and the greatest tonnage per acre. Others plant thinly and claim that a good ear development is necessary if silage of a high nutritive value is to be obtained.

Since porous solids possess an extremely large surface, relative to their mass, one would expect this power to be developed to a high degree, and this is amply borne out by the observed facts. The original discovery of this phenomenon was made by Scheele and Fontana, independently, in 1777, and the selective nature of adsorption was at once recognized.
