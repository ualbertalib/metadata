To this end, I present both an analyses of Mallet-Stevens' work and a photomontage on the Noailles and Cavrois villas, which combines my photos with historical documents. The montage reveals in these spaces a perceptual quality of the image germane to Merleau-Ponty's notion of flesh. The analysis develops this notion along the lines of 'the grain and the skin'. It reveals in Mallet-Stevens' work the capital importance of his experience, as movie set designer. Indeed, space is conceived by Mallet-Stevens in relationship to a camera frame: therefore the primary medium is the surface (the grain), where the emotional effect of temporality takes place (the skin).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rg34n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jt02s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Villa de Noailles (Hyères, France)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mallet-Stevens, Robert, 1886-1945</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- France -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Villa Cavrois (Croix, Nord, France)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2f75r9621"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Kit homes as a self-help affordable strategy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ghandehari, Hoordad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Within the prefabrication industry, Kit homes have had a long history of success within the twentieth century. Kit homes are houses whose components are manufactured using a panelized or pre-cut prefabrication system, are numbered, packaged and shipped to the building site for erection. Among the different strategies in purchasing a manufactured house, buying a house as a kit has a great potential for self-help assembly. Since about one third of the cost of construction is labor costs, the author has investigated the option of self-help building using Kit homes, to eliminate the labor cost and thus further reduce the construction cost. In order to study the Kit home potential and costs when bought from, and assembled by the manufacturer, four manufacturers of prefabricated homes who offer Kit homes were visited. In order to study the Kit home potential and costs when assembled by the buyer, the building process of a self-helper was researched and documented.

The potential of phytoremediation to remediate mixtures of heavy metals and hydrocarbons in soil is presented in two papers. A hydropic screening of twenty-seven forage grasses, grown in a solution containing 100 muM Zn, 5 muM Cu and 1 muM Cd, provided six species that were exceptionally metal tolerant. These six species were examined for their growth response and root phenolic secretion at five levels of hydroponic heavy metal contamination. Phenolic secretion, an indicator of a plant's capacity to promote polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation, increased with heavy metal contamination, however, the values were low (&lt;30 mug/g root). Two high biomass producing, metal-tolerant grasses, Bromus riparius and Arrhenatherum elatius, were combined with M2Rhizo4, a strain of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria. The plant-bacterial combinations were established in artificial and genuine soils contaminated with heavy metals and PAHs at a range of concentrations. In contaminant-free artificial soil, inoculation promoted B. riparius growth by 25% compared to non-inoculated plants. In artificial soil, contaminated with 495 mg/kg Zn, 263 mg/kg Cu and 23 mg/kg Cd, M2Rhizo4 promoted B. riparius growth by 22%. In chromated-copper-arsenate (CCA) and creosote contaminated soil, M2Rhizo4 inoculated A. elatius had 15% more biomass and greater survival rates than non-inoculated A. elatius. A phytoremediation system composed of metal-tolerant plants inoculated with hydrocarbon-degrading or plant growth promoting bacteria may be suitable for sites contaminated with a mixtures of hydrocarbons and heavy metals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Prasher, S.

Hex S, the alphaalpha homodimer is physiologically unstable. Mature alpha and beta subunits share 60% sequence identity. The beta subunit active site hydrolyzes neutral substrates. The alpha subunit active site hydrolyzes neutral (4MUG) and charged substrates (4MUGS, GM2 ganglioside). Only Hex A hydrolyzes the natural substrate, GM2 ganglioside, in the presence of the GM2 activator protein (AP). We investigated regions of the alpha and beta subunits involved in AP binding, subunit dimerization, and substrate specificity. We constructed four chimeric cDNAs: alpha1--259beta292--544 , alpha1--118beta152--544, beta 1--418alpha387--529, and beta1--151 alpha119--259beta292--544 (subscripts refer to amino acid residues). Chimeric cDNAs were expressed in a TSD neuroglial cell line, which produces no endogenous alpha subunits. The chimeric isozymes were chromatofocused and assayed for hydrolysis of (a) 4MUG, (b) 4MUGS and (c) GM2 ganglioside. Transfection of the cDNA constructs lead to expression of homodimeric and heterodimeric chimeric proteins, albeit at lower yields than transfection of wild alpha-cDNA. All of the chimeric proteins hydrolyzed 4MUG but none were active towards 4MUGS or GM2 ganglioside. These results suggest that (a) all constructs contained sufficient information to form both heterodimeric and homodimeric chimeric proteins, (b) the chimeras lacked the alpha-subunit sequence necessary for the hydrolysis of charged substrates.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hechtman, P.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Kaplan, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x091n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v838238p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Glycosidases -- Analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tay-Sachs disease</dc:subject><dc:subject>beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidase</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k695w"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A population-based case-control study of breast cancer and active smoking and environmental tobacco smoke among postmenopausal women in Montreal, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Faith, Janet M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This population-based multi-centered case-control study of incident postmenopausal breast cancer was carried out in Montreal. Case subjects included all incident histologically confirmed breast cancer among postmenopausal women, age 51--75 years, diagnosed in 1996 and 1997 in all major hospitals. Control subjects had other histologically-confirmed sites of cancer from the same hospital, and were approximately frequency-matched by age to the case subjects. Detailed information was obtained on active smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in the home before the age of 18 and in the workplace as an adult. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer and various indices of smoking and exposure to ETS. The OR for breast cancer among women with exposure to active smoking only was 0.71 (9596 CI: 0.34--1.48), for early exposure to ETS only, the OR was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.65--1.85), and for occupational exposure to ETS only, the OR was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.53--1.90). When occupational and early exposures to ETS were combined, the OR was 1.40 (95% CI: 0.81--2.40).

Two different methods were employed for MUN analysis and were referred to as the Macdonald Campus method (MUN-MAC) and the Programme d'Analyse des Troupeaux Laitiers du Quebec method (MUN-P.A.T.L.Q.). The MUN-MAC consists of an enzymatic method while the P.A.T.L.Q. method is an infra-red method. Prior to initiation of the trial, the MUN-MAC method was validated and found suitable for use in this experiment. The results demonstrated that the factors which significantly contributed to the models were the ration's net energy of lactation, season, region, somatic cell count, total dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, non-structural carbohydrates, total fat, crude protein, protein to energy ratio, starch to protein ratio, parity and days in milk.

Community-based programmes see literacy as emancipatory, adopt a critical stance towards society and ideally use a learner-centred approach. This study sought to inform one community-based programme on more effective learner-centredness. Fourteen Caribbean immigrants participating in the programme were interviewed to investigate their concepts of literacy, motives for enrolling in, and expectations of, the programme. Results indicate that learners had limited concepts of the word "literacy," and had joined the programme because of difficulties in accessing Canadian public education. Most had completed primary school in the Caribbean and were accustomed to teacher-directed education. The study recommends that the programme increase learner-participation in decision-making and adopt a holistic approach to learning using focus groups. Also advocated is critical assessment of issues affecting learners such as language, migration and access to school.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Donald, Janet G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p8989.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kq021</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Functional literacy -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching (Continuing education) -- Foreign speakers -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adult education -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Caribbean Canadians -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655j48q"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nursing and the computerized age</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>DeLorey, Robin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis provides the rationale for the necessity of a redefining of the holistic back into nursing after the consequences of technological restructuring. This study revealed that the impact of modern technology-based, prescriptive changes on professional nursing practice in Canada has resulted in an increasing alienation of labour for nurses, including direct interference with patient-based nursing care, authority, necessity for broader knowledge systems, stability and fragility in job security. The implications of this examination have demonstrated that this shift has not been the result of mechanical technologies alone, but the science-based management philosophies and communicative nature of technologies as well. This project has verified that more importantly than the advancing technological shift itself the danger for professional nursing has been in what these systems are actively replacing. Namely, prescriptive technologies work to establish a managerial or 'expert' presence and authority within the practice of nursing serving to change professional understandings for nurses as well as to decrease value in the judgement and holistic care skills of registered nurses.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Picot, Jocelyne</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xd565.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655j48q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nursing services -- Administration</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nurses -- Attitudes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Expert systems (Computer science)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m3687"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ravel's Sheherazade and Fin-de-siecle orientalism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Deruchie, Andrew</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sheherazade (Trois poems de Tristan Klingsor), composed in 1903, represents both Ravel's first major vocal work and his earliest major orchestral composition. Despite the work's important position in the composer's oeuvre, it has received little academic attention. No monograph, dissertation, or article on Sheherazade has yet appeared. The primary objective of this study is to make this much needed contribution to Ravel scholarship. Of the piece's salient features, the most immediately striking is its exoticism; every phrase is given an Oriental tint. Using the work of cultural critic Edward Said as a theoretical framework, I contextualize Sheherazade's exoticism by situating the piece within the broad set of interrelated cultural practices Said calls Orientalism. I show that the work is affiliated, structurally and rhetorically, with particular Orientalist texts (both musical and non-musical), textual genres, traditions, and practices. By locating the piece historically among these texts and practices, and by using them as a referential network to read it hermeneutically, I demonstrate that rich cultural, political, and, for Ravel, personal meaning can be read into Sheherazade .</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Huebner, Steven</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644t421.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m3687</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50gx94d"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The theory and practice of biomedical ethics : a troubled divide</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Goldenberg, Maya</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Biomedical ethics does not lend itself to easy categorisation as either a 'theoretical' or a 'practical' enterprise because inquiry into the quandaries of morality requires both situational and 'translocal' perspectives.

This division hinders the development of bioethics by fostering internal dispute within the discipline regarding appropriate methodology and the practice of clinical ethics. In this thesis, I argue that much of these disciplinary disjunctions are due to an undue labeling of bioethics as either 'applied ethics' or 'practical ethics', and a failure to recognise the intricate way in which theory and practice inform each other and are integral and interrelated parts of moral deliberation.

Kinetic properties of this domain were investigated. Substrate channeling assays comparing separate D/C and S domains with the native D/C/S indicated that there is no channeling between the D/C and Synthetase domains even with H4folate polyglutamate as substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis in the putative active site of the D/C domain indicated that Y52 plays a role in binding/orientation rather than in catalysis. Cyclohydrolase activity is lost completely in all of the mutants at K56 except K56R, and the dehydrogenase activity of most of the K56 mutants was also affected dramatically. The results suggest that K56 is a central catalytic residue in both the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase reactions. Two monofunctional dehydrogenases (K56Q, K56M) generated by this method were used with monofunctional cyclohydrolase (R173E) to compare with the D/C domain of the wild type enzyme in substrate channeling assays. The loss of channeling between the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase demonstrates that channeling cannot occur if the two activities are present in separate enzyme molecules. The results show that channeling in the native D/C domain cannot be explained by dissociation and rebinding of the intermediate. The possibility of the involvement of a bound water molecule participating in the cyclohydrolase step was also tested by mutating residues S49, C147 and T148.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mackenzie, Robert E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870x75k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78td97n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514nn229"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The involvement of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in tRNALys3 viral packaging</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wise, Sylvie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Selective packaging of primer tRNA into HIV-1 particles is dependent upon viral incorporation of reverse transcriptase (RT) via the Pr160 gag-pol precursor protein. In this report, we have studied the effect of a series of point mutations in the RT sequence of HIV-1 upon tRNA Lys3 incorporation, tRNALys3 placement onto the primer binding site (PBS), and the RT-catalyzed cDNA extension of tRNALys3 within the virus. Viral protein patterns, RT activity and viral infectivity were also examined. Wild type and mutant viruses were produced by transfecting COS-7 cells with either wild type or mutant proviral DNAs. Mutations in the RT thumb domain, a region that interacts with the anticodon loop of tRNA Lys3, did not affect primer transport into the virus, nor prevent tRNALys3 placement onto the RNA genome, although placement levels were reduced compared to wild type. Thus neither the thumb domain of RT, nor the anticodon loop of tRNALys3 are involved in primer packaging. Two of the three thumb mutant RTs were able to add deoxyribonucleotides to the PBS-bound primer tRNA within the virus. The third lacks RT activity. Point mutations in the primer grip region of the RT palm domain affected selective incorporation of the primer and decreased tRNALys3 placement onto the viral genome by up to 70%. Two of the primer grip mutants showed a severe reduction in Pr160gag-pol polyprotein viral packaging. The primer grip mutants are not infectious due to lack of RT activity. Our data, plus other data in our laboratory and others, indicates a possible tRNA Lys3 binding site on Pr160gag-pol near the palm/thumb border region of RT.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kleiman, Lawrence</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945s723.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nn229</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azw12z7240"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Suppression of the integrin ℓv subunit by antisense oligonucleotides : a potential approach for anti-angiogenic therapy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wong, Amy, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Angiogenesis is essential for reproduction, inflammation, development and wound repair.

In the present study, the effect of alphav antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) on alphavbeta3 expression, and on cellular migration and proliferation was assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We found that alphav antisense phosphorothioate ODN reduced alphavbeta3expression in some endothelial cell cultures and this resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in endothelial cell migration and proliferation.

It proposes a set of characteristics that can affect the suitability of a language to such development, and compares a selection of common programming languages, including Ada, C, C++ and Java, against this framework.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Panangadin, Prakash</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v738k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43p0061</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1z40kv705"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Analysis and modelling of the multiple responses of the Ste-Marguerite River to large-scale meander rectification</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Talbot, Tracey D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Early 1960's meander rectification of the Ste-Marguerite River, Quebec, Canada, was undertaken in order to facilitate highway construction along the valley bottom. Through analysis of thalweg elevation and grain size data, the fourfold response of the river since rectification has been determined: (1) 1 m of bed incision in the upper 4 km and 2m of bed aggradation in the lower 2 km of the 6 km straightened reach; (2) coarsening (up to 20 mm) of the pavement D50 and D84 in the area of maximum degradation; (3) lateral erosion of the channel into three high terraces; and (4) regrowth of three meanders within the reach. Estimations indicate that reprofiling and pavement coarsening have been most important in reducing the disequilibrium in gravel transport rates due to rectification. Model simulations of the response to rectification have been validated against field data and the half-time scale of response has been estimated at 10 years. A further 10 cm of degradation upstream, 17 cm of aggradation downstream and 10 mm of pavement coarsening is predicted for the next century.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lapointe, Michel</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gf83z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kv705</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Meandering rivers -- Regulation -- Québec (Province) -- Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Region</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sainte-Marguerite River (Québec) -- Regulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sainte-Marguerite River (Québec) -- Channels</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45qb69k"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Software cost estimation with incomplete data</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Strike, Kevin D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The construction of software cost estimation models remains an active topic of research. The basic premise of cost modeling is that a historical database of software project cost data can be used to develop a quantitative model to predict the cost of future projects. One of the difficulties faced by workers in this area is that many of these historical databases contain substantial amounts of missing data. Thus far, the common practice has been to ignore observations with missing data. In principle, such a practice can lead to gross biases, and may be detrimental to the accuracy of cost estimation models. In this paper, we describe an extensive simulation where we evaluate different techniques for dealing with missing data in the context of software cost modeling. Three techniques are evaluated: listwise deletion, mean imputation and eight different types of hot-deck imputation. Our results indicate that all the missing data techniques perform well, with small biases and high precision. This suggests that the simplest technique, listwise deletion, is a reasonable choice. However, this will not necessarily provide the best performance. We provide a decision tree to select the best performing missing data techniques depending upon the pattern, mechanism and percentage of missing data.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Madhavji, N.

The results of this study indicated significant reduction in the expression of syntaxin I and synaptophysin in the core subregion of the nucleus accumbens along with a significant enhancement in syntaxin I expression in the shell subregion. Thus repeated administration of amphetamine induced differential changes in synaptic protein expression between the core and shell subregions of the nucleus accumbens. This result is consistent with several studies reporting differential neurochemical changes occurring in the core and shell in response to repeated psychostimulant administration (Cadoni and Di Chiara, 1999; 2000; Cadoni et al., 2000). This study also investigated possible alteration in glutamatergic (NMDA and kainate) and dopaminergic (D3) receptor levels in response to amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization. The results of this study indicated a lack of significant difference in the expression of these receptors following amphetamine sensitization.

In a specific form, the problem asks whether every finite group occurs as a Galois group over Q . An intrinsically group theoretic property called rigidity is described which confirms that many simple groups are Galois groups over Q . Connections between rigidity and geometry are described and applications of rigidity are provided. In particular, after describing some of the theory of groups of Lie type, the rigidity criterion is applied to the exceptional Lie type groups G2(p), for primes p &gt; 5. With the confirmation of a rationality condition, this establishes that G2(p) occurs as a Galois group over Q for all p &gt; 5. Furthermore, the conjugacy classes which arise in the proof of rigidity for G2( p) are explored in detail, in the hope that a new proof might be produced which would illuminate the geometry associated to this rigid situation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Darmon, Henri</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj218.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214r02x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848s38j"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Resolution of muscle wasting during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Reavell, Colleen Frances</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Weight loss and depletion of fat-free mass commonly occurs in patients with COPD. The objective of the study was to determine the magnitude and duration of protein depletion during an episode of acute exacerbation. Fifteen patients (9 women and 6 men) admitted for an acute exacerbation of COPD participated in a descriptive study that prospectively measured individual nitrogen balance over a 6-week follow-up period using repeated nitrogen balance tests. The mean nitrogen balance in hospital was -13.20 +/- 11.63 g N/day. Only 2 patients achieved a positive nitrogen balance by 2 weeks post-admission and 4 more patients by 4 weeks post-admission. At 6-weeks post-admission, 7 patients (47%) were still in negative nitrogen balance (-10.75 +/- 9.34 g N/day). Protein and energy intakes were significantly higher in patients who achieved a positive nitrogen balance (1.7 +/- 0.5 g protein/kg/day and 120 +/- 30% of estimated energy expenditure (1.7 x REE)) than patients who remained in a negative nitrogen balance (1.3 +/- 0.6 g protein/kg/day and 70 +/- 20% of estimated energy expenditure). There were no significant changes in weight or handgrip strength over the follow-up period. No effect of cumulative or daily corticosteroid doses on nitrogen balance or changes in handgrip strength were found. In conclusion, the catabolic stress of an acute exacerbation on nutritional status is remarkable. Patients admitted for an acute exacerbation of COPD are in severe negative nitrogen balance, which improves very slowly post-discharge. A negative nitrogen balance is prolonged in patients who have a decreased protein and energy intake.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gray-Donald, Katherine</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290c38b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848s38j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lungs -- Diseases, Obstructive</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nitrogen in the body</dc:subject><dc:subject>Muscle strength</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adrenocortical hormones</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811km55r"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The use of endovaginal sonography and Doppler ultrasound in the detection of endometrial carcinoma in women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Reinhold, Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Purpose. To evaluate the role of endovaginal sonography (EVS) and Doppler ultrasound in detecting endometrial carcinoma in women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding. Materials &amp; methods. We prospectively evaluated 421 women with EVS over a 5-year period. Of these 31 (7.4%) were diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma at histopathology. For each patient, biometric and morphologic parameters, as well as Doppler indices of the endometrium were obtained. Results. Applying a combination of biometric and morphologic criteria, EVS diagnosed malignancy with a sensitivity of 77% (95% CI: 59%--90%) and a specificity of 84% (80%--87%). Using only biometric criteria (endometrial thickness &gt;2mm indicating malignancy), EVS achieved a sensitivity of 100% (91%--100%) and a specificity of 24% (20%--29%), whereas the corresponding sensitivity and specificity for endometrial thickness &gt;5mm was 74% (55%--88%) and 59% (54%--64%), respectively. The most predictive Doppler index was peak venous velocity (95% CI for odds ratio: 1.08--1.40). Conclusion. Using a combination of biometric and morphologic sonographic criteria achieves the best accuracy in diagnosing patients with endometrial carcinoma, however at the cost of a decreased sensitivity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Joseph, Lawrence</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jg73t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km55r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wh87n"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Postnatal risk factors in the etiology of schizophrenia : association with good premorbid adjustment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pukall, Monica G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Research shows distinct premorbid subtypes in schizophrenia.

Both childhood trauma and premorbid substance use appear to increase vulnerability to schizophrenia. The goals of this study were to determine the association among family history, obstetric complications, childhood trauma, and premorbid substance use; and secondly, to assess whether trauma and premorbid substance use are associated with good premorbid schizophrenia. Trauma and substance use were assessed in 26 schizophrenia patients whose mothers were asked about family history of schizophrenia and obstetric complications. Results suggest that childhood trauma may co-occur with a family history of schizophrenia; high premorbid cannabis consumption was significantly associated with an absence of family history. Childhood trauma and premorbid substance use, however, did not consistently predict a good premorbid adjustment profile.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>King, Suzanne</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g9289.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wh87n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4q77ft285"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A high-pressure vibrational spectroscopic study of polymorphism in steroids : progesterone and spironolactone</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pisegna, Gisia L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of high external pressures on the vibrational (IR and Raman) spectra of the polymorphs of progesterone and spironolactone has been examined.

Sustained hypercapnia results in a transient rapid CBF rise in newborns with respiratory disorders; however, contrary to adults, the secondary effects of hypercapnia especially the decrease in blood pH, do not seem to reset (Brubakk et al., 1987). Acute hypercapnia and associated acidosis cause a significant rise in nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins (PG) levels, which in turn affect early CBF changes. However, the mechanism(s) and their mediator(s) in prolonged hypercapnic CBF fluctuations remain elusive. Results of this study provide direct evidence that in newborn brain, blood flow exhibits a biphasic response to sustained hypercapnia. PG synthase and NO synthase inhibitors block the secondary increase suggesting an important interaction between these factors. The slow and more sustained profile of the secondary increase suggests an induction of a gene implicated in vasodilation. Indeed, we report an increase in endothelial constitutive NOS (ecNOS) expression, activity and reactivity due to sustained hypercapnia and associated acidosis. We also demonstrate that PGs regulate both ecNOS expression and reactivity during acidosis in cerebral microvasculature. Acidosis does not directly stimulate PG synthase or NO pathways, instead an effect through the endothelial cell membrane seemed more plausible. Blockade of K+ channels, which are important regulators of membrane potential, inhibited the pH-dependent increase in PGs and ecNOS mRNA expression. Moreover, their inhibition blocked the influx of calcium elicited by acidosis in microvascular endothelial cells irrespective of Ca++ channel blockade. We conclude that these findings help in the understanding of the contribution and interaction of distinct factors proposed to regulate CBF in the newborn.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chemtob, Sylvain</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rg35x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375z23z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wh88x"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis in Montreal and British Columbia</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Musana, Kenneth Apollo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Though the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in Canada is low, TB remains a problem in specific population subgroups-most notably the foreign-born, who account for a steadily increasing proportion of all cases. The foreign-born represented 80% of all patients diagnosed with active TB on the island of Montreal in 1997 and 75% of all cases in British Columbia. The extent to which foreign-born persons transmit TB to the Canadian-born is not known. Using DNA Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), this study sought to estimate the proportion of active cases of TB among the Canadian-born potentially attributable to foreign-born sources. M. tuberculosis isolates from patients diagnosed with active TB in British Columbia and Montreal from July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1997 were characterized by RFLP analysis, using the standard IS6110 technique. Patients whose isolates had identical DNA fingerprints were considered to be clustered (confirmed by spoligotyping for isolates with ≤5 IS6110 copies), indicating recent infection and potential person-to-person transmission. Of the 706 isolates analyzed, 54 clusters were identified composed of 147 patients. Foreign birth was found to be negatively associated with clustering. HIV positive status, intravenous drug use, and alcohol use were found to be associated with an increased incidence of clustering. Of the 54 clusters found, 9 (17%) had both foreign- and Canadian-born members and in only 4 (7%) was there potential transmission from a foreign-born source case to a total of 5 Canadian-born persons. The estimated proportion of active TB among the Canadian-born potentially attributable to recent transmission from foreign-born cases was 0.8% in British Columbia, and 12% in Montreal.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schwartzman, Kevin</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Menzies, Richard</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xb42p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wh88x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526f15d"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The mandibular implant overdenture versus the madibular conventional denture : impact on the nutritional status</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Muller, Katia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is an ongoing and increasing interest in the significant and essential role that food plays in the health and survival of all people. As masticatory efficiency diminishes drastically in edentulous patients, many researchers in the past two decades have been studying how dietary intake varies when different types of oral rehabilitation are provided. Since the use of implants to support prostheses in edentulous mandibles has been shown to significantly improve masticatory performance, the question remains as to whether this improvement will influence nutritional status. In the present study, we used several nutritional markers to compare the nutritional status of edentulous patients who randomly received either mandibular conventional dentures or implant-supported overdentures one year previously. Although the conventional denture wearers reported having more difficulty chewing hard foods, no significant differences were detected in any of the nutritional markers. Therefore, even though chewing is more difficult for the patients wearing conventional dentures, it appears that the nutritional status of these two groups is similar.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Feine, Jocelyne</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d610x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s7526f15d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Dentistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nutrition</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
