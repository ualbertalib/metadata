Thus, it is important to predict the conditions under which shrinkage occurs. In  this work, a 3-D thermo-viscoelastic stress/strain model was used to analyze  shrinkage for a flat rectangular injection molded plate under varying process  conditions. Initially, the pressure, temperature, crystallinity and shear rate  profiles were calculated, using an existing injection molding simulation program  (McKam-IV). These data were then used to conduct the stress/strain analysis and to  make shrinkage predictions for a rectangular plate represented by a 10 x 10 x 10  finite volume elemental mesh. The materials used were high density polyethylene  (HDPE), a semi-crystalline material and polystyrene (PS), an amorphous material. The  predictions were validated experimentally using a specially designed engraved mesh  mold cavity. In-plane measurements showed good quantitative agreement for both  materials. Thickness measurements for PS were limited by experimental factors. The  molded plates were then subjected to a simple post-process heat treatment and the  simulation program was modified to assess the effects of heating. Reasonable  predictions were made for HDPE, because volumetric effects could be accounted for by  the simulation program. Predictions were not as good for PS, possibly because the  simulation code could not account fully for the effects of frozen-in orientation  effects.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v362c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kb299</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mj53b"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of a functional oil rich in medium chain triglycerides and phytosterols on plasma lipid profiles and body composition in hypercholesterolemic, overweight men</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Roynette, Catherine E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Localised accumulation of body fat significantly influences the  development of obesity related co-morbidities and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.  Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) have been suggested to modulate body fat  distribution. Phytosterols (PS) have demonstrated unequivocal cholesterol-lowering  effects. A healthy dietary solution combining MCT and PS could thus become  first-line obesity and CVD prevention. The aim of this study was therefore to  investigate the effects of a functional oil (FctO) rich in MCT and PS on blood lipid  levels and body adiposity, compared to olive oil. Twenty-three hypercholesterolemic,  overweight men, were randomly assigned, in a single-blind crossover study, to  consume a FctO, or olive oil, incorporated into a 40% fat diet for 6 wks. Blood  lipid levels were measured and body composition was assessed. Total and LDL  cholesterol were significantly reduced in subjects consuming the FctO versus the  control oil. No significant differences for weight or adiposity loss of subjects  were observed between the two oils. Results support the cardio-protective role of  this FctO.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sk12z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mj53b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Phytosterols</dc:subject><dc:subject>Overweight men</dc:subject><dc:subject>Functional foods</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hypercholesteremia -- Diet therapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Blood lipids</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sterols -- Physiological effect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Triglycerides -- Health aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv935348c"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Counsellor awareness of client-identified helpful events and its association to the psychotherapeutic process in process-experimential therapy with depressed clients</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fitopoulos, Lazarus</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research examined the relationship between counsellor  awareness of client-identified helpful events and session and event level outcome.

Micro filtration and ion-exchange, two  commonly used processing techniques in whey protein manufacture, generate whey  proteins with different compositions. Two animal studies were designed to compare  the digestibility and GSH inducing effects of whey protein isolates (WPIs) treated  with three repeated pulse cycling of pressure (3-cycle) or single pulse of high  pressure (1-cycle) and pressurized microfiltrated and ion-exchange WPIs. The results  indicate that special hydrostatic pressure treatment on the proteins improves its  growth stimulating effect, but does not enhance the GSH-inducing effect of WPI in  the healthy growing rats.

We improved the speed and the memory requirements  of the rendering process by replacing the 3D inverse Fourier transform used in the  rendering technique by a sequence of 2D inverse Fourier transforms. One of the  issues with the rendering technique was that it didn't take into account the  variations across the motion field that are visible when the observer undergoes  non-lateral motion. In order to incorporate the motion field effects caused by  egomotion (i.e. the motion of the observer) we devised a tiling technique which  involved dividing the view field into square image tiles, rendering each tile with a  unique direction of motion and speed range (depending on the underlying motion  field) and then blending the tiles together. The tile boundaries are not visible in  this case because of certain constraints present in the human visual system (HVS)  with regard to processing such motion gradients or discontinuities. Finally, based  on the constraints present in the HVS in processing multiple moving layers, we show  that the original model which renders a large number of overlapping transparent  layers is an overkill and demonstrate a simplified model which renders just a  limited number of layers.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722h939f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rk823</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182k65j"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Follicle cell fate determination in the Drosophila ovary : the role of the capicua gene</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rounding Atkey, Matthew</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The gene capicua is required for the establishment of  dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophila melanogaster ovary. Loss of capicua  function in the follicle cells results in dorsalization of both the embryo and  eggshell. The most prominent dorsal features of the Drosophila eggshell are the  dorsal appendages. We show that loss of capicua function results in the ventral  ectopic specification of dorsal appendage-producing follicle cell fate. This cell  fate change is due in part to the ectopic expression of genes such as mirror and  Broad-Complex in capicua mutant ovaries. When either mirror or Broad-Complex are  ectopically expressed independently of loss of capicua function, they generate a  phenotype similar to the capicua mutant phenotype. We propose that Capicua normally  acts in the ventral follicle cells to repress the expression of genes that pattern  the dorsal follicle cells. EGF receptor signaling may normally inactivate Capicua  repression in the dorsal follicle cells.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f638x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182k65j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Morphogenesis -- Molecular aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Embryology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zb60x"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of a three-dimensional eulerian model of droplet-wall interaction mechanisms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Honsek, Raimund</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A wide variety of engineering applications involve the flow of  particulate multiphase systems, featuring discrete liquid droplets dispersed in a  continuous gas phase. Specific industrial examples range from fuel injection  technologies over the optimization of multiphase segregation processes commonly  encountered in petrochemical applications to aircraft in-flight icing control. A  detailed understanding of dispersed phase characteristics such as local droplet  velocity and volumetric fraction is required for design purposes and may be obtained  from a numerical solution of the equations governing droplet motion. A fundamental choice between Lagrangian and Eulerian reference  frames presents itself in the formulation of the governing equations. While the  physically intuitive Lagrangian approach treats the dispersed phase as a set of  discrete particles that are individually tracked through the computational domain,  the Eulerian formulation considers the dispersed phase as a continuum. The use of an  Eulerian formulation to describe the evolution of discrete particles may appear  counter-intuitive from a physical standpoint; however, advantages with respect to  computational effort, numerical accuracy and accommodation of geometric complexity  strongly suggest the use of an Eulerian formulation. In order to accurately predict droplet behavior in the vicinity  of a solid system boundary, droplet-wall interactions must be accounted for in the  governing mathematical model. Due to current limitations in computational capacity,  an industrially viable simulation is necessarily based on a semi-empirical  description of the droplet-wall interaction process. Since empirical correlations  are inherently Lagrangian in nature, the associated information must be transformed  from a Lagrangian to an Eulerian frame of reference. This transformation, however,  is not obvious and as a consequence no Eulerian impact models have been reported in  the published scientific literature to date. A detailed derivation of an Eulerian  model of the droplet-wall interaction process is presented along with a comparison  of numerical and experimental results demonstrating the model's current simulation  capabilities and suggested future improvements.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xs148.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zb60x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q448d"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>High-speed and multi-bitrate clock and data recovery system based on half-rate clocking</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hong, Sung-Hwan (David), 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Today's telecommunications infrastructures and consumer  electronics rely largely on serial communications. Serial communications is a major  form of transmitting information; therefore, faster and more cost effective methods  of designing receivers are becom ing interesting research topics ([1]-[8]). This  work focuses on the full design flow of an integrated clock and data recovery (CDR)  system in CMOS technology, responding to this need of high-speed and cost effective  circuit solutions. This thesis reports a full bottom-up design flow of a CDR  system. The main challenge is to use an affordable and mainstream technology, such  as the CMOS 0.18-micron technology, to implement a 6-Gbps serial receiver for land  line applications. Unfortunately, the traditional full rate implementation is  impossible with this CMOS technology; therefore, this problem is alleviated by  exploring half-rate architectures. The basic building blocks were first designed using TSMC's CMOS  0.18-micron technology. These gates were then assembled to create larger circuit  blocks such as an edge-triggered flip flop, a double edge-triggered flip flop, a  phase detectors, a phase/frequency detector, etc. Each component was characterized  and then verified. The completely assembled system was simulated, verified, and then  sent for fabrication. Finally, the system was tested and verified for  analysis. Eye diagram patterns were extracted from the CDR prototype  circuit. Results show an opening in the eye, which suggests that the data pattern  are properly recovered. The system was also successfully tested for lower bit rates.  A top-down verification method was then executed in order to compare the  experimental and simulation results. The main contribution of this work is the full detailed  documentation of the design flow of a CDR system using a bottom-up implementation  with a top-down verification methodology. Verification methods were designed and  applied in order to investigate some discrepancies in the results.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dm86s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q448d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247ds673"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fluid-structure interaction in the aortic valve : implications for surgery and prosthesis design</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ranga, Adrian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aortic valve is a complex and dynamic structure, which, with  age, degenerative disease, or genetic abnormality, can become pathological and cease  to function as in its natural state. A particularly prevailing disease of the aortic  valve occurs when the valve becomes abnormally dilated, and regurgitation, or  backflow of blood occurs. When this condition becomes severe and is accompanied by  debilitating clinical manifestations, the standard procedure has been to replace the  entire aortic root and valve with a composite valve graft incorporating either a  mechanical or a bioprosthetic valve, during a type of surgery known as the Bentall  procedure. However, both of these options have significant drawbacks for the  patient, and for cases in which only the aortic root wall is dilated but the  leaflets are still intact, novel surgical reconstruction techniques known as  "valve-sparing procedures" have been adopted in recent years. The main  idea is to excise only the dilated part of the wall, suturing a synthetic graft  conduit in its place and thereby leaving the leaflets intact. A number of variants  have been proposed, with a vigorous debate in the surgical community as to which is  preferable in restoring valve dynamics and hemodynamics, thus leading to a more  durable repair and a more favorable outcome for the patient. The objective of this  work is to develop numerical simulation techniques to simulate the behavior of the  normal aortic valve, and to quantify the effect that these various procedures, as  compared to the benchmark native aortic valve. Various types of computational  methods have been developed in the past to study the aortic valve, with an  increasing level of sophistication as computational resources have evolved. Most of  these studies have been structural finite element analyses, where the valve  structures have been loaded with uniform distributed pressure loads in order to  simulate the effect of blood.

The glass plates are 610 mm long and 350 mm  high. Three different values of the normal separation distance between them were  investigated: 25.4 mm, 38.1 mm, and 50.8 mm. For each of these separation distances,  the following three values (nominal) of the mass flow rate per unit width were  considered: 0.81 kg/s-m, 1.85 kg/s-m, and 3.33 kg/s-m. The granular material used in  this work consists of slightly polydisperse, almost spherical, ceramic (zirconium  silicate) beads: mean effective diameter of 1.59 mm and mass density of 4071 kg/m3.  For these ranges of dimensional parameters, statistically-steady fully developed  flows were established in a reliable and repeatable manner. A high-speed camera  system was used to acquire digital images of the granular flows of interest in the  fully developed region. Image processing and a commercial PTV software package  (DiaTrackPro 2.3) were used to obtain the particle trajectories. Special routines  were written in Matlab to obtain the corresponding instantaneous and  ensemble-averaged velocity distributions. These results were then used to compute  the corresponding distributions of granular temperature and a related dimensionless  parameter that is commonly referred to as the Savage-Jeffrey parameter. The  aforementioned PTV and data processing procedures, the results in dimensional and  dimensionless forms, and the applicability of some recently proposed scaling laws  are discussed in this thesis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vb88w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f1685</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sg811"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of East Asian Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ugly ducklings: the construction and deconstruction of gender in Shôjo Manga</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ricard, Jennifer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines shojo manga (Japanese comics for girls) as  a site of the subversion of gender. The focus will be on stories about  cross-dressing, as the crossdressed heroine poses from the outset questions about  the nature of girls within shojo manga and the girls who are supposedly reading the  texts. The analysis takes place at two levels: visual language and narrative. Over  the course of five chapters, focusing on a couple of series in each, this thesis  will show the various ways categories of gender and sex are undermined in five  different subgenres. Yet gender norms are recuperated in the end. The manga always  return to the figure of the shojo , the ambiguously gendered  "not-quite-female" female that must expire at adulthood and the regulatory  function heterosexuality plays in this inevitable demise. Nevertheless shojo manga  readers need not necessarily share this end. The various ways that the reader is  positioned both visually and narratively suggests that her gender and sexuality  remains ambiguous and indefinable.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708w992.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sg811</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Comic books, strips, etc. -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Graphic novels -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gender identity in art</dc:subject><dc:subject>Girls in popular culture -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gender identity in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r147c"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>God, world and humanity : an investigation into the work of Gordon D.

For Kaufman the concepts of world and nature are  religiously relevant insofar as they call for a theology for our contemporary life  centred in this world rather than in some metaphysical beyond. This study examines  how Kaufman articulates a concept of God that is not necessarily bound by the  traditions of a particular religion, but also whether he offers a concept of God for  the so-called 'secular' modern world. Chapter one examines how Kaufman conceives of the difference  between world and nature. Chapter two relates the analysis of these concepts to the  concept of God as well as Kaufman's treatment of revelation in light of his attempts  to reconstruct the concept of God. Chapter three considers some of Kaufman's recent  suggestions for reformulating the concept of God that take into account the  relativist and historicist perspectives.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472w969.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r147c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>God (Christianity)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kaufman, Gordon D</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wq71w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Plotting the networked self : cyberpunk and the future of genre</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rose, Margaret Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cyberpunk's attempt to imagine the futures that the expanding  communications networks will shape, as explored in Sterling's Islands in the Net and  Stephenson's The Diamond Age, discovers that the boundaries between the machine and  human, the natural and artificial, and the past and present have never been as clear  as the modern realist schematic has drawn them. Gothic literature represents  transgressions of these boundaries as threatening to the self, and Mary Shelley's  Frankenstein is the node where the gothic is dismembered and sutured into science  fiction, and the modern self faces its monstrous double.

Decried as both a human rights violation and a barbaric example of  the patriarchal subjugation of women and girls in developing nations, FGC has only  recently been examined within the cultural framework in which it takes place. This  thesis will focus on the Muslim communities in Egypt and Sudan who continue to  engage in FGC as a required Muslim practice. Starting from the notion that FGC has a  limiting effect on a woman's overall health, this thesis will use three foundational  notions from Islamic medical ethics to argue against the continuation of FGC.  Specifically, it will elaborate and draw on the Islamic position in favor of organ  transplantation, thus further illustrating the argument against FGC. By using  principles and notions from Islamic medical ethics, this thesis will argue against  FGC from within Islam.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g195.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945r31n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Female circumcision -- Religious aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islamic ethics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in Islam</dc:subject><dc:subject>Female circumcision -- Prevention</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap2676w12m"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The transition to constitutional democracy : judging the Supreme Court on gay rights</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hicks, Bruce M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The idea that Canada was transformed into a "constitutional  democracy" in 1982 is widely believed by the public, yet rarely examined in  academic literature.

Hypothesizing a resulting  bifurcation of such state structures, this study identifies and explores the  transformation dynamics of states being pressured by these two forces through an  in-depth analysis of the Turkish case. First, the roots of the two pressures are  explored from the late Ottoman and early Republican eras, and a pendulum period is  observed, in which the incompatibility of the two drives becomes accepted. As the  inevitability of the transformation from more authoritarian to more liberal regimes  is realized, a resulting gradual development and institutionalization of a dual  state structure into hard and soft agendas and, eventually, realms is shown. Within  such a structure, a compromised governance system emerges, in which both a form of  democracy and democratization is maintained for legitimacy purposes, and a strong  power-holding mechanism, unaccountable to the public, is preserved as an ultimate  guard to maintain control over the transformation process. An analysis of changes in  the Turkish constitutions is used to reveal traceable reflections of the gradual  expansion and consolidation of the hard realm. The actual workings of a dual state  structure, revealing the realms' actors, their domestic and external allies, their  positions, arguments and rhetoric, is provided by focusing on the clash in the  Turkish case over the issue of minority rights in relation with the country's  application process for European Union membership.

The study focuses on one of the Ewe's  oldest and most powerful religious dance and music ceremonies, Adzogbo, as it is  performed by the Mawuli Kpli Mi Adzogbo Group from the village of Aflao in Ghana,  West Africa. Adzogbo, originally from Dahomey (now Benin), was brought to  Ghana in the late 19th Century, and was formally performed for the Dahomeyan war  gods to transmit pertinent information to warriors preparing for battle. It is still  considered one of the most complex dance and music systems, having intricate  polyrhythmic texture and specific relationship between the master drummer and the  vigorous and articulated movements of the dancers, which are emphasized by their  elaborate costume. Presently, the dance functions as a recreational ceremony and is  performed during specific special occasions. It is used to display mental, physical  and spiritual power and still carries some of its original war dance  characteristics. This project consists of a written thesis document and one hour  digital video documentary of the Adzogbo Dance Ceremony, outlining its background  and importance, form and structure, and a comparative analyses of the organization  and structure of both the dance and music. The text provides information on Ewe  culture, including their historical, social, and geographical background, their  dance, music and related activities and an exploration of Interactive multimedia  technologies to in future develop electronic educational material.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>White, Boyd</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mj58q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719m90m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ewe (African people)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dance -- Ghana -- Religious aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296wz608"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The physiological and cellular functions of PTPIB in obesity and cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cheng, Alan, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is the prototype for the  superfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases, and has been implicated in multiple  signaling pathways. Of particular interest, gene targeting studies in mice have  established PTP1B as a critical physiological regulator of insulin signaling and  PTP1B knockout mice are resistant to both diabetes and obesity. At the start of this  thesis, the mechanism underlying the role of PTP1B in obesity was not completely  understood. Furthermore, the importance of PTP1B in cellular and oncogenic signaling  was not well established. My doctoral research has primarily been aimed at  addressing these two broad questions. Using leptin deficient mice as a genetic model  of obesity, I demonstrate that the absence of PTP1B can lead to decreased adiposity  and increased metabolic rate. Specifically, I showed that PTP1B deficient mice  display increased sensitivity towards the metabolic actions of the hormone leptin.  Substrate trapping studies demonstrate that PTP1B dephosphorylates the JAK2 kinase  within the leptin signaling pathway, and hypothalami from PTP1B deficient mice  display increased leptin mediated STAT3 activation. My studies identify PTP1B as a  critical regulator of body metabolism. In order to characterize the cellular role of  PTP1B in oncogenic signaling, I generated fibroblast cell lines from PTP1B deficient  mice. Although, PTP1B dephosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, PTP1B  deficient fibroblasts exhibit impaired growth factor mediated MAPK activation. I  found that loss of PTP1B leads to decreased Src activation, increased p120RasGAP  expression, and increased p62Dok phosphorylation in immortalized fibroblasts.  Collectively this results in decreased Ras activity, and thus, MAPK activation.  Hence, my findings point to a mechanism by which PTP1B can act as a positive  regulator of Ras signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases, and consequently  offers an explanation as to wh</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tremblay, Michel L.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g327n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296wz608</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jp22r"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the dynamics of the inner spiral rainbands in a simulated hurricane</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chen, Yongsheng, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite the fact that spiral rainbands have long been detected  in radar observations, many aspects of their dynamics and their role in hurricanes  still remain unresolved. In this thesis, the high-resolution PSU-NCAR nonhydrostatic  mesoscale model (MM5) is used to perform three numerical simulations, namely, the  control run, the dry run and the landfall simulation. The dynamics of inner spiral  rainbands formed in the simulated hurricanes are studied. It is shown that the interaction of low-level potential  vorticity (PV) anomalies with boundary layer friction and the strong coupling of the  PV band and the cloud band give rise to the inner spiral rainbands. The propagation  properties of the PV bands are analyzed and found to be consistent with predictions  of vortex Rossby wave theory. Empirical normal mode method is further applied to  separate the vortex Rossby waves from the gravity waves. The former dominates the  latter in terms of wave activities. The radial and vertical propagation and the  associated eddy momentum and eddy heat fluxes of vortex Rossby waves are studied  using the Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux. The wave-mean-flow interaction indicated by the  divergence of the EP flux shows significant effects on the intensification of the  hurricanes. While diabatic heating tends to maintain a ring structure of PV  by continually generating high PV in the eyewall, the vortex Rossby waves tend to  redistribute the PV in the ring and to increase the inner-core PV. When diabatic  heating is suppressed in the dry run and in the landfall simulation, the PV ring  evolves to monopolar structure. The dynamical properties of the inner spiral  rainbands and their roles on the intensity then vary as a response to the evolving  mean PV structure of the hurricane. Nevertheless, the total effect of the asymmetric  diabatic heating and the vortex Rossby waves tends to counteract the effect of the  mean circulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yau, M.

Specifically, this research is  interested in addressing the emerging paradigm of "migration management"  and its impact on the nature of refugee protection and asylum in an integrated  Europe. Two approaches are used in this analysis. First, from a functionalist  perspective, this work considers how migration management has responded to  contemporary realities of international migration. Secondly, from a critical theory  perspective, the thesis analyzes how refugee protection becomes subsumed within the  broader goals of migration management. This thesis will argue that the paradigm of  migration management has effectively shifted the contours of the asylum debate by  linking refugee and asylum policy with broader issues of labor migration, illegality  and foreign relations. This has resulted in the separation of asylum from  territoriality and more broadly, the submersion of the humanitarian considerations  to the overarching goals of migration management.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930bx71s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc10x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Europe -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Foreign workers -- Europe</dc:subject><dc:subject>Refugees -- Government policy -- Europe</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct46z"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>spa</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Hispanic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Huatulqueños y Samahua : el referente, el texto y su recepción</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Osegueda, Ximena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyses Huatulquenos (1991) and Samahua (1997), by  the Mexican author Leonardo Da Jandra.

The referent, the county of Santa Maria Huatulco (Mexico), has been studied from a  socio-political perspective. The text analysis, on the other hand, not only focuses  on style and content of the texts, but it isolates the implicit discourses  articulated in both novels. Finally, the study of the reception explains the  different reactions the texts have experienced as well as the environmental activism  the author and his wife have led. The conclusions wrap up by questioning the roles  of the intellectual as a cultural mediator and of literature and literary criticism  as means of representation of subaltern groups.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j6186.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17ct46z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Jandra, Leonardo da, 1951- Huatulqueños</dc:subject><dc:subject>Santa María Huatulco (Mexico) -- In literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jandra, Leonardo da, 1951- Samahua</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qs525"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ita</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Italian</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Il Bestiario : scienza e letteratura in Leonardo da Vinci</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Calabrese, Filomena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Le Bestiaire de Leonard de Vinci (datable aux alentours de  1493-1494) est une oeuvre qui s'inscrit dans le cadre de la complexe tradition  litteraire-scientifique tout en etant, de plusiers facons, differenciee par rapport  au corpus a facettes des ouvrages de Vinci.
