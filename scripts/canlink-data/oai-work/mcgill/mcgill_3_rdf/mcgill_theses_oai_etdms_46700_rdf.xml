We may apply the words with perfect fitness to the place which the Bible holds in the rich treasure-house of our English Literature. Of all the books that have been written in our noble English tongue, "there is but one." If we could imagine some strange convulsion of nature in which all other books, even from "King Shakespere himself" down to the latest volume, were lost, and if only a copy of the English Bible were preserved our race would not be without its literary as well as its spiritual food,--its daily bread sufficient not only for the day but for the production of a new literature as glorious as the old.

During the course of these experiments the writer found that nucleated red cells appear in the circulation as a result of injection. Since quartz is practically insoluble the writer began to investigate the effect of particulate matter in general upon the red cell content of the blood, particularly in relation to the haemolyto-poietic function of the reticuloendothelial system. Certain observations have also been made upon the reactions of leucocytes toward single and repeated doses of particles.

It is evident that any moving pistondevices actuating systems of levers would be of little use at the high speeds at which the present-day gas engine is run, chiefly because of the large inertia effects of thesystem.

Such workers as Tollens 1,Fischer 2, Karrer 3, Irvine 4 and more- recently Hibbert 5 and his pupils have studied or used this class of compounds in their efforts to explain, by analogy, certain features of the chemical behaviour of the more complex polysaccharides. It is remarkable, therefore, that up to the, present time, the molecular structure of one of the simplest glycerol acetals, namely, ethylidene glycerol has remained undetermined, its formula being given as either, or both, of the two possible isomeric forms.

The object of the investigation was to be a determination of the Frequency Stability and Wave Form of the Output, obtainable. It developed, however, that no method of oscillator design of proven accuracy for low power oscil1ators was available and hence the problem or Frequency Stability and Output Wave Form was deferred until the problem of circuit design could be looked into. This involved a thorough study of the factors entering into the design of a Valve Oscillator and also of the methods used by other investigators.

The march of events has brought about the direct necessity of government intervention. Especially is this true in the case of industrial disputes.These are times of organization, amalgamation and concentration. No more does the employer treat with his few help in free and unrestricted fashion, or the benevolent factory owner regard his workmen as his proteges. Those days are gone. Whereas a hundred years ago an industry was a large one if backed with several hundred thousand dollars, to-day there are corporations with a capital of over a billion dollars. With their phenomenal growth, has come the realization of the greater efficiency of association, and amalgamations have gone on apace.

Moreover, in the electric fields which obtain in 10 Surdo discharge phenomena appear whioh are difficult or even impossible to obtain elsewhere. For example, certain spectral lines only appear in very intense fields whereas others are brought out by moderate field intensit1es, disappearing again where the field becomes high.
