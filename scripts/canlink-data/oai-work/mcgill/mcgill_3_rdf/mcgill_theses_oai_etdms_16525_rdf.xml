The reduction in the life span of this plant in Quebec is generally attributed to "winter killing," but the cause of winter killing could be due to a number of factors such as: frost; Sclerotinia trifoliorum Erikss.

We then look at the Hebrew religion as it makes contact with Baalistic prophetism, an early form of mysticism. In the struggle that ensued between the two, we discover the religion of Israel absorbing something from Baalism but asserting its own peculiar genius. Some of the great prophetical books are then examined. The conclusion we reach is that, although there are mystical elements in the prophets, mysticism and prophetism are two distinct systems, with deep differences in their conception of God’s nature, in their idea or the relationahip between God and man, and in their attitude to life and the world.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Frost, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795c41k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042x662</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Divinity</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mr04c"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of some methods of measuring ablation and run-off on an arctic glacier</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Adams, William.

Even the ‘Lakehead’ , the westernmost extremity of Lake Superior, did not mark the limit restricting further extension of waterborne commerce, since the earliest travellers and traders employed the canoe, the product of native ingenuity, in making their way westwards, while the portage, by-passing navigational obstructions, became a common feature attending the conduct of the trade in Canada’s first staple.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooper, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wk76j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395wc187</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70n009j"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Diagonal tension cracking in reinforced concrete beams</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Williams, Desmond</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nine rectangular reinforced concrete beams, without web reinforcement but with varying amounts of longitudinal tensile reinforcement, were tested under simple span concentrated loading at a shear span to effective depth ratio of three. The results of this investigation indicated that increased resistance to diagonal tension cracking was associated with increased amounts of longitudinal reinforcement.

Strain measurements made above diagonal tension cracks indicated major stress redistributions at formation of the cracks.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Harris, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408169s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70n009j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reinforced concrete beams</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q7898"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Novelty, skin conductance, and stimulus generalization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Williams, Judith. A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is well known that a change in the stimulus characteristics of an experimental situation to which an organism bas become adapted evokes a variety of measurable bodily reactions. Changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance, as well as more easily observable reactions, such as increased muscular tension and orienting responses, have been found to result from the introduction of a stimulus change. This reaction complex has been referred to as startle response (Landis &amp; Hunt, 1939), orienting response (Robinson &amp; Gantt, 1947), and reactions to novelty (Bindra, 1959). The use of such terms emphasizes the fact that these reactions are dependent not so much upon any particular value of a specific stimulus, but on stimulus change, or novelty.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bindra, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gh44p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q7898</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494c88w"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>New isomers from (p,xn) and (p,pxn) reactions on Pd, Ag, Cd, In, and Sb targets</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>White, William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>NaI(Tl) scintillation counters have been used in conjunction with a rapid target extraction unit to study isomers of a few seconds half-life, produced by proton bombardment.

Ag103m also exhibits an E3 de-excitation, and has a half-life of 5.7 ± 0.3 sec. and a transition energy of 135 ± 2 Kev.

Fortunately, the event is rare, nevertheless it is serious and embarrassing because it develops usually as an unexpected complication. It is known to follow trauma, infections and particularly surgical procedures. The incidence of gastric dilatation has decreased considerably since the introduction of methods of anaesthesia and of gastric intubation in abdominal procedures. However, it still remains a problem of unknown etiology in many of the cases studied.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Skoryna, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bt001.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752m51p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395wc19h"><ual:graduationDate>1961</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The electronic correction for attenuation of 3.2-cm radar signals from rain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wein, Marceli</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Radar signals at 3.2 cm are corrected electronically for rain attenuation before being displayed on a scale of grey. The correction is computed by integration of tile signals in a feed-back loop. The use of logarithmic and antilogarithmic devices makes it possible to apply the proper power law relationships. Corrected grey scale CAPPI records have been obtained. The signal from heavy cores is enhanced although the total area on the display remains that of the original attenuated signal. Subsequent analysis of the system, based on previous theoretical work, led to a new adjustment method. At 5.7 cm correction for rain attenuation is not recommended because the uncertainties in interpretation of radar signals are at least of the same order of magnitude as the errors due to attenuation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278x95r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395wc19h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
