They increased by 38% over a 20 min rest following 60 min, 20/sec stimulation and remained elevated for at least 3 hr. The increase was less with 10 min stimulation and absent with 4/sec stimulation. The excess ACh was released during stimulation in the presence of hemicholinium-3. The time course or Ach release from stimulated plasma-perfused ganglia was followed. The release rate was highest near the onset of 20/sec stimulation and declined over 5 min to a 50% lower steady value. At 4/sec the rate increased over the first 5 min to a 25% higher steady value. These findings are discussed in relation to the hypothesis of preferential release of newly synthesized transmitter and the two compartment model of transmitter storage.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Birks, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290d69j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z395p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
