It gives rise to many dyes, the most important being methylene blue, Lauth’s violet, and thionol. Phenothiazine is a soft, smooth powder of talc-like consistency, slightly off yellowish-white in colour. It has a faint but characteristic odour and taste. It is highly insoluble in water, but readily soluble in the fat solvents, alcohol, xylol, toluol, ether, chloroform. From these it crystallizes out in flat plates.

Au premier chapitre, j’essayerai d’expliquer la relation qu’il y a entre les événements de la vie de l’auteur et la publication de ses oeuvres. En prenant chaque ouvrage, en ordre chronologique, je jetterai un coup d’oeil sur chacun en résumant les idées principales. Le chapitre qui suit sera consacré en entier aux oeuvres qui s’intéressent tout particulièrement a la nature et à Dieu. J’étudierai les oeuvres dont les critiques ont traité spécialement. Dans le troisième chapitre, je traiterai l’évolution qui s’est produite dans l’esprit de Francis Jammes quant à Dieu et la nature depuis la première phase de sa carrière littéraire jusqu’à son entier développement et son retour à la foi de son enfance. Son style a été ou bien très critiqué, ou bien très loué.  Quelques écrivains ont voulu voir chez lui le rénovateur de la poésie moderne, celui qui savait prendre son inspiration dans la vie rurale, dans la terre, dans la nature: une espèce de Chantecler enfonçant fièrement ses pattes dans le sol, pour y puiser son inspiration. D’autres lui ont reproché de prendre son inspiration d’une vie effacée et commune. Certains auteurs ont admiré son style comme étant l’essence de la simplicité et du lyrisme. D’autres l’ont trouvé naïf, puéril et presque niais. Nous ne nous proposons pas d’étudier ces questions, car le but de cette étude se limite à voir la lente évolution de son esprit quant à sa croyance en Dieu, depuis ses jeunes années jusqu’à sa mort, en passant par la crise de sa conversion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Furness, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sn39s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75rb99w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Jammes, Francis, 1868-1938 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wk23h"><ual:graduationDate>1943</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Commerce</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Prices and wages in Canada since the beginning of the second World war</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fox, Lester Leonard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>When the present war began in September 1939, the evils of inflation so typical of the first world war induced the warring nations to adopt the principle of price control. Germany had established an over-all price ceiling in October 1936, which indicates how long ago Germany had begun to prepare her economy to withstand the shock of war. An actual price inflation constituted no serious threat to Canada at the start of the war because we had idle capital and idle labour. The amount of economic “slack” arising from developments prior to the outbreak of war is surveyed in Chapter I. Briefly, it may be described as the result of the rising period of prosperity which culminated in 1929 and the depression which followed in the 1930’s. Although it appeared in 1937 that we were at last climbing out of the depression, we had another setback in 1938. Thus Canada entered the war with an industrial output far below her capacity.

The Lorraine beds of New York and equivalent strata of other areas are underlain by black, more or less bituminous shales commonly known as the “Utica” shales. That all so-called “Utica” shales may not be identical in age with the typical Utica formation of Utica, New York, is, however, generally appreciated. Strata which have long been recognized as approximate equivalents of the Utica and Lorraine formations of New York State outcrop in the St. Lawrence Lowland. They are found from Montreal to Quebec over an area whose maximum lateral extent is about ten miles on the northwest side of the St. Lawrence River and thirty miles on the southeast side. The area is widest near Montreal and narrows rapidly near Quebec.

With the exception of a few isolated articles and the very indifferent publication known as “The Municipal Review of Canada”, little is written on the subject. The Union of Nova Scotia Municipalities at its Conventions sometimes discusses salient municipal problems, but only too often its proceedings are of little interest to the academic observer. A number of Royal Commissions have sat to consider municipal problems but, apart from obvious generalities, their reports have only too often been of parochial interest only. The main conclusion I can come to is that the prouder problems of federal and provincial finance, and the constitutional and administrative clashes they provoke, have almost completely side-tracked the interest of Canadian economists from the sphere of municipal tribulations. In this they differ materially from their American counterparts, who continually evidence a lively interest in municipal finances and affairs generally, debate them hotly, and write on them freely.

As the rubber produced by this plant is of high quality, it is possible that the propagation of the species in Canada might prove to be of national benefit. Seed of Taraxacum kok-saghyz has been brought to this country, and an effort is being made to determine the potentialities of the plant under Canadian growing conditions. Its proposed introduction here, as a commercial crop, raises problems of breeding and cultivation. The plants show variation in rubber content of the roots, while difficulties of cultivation result from their habits of growth, For this reason an investigation of the cytology of the species has been carried out with the hope that an insight may be obtained into the best methods by which its general characteristics may be improved.
