The percentage depth dose data and the conventional collimator factor are unaffected by the addition of MLC or micro-MLC shaped field unless, in the latter case, the tertiary field is much less than the jaw setting. However, relative dose factors for a given MLC or micro-MLC field size depend on the jaw setting. The penumbra is generally sharpest for fields defined by the micro-MLC and the least sharp for fields defined by the MLC. Average transmission values were found to be between 1.5% and 2.5%. Comparison and evaluation of two treatments, one delivered using the MLC and the other using the micro-MLC, for the same radiosurgical target volume are described.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Podgorsak, E.

We can use it to decompose an MR image in a set of coefficients that will be studied statistically. This statistical analysis allows us to get rid of the noise included in the MR images.

In particular, technological convergence united cable and telephone networks as convenient platforms for the provision of numerous new telecommunications services. The advent of the Internet and the development of other services started a race for the acquisition of broadband transmission that has, in part, prompted a number of corporate mergers between the major telephone, cable, and Internet service providers. This thesis analyzes the legal implications of the convergence of cable operators and telephone carriers in the United States of America (U.S.). The analysis was conducted in light of the 1996 Telecommunications Act's provisions, the Federal Communications Commission's reports and orders, and under the critical approaches of the cable and telephone industries.

It examines the extent to which such a theory can contribute to an understanding of the regulatory crisis of the nation-state and serve as a point of departure for new regulatory approaches. A historical overview which looks at the disciplinary origins of legal pluralism is followed by an analysis of several legal pluralist concepts. This analysis serves as the basis for an elaboration of the descriptive and normative aspects of legal pluralism. The concept is compared with other social theories which are concerned with similar questions as legal pluralism. To illustrate the legal pluralist approach, same specific examples from the media sector are introduced. The thesis concludes by showing where a legal pluralist analysis might be appropriate and, moreover, how the theory can contribute to regulatory ways alternative to direct state intervention and market conceptions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macdonald, R.

It undertakes to shed light, by means of a psychoanalytical approach, on the regime for the attribution and change of surname, notably on law reform initiatives in the Province since the onset of the 80s. Contemporary norms in Quebec in respect of the name depart from the classical features of the civilian tradition in that the role played by human will appear indeed to be preponderant in Quebec, be it as to assignment or change of name. This characteristic is likely to affect the normal functioning of the naming process by turning it into a battlefield upon which unresolved incestuous and narcissic tendencies are at play. Whilst the naming scene is in process of privatisation, state actors remain however principally as sanction takers toward parents.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kasirer, Nicholas</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cj428.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w664k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Names, Personal -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv935479k"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Insider trading in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lindenfield, Susannah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a critical analysis of the law relating to insider trading in three common law countries. Chapter One, addresses the merits and demerits of the regulation of insider trading and presents a review of the academic literature relating to this field. In Chapters Two, Three and Four, the law of insider trading in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom is analysed and discussed on a comparative basis. Each of these chapters is in two sections. The first section describes the regulatory system and institutions, and the second section discusses the regulation of insider trading, highlighting the critical elements of this type of regulation, such as the definition of an 'insider' and the scope of 'inside information'. It concludes with a broad discussion of the differing approaches of these countries to insider trading.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cv80g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935479k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Insider trading in securities -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Insider trading in securities -- United Kingdom</dc:subject><dc:subject>Insider trading in securities -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap5547t36n"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The flaneur goes shopping : an inquiry into the flaneuse as consumer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Williams, Suzanne Elizabeth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent feminist theorists have suggested that the flaneur---a key trope of modernity---had a sister figure who, if not equally on par in importance, figured significantly within the changing modern landscape. The 'flaneuse' also gazed upon the spectacle of urban life, only she did so from the vantage point of the consumer dream-land that was the department store. But how useful is this trope of the flaneuse and what are its, or more specifically, her limitations, particularly within her popular construct as the consumer-observer? This paper explores the concept of the flaneuse, challenges her definition as consumer and questions the usefulness of this metaphor, particularly as it relates to the original construct of the flaneur. This paper is a review of the writing on the flaneuse as well as an exercise in deconstructing one of her likenesses. I argue that the consuming- flaneuse is at odds with the entire premise of flanerie . In the translation from flaneur to flaneuse, the physical similarities may have been accounted for but the ideology of flanerie---what makes the flaneur such a powerful metaphor---has been lost. I suggest, therefore, that a new image of modernity needs to be found for women, one that provides a more balanced perspective of women's experiences and that takes women out of the very limited arenas of consumption.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Straw, Will</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m859g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547t36n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Shopping</dc:subject><dc:subject>Flaneurs in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Consumption (Economics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women consumers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nc96h"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A new century and a new attitude towards safety oversight in air transportation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Boteva, Meglena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Public international air law is not in itself an autonomous system. It follows the legal principles and notions applicable to public international law in general. The principle of good faith performance or enforcement of a contract, in particular, emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party unless an expressed intention to the contrary has been declared. By signing the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944, all 185 Contracting States agreed to certain principles and arrangements in order that international civil aviation could be developed in a safe and orderly manner. They undertook, inter alia, to collaborate in securing the highest practicable degree of uniformity in all matters in which such uniformity could facilitate and improve air navigation. Thus, they all agreed to a common purpose and to the means for ensuring it. With the presence of several regulatory levels, namely, national, regional and international, and given the challenges of the new century in parallel with the increased sophistication of civil aviation systems, safety in air transportation requires that it be a shared responsibility.

Because of the evolution of the sector, international satellite organizations have undertaken for around ten years several internal reforms that lead today to the privatization of the three major organizations: Intelsat, Inmarsat and Eutelsat. These transformations constitute a particular sensitive issue as these organizations have been initially established so that to exploit satellite systems for the general interest of their members. The impact of this phenomenon is no less considerable on the ITU, in charge of the international regulation, from a regulatory but also structural point of view. Moreover, the liberalization of telecommunication market undertaken under the aegis of the WTO grants to this organization a new major place in space telecommunication regulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jakhu, R.

Given the extent of the phenomenon, international action is necessary to ensure its elimination. In this regard, international law can play an important role as it can direct formulations of State policy. Unfortunately, despite numerous normative developments, child labour still exists. Therefore, the author suggests that international action be reoriented at two levels. Firstly, the current approach must be re-evaluated to take into account the social dimension of child labour. Education should be a key focus in the struggle against child labour since it can work to fight the diverse causes of the problem while offering young labourers an alternative. Secondly, as normative control mechanisms are deficient, international law should be completed by direct intervention to ensure education is put at centre stage. Only direct action lead by international and local partners will eliminate the economic exploitation of children.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Provost, Rene</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720f73s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q814w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children -- Social conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child labor -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Labor laws and legislation, International</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579v09v"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>O' the tangled webs we weave, when first we practice to conceive : navigating the online commodification, distribution, and consumption of donor sperm</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Prest, Janalyn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Much of the public debate surrounding new technologies and techniques in assisted reproductive technology (ART) is caught up in the speculative nature of imagined futures of 'science-fictive' proportions. This thesis, by contrast, examines a 'naturalized' ART donor insemination, discussing the manner in which couples (and occasionally single women) construct distributive and kinship networks as they move through the processes of fertility treatment and the selection of donor sperm. This thesis follows a marketing trail for sperm from scientific journal, to the web, to conference floor. In doing so it examines and contrasts the information that is offered by companies distributing donor sperm and drawn upon by those making selective choices. It argues that the process of donor gamete selection---as mediated by Internet technologies---is characterized by a juxtapositioning of two trends: 'eugenic' promise, and expansion kinship networks based on 'like kinds'. This paper strives to explore these desires, beliefs and motivations at play in the commodification, distribution and consumption observed in the online marketing and sale of gametes. This thesis contributes to the body of anthropological theorizing on gifting and commodification, and kinship, by arguing that donor sperm---in the context of current exchange practices---challenges a dichotomous categorization of gift/commodity, and is best understood as a hybrid item of exchange. Following Appadurai, the commodity candidacy of donor sperm, and the context of its commodification is explored, noting the manner in which kinship networks are extended and negotiated in the process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lock, Margaret</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j67315786.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579v09v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Artificial insemination, Human -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electronic commerce -- Social aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35tb31d"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La fictionalisation dans le Journal d'Henriette Dessaulles ; A demain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Proulx, Marie-Helene</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis as for object the diary literary genre. It is divided into two distinct parts: the first relates to textual criticism, and the second to the creation of a short diary novel. The critical text's problematic is based-on the elaboration of indices of fictionality within an excerpt from the non-fictional diary of Henriette Dessaulles (Journal), where the author narrates her convalescence journey at Orchard Beach. Based on theoretical grounds generated by narratology and the pragmatics of speech acts, this research focuses on the function of two narrative strategies, elaborated by the diarist. These consist in the textual inscription of the addressee, as well as in the construction of the narrative voice. As far as the creative text is concerned, it utilizes many generic features of the personal diary, amongst which can be found a relatively bare and unrestrained literary style; the rule of periodicity is also observed. Moreover, the aspects tackled in the text are typical to the tenor of teenager's personal diary: the search of one's identity, relationships with significant ones, sexual desire, friendships, loneliness and death.

Published in 1899, the Theory proposes a sociological analysis of the economical and social American elite, from 1850 to 1900, a time of major capitalistic expansion in the United States. Veblen's concepts of leisure and conspicuous consumption allow us to demonstrate how each character in Proust's novel distinguishes itself in a context of social rivalry. Referring to Pierre Bourdieu's theory, various conspicuous social practices are analyzed according to the social milieu of La Recherche from which they originated. Therefore, Mme Verdurin's upper middle class perception of reality confronts the aristocratic ethic embodied by the duchesse de Guermantes. In the conclusion of the thesis, we acknowledge the predominant sociological aspect of La Recherche, which is however only one of the many underlying elements of Proust's technique of fiction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angenot, Marc</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sm29b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042v78f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Veblen, Thorstein, 1857-1929</dc:subject><dc:subject>Society in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proust, Marcel, 1871-1922.

Nietzsche's conception of tragedy applies to and describes the novel surprisingly well, explaining certain similarities between the authors' works while identifying another of the text's many genres.

Pieyre de Mandiargues : musee des horreurs ; Monstres</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Faucher, Evangeline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Andre Pieyre de Mandiargues' Le musee noir is a collection of short stories insidiously permeated by the monster figure in its most diverse forms. Far from being reduced to a simple thematic function, this omnipresence of the monstrous contributes to making the collection truly a whole by instilling it with an internal mode of operation. This rhetoric of the monstrous directs both the collection and each of the stories, all the while driving their dynamic of the fantastic. The mandiarguian text acquires its fantastic dimension through a progressive transformation of the protagonist's point of view, inciting him to perceive his environment as a gigantic monstrous entity. Contact with this entity causes the protagonist's own personality to be replaced by that of the monster. Yet it is the woman who, as a representative of the sacred in the logic of fantastic stories, remains in Mandiargues' text the best incarnation of the monstrous figure. Man, who represents the profane, will emerge contaminated by the sacred from his encounter with the monstrous and devouring woman. This contagion is incarnated by the androgynous figure, which remains most convincingly represented within this work by the negro. Finally, by comparing Mandiargues' writing devices with the techniques used in horror museums of old for monsters stage exhibitions, we will be able to confirm our initial hypothesis: the monster figure, by being the motor of the fantastic element dynamic, is essential to the unity of the collection.

The task is accomplished by analyzing arguments both for and against qiyas and ta`lil as presented by two major jurists of the 5th century of the Hijra representing opposite ends of the Islamic theological spectrum: (1) the H&amp;dotbelow;anafite Mu`tazilite jurist Abu l-H&amp;dotbelow;usayn al-Bas&amp;dotbelow;ri (d. 436/1044) and (2) the Z&amp;dotbelow;ahirite Abu Muh&amp;dotbelow;ammad `Ali ibn H&amp;dotbelow;azm al-Andalusi (d. 456/1064). After detailing each author's stance regarding the justifiability of qiyas and ta`lil, the thesis analyzes the underlying theological and epistemological premises and assumptions that can be extrapolated from each author's position. This analysis focuses on three fundamental sets of questions, namely: (1) What can be inferred from each author's position regarding the nature and provenance of knowledge in general, and of the relative status of certain (qat&amp;dotbelow;`i, yaqini) versus suppositional (z&amp;dotbelow;anni ) knowledge in matters of Shari`a? (2) What, according to each author, was the moral-legal status of acts before the promulgation of the Shari`a, and what can be inferred from this about the nature and provenance of moral-legal norms as conceived in the Islamic world view? Finally, (3) What can we conclude, on the basis of each jurist's arguments for or against qiyas and ta`lil, about the purposefulness of Divine acts in general and of the Shari`a in particular?</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hallaq, Wael B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430660c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kq00g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Knowledge, Theory of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ibn Ḥazm, ʻAlī ibn Aḥmad, 994-1064</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islamic law -- Sources</dc:subject><dc:subject>Baṣrī, Muḥammad ibn ʻAlī, d. 1044</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw66345665"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Transforming emotions : the practice of lojong in Tibetan Buddhism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fernandes, Karen M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study concerns the investigation of the mind training method called Lojong, as portrayed by the Gelug branch of Tibetan Buddhism. The emphasis is placed on the practical application of the philosophical tenets underlying this set of routines. Some of the issues to be addressed are: the use of imagery in the process of emotional healing, the ethical concerns that arise in regards to interpreting key concepts pertaining to the Mahayana Buddhist world view, the importance of individuality and the problem of selflessness in practices that deal with alleviating negative emotions, and the suitability of the specific practices for the contemporary western female practitioner. In consideration of the pragmatic nature of this study, conclusions have been drawn towards the possible changes that might be made, when a form of training devised for a distinct group of practitioners, is extended to a more diversified population.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayes, Richard</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d6095.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w66345665</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Meditation -- Buddhism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Philosophy, Buddhist</dc:subject><dc:subject>Buddhism -- China -- Tibet</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vv99j"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La femme au cœur du dialogue des cultures dans Leon l'Africain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ephrem el-Boustani, Leila</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of our thesis is to show the important role of the woman in the novelistic autobiography of Leon l'Africain.

The surfactant was Antarox BL-236, a nonionic surfactant with a solubilization capacity of 0.052 g DCB/g surfactant. The 9 cm long bed, which initially contained 10 wt % bentonite and a dispersion of o-DCB (2910 or 5821 ppm) in water, was placed in a horizontal cylinder (5 cm ID) and held at each end by a supported filter paper. Carbon disk electrodes were located in compartments at each end of the bed. Surfactant solution or distilled water was fed to the anode compartment and effluent was withdrawn from the cathode compartment to maintain liquid levels. A constant direct current of 1.53 mA/cm2 of bed cross sectional area was applied. The current generated hydrogen ions at the anode, hydroxyl ions at the cathode, and an electroosmotic flow from the anode to the cathode. Stainless steel pin electrodes placed in the bed and pH electrodes inserted into the bed and the electrode compartments gave continuous measurements of voltage differences and pH changes. Experimental runs were 48 to 96 hours in duration. To prevent cracking of the bed, which increased the energy requirements, the cathode compartment was flushed continuously with 0.01 M HNO3, a procedure called cathode rinse. An anode feed of 10 wt % surfactant solution removed six times more DCB in 4 days than distilled water. About 20% of the solubilization capacity of the surfactant was utilized at 2910 ppm initial DCB, increasing to 34% for 5820 ppm. DCB was detected in the effluent after about 1.5 pore volumes of liquid passed through the bed; thereafter the rate of DCB removal was approximately constant. The effects of surfactant concentration and NAPL concentration on DCB removal and the energy expenditure were determined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Weber, M.

Studies have shown that this applies to both the cantilevered and clamped-clamped shells. The effect of boundary conditions was examined and it was concluded that a system with identical end conditions (clamped or pinned) is conservative; thus, at sufficiently high flow, it loses stability by divergence, followed by coupled-mode flutter at a slightly higher flow velocity. This thesis focuses on the systems of clamped-pinned and pinned-clamped shells. Initially using two different theories, the standing wave analysis and the travelling wave analysis, small dampings (negative or positive) are found in a system of clamped-pinned (and pinned-clamped) ends before the flow reaches the critical divergence velocity. The same result is obtained based on an analysis of an elastically constrained shell. Upon further examination, it is found that the small dampings observed in the first two cases are simply numerical artifacts: the magnitude of these dampings tends to zero as the accuracy of the computation is improved Hence, it is concluded that the clamped-pinned and pinned-clamped systems are conservative.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Paidoussis, M.

Biomass pellets were subjected to a slow heating process using a Thermogravimetric Furnace (TGF) coupled with a Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). The mechanism of biomass pellets during combustion and the evolution of combustion gases from the solid residues were identified.

This series included: a specimen without any confinement; a specimen with closed ties; a specimen with seismic hoops and crossties; a specimen with closed hoops and headed bars replacing the crossties; and two specimens that had all of the transverse reinforcement replaced by headed bars at two different spacings. Two additional specimens were tested to investigate the effectiveness of headed bars used to retrofit specimens that had no transverse reinforcement. In the retrofit procedure the first step involved drilling horizontal holes through the specimens. Headed bars with one end having a fixed head and the other end having a threaded head were then placed in the holes. After seating the heads on a thin layer of epoxy, the headed bars were slightly prestressed using the turn-of-the-nut method. Using small access holes drilled at the end of each headed bar, the horizontal holes were filled with structural epoxy. Behavioural comparisons were made for the boundary elements utilizing conventional reinforcement and those with headed bars. It was found that headed bars not only provided a viable solution when used as crossties, but they also offer improved confinement compared to the seismic hoops and crossties used in seismic design. It was also found that headed bars can be used to replace entirely the hoops and crossties with improved confinement. The retrofit procedure using added headed bars resulted in significant improvement to the confinement of the boundary elements.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, Denis</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xg73p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763887p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505226f"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Design for manufacturability of speed-reduction cam mechanisms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lee, Mern Keat</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cam mechanisms are widely used in industry, in applications requiring quick-return and indexing motions. A current research effort at the Robotic Mechanical Systems Laboratory of McGill University's Centre for Intelligent Machines aims at the application of cam mechanisms as speed reducers. The accuracy required in these mechanisms is of the utmost importance, especially when cams are rotating at a high speed. In this thesis, the design for manufacturability of planar speed-reduction cam mechanisms is studied. In particular, the thesis focuses on a speed reducer with a rotating follower to couple shafts of parallel axes, termed planar Speed-o-Cam. Principles of the design for manufacturability are applied to Speed-o-Cam and a unified method for obtaining the optimum parameters satisfying the curvature constraints and pressure-angle bounds is developed. These two factors are relatively important because Numerically Controlled and Computer Numerically Controlled machine tools could be very sensitive to changes of curvature of the workpiece, especially when milling complex shapes such as those of cam plates. Cam-mechanism balancing is also studied because unbalance in a high-speed rotating element can cause severe vibrations and greatly affect the bearings and hence, the performance of the machine. This is done by not only adding counterweights, which unavoidably increase the weight and volume of the mechanism, but also by removing material.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angeles, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bn58p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505226f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azc77sr857"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Seismic prioritization of highway bridges in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liu, Zhu, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most of the existing bridges in Montreal have not been designed to resist seismic forces. Although Montreal is not as highly exposed to earthquake hazards as New Zealand, Japan, California, or Vancouver, seismic hazards do exist. Seismic retrofitting has been considered as the most appropriate way to mitigate seismic hazards except for bridges that have a high retrofit cost and rather low importance. As the first step in seismic retrofitting, prioritization of bridges becomes a very important activity. The goal of this thesis is to upgrade the current Canadian prioritization procedure using the latest information from the performance of bridges during recent earthquakes, as well as results from the latest research projects. The previous procedure used in Canada was developed in 1993, since then many changes have occurred relative to seismic retrofitting philosophy. An analytical procedure has replaced the previous simple numerical scoring procedure for the evaluation of vulnerability, and the evaluation of the importance of a bridge has also changed significantly, especially with the addition of new factors such as the ratio of replacement cost to retrofit cost, structure condition and remaining service life. The proposed procedure incorporates these new features and is applied and compared to eleven other procedures for twenty-four bridges administered by the Montreal Office of Transport Quebec.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chouinard, Luc E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x5771.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sr857</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
