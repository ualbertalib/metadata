Some of these have long been recognized as the causative organisms of certain diseases in plants and as causing crop losses of economic significance. Recently there has been increased recognition of the importance of this group of parasites. Farmers as well as research workers are coming to realize that reduced yield and diseased conditions may often be laid at the door of the “eelworm”. Intensive and extensive study of phytonematology is therefore in order.

Extensive diffraction work did not disclose the presence of highly disordered feldspars (high comparative forms). However, the plagioclases of these rocks belong to a distinct series whose order-disorder relations are in agreement with the geological setting of the intrusives and would classify the rocks as hypabyssal rocks (shallow seated rocks). The alkali feldspars of the Monteregian rocks belong to the low-albite--orthoclase series. The presence of this series of alkali feldspars and the absence of feldspars of the low-albite--microcline series is a characteristic of these rocks that is regarded to be a consequence of their cooling history. The rate of cooling of the igneous masses and the annealing of the rocks under predominantly dry conditions are thought to have been the principal factors responsible for the incomplete ordering of the feldspars. The trends of crystallization and the interrelations between the rock types are discussed on the basis of the compositional data obtained on the feldspars. A qualitative diagram for pressures of approximately 1000 bars has been presented to explain the paragenesis of the feldspar associations encountered in the Monteregian Rocks.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stevenson, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h318h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139567c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s6082"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An experimental evaluation of different procedures to induce ventricular-luminal-myocardial circulation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pifarre, Roque</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The work of Wearn (1933) describing the myocardial circulation, with its myocardial sinusoids and arterio-luminal vessels, was confirmed by Vineberg in 1945.

The border problem cannot be separated from the general constitutional questions. The border, in fact, becomes delineated in the process of formation of a state. The border is the limit of claim of sovereignty, and of its effective exercise by a state.

For the clay used in these tests, the observed deformations and bearing capacities were not in agreement with those expected from the conventional bearing theories. The observed bearing capacity was about 25 percent less than that given by the latter theories, due to a punching or local shear failure. An approximate theory developed by Bishop et al (1945), to determine the load required to force a punch into a semi-infinite cohesive mass, was examined. The bearing capacity determined from this theory was in reasonable agreement with the results of the model tests, and also a limited amount of other data which could be examined. On the basis of these limited results, a relation is suggested for the bearing capacity of surface footings on saturated clay which includes, and predicts from the stress-strain properties of the clay, the case where a local shear failure occurs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yong, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655m106.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd473098n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278x92x"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agriculture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of feed restriction upon the growth and initial performance of meat-type replacement pullets</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Parkin, Herbert.

Nous avons parmi les critiques d'opinion opposée ceux qui louent le parler des Canadiens-français pour sa pureté et son élégance. Au début du dix-huitième siècle, à l'époque oh le français des premiers colons venus de nombreuses provinces de la France était devenu à peu près uniforme, un visiteur de la France, le père Charlevoix, écrivit que "nulle part on ne parle plus purement le français qu'en Nouvelle- France." </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rigault, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mr033.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182p73v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>French</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zf70s"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of microstructure in zinc-tin alloys</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Miller, William. A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The properties of metallic materials are largely determined by their microstructure, i.e. by the relative amounts and by the arrangement of the phases that make up the microstructure. This fact has not been given the full attention which might seem due to it because, in the development of alloys, metallurgists have concentrated most on the properties of the separate constituents, less on the amount of these constituents and least of all on the disposition of the alloying elements in the final structure A simple illustration of the above remarks can be found in the case of cast iron, an alloy of iron and graphite.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000363w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zf70s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Metallurgical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn3014991"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The nuclear many-body problem using the boundary condition model</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McMillan, James. M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis the Feshbach-Lomon Boundary Condition Model for nucleon-nucleon interactions is applied to the Independent Pair Model (or Brueckner theory) of infinite nuclear matter, and to the modified Brueckner theory which includes also the hole-hole interactions. This is accomplished by the construction of a pseudopotential which is equivalent to the Boundary Condition Model in the two-nucleon problem. The pseudopotential is then used in the many-body problem in place of the complicated phenomenological nucleon-nucleon potentials used in more standard treatments. Because of the very simple form of the pseudopotential, the integral equation for the nuclear matter K matrix can be handled relatively easily and without resorting to perturbative approaches. Further, the dependence of the K matrix on the centre of mass momentum of the interacting pair is treated more fully than in previous treatments. Numerical calculations are performed for the case when the nucleon-nucleon interaction vanishes in all but 1s0 states, and in particular the effects arising from the hole-hole interactions and from the centre of mass momentum dependence of the K matrix are discussed. The singularity of the K matrix, the presence of which has been associated with a superconducting state of the system, is investigated for the case when the interaction potential vanishes in all but 1s0 states. The question of whether a singularity exists when the interacting particles have a non-zero centre of mass momentum is also discussed. Finally a value for the size of the energy gap is found.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kahana, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75rc57k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3014991</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j333594r"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A variational solution of the one group neutron transport equation with isotropic scattering in long, homogeneous, circular cylinders</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McKay, Carlyle.

In particular the method is applied to a long homogeneous cylinder which captures and isotropically scatters neutrons and which is subject to an incurrent of neutrons with an angular distribution proportional to the cosine of the angle between the normal to the surface and the direction of neutron travel. Tables and figures are given to illustrate the accuracy of the “method for cylinders with radii up to four mean free paths and which range from almost purely capturing to nearly purely scattering. The calculations are done with trial functions that are polynomials in the square of the distance from the cylinder axis with various number of terms, up to nine, included.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wallace, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311t044.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333594r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82kc012"><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agriculture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Zone electrophoretic studies of the proteins of avian serum and egg yolk</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McCully, Keith.
