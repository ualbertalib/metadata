However, recent research showed that this system could increase phosphorus (P) losses in tile drains. The cause of this increase, whether related to enhanced P solubility due to shallow water tables seen with WTM or to the addition of P by the subirrigation water, has not been investigated. The goal of this research was to evaluate the impact of WTM on P losses and on soil P concentration, soil P saturation and soil pH with a field study. Furthermore, a laboratory soil column study was conducted to better understand the results of the field study. The field study was carried out in 2004 and 2005 in Coteau-du-Lac (Quebec). The WTM system, with a design water table set at 0.60 m below the soil surface, was compared to conventional free drainage (FD). The results showed that WTM had no effect on the soil P concentration and saturation. However, soil pH was slightly increased in WTM plots, which may demonstrate a greater P solubility. Total outflow volumes from WTM plots were reduced by 19% and 27% in 2004 and 2005, respectively. However, P loads in drainage water from plots under WTM were greater than from FD plots due to increased P concentrations, which always exceeded Quebec's surface water quality standard of 0.03 mg/L. Of the total P concentration, around 96% was dissolved P in both treatments. The laboratory soil column experiment, in which the two drainage treatments were simulated, also showed that P concentrations were greater under WTM than FD. This suggests that the increased P losses in the field with WTM were most likely caused by the increased P solubility due to a shallow water table rather than by the addition of P by the water used for subirrigation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j835p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gs945</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Water table -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drainage -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phosphorus -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0g354f523"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Tropical host plant-insect relationships as guides to medicinally-active plants</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Helson, Julie Elizabeth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous studies have shown that: (1) plant defensive compounds may have medicinal properties; and (2) defensive compounds present in aposematic insects are often sequestered from their host-plant(s). This study addresses whether aposematic insects can be used as guides to detect plants containing medicinally-active compounds. First, ten tropical medicinally-active plants and ten non-active plants, selected using previous ICBG bioassay results, were observed regularly to determine their insect populations. Aposematic insects were found more frequently on active than non-active plants ( X2=8.167, P=0.01). Second, three aposematic insects feeding on Tithonia diversifolia were examined chemically to determine the fate of the plant's pharmaceutically-active compounds. They were not found to sequester or excrete these compounds. Therefore, using aposematic insects could increase the likelihood of finding plants with medicinally-active compounds; however, these insects may not necessarily utilize these compounds for defensive purposes. The underlying basis for this significant association between aposematic insects and medicinally-active plants requires further investigation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f8498.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354f523</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Insect-plant relationships -- Panama</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medicinal plants -- Panama</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666478n"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Model evolution</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>He, Amaranth Wei</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>"Model Driven Software Development" is a recent trend in development of software-intensive systems. In the Model Driven Software Development process, all knowledge pertaining to the software system to be built is represented in the form of models, in the right formalism(s) and at the right level of abstraction. At the highest level of abstraction, domain models, rather than generic models are used. Although the idea of developing the software system at a higher abstraction level is appealing, many fundamental questions remain unresolved. Many issues such as how to define the syntax and semantics of models, how to represent and store models and how to trace model evolution should be addressed properly. In this thesis, the focus is on model transformations and the open problems related to it. In particular, how to compare models, how to trace model evolution (with as a goal to undo and redo model changes), how to deal with meta-model evolution, and ultimately with semantics evolution are explored. For each issue, we analyze problems, and propose some solutions. We use small case studies to make issues more concrete. All case studies are developed in AToM3 (A Tool for Multi-formalism and Meta-Modeling), developed in the Modeling, Simulation and Design Lab (MSDL) in the School of Computer Science of McGill University.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs22h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666478n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agm80hv590"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Solving constrained integer least squares problems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Han, Qing, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to design efficient algorithms for solving constrained integer least squares (ILS) problems. These problems may arise from many applications, such as communications and cryptography. In this thesis, we mainly consider two kinds of constrained ILS problems: box-constrained integer least squares (BILS) problem and ellipsoid-constrained integer least squares (EILS) problem. Solving a constrained ILS problem usually has two stages: reduction (or preprocessing) and search. We first present a reduction algorithm and a search algorithm for solving the BILS problem. Unlike the usual reduction algorithms, which use only the information of the generator matrix, the new reduction algorithm also uses the information of the given input vector and the box constraint. The new search algorithm overcomes some shortcomings of the existing search algorithms and gives some other improvements. Then, for solving the EILS problem, we dynamically transfer it to a BILS problem and extend the above new search algorithm. In addition, we suggest using the well-known LLL reduction for preprocessing. For both problems, simulation results indicate the combination of our reduction algorithms and search algorithms can be (much) more efficient than the existing algorithms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b6342.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80hv590</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asx61dm60n"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hydrological and water quality modeling of agricultural fields in Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gollamudi, Apurva</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two tile-drained agricultural fields in the Pike River watershed of Southern Quebec were instrumented in October 2000 to monitor phosphorus and nitrate concentrations in surface runoff and tile drainage. Data collected from these sites were used as the primary input to test a GIS-based hydrological and water quality simulation model (ArcView SWAT2000) at the field scale. Surface runoff, subsurface flow, sediment yield, nitrate loads and phosphorus loads were the principal parameters evaluated by the model. The SWAT model was calibrated using data collected in the year 2002 while 2003 data was used for validating the model. Particulate phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus loads in streamflow were also simulated using SWAT and compared with field measurements. A sensitivity analysis showed that curve number, available soil water content and soil evaporation factors significantly influenced water yield simulations while model performance for water quality parameters was governed mainly by the accuracy of simulating field operations such as fertilization and tillage. The monthly coefficients of performance after calibration ranged from being very good for some parameters (0.27 to 0.66 for total water yield; 0.38 to 0.67 for total phosphorus; and 0.23 to 0.89 for sediments) to being inconsistent for others (0.44 to 2.28 for subsurface flow; 0.63 to 4.36 for surface runoff; and 0.66 to 1.35 for total nitrate loads). Overall, it was found that SWAT results on a seasonal scale were generally more reliable whereas daily or monthly simulations could be improved by using a longer calibration period or incorporating model changes. Short-term impacts of implementing different best management practices for tillage, crop rotation and fertilization were also evaluated using the validated SWAT model. It was found that conservation tillage of corn coupled with pasture or soybean rotations can reduce total phosphorus loads in the range of 25-50% over conventional tillage with corn.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p064n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dm60n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nitrates -- Environmental aspects -- Pike River Watershed (Vt. and Québec)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phosphorus -- Environmental aspects -- Pike River Watershed (Vt. and Québec)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water quality -- Pike River Watershed (Vt. and Québec) -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agricultural pollution -- Pike River Watershed (Vt. and Québec) -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A44558d659"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hydrodechlorination of polyvinyl chloride in sub-critical water</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gong, ShiYi, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), a plastic polymer composed of ~43% hydrocarbon by weight and ~57% chlorine has become extensively used in our daily lives. However, the disposal of waste PVC plastics presents serious problems. The increased awareness of these problems requires the development of a reliable technique to dispose of these wastes in a safe and environmentally benign way that is devoid of the formation/release of organo-chlorine compounds. Chemical degradation of PVC is a technology that transforms PVC waste into completely new chemical products that don't contain chlorine. Sub-critical water (SCW) treatment is one of the most reliable technologies since SCW as a chemical reaction medium having adjustable physico-chemical properties. Hydrodechlorination (HDC), a reaction that replaces organically bound chlorine by hydrogen, can be accelerated by the presence of metal oxide catalysts (alumina supported palladium, Pd0/Al2O3) or raney nickel. When combined with SCW treatment, HDC offers a disposal process that is free from unwanted by-products. The rate of borohydride decomposition is accelerated by raney nickel. The HDC efficiency of virgin and formulated PVC in SCW under various reaction conditions of time and temperature was evaluated systematically. The time of reaction was varied from 1 to 4.5 hours and the temperature was varied from 150 to 280°C in the presence of palladium on alumina (Pd/Al2O3) or raney nickel. The efficiency of HDC varied from ~3% up to a completed dechlorination. Thus, organically bound chlorine in PVC in a water phase can be converted, virtually quantitatively, to chloride ion. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for experimental design and data analysis. The computer output from the Design-Expert software was used to optimize a model for the dechlorination as a function of time and temperature. A subsequent analysis of variance associated with the fitted model indicated a good fit between observed and predicted HDC efficiencies.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128b18s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558d659</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Polyvinyl chloride -- Environmental aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polyvinyl chloride -- Deterioration</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816m87j"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Measuring and improving the runtime behaviour of aspectJ programs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Goard, Christopher</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>AspectJ is a popular aspect-oriented extension to Java, providing powerful new features for the modularizing of crosscutting concerns, promising improved code quality. The runtime cost of these features, however, is currently not well understood, and is a concern limiting even more wide-spread adoption of the language. The crosscutting nature of AspectJ complicates the measurement of these costs. This thesis presents a methodology for analyzing the runtime behaviour of AspectJ programs, with a particular emphasis on identifying runtime overheads resulting from the implementation of AspectJ features. It presents a taxonomy of overhead kinds and defines some new AspectJ-specific dynamic metrics. A toolset for measuring these metrics is described, including both of the current AspectJ compilers: ajc and abc, and results for a newly collected set of AspectJ benchmarks are presented. Significant overheads are found in some cases, suggesting improvements to the code generation strategy of the AspectJ compilers. Initial implementations of some improvements are presented, resulting, for some benchmarks, in order of magnitude improvements to execution time. These improvements have since been integrated in abc and ajc. Clearly understanding the runtime behaviour of AspectJ programs should result in both better implementations of the language and more confident adoption by the mainstream.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jf12w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816m87j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k518k"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of smooth muscle myosin isoforms in a model of innate airway hyperresponsiveness</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gil, F. Roberto</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a key feature of asthma, characterized by exaggerated rate and extent of shortening of airway smooth muscle. Two isoforms of the smooth muscle myosin differ by the presence [(+)insert] or absence [(-)insert] of a 7 amino acid insert. The (+)insert exhibits a 2-fold greater ATPase activity and velocity of actin filament propulsion in the in vitro motility assay. The expression of these isoforms and other contractile proteins was quantified in the trachea of the Fisher and Lewis rat model of innate AHR. We found 95% greater mRNA and 45% greater protein expression of the (+)insert isoform in the trachea of the hyperresponsive Fisher animal (p&lt;0.01), but no difference in other contractile proteins. A greater extent of myosin phosphorylation was also observed (55.1+/- d6.4 vs. 41.4+/-d6.1, p&lt;0.01). These results suggest that in addition to greater myosin activation, an increased expression of the (+)insert isoform contribute to AHR.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z558d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k518k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0v838081j"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A software system for laptop performance and improvisation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zadel, Mark</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Laptop performance---performance on a standard computer system without novel controllers, usually by a solo musician---is an increasingly common mode of live computer music. Its novelty is diminishing, however, and it is frequently described as being uninteresting. Laptop performance often lacks the sense of effort and active creation that we typically expect from live music, and exhibits little perceivable connection between the performer's actions and the resulting sound. Performance software designs tend to constrict the flow of control between the performer and the music, often leading artists to rely on prepared control sequences. Laptop performers become "pilots" of largely computerized processes, detracting from the live experience. This thesis project presents an alternative software interface that aims to bring a sense of active creation to laptop performance. The system prevents the use of prepared control sequences and allows the live assembly of generative musical processes. The software resembles a freehand drawing interface where strokes are interactively assembled to create looping and cascading animated figures. The on-screen animation is mapped to sound, creating corresponding audio patterns. Networks of strokes are assembled and manipulated to perform music. The system's use of freehand input infuses the music with natural human variability, and its graphical interface establishes a visible connection between the user's actions and the resulting audio. The thesis document explores the above issues in laptop performance, which motivated this research. Typical examples of performance software are presented, illustrating the interface design patterns that contribute to this situation. The thesis software project is presented, describing its goals, design and implementation. The properties of the interface are discussed in light of the project's initial objectives. It is concluded that the system is a solid step toward a novel approach to laptop performance software.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x177r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v838081j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Composition (Music) -- Computer programs</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer composition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Improvisation (Music) -- Computer programs</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8p58pd227"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Towards robust voxel-coloring : handling camera calibration errors and partial emptiness of surface voxels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Anwar, Zeeshan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we present two new methods to overcome the effects of both camera calibration errors and partial emptiness of surface voxels in voxel-coloring. Voxel-coloring is a relatively new volumetric method for 3D scene reconstruction from multiple calibrated views. The quality of reconstruction is affected by the presence of errors in the estimated calibration parameters. Furthermore, a voxel forming a scene surface may be partially empty as there is no prior knowledge about the scene surface. Both of these sources of error result in outlier pixels in voxel projections in the input images. These outlier pixels affect the photo-consistency test of the voxel and tend to result in over-carving of the reconstructed 3D scene. The existing methods to handle these errors are either insufficient or too complex. We propose a method to handle the effect of calibration errors and call it Adaptive Gaussian Averaging. It makes use of the information of the error probability distribution of projected pixel coordinates due to camera parameter errors. We propose another method to reduce the effects of partial emptiness of surface voxels and we call it Area Weighting. In this method we use the pixel count in voxel projections to weight the projections in voxel's color statistics calculations. Our proposed methods are simple and can be incorporated into the existing voxel-coloring algorithms easily. We also conduct experiments on our own calibrated data sets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The experimental results show that both of our proposed methods have the ability to improve the results of existing algorithms. We also compare the results of our proposed methods with the results of an existing method that handle these errors too, the r-Consistency. We find that our proposed methods have the ability to adapt to the level of errors present in the system, and perform better than r-Consistency when the effect of these errors is higher on voxel-coloring.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v5741.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pd227</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jb77b"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>X = what? : Douglas Coupland, Generation X, and the politics of irony</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zurbrigg, Terri Susan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis considers four novels written by Douglas Coupland: Generation X (1991), Shampoo Planet (1992), Microserfs (1995), and Girlfriend in a Coma (1998), and demonstrates how each of these novels provides a discursive space in which Coupland examines the members of Generation X: those born between 1965 and 1980. Frederic Jameson's theories about postmodernism, which he equates with the concept of late capitalism, offer a theoretical lens through which this demographic can be interpreted because Coupland's characters struggle to find meaning and sincerity in a realm where advertising and consumerism are omnipresent and nearly all aspects of life are commodified. The ultimate consequence of the alienation and apathy that result from such rampant materialism is the emergence of an idiom that privileges irony. For Coupland, the prevalence of this irony is the most problematic aspect of postmodern society. Consequently, in portraying how the members of Generation X cope with late capitalism and its concomitant irony, Coupland's first four novels function as a trajectory that demonstrate how he and his characters grapple with and eventually repudiate it.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dp98r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jb77b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Coupland, Douglas -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Irony in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Generation X</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322d520"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Collaborative multi-camera surveillance using automated person detection</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ahmedali, Trevor</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis aims to build the groundwork for a distributed network of collaborating, intelligent video surveillance cameras.

Training examples are automatically extracted and labelled from the current frame, and the classifier is then applied to the image to detect and locate person instances.

The questions being addressed are: (1) What are the current challenges and benefits impacting teachers with the integration of computers in the classroom environment? (2) What do classroom practices look like given (a) in the context of Quebec's constructivist-learning environment and (b) the possibility of ICT support. Case studies with teachers from elementary and high schools show changes in teacher and student role; however, lack of guidelines hinder constructivist teaching practices.

The proportions of wishes and fears expressed at two phases in the participant's recovery journey are also discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53ww00p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602094d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Recovering addicts</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cocaine abuse</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mothers -- Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956g159"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of a gross motor task to assess motor planning of children with autism spectrum disorders</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Staples, Kerri</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Motor planning was assessed by performance of 10 male children (age range 9-12 years) with ASD on a simple obstacle course of horizontal barriers. The primary measures of motor planning were acts of hesitation and hesitation time. These measures, along with executive functioning scores from the BRIEF, and measures of movement execution were correlated to assess the validity of this obstacle course. Results of these correlations supported the validity of the motor planning inferences from the performance of the obstacle course since motor planning correlated in the expected directions with the BRIEF scores and movement execution measures. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was sufficiently high to support the reliability of this obstacle course, with the item analysis providing direction for the most reliable barrier heights. Therefore, the use of this obstacle course task provides both valid inferences and reliable measures of motor planning, although further development is warranted.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vn90n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g159</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Motor ability in children -- Testing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Autistic children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r340k"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Moment of silence : constructions of race and nation in narratives of Canadian history</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stuart, Amy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This project explores the racialized construction of the Canadian nation through the teaching of history and the discourse of multiculturalism, and investigates the ways in which young people experience and make sense of history, nation and race in the context of 'official' narratives of the nation.

Following a discussion of the methodological approach, I analyse the construction of race and nation through the discourse of Canadian history, as manifested in a variety of sites, including federal policy, curriculum frameworks, textbooks, and the Historica Foundation's Heritage Minutes. Finally, I present the results of a conversation with youth about their experiences with and views of race, nation and history.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zd82t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r340k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Multiculturalism -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>History -- Study and teaching -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Race awareness -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0v838082t"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>S'écrire à travers la mémoire de la Shoah, cinquante ans après : le cas de Patrick Modiano ; suivi de, Les trois âges de Zofia</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pawlowicz, Julia Magdalena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Is it possible, indeed, is it legitimate to write about the Shoah when one is born after the war, when one hasn't experienced the horrors of concentration camps, and when survivors themselves are questioning the representability of the genocide? Which idioms can one use, what language can one invent in order to speak of this tragic event when it is necessary to do so, because it defines one's Jewish identity? By its density and its specificity, Patrick Modiano's work answers these difficult questions. In a confrontation with collective history, which is at once strange and familiar to them, his narrators explore writing in order to find the right way to define the parametres and, more significantly, the limits of their identity. Their integrity allows them to transform their weaknesses into strengths: by accepting the distance between himself, the Shoah, and collective history, Modiano situates himself with respect to one of the most important events of the twentieth century.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t210t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v838082t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945), in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Modiano, Patrick, 1945- -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jp010"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>In laudem sancti Michaëlis : the Irish and Coptic analogues and the Anglo-Saxon context</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Perron, Roland</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In laudem sancti Michaelis (ILSM) is a heretical Old English homily on the Archangel Michael copied in the margins of an exemplar of Bede's Ecclesiastical History. The Introduction surveys the previous researches on ILSM. Chapter 1 analyzes it as a case of heterodoxy, discussing how it deformed the etymology of "Mi-cha-el?". Chapters 2 and 3 consider its Irish and Coptic analogues, then situate it in 11th-century England. Refining the insights of other scholars, I argue that a theme having to do with supernatural protection links ILSM to some of its companion marginalia, and that an archival intent motivated its preservation. The Conclusion addresses the question of its being an esoteric text. A new edition and translation of ILSM is offered in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 provides the very first edition and translation of its Irish analogue, the Liber Flavus Fergusiorum tract on Saint Michael. Budge's translation of the Coptic analogue attributed to Theodosius (AD 535-567) makes up Appendix 3. Appendices 4 and 5 compile documents relevant to my analysis of the context.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579s505.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jp010</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Christian heresies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Manuscripts, English (Old)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abk128b192"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Jewish Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A literary movement for the vanished world of Lithuanian Jewry : the work of the Yiddish writer Chaim Grade</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pilnik, Shay A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis offers new perspectives on the Yiddish poet and novelist Chaim Grade, examining his reflections on the world of historic Lithuanian Jewry from the outset of his career through his post-Holocaust novels. Chapter one explores the gap between the historical reality of interwar Vilna and its literary representation in his novel Di agune and questions the widely accepted view of this work as a credible historical source. Chapter two deals with Grade's depiction of his experience as a student in a Novaredok Musar yeshiva, contrasting the depiction of this yeshiva in the poem Musernikes (1938) and the novel Tsemakh atlas (1967). The writer's shift from a fierce condemnation of the Novaredok Yeshiva to a more moderate and affectionate view as a post-Holocaust writer is explained as the older Grade's attempt to reconcile his art and identity as a modern Jew with the religious world he had forsaken.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xr88v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128b192</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Jews -- Lithuania -- Vilnius</dc:subject><dc:subject>Literature and history -- Lithuania</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grade, Chaim, 1910-1982</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r120z"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A matter of time : digital patina and timeboundedness in new media</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pelletier, Johanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The term patina refers to a particular quality of decay in material objects, where the decay is both a physical and symbolic property of the object.

Participants were 36 teachers at junior high and elementary schools and 28 undergraduates in a TEFL certificate program. Data collection was completed with the use of two Likert-scale questionnaires: one involving a task in listening to various English varieties, and the other asking about beliefs about the English language in general and perceptions of nonnative/nonstandard Englishes as opposed to the two major varieties in ELT in Japan: American and British English. In addition, oral interviews were conducted with several participants and their assistant language teachers (ALTs). The findings suggested that in-service teachers showed more ambivalent attitudes toward nonnative varieties than student-teachers did; although the teachers acknowledged potential benefits of nonnative Englishes for the future use of EIL, they showed hesitation in regarding different Englishes as instructional models to be exposed to students. However, the study also showed participants' interest in introducing other Englishes as awareness-raising models. The possibility of inclusion of nonnative varieties was further discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860722w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c309z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Variation -- Foreign countries</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Japanese speakers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848q88b"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>French influence on a 20th century 'Ālim : 'Allal al-Fāsī and his ideas toward legal reform in Morocco</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mogilski, Sara</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a study of a 20th Century Moroccan ' alim, 'Allal al-Fasi, and his ideas toward legal reform. The aim of this study is to understand the influence French colonialism had on a traditional scholar and nationalist. This thesis attempts to unearth the way al-Fasi assimilated and advocated many French notions of how a legal system ought to operate. It begins with a discussion of the French colonial discourse surrounding the Moroccan legal system and their subsequent reforms. This is followed by a biographical account of al-Fasi, discussing his role as both nationalist and 'alim. Subsequently, an examination will be offered on al-Fasi's ideology as an 'alim seeking to reconcile the traditional Islamic legal system with modern concepts of justice. Its final section will attempt to show the contradictions in al-Fasi as a nationalist and as an 'alim. This will help to understand how French legal discourse became incorporated into al-Fasi's thought.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wc93h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848q88b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fāsī, ʻAllāl, 1910-1974</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law -- Morocco</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qs20w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Bone pins and territoriality at the Koster, Black Earth and Modoc Rockshelter sites : a social contradiction model for the trend toward sedentism in the Middle Archaic Midwest</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McNichol, Anthony J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Carved and engraved bone pins from the Koster, Black Earth and Modoc Rockshelter sites have been used by Professor Richard Jefferies to investigate the development of regional-scale interaction between hunter-gatherer groups of the Midwest Middle Archaic.

The essay explains how the author makes use of a variety of sources, and how he shapes their effect according to an original conception of the form of the contemporary novella. There follows a discussion of this form and its relation to the confessional narratives of Vladimir Nabokov, and to cultural critics' views on the social role of criminals. The author demonstrates how the changing nature of criminality and confession is reflected in the works of de Sade, Poe, and Nabokov. The issues of the handling of irony, paranoia and the relation of crime to work emerge as the key elements. The author posits the fusion of confessional narrative with the literature of genre overdetermination, in which the expectations of genre dominate a character's interiority.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246s374.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dm626</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nabokov, Vladimir Vladimirovich, 1899-1977 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Criminals in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p746b"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>&amp;quot;The land is getting smaller&amp;quot; : changing territorial strategies of pastoralists in Tanzania</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>LaRocque, Olivier</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is the result of fieldwork in Tanzania alongside pastoralists. Since mobility is a condition of pastoral existence, the study followed patterns of livestock movements in several sites, along seasonal migratory routes, and in areas where pastoralists have relocated permanently. Large-scale land alienation from their customary territory by the government and the encroachment of agriculturalists threaten the integrity of the pastoralists' livestock economy. Most pastoralists now farm to supplement their dairy diet. Since agricultural development secures a stronger claim on land, pastoralists also pre-empt outsiders' claims for land by expanding their own farming activities. However, the study suggests that the transformation of key seasonal pastures into large commercial farms and subsistence farm plots has a cumulative effect on the availability of pastoral resources. The chronic scarcity of dry season grazing resources exacerbates competition among pastoralist groups. Large pastoral territories are fragmenting into less sustainable pastoral management units and strategies of exclusion are replacing earlier arrangements based on reciprocity of access to facilitate livestock mobility. As a last resort, some pastoralists relocate in agricultural areas where prejudices against pastoralism run high and livestock mobility is further constrained. Altogether, political constraints now shape livelihoods from livestock more so than ecological factors. The loss of livestock mobility increases the vulnerability of herd-owners to occasional droughts, and stationary herds are more likely to cause environmental damage. Pastoralism is often deemed economically unsustainable and environmentally destructive, but the examination of political and social constraints helps understand better the current state of mobile pastoralism.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042t42v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p746b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Land tenure -- Tanzania</dc:subject><dc:subject>Maasai (African people) -- Land tenure</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
