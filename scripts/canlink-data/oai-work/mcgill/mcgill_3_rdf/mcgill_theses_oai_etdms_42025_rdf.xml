I propose that a cognitive strategy people employ to reach this equilibrium is the activation of Compensatory Health Beliefs (CHBs). CHBs are beliefs that the negative effects of an unhealthy behavior can be compensated for, or "neutralized," by engaging in another, healthy behavior. "I can eat this piece of cake now because I will exercise this evening" is an example of such beliefs. This thesis presents a theoretical framework which aims at explaining why people create CHBs and how they employ CHBs to regulate their health behaviors. The model extends current health behavior models by explicitly integrating the motivational conflict that emerges from the interplay between affective states (i.e., cravings or desires) and motivation (i.e., health goals). The first study includes a psychometric scale that measures CHBs in the general population and provides data on its reliability and validity. The results showed that scores on the scale were uniquely associated with health-related risk behaviors and symptom reports and could be differentiated from a number of related constructs. Holding CHBs may hinder individuals from acquiring healthier lifestyles, for example lose weight or exercise. The second large-scale study of this thesis aimed at studying CHBs in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. It is proposed that in this population, CHBs might interfere with treatment adherence. If compensatory behaviors fail to compensate for the maladaptive behaviors, poor blood glucose control and related health problems may arise. To investigate this further, I developed and validated a CHB scale specific to type 1 diabetes. The scale was validated in a sample of adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Results showed that holding maladaptive compensatory health beliefs was associated with poorer blood glucose control and poorer adherence to self-care behaviors while adaptive CHBs were associated with better blood glucose control and better adherence to treatment behaviors. Specifically targeting CHBs in an intervention could improve adherence to treatment and therefore the long-term health of this population. Future research as well as the implications for possible interventions are explicitly being discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3336540.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jw32x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pleasure principle (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diet -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self-control</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agm80j084b"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Contemporary expressions of nonsexism : authentic or assumed?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poore, Abigail G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Over the past forty years, polls have clearly indicated a decrease in expressions of racism and sexism. However, while people appear more tolerant, many social scientists claim that prejudice is still prevalent, although in a more disguised form. Indeed, it may be difficult to distinguish a person who is genuinely nonprejudiced from someone simply conforming to external nonprejudiced norms. This thesis presents three experiments that focus on amen and women in the workplace in order to investigate the extent to which the dilemma of genuine nonsexism exists. Experiment I investigated men's hiring preferences. Men whose nonsexist self-conceptions were threatened with sexist feedback were more likely to choose a less competent female over more competent male worker, than nonthreatened men, especially if they had a well-internalized nonsexist self-conception. Are these men genuinely nonprejudiced? Experiment II investigated the alternative explanation that better-internalized nonsexist men who preferred the less competent woman, may simply have been conforming to nonsexist norms rather than being genuinely nonsexist. Male participants read a scenario wherein sexism was deemed inappropriate and were also required to respond to a romantic attraction between a male manager and female employee that conflicted with the nonsexist workplace norms. Unlike less well-internalized nonsexist men, better-internalized nonsexist men were predicted to avoid potentially sexist expressions of attraction towards a female employee, despite endorsing the workplace romance. Results unexpectedly reveal that better-internalized men, even when threatened, were as likely to express attraction towards the female employee as threatened, less well-internalized men. Better-internalized men therefore responded inconsistently with their nonsexist self-conceptions and instead conformed to a potentially sexist norm of romance in the workplace. Experiment III further explored the influence of romantic norms on men's responses to a female employee. Results reveal that threatened, better-internalized men tended to comply with romantic norms as did threatened, less well-internalized men. Norms appear to encourage compliance with both attraction and nonsexism, even in men apparently motivated by genuinely internalized nonsexism. Thus, apparently "genuine" nonsexist men may instead be viewed conforming to nonsexist norms rather than having authentically internalized a nonsexist self-conception.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wv79x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80j084b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sexism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self-perception</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m3587"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sympathetic sprouting and changes in nociceptive sensory innervation in the glabrous skin of the rat hind paw following partial peripheral nerve injury</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yen, Laurene Dao-Pei</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous studies have suggested that sympathetic sprouting in the periphery may contribute to the development and persistence of sympathetically-maintained pain in animal models of neuropathic pain. The purpose of this thesis was to examine morphological changes in the cutaneous innervation in rats after chronic constriction injury (CCI) to the sciatic nerve. More specifically, this study addresses the question of whether sympathetic fibres sprout de novo into the upper dermis of the rat hindpaw skin after CCI of the sciatic nerve. We also determined changes in peptidergic sensory innervation following CCI. At several periods post-injury, hind paw skin was harvested and processed using a monoclonal antibody against dopamine-beta-hydroxylase to detect sympathetic fibres and a polyclonal antibody against calcitonin gene-related peptide to identify peptidergic sensory fibres. We observed migration and branching of sympathetic fibres into the upper dermis of the hind paw skin, from where they were normally absent. This migration was first detected at 2 weeks, peaked at 4 to 6 weeks and lasted for at least 20 weeks post-lesion. At 8 weeks post-lesion, there was a dramatic increase in the density of peptidergic fibres in the upper dermis. Quantification revealed that densities of peptidergic fibres 8 weeks post-lesion were significantly above levels of sham animals. Interestingly, the ectopic sympathetic fibres did not innervate blood vessels but formed a novel association and wrapped around sprouted peptidergic nociceptive fibres. Our data show a long-term sympathetic and sensory innervation change in the rat hind paw skin after the chronic constriction injury. This novel fibre arrangement after nerve lesion may play an important role in the development and persistence of sympathetically-maintained neuropathic pain after partial nerve lesions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930c2480.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m3587</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Peripheral Nerves -- injuries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sciatic Nerve -- injuries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adrenergic Fibers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akp78gm62x"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The development of sensitization to amphetamine : a possible involvement of netrin-1 receptors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yetnikoff, Leora</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Repeated exposure to amphetamine (AMPH) induces sensitization to its behavioral-activating effects. The development of sensitization depends on (1) the direct actions of AMPH in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the cell body region of the mesocorticolimbic DA system, and (2) AMPH-induced glutamatergic neurotransmission in this region. Moreover, sensitization is accompanied by morphological changes in mesocorticolimbic DA circuitry. During development, the DA system is organized, at least in part, by the netrin-1 family of guidance cues. Both netrin-1 and its DCC and UNC-5 receptors continue to be expressed in the mesocorticolimbic DA system of the adult brain. Importantly, netrin-1 receptor deficient mice do not develop sensitization to AMPH, implicating an involvement of netrin-1 signaling in AMPH-induced plasticity of the DA system. To explore this possibility, adult rats were pretreated with repeated AMPH or saline, and DCC and UNC-5 receptor expression was examined in DA cell body and terminal regions using western blot. Striking AMPH-induced increases in the expression of DCC and UNC-5 were observed in the VTA only. Remarkably, these changes depended on NMDA-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission. This is the first demonstration that repeated AMPH pretreatment regulates netrin-1 receptor expression in the adult brain and suggests that netrin-1 receptor regulation may be involved in the development of AMPH-induced sensitization.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763c08n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gm62x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amphetamine-Related Disorders -- etiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, Cell Surface</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wp45w"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Determination of the stability boundary for thermonuclear burning at the surface of an accreting neutron star</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Niquette, Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neutron stars in mass-transferring binaries accrete hydrogen and helium rich matter from their companions. Unstable nuclear burning of this matter results in Type I X-ray bursts every few hours to days. Theoretical models propose three regimes of unstable burning on neutron star surfaces and also define the critical accretion rate above which the neutron star burns fuel stably without bursting. Currently, the theoretical value for this stability boundary is comparable to the Eddington limit whereas the observational limit is estimated to 0.3 m˙Edd. In this dissertation, we examine the boundary between stable and unstable thermonuclear burning at the surface of an accreting neutron star for a range of initial compositions. We compute different steady-state equilibrium models and use them to conduct a linear perturbation analysis. The main results of this analysis are plots of the critical accretion rates as a function of the initial helium mass fraction which were never produced before.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612s85q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wp45w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>X-ray bursts</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neutron stars</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801pm40w"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of East Asian Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A westerner's journey in Japan : an analysis of Edward S.

In the vast majority of cases, this X-linked disorder is due to a CGG expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the fmr-1 gene and the resulting decreased expression of its associated protein, FMRP (Fragile X associated Mental Retardation Protein). FXS is characterized by a number of cognitive, behavioural, anatomical, and biological abnormalities. This monogenic disorder provides a unique opportunity to study the consequence of a mutation in a single gene on the development and proper functioning of the CNS. Histological work on FMRP expression in the monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has revealed differential staining in the magnocellular and parvocellular layers, with increased expression in the magnocellular layers (Kogan, Boutet, Cornish, Zangenehpour, &amp; Mullen, 2004). In individuals with fragile X, this differential expression pattern is correlated at the behavioural level with impairments in the M but not the P-visual pathway processing. These findings by Kogan and colleagues, led to the hypothesis that brain regions that express high levels of FMRP are particularly susceptible to its reduced expression, as occurs in FXS. It was therefore of interest to extend this work to determine the pattern of FMRP expression throughout the monkey brain, with the aim of identifying the brain structures most susceptible to reduced expression of the fmr-1 gene product. The current focus on the role of FMRP in RNA translation and neuronal maturation makes it timely to assemble the extant information on how reduced expression of the fmr-1 gene leads to neuronal dysmorphology. The first section of this manuscript offers a summary of recent genetic, neuroanatomical, and behavioural studies of fragile X syndrome, and provides potential mechanisms to account for the pleiotropic phenotype of this disorder. The following section presents a detailed account of the FMRP expression profile in the monkey brain, and reveals the striking correlation between the expression of the protein and behavioural deficits associated with its reduced expression, as occurs in FXS. The last chapter of this manuscript offers insight into future trends in FXS research. A number of electrophysiological and behavioural studies point to a particular involvement of the metabotropic glutamatergic system in FXS, with a preeminent role for metabotropic glutamate receptor type V (mGluR5). The involvement of this receptor in FXS and the potential therapeutic implications of pharmacological regulation of this receptor will be discussed. There is a body of work pointing to the remarkable behavioural similarities between FXS and autism. While FXS is a single-gene disorder, autism is associated with a number of genes, which have not yet been precisely identified. The final section of this manuscript delineates the neuroanatomical, behavioural, and linguistic overlap, as well as the differences between the two conditions. Finally, this section affords some insight as to how FXS, a single-gene disorder, may assist us in our understanding of autism.

One d old male broilers were fed a basal corn-soybean meal diet (CTL, 1.2 % AR and 40 IU VE), the basal diet supplemented with 1% AR and either 200 IU VE (AE group), or 500 mg of VC (AC group), or a combination of VE and VC (AEC group) at the same level per kg of feed. Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded in clinically healthy anesthetized birds (28-42 d old) before and after an epinephrine challenge (EPI, 0.5 mg/kg BW i.v.), Amino-guanidine Hemisulphate (AG, 100 mg/kg BW i.v.) and N-Nitro L-Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME 50 mg/kg BW, i.v.) at 20 min intervals. The PAP increased 30 s after EPI in all birds, but the peak PAP was lower in the AEC group than in all the other birds. After 120 s of challenge the PAP was lower in AEC birds compared to the other birds. The PAP returned to pre-EPI levels within 300 s in all groups. The PAP was increased ( P&lt; 0.05) within 60 s after the AG and L-NAME challenge in all groups, but no differences were found among groups. Plasma nitric oxide (NO) was higher in the AEC birds than in all the other groups before and after challenge. Our results showed that birds fed AEC maintained a lower PAP than the CTL birds after EPI elicited an increase in cardiac output and this can be explained by a higher production of NO. A combination of AR, VE, and VC may have complementary effects against oxidative stress, protecting the endothelium and preserving NO function.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qv14r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85ng433</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vitamin C in animal nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Broilers (Chickens) -- Cardiovascular system</dc:subject><dc:subject>Broilers (Chickens) -- Diseases -- Chemotherapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vitamin E in animal nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arginine</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ascites -- Chemotherapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahq37vs81h"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mathematical and computational tools for the manipulation of musical cyclic rhythms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khoury, Imad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents and analyzes tools and experiments that aim at achieving multiple yet related goals in the exploration and manipulation of musical cyclic rhythms.

We find that the lower order modes do not depend on B while the higher order modes do when the field strength is low or extremely high.

To any finite domain D and any constraint language Γ (a finite set of relations over D), we associate the constraint satisfaction problem CSP(Γ): an instance of CSP(Γ) consists of a list of variables x1, x2,..., x n and a list of constraints of the form "(x 7, x2,..., x5) ∈ R" for some relation R in Γ. The goal is to determine whether the variables can be assigned values in D such that all constraints are simultaneously satisfied. The computational complexity of CSP(Γ) is entirely determined by the structure of the constraint language Γ and, thus, one wishes to identify classes of Γ such that CSP(Γ) belongs to a particular complexity class. In recent years, logical and algebraic perspectives have been particularly successful in classifying CSPs. A major weapon in the arsenal of the logical perspective is the database-theory-inspired logic programming language called Datalog. A Datalog program can be used to solve a restricted class of CSPs by either accepting or rejecting a (suitably encoded) set of input constraints. Inspired by Dalmau's work on linear Datalog and Reingold's breakthrough that undirected graph connectivity is in logarithmic space, we use a new restriction of Datalog called symmetric Datalog to identify a class of CSPs solvable in logarithmic space. We establish that expressibility in symmetric Datalog is equivalent to expressibility in a specific restriction of second order logic called Symmetric Restricted Krom Monotone SNP that has already received attention for its close relationship with logarithmic space. We also give a combinatorial description of a large class of CSPs lying in L by showing that they are definable in symmetric Datalog. The main result of this thesis is that directed st-connectivity and a closely related CSP cannot be defined in symmetric Datalog. Because undirected st-connectivity can be defined in symmetric Datalog, this result also sheds new light on the computational differences between the undirected and directed st-connectivity problems.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cz51n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322j95m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Logic programming languages</dc:subject><dc:subject>Constraints (Artificial intelligence)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Constraint programming (Computer science)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj6731828m"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the inotropic effect of insulin and glucose : a new diet for the ischemic heart?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Carvalho, George</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present project investigated the effect of glucose, high dose insulin and normoglycemia (GIN) therapy in patients undergoing coronary revascularization surgery.

In particular, DRN serotonin (5-HT) neurons are thought to be implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD) as are steroid hormones. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to assess the effects of some neurosteroids on DRN neurons in non-anaesthetized rats. Initially, we examined electrophysiological properties of dorsal raphe cells across the sleep---wake cycle in non-anaethetized rats. In this first study we characterized six distinct neuronal populations in the DRN based on spike waveform and firing pattern. We then examined the effects of DHEA-S and testosterone (T) on the firing properties of DRN neuronal populations previously characterized. We observed that most populations exhibited an initial decrease in firing activity following one week of treatment.

With three or more sources, dependence between sources may be modelled using log-linear models. We propose a Coefficient of Incremental Dependence Criterion (CIDC) for selecting an estimate of population size among all possible estimates that result from hierarchical log-linear models. A penalty for the number of parameters in the model was selected via simulation for the three-source and four-source settings. The performance of the proposed criterion was compared to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) through simulation. The CIDC was found to modestly outperform the AIC for data generated from a population size of approximately 100, with AIC performing consistently better for larger population sizes. Modifications to the criterion such as incorporating the estimated population size and the type of source interaction present should be investigated, along with the mathematical properties of the CIDC.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913v01n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cz52x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Epidemiology -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epidemiology -- Statistical methods</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bn64c"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Native title law as 'recognition space'? : an analysis of indigenous claimant engagement with law's demands</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Phillips, Jacqueline, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis engages in a critique of the concept of Australian native title law as a 'recognition space'. It doing so, it treats native title law as a form of identity politics, the courts a forum in which claims for the recognition of identity are made. An overview of multicultural theories of recognition exposes what is signified by the use of recognition discourse and situates this rhetoric in political and theoretical context. A critique of native title recognition discourse is then developed by reference to the insights of sociolegal scholarship, critical theory, critical anthropology and legal pluralism. These critiques suggest that legal recognition is affective and effective. This thesis highlights native title law's false assumptions as to cultural coherence and subject stasis by exploring law's demands and indigenous claimant engagement with these demands. In this analysis, law's constitutive effect is emphasized. However, a radical constructivist approach is eschewed, subject engagement explored and agency located in the limits of law's constitutive power. The effects of legal recognition discourse, its productive and enabling aspects, are considered best understood by reference to Butler's notion of provisional 'performativity'. Ultimately, claimant 'victories' of resistance and subversion are considered not insignificant, but are defined as temporary and symbolic by virtue of the structural context in which they occur.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk833.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bn64c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Native title (Australia)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multiculturalism -- Australia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak0698c976"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Health &amp; safety rights and transnational liability for harm</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Philo, John C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Safety and health is a basic human need and when not met, exacts costs that prevent societies from realizing development goals. Injury is increasing as a leading cause of death and disability. As the result of advances in public health knowledge and safety engineering technology, accidents and other injury events are often preventable. Injuries result from identifiable determinants and conditions that create exposure to identifiable hazards. By controlling hazards, the toll of injury can be reduced. International trade and investment can create conditions that increase or diminish the global injury burden. International institutions and national governments face the question of how to protect safety and health rights and reduce the injury burden in a world of increasingly global business activity. International institutions do not yet provide comprehensive regulation for exported harms. In common law nations, liability through formal law plays an important role in regulating conditions that can lead to injury. In such nations, private law can play an important role in filling segments of the regulatory gap relating to exported harms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903423t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698c976</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>International business enterprises -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Personal injuries -- Prevention</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liability (Law)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784q648"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An emerging international criminal law tradition : gaps in applicable law and transnational common laws</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Perrin, Benjamin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis critically examines the origins and development of international criminal lave to identify the defining features of this emerging legal tradition. It critically evaluates the experimental approach taken in Article 21 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which attempts to codify an untested normative super-structure to guide this legal tradition. International criminal law is a hybrid tradition which seeks legitimacy and answers to difficult questions by drawing on other established legal traditions. Its development at the confluence of public international law, international humanitarian law, international human rights law and national criminal laws has resulted in gaps in difficult cases with no clear answers. These lacunae have been filled by recourse to judicial discretion, exercised consistent with Patrick Glenn's theory of transnational common laws, and by privileging one of the competing aims of international criminal law: enhancing humanitarian protection versus maximizing fairness to the accused.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354k51n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784q648</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>International offenses</dc:subject><dc:subject>International Criminal Court</dc:subject><dc:subject>International criminal courts</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atd96k666p"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Legal framework for Japan to facilitate private space activities</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sakamoto, Saeko</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explores a viable domestic legal framework for Japanese private space activities. Ideally, Japanese space legislation would govern private entities in a way that promotes commercialization while also fulfilling international obligations, doing both with an especial focus on commercial launch activities. First, I analyze current Japanese space law and space policies and continue by identifying Japan's problems in this arena. Next, I present research regarding other countries' space legislation solutions and examine how other nations' regulations do or do not solve problems similar to Japan's. Then, I assess the applicability of the foreign countries' approaches to Japan's situation. Finally, I propose ideas for a new legal structure for space activities in Japan and discuss possible implementation. I do so within the context of existing space policy problems that Japan must first tackle in order to successfully develop and enforce such new laws in the future.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dr36d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k666p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Space law -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Space law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cv86c"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Clinical epidemiology of mono-pyrazinamide-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yee, Daphne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Rationale. In Quebec, 6.2% of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) isolates from Canadian-born patients are resistant to pyrazinamide alone (mono-PZA-R). Over 90% of mono-PZA-R isolates in Quebec have been characterized by a specific and unique mutation in the pncA gene. The unusually high prevalence of mono-PZA-R disease and its associated mutational profile in Quebec provided an exceptional opportunity to study the epidemiologic and clinical significance of mono-PZA-resistance in patients with active TB. Methods. 67 patients with mono-PZA-R TB diagnosed between 1 Jan 1990 and 31 Dec 2000 were compared to 211 randomly selected patients with pan-sensitive (Pan-S) isolates diagnosed within the same time period. Demographic, laboratory, and clinical information pertaining to patients diagnosed with TB from the provincial database of Maladies a declarations obligatoires (MADO) were linked to drug resistance profiles derived from the provincial laboratory. Data from MADO were supplemented by other clinical information abstracted from chart review, the provincial drug insurance database, and the provincial registry for Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccination. Results. There were no statistically significant differences in demographics or clinical characteristics between patients infected with mono-PZA-R compared to Pan-S strains. Among patients with mono-PZA-R TB, 51 (76%) were cured, 3 (4%) relapsed, and 13 (19%) died within 6 months of diagnosis. In comparison, for subjects with Pan-S TB, 181 (86%) were cured, 2 (1%) relapsed, 2 (1%) failed treatment, and 26 (12%) died within 6 months of diagnosis. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, mono-PZA-R was associated with decreased odds of successful clinical outcomes compared with Pan-S TB (OR=0.38, 95% CI = 0.18-0.81). Conclusion. PZA-resistance had a clinically significant impact on outcome of TB disease.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qp06j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cv86c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Epidemiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q858g"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The modulatory role of morning and afternoon basal cortisol levels on neural activation changes in healthy young males performing an n-back working memory task : an exploratory fMRI study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wuethrich, Stephanie Nadya</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Human cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cortisol, the human stress hormone. In the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the different cortisol characteristics are neither controlled nor accounted for. This study will aim to investigate, by means of functional MRI, the effects of morning and afternoon cortisol levels on neural activation changes in response to a working memory task in young males. We hypothesized a significant difference between morning and afternoon subjects' cortisol levels and neural activation patterns in relation to the task. Nineteen young males were recruited, 9 for the morning group and 10 for the afternoon group. Cortisol levels, neuronal activation, and behavioural measurements (correct percentage of hits and reaction time) were assessed during the task. Six saliva samples were taken during the experiment at various time intervals. As expected, morning cortisol levels were higher than afternoon cortisol levels. Results indicate that the afternoon group had significantly slower reaction time on the frontal task compared to the morning group, whilst the percentage of correct hits did not differ. Furthermore, we observed an increased range of neural activation in the morning group compared to the afternoon group. This study demonstrates the impact of time of day of testing (i.e. different cortical levels) on neural activation in functional MRI experiments. It is important for investigators using this technique to be aware of and control for this variable.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593v063k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q858g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qv151"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>L'influence de l'évolution du gouvernment d'enterprise sur les dirigeants des sociétés : essai de droit comparé (France et Angleterre)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abi Chacra, Charbel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The essence of running an enterprise which is defined as a system by which the companies are lead and compared is generally set in priority terms.

Difference in cortisol levels did not differ between the children who scored at opposite extremes of the inhibited-noninhibited score. On the other hand, specific differences between inhibited and non-inhibited children were observed in heart rate patterns. The measure moderately predicted increased internalizing behaviour in inhibited children, however, in combination with maternal depression, had much stronger predictive power. In summary, our inhibition measure appears to be an efficient means of assessing inhibition that predicts risk factors of childhood behavioural problems.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t337r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w650t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Developmental</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666904w"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pancreatic cancer : a developmental quest</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shehata, Fady Fouad Amin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pancreatic cancer is considered the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in Canada and one of the most fatal diseases in the world. Its definite underlying cause is still unidentified, and its actual cell of origin remains unclear. Unfortunately, most of the current research on the pancreas is focused on one disease only, namely diabetes with much less consideration for other pancreatic diseases. Diabetes has been extensively studied from a developmental aspect, and continues to attract the interest of numerous researchers. On the contrary, few accomplishments have been done to decode the developmental errors occurring in pancreatic cancer. It is therefore necessary to allocate more research resources to address this disease from a developmental aspect. This study provides a literature review of the pancreas concerning its anatomy and function, transcription factors and signaling pathways controlling its development, and the role of these signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer. The review provides distinct emphasis on three important aspects. First, a review of pancreas development is provided, with a focus on different transcription factors and signaling pathways involved in this process. Second, it addresses how the signaling pathways which play a role in pancreas development are the same signaling pathways that play a role in pancreatic cancer, additional emphasis is placed on describing the genetic alterations occurring in pancreatic cancer. Third, a methodology of approaching pancreatic cancer research from a developmental aspect is presented. Using an example of one gene, Anterior gradient 2 (Agr2), is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer in ductal cells only, and might play a role in ductal cell development of the pancreas. Thus, the main objective of this review is to provide a developmental framework for the analysis of pancreatic cancer.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dh657.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666904w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3197xq843"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fenretinide's preventive effect on the development of osteoprosis in Cystic Fibrosis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Saeed, Zienab Sahar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease affecting the Caucasian population. This devastating disease is caused by any one of 1500 mutations identified in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator Conductance (cftr) gene. Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of CF and it affects all systems including respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive and skeletal. Although the exact molecular link between the CFTR dysfunction and various phenotypes remains to be delineated, many phenotypes seem to be linked to inadequate nutritional absorption of essential fatty acids and vitamins, which leads to an imbalance between the essential fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA). The skeletal system does not only serve as mechanical support, but also functions as an active organ that regulates balance and interactions between both local and systemic hormones, cytokines and prostaglandins. Previously our laboratory has shown that fenretinide [ N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide] corrects the essential fatty acid imbalance. We hypothesized that correcting the DHA/AA ratio in the plasma of Cftr-KO mice could avoid the early-onset osteoporosis. This thesis presents our novel results describing how fenretinide prevents osteoporosis. We found that twice a week treatment with fenretinide over a period of four weeks dramatically increased trabecular bone volume and quality in Cftr-KO mice. The results of this thesis strongly suggest that fenretinide might have potential for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients by preventing the reduction of trabecular bone mineral density.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r747b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xq843</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j531s"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Neural correlates of high and low self-esteem : structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Scherling, Carole S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Self-esteem is defined as: i Previous research has linked self-esteem to many factors (life-satisfaction, health, stress); however its origins, manifestations, and thus neural correlates are largely unexplored. This thesis includes two independent neuroimaging studies investigating central nervous system variables possibly linked to self-esteem. The first study investigated hippocampal volume variations in relation to parental bonding and self-esteem. A trend was observed between the left hippocampus and retrospective mother care (smaller volumes = lesser care). The second study used fMRI to explore the differential neural correlates of high/low self-esteem when performing a social acceptance or rejection task. Here, differences in neural reward-pathways could be revealed between high and low self-esteem, suggesting an impact of self-esteem on the neural processing of social evaluation. In conclusion, these studies provide evidence that self-esteem has strong neural correlates. This adds to previous research showing that this is a trait that is determined early in life and is self-perpetuating.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4308965.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j531s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Psychobiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Physiological</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
