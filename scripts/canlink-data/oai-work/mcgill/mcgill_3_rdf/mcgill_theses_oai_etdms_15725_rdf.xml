N.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Values of the tritium concentration in precipitation collected at Ottawa in 1961 fluctuate by as much as a factor of 3 from one measurement to the next a few days later. The first attempt to determine what meteorological factors could be responsible for these fluctuations was to sort the storms for April and May 1961 into two categories; those predominantly continuous and those predominantly showery precipitation, using both constant altitude radar pictures and hourly precipitation records. There was a slight tendency for the higher tritium concentrations to occur in continuous precipitation. Height/time diagrams showing the positions of the various airmasses over Ottawa revealed that the highest tritium concentrations occurred when maritime arctic air extended from the ground to the tropopause. On occasions with mA air at the ground and other airmasses above it, the measured tritium concentration was approximately proportional to the depth of mA air traversed by the precipitation. The lowest tritium concentration was measured in a storm wholly contained in mT air. Air mass trajectories confirmed that the higher concentrations were measured in precipitation which had fallen through air of arctic origin with an arctic trajectory than through air of tropical origin.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gunn, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wn90h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zx797</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Meteorology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fq44g"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of St. Lawrence lowland shales</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dean, Ronald.

With a few minor exceptions, no previous work of this type had ever been undertaken within this region. It has been found that differences in shale mineralogy, as determined by X-ray diffraction procedures, could be directly related to variations in tectonic activity of the Canadian Shield and the land mass of Vermontia, the two principal source areas from which the clastic sediments of the St. Lawrence Lowland were derived.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clark, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gx25k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fq44g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah702q977c"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics and Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The supply of money in Canada 1867-1961</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Melto, Dennis.

In this thesis I plan to stay very close to the standard, orthodox definition of money. Money will be defined here as any commodity generally used as a means of settling economic obligations. This thesis will focus, therefore, on the means-of-payment function of money with the further stipulation that it must be generally acceptable. What money is in an economy will depend very much on practice, that is, on what people are willing to accept as a means of making settlements. The other functions of money, such as its unit-of-account, store-of-value, and means-of-making-deferred-payments functions will be assumed to be present simply because any means of payment which did not contain these functions would not be generally acceptable for long.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Weldon, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pv15d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q977c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics and Political Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arb68xg37c"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Anatole France et l’histoire</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Gardony, Juliette.

According to Roha, this type of polymerization is not regarded as distinctly cationic, anionic, or covalent, but rather as embodying these classical concepts to different degrees, in accordance with the coordinating influence of the catalyst. The four main steps that may operate in vinyl-type polymerization are initiation, propagation, chain transfer, and termination.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395wc101.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z9033565</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720h469"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Metabolism of the isolated surviving guinea pig heart</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Davis, Eldred.

Car, pour lui, son roman n’est qu'une histoire qu'il raconte aux autres après l'avoir en quelque sorte vécue lui-même.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reverchon, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk11v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h5164</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>French</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj4308167"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Treatment of outlying observations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cockayne, Ernest. J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The subject of statistics is concerned with making decisions or inferences about a given population from a representative sample of the population. Whenever data has been collected for such a purpose, it may be necessary or desirable to subject it to a critical examination to decide whether or not the sample is representative of the population in question so that any conclusions will be valid. The results of such an inspection may lead one to suspect the consistency of the sample, to feel that certain observations have been subject to abnormal errors of some kind and thus that the data, as it stands, does not truly represent the population. When such doubts exist, the following choice of procedures comes to mind.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guttman, I.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752m430.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj4308167</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sk78b"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Barrières reproductives chez les Gryllides (Gryllus Linnaeus, et teleogryllus chopard) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cochaux, Pierre.

Ceux-ci font partie du genre Gryllus,  pris dans un sens large. Le genre Gryllis a fait l'objet d 1une récente révision due à Chopard (1961). Cet auteur a reclassé les espèces de ce groupe en neuf genres, en se basant principalement sur des  caractéristiques morphologiques de 1’appareil copulateur male.[…] Le présent travail a pour objectif de contribuer, par l'étude de certaines particularités biologiques et par des croisements de laboratoire, au développement d’une meilleure  compréhension non seulement de la systématique des grillons mais aussi d’apporter certains  éléments de réponse sur les causes mêmes qui ont p1 ou qui peuvent encore orienter l’évolution et la spéciation de ce groupe.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kevan, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d351t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sk78b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teleogryllus</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gryllus</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92gb83k"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Infrared heating due to ozone</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Clark, John.

Satisfactory results are obtained at the bottom and top of the ozone layer while, at intermediate heights, the Approximation is not so successful. An explanation of this pattern is obtained by a crude application of criteria suggested by Plass (1960). With routine calculations made feasible by the use of the Approximation, the affect on heating rates of the distribution of ozone and temperature is investigated. The former appears as the more critical of the two parameters. A chart constructed for the graphical determination of flux divergence or heating rate is presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hitschfeld, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322j25x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92gb83k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Meteorology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sk79m"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics and Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Quebec general election of 1962</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Citrin, Jacob</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study of the Quebec general election of 1962 is undertaken in the conviction that "elections are of fundamental importance in any democratic society, constituting almost the only occasions when the power of the citizen is brought to b ear directly and formally upon his rulers.” General elections, in a democracy, decide who is to rule and on what terms; every general election, therefore, is a potential turning point in national history. For this reason, if for no other, psephology is an important part of political science. Elections have been analyzed in several ways, the researcher's choice of method depending upon his interests and purposes. This thesis is modeled upon the Nuffield College monographs on British general elections.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Frankel, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395wc119.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sk79m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics and Political Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j452b"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Investigation into certain implication-negation fragments of propositional logic</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chung, Lung-ock</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this paper, we study the completeness property of some implication-negation fragments of propositional logics. By the phrase implication-negation fragment of a propositional logic, we understand the system consisting of all the theses which have implication and/or negation as their sole connectives in the said logic. This means, that we have to find a means to isolate, so to speak, all these theses and then axiomatize the resultant system. Our method of proof is by constructing a Gentzen type Sequenzen Kalkul which is strong enough to embrace all theses in the said logic. Since, Sequenzen Kalkul has a constructive character, every connective, once introduced, will remain in later sequents of the derivation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McCall, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r463c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j452b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abk128f55j"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of exercise and diet on the nitrogen status of several tissues in young adult rats</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Christensen, David.

The rats in one replicate bad been exercised intermittently prior to this test while those in two other replicates had no previous exercise. It was round that exercise imposed during this test, and the lowest protein diet both resulted in reduced serum albumin-globulin ratios. Rats exercised in this test, if exercised previously, bad greatly increased DNA, RNA, and total nitrogen in their gastrocnamius muscles. This increase did not occur in rats exercised only in this test. In addition, it was found that liver DNA was increased in rats that bad previously undergone intermittent exercise. Liver nitrogen decreased as dietary protein level decreased. The amounts of' RNA and nitrogen per unit DNA in skin samples decreased following prolonged intermittent exercise, but were not affected by dietary protein level.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Crampton, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462879d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128f55j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nutrition</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
