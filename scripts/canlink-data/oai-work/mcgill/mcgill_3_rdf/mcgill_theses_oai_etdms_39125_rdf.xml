Previous research in non-Aboriginal populations has established that GDM and macrosomia are associated with increased risk of fetal morbidity. Specifically, GDM is a risk factor for infant macrosomia, hypoglycemia, polycythemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Furthermore, macrosomia is an independent risk factor for shoulder dystocia, clavicular fracture, brachial plexus injury, birth asphyxia and operative delivery. The main objectives of this study were to determine prevalence rates of GDM and macrosomia related neonatal complications for the James Bay Cree population of northern Quebec, and to identify risk factors for specific birth trauma injuries and metabolic complications in the population. The prevalence of macrosomia (≥4500 g) was 10.4%, and the estimated prevalence of GDM was 16.6% (95% CI 14.6-18.6) (n = 229/1379). Shoulder dystocia was the most common birth trauma event among the Cree, affecting 2.5% (n = 42/1650) of all Cree births, and 9.3% (n = 16/172) of macrosomic deliveries ≥4500 g. The prevalence of neonatal hypoglycemia was also high, affecting 8.8% (n = 144/1650) of all Cree newborns, and 18.1% (n = 34/192) of GDM deliveries. Macrosomia (BW ≥ 4500 g) was a significant risk factor for shoulder dystocia, clavicular fracture, hypoglycemia, and caesarean section delivery. After adjusting for maternal age, parity, and gestational age, GDM was identified as a significant risk factor for macrosomia (≥4500 g), hypoglycemia, polycythemia, and hypocalcemia. In summary, this study identified a high incidence of neonatal complications among the James Bay Cree compared with rates in the general North American population. These outcomes can be explained, in part, by high prevalence rates of gestational diabetes and infant macrosomia.

The influence of various environmental conditions was studied with regards to the influence on Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to resist mechanical shear. Further investigation was performed in order to locate a structure within the yeast cell that contributes to mechanical shear resistance. It was found that yeast cells grown anaerobically in limited glucose media were more prone to losses in cell viability than cells grown aerobically in the same media, when subjected to mechanical shear. Cells grown anaerobically in high glucose concentrations and allowed to ferment the media to exhaustion were slightly more resistant to mechanical shear compared to cells grown anaerobically without fermentation in minimal glucose media. Higher ethanol concentrations lead to marginally decreased resistance to mechanical shear. Cell walls of S. cerevisiae were partially digested or extracted using enzymatic treatment or chemical attack. It was found that while the outer mannoprotein layer does not contribute significantly, the inner beta-(1 → 3)-glucan structure plays a significant role in resistance to mechanical shear.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sheppard, John</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b061j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wf58b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Yeast -- Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fungal cell walls -- Mechanical properties</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shear (Mechanics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Cytology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53wx62w"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Transposons and the evolutionary relationships among modern rice species</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Turcotte, Kime</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A high-resolution computer-based survey for transposable elements performed on 910 Kb of rice genomic DNA sequences revealed the presence of both class I and class II transposable elements.

Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITES) are clearly the predominant type of transposable element in the rice sequences examined. Phylogenetic analysis of the putative transposases of several transposable elements indicated that Tourist-like miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITES) are closely related to the bacterial insertion sequence 5 (IS5) family of transposable elements, while Emigrant-like and Stowaway-like MITES are both related to members of the IS630/TcI/mariner superfamily of elements. Finally, the nucleotide sequences of MITES, Ac-like, Mutator-like elements (MULE), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and other unclassified elements, as well as their insertion polymorphism data have been used to reconstruct the relationships between rice species in the AA genome.

With time, improvements in spatial, spectral and temporal resolution have been made and generated a resurgence of remote sensing popularity. Combined with agricultural systems modelling, remote sensing data such as weather radar measurements can help to obtain an accurate tool in real-time for agricultural decision-makers. Indeed, precipitation and relative humidity (RH) could become available for the agricultural decision-makers using the McGill Doppler S-band radar. At present, precipitation measurements are available with a spatial resolution of 1 km up to a range of 240 km and RH data could be available with a resolution of a few kilometres up to a range of 40 km. Both weather variables could be available with a time scale of 5 min if requested. These measurements would compensate for the actual lack of a dense weather station network prevailing in southern Quebec. So far, the reliability of weather radar measurements has been tested by the scientific community for precipitation data but has never been tested for the RH data. In this study, a comparison between RH measured at three weather stations and RH calculated from weather radar measurements was made using consecutive time interval of 240 hours in 1997 and 336 hours in 1998. A valid t-test designed for simple linear regression analysis with two time series as dependent and explanatory variable, and based on the first-difference ratios (FDR) of the time series clearly showed that RH calculated from radar measurements is comparable to the one measured at weather stations. Thereafter, the possibility of integrating weather radar measurements (precipitation and RH) in a geographic information system (GIS) to map the variability of a crop disease was verified. Results indicated the potential of weather radar measurements in agriculture.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zawadzki, Isztar</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q332m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579v036</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cercospora -- Québec (Province) -- Forecasting</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carrots -- Diseases and pests -- Québec (Province) -- Forecasting</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geographic information systems -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Radar meteorology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aws859h41w"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Enriched mantle component(s) in proterozoic continental flood basalts of the Cape Smith foldbelt, northern Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Modeland, Sheldon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Cape Smith foldbelt is one of Earth's best exposed Proterozoic mobile belts and provides a natural laboratory for the study of Proterozoic mafic magmatism. Magmatism associated with circa 2.04 Ga rifting of the Superior Province resulted in the formation of tholeiitic and alkaline basalts as well as minor rhyolites, collectively known as the Povungnituk Group. Despite their continental setting, the tholeiites are not typical continental-flood basalts in that they lack significant negative Nb and Ta anomalies relative to light rare earth elements and primitive mantle, thus indicating that crustal contamination did not play a major role in their evolution. Although crystal fractionation along a gabbroic cotectic can account for much of the variation in trace-element concentrations, this process cannot explain the wide range of observed incompatible trace-element ratios within the Povungnituk Group. Despite their continental setting, the Povungnituk Group lavas exhibit a range of incompatible trace-element contents similar to that from tholeitic to highly alkaline lavas in modern ocean-island-basalt suites, such as Hawaii, the dominant relatively depleted lavas of the Povungnituk Group are most similar to the basalts of oceanic-plateau suites, and the upper lava flows of some continental flood-basalt suites.

The ability of RGSs to inhibit SSTR5 signaling was further assessed in cells expressing modified Gpa1 proteins. Yeast have also been shown to be a useful model organism for the study of the localization of mammalian RGS proteins.

Despite extensive controversy surrounding the existence of these "nanobacteria", the possibility exists that these microorganisms might be involved in pathological calcification such as kidney stones. Using a combined morphological and biochemical approach, we have investigated further the formation of these mineralized structures in incubated serum. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis, high-resolution lattice imaging, and freeze-fracturing techniques were used to demonstrate at the ultrastructural level the crystalline nature and composition of these structures. Additional studies were performed to elucidate the relationship of nanoforms with mineralizing bone cell cultures. The formation of HA in incubated serum represents an otherwise unknown calcification process that offers a unique opportunity to study mineralization under laboratory conditions. In addition, information gained from understanding this process might be useful for bone tissue engineering where mineralization is desirable within synthetic bone substitutes, and within which mineral-binding bioactive factors may also be incorporated.

The software packages are designed to gather stock data over the Internet, and process the gathered data to determine an approximate correlation (A-correlation) between a reference stock and a set of comparison stocks. In this thesis, the A-correlation is obtained from historical stock data using data mining techniques. The data mining techniques include a data retrieval and analysis algorithm. First, a large pool of stock data is retrieved from the CNBC web site by employing an Internet data retrieval algorithm. Then an analysis algorithm is applied to determine the A-correlation between a reference stock and each of a set of the comparison stocks. The analysis algorithm is based on the accumulation of individual stock movements (up/down) over a period of time. We have designed and implemented the two programs using Microsoft Excel/VBA. The two programs share common functionalities such as providing the A-correlation as a function of time, ranking the A-correlation results in a predefined order, and allowing the user to spot possible A-correlation trends. The difference between the two programs is that the first program analyses A-correlation with no time delay and the second program deals with the time delayed A-correlation. Each program can be useful in revealing different aspects of the relationships between stocks. These two programs can be useful tools for stock market analysis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Newborn, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p8882.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193b726</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Information Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economics, Finance</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296x085h"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Measles and Vitamin A : mechanisms of action</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fox, Stephanie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Measles virus (MV) infects an estimated 30 million individuals each year, leading to ~880,000 deaths. The mechanisms that underlie both MV-associated immunosuppression and the dramatic benefit of vitamin A remain poorly understood. Vitamin A supplements are also important for the eradication of vitamin A deficiency, which is implicated in the death of ~1 million children each year, due to blindness and severe infections. In recent years, there has been increasing pressure to include vitamin A supplements in "universal" childhood vaccination programs in the developing world (e.g.: EPI). In this thesis, three studies dealing with the relationship between measles virus, vitamin A and the immune system are presented. First, the induction of PBMC apoptosis by MV is described and correlated with viral output and proliferation of these cells. In the second study, the results from a large trial of vitamin A supplementation at the time of MV vaccination are presented. Finally, as part of ongoing studies into the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of vitamin A supplementation in MV infections, changes in the retinoid (vitamin A) signaling cascade during MV infection of a monocytic cell line (U937) were measured.

SST modulates neurotransmission, and acts as a inhibitory regulator of cell secretion and proliferation. These actions are mediated by a family of G protein coupled receptors with five distinct receptor subtypes termed SSTR1-5. Another putative role of SST is the neuroprotective action it exhibits in in vitro models of neurodegeneration. To determine whether SST extends its alleged neuroprotective role to other models of neurotoxicity, we have characterized the effect of another potent neurotoxin, beta-amyeloid peptide (Abeta)25--35, on SST production in primary rat cortical neuronal cultures. Furthermore, we attempted to determine the mechanism through which SST mediates its neuroprotective effect against Abeta-induced toxicity by using SSTR-subtype selective analogs as well as SSTR antisense oligonucleotides. Cell viability was assayed after treatment with SSTR agonists and Abeta 40muM for 24 hours.

Experiments were conducted using sand of mean particle size 507 mum. Water was injected into the sand through a tube of semicircular cross-section (internal diameter 0.55 cm) located at the wall of the tank, forming a half jet. At sufficiently high flowrate a U-shaped fluidized region formed around the jet tube. The fluidized zone was characterized by measuring scour depth, diameter of the fluidized region at the jet insertion depth and diameter of the fluidized region at half the jet insertion depth. For a fixed jet insertion depth, increasing the jet velocity increased the scour depth, the diameter of the fluidized region at the jet insertion depth, and the diameter at half the jet insertion depth. For a fixed jet velocity, the scour depth was independent of the insertion depth, however the two diameters of the fluidized region decreased with increasing jet insertion depth. The profiles obtained for inclined jets were more asymmetric than those for vertical jets. The effectiveness of the 'up-flow washing' technique for the removal of a water-soluble contaminant (CuSO4) from a saturated bed of sand was investigated for a vertical jet at jet velocities of 213 cm/s and 320 cm/s and jet insertion depths of 5.5 cm and 7.5 cm. Up-flow washing removed the contaminant from the sand bed. The cleaned region extended well beyond the boundary of the fluidized region as jet liquid leaked from the fluidized region and percolated through the fixed bed region. An approximate model for the leakage suggested that 10--20% of the jet liquid leaked from the fluidized region to the fixed bed region.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Weber, Martin E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zj56r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tb240</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Environmental</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g9203"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Object-oriented modeling of the dynamics of space systems with reaction wheels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Misra, Sarthak</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Analysis of the attitude dynamics of a spacecraft is necessary for its successful operation.

In this thesis, an effort has been made to develop objects that can be combined to formulate the complete dynamic equations of a spacecraft containing reaction wheels. In order to generate the mathematical model and dynamical equations of the multibody system, a variation of the Lagrange's method has been used, along with the concept of Natural Orthogonal Complement, in order to eliminate the kinematic constraint force and moments. The designed objects would be part of a multibody system software package that could simulate the complex dynamics of a spacecraft containing reaction wheels and any arbitrary configuration of connected bodies. The objects have been designed such that the spin rate of the wheels may be specified as a constant nominal rate, or as any function of time, or in the form of a P.I.D. control law, wherein the wheel spin rate is a function of the body quaternion of the motherbody. The accuracy, versatility, and adaptability of the designed objects have been illustrated with numerous examples and compared with results obtained using standard procedure. Maneuvers have also been simulated on the designed model and compared with available spacecraft data in order to substantiate the authenticity of the designed objects.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Misra, Arun K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945s66z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g9203</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hr47d"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Packet loss concealment for voice transmission over IP networks</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mahfuz, Ejaz</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Voice-over-IP (VoIP) uses packetized transmission of speech over the Internet (IP network). However, at the receiving end, packets are missing due to network delay, network congestion (jitter) and network errors. This packet loss degrades the quality of speech at the receiving end of a voice transmission system in an IP network. Since the voice transmission is a real-time process, the receiver cannot request for retransmission of the missing packets. Concealment algorithms, either transmitter or receiver based, are used to replace these lost packets. The packet loss concealment (PLC) techniques described in the standards ANSI TI.521 (Annex B) and ITU-T Rec. G.711 (Appendix I), have good performance, but these algorithms do not use subsequent packets for reconstruction. Furthermore, there are discontinuities between the reconstructed and the subsequent packets, especially at the transitions from voiced to unvoiced and phoneme to phoneme. The goal of this work is to develop an improved PLC algorithm, using the subsequent packet information when available. For this, we use the Time-Scale Modification (TSM) technique based on Waveform Similarity Over-Lap Add (WSOLA) to reconstruct the dropped or lost packets. The algorithm looks ahead for subsequent packets. If these packets are not available for reconstruction, algorithm uses information from past packets. Subjective tests show that the proposed method improves the reconstructed speech quality significantly.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3334190.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr47d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903177h"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Design and characterization of MEMS micromirror devices</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lin, Julianna E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explores the design, implementation and characterization of MEMS micromirror devices for use in optical systems. Possible applications for these devices include areas such as adaptive optics, beam scanning, and optical switches. The devices were fabricated using a commercial MEMS foundry process, known as the Multi-User MEMS Processes (MUMPs) foundry service; the resulting prototypes were characterized using a phase-shifting Mirau interferometer, assembled specifically for this work. From these results, it was shown that the MUMPs process can be used to create satisfactory designs for rotational micromirrors with tilt angles in the range of 0--23 mrad and control voltages in the range of 0--30 V In addition, the behaviour of these mirrors were shown to fall within 5% of the predicted values calculated by the theoretical models for the devices.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kirk, Andrew G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773x50g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903177h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21th246"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A top-down approach to delta-sigma modulator design</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chandra, Naveen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work presents the use of a new design methodology for the creation of analog integrated circuit components featuring optimization with Matlab and Simulink. This procedure allows circuit design to take place at the highest level of abstraction, and has the added advantage that designs can be implemented with currently used, and widely available tools. It results in building block requirements being specified prior to the undertaking of transistor level simulations, thereby saving much valued design time. Also presented are the issues behind the design of an audio-band, single bit switched capacitor delta-sigma modulator with 16 bits of performance. This begins with the filtering function design, continues with the realization in a low voltage standard CMOS process, and concludes with experimental measurements to gauge performance. The creation of the modulator was carried out using the proposed top-down design methodology, and its experimental performance is used to help validate the procedure. In addition, the design and fabrication of a multibit DeltaSigma modulator including a novel internal DAC was carried out. The multibit DAC is based on encoding DC levels into digital PDM bitstreams, which are then decoded by a single analog filter. The use of a single filtering path reduces mismatch effects in the DAC. The functionality, performance, and limitations are explored by examining the experimental results of a 2.5 V, audio-band, 2nd order, 3-bit DeltaSigma modulator in a 0.25 mum CMOS process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roberts, Gordon W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dt92n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21th246</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w155d"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Log-domain filtering : disk-drive applications and distortion analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abdul Baki, Rola</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis proposes a seventh-order 0.05° equiripple linear-phase continuous-time filter employing, for the first time, instantaneous companding. The filter was designed and integrated in a mature bipolar process. The amount of boost (up to 13dB) and group-delay adjustment (+/-30%) are digitally programmable. The DC gain is controllable up to 10dB, and the -3dB frequency (fc) is tunable from 5 to 70MHz. The output swing for 1% THD is higher than 100mVpp, with a 1.5V supply. The filter consumes very low power (5--13mW for fc = 70MHz), compared to state-of-the-art implementations (e.g. 120mW for fc = 100MHz [1]). An approach to estimate the distortion in log-domain filters is also presented. The models used for the bipolar transistors include the C pi and Csub parasitic capacitors, the beta effect, and the parasitic emitter resistances. Simple closed-form expressions describing the effect of each nonideality on distortion are derived and compared to simulations. A general method, which could be extended to analyze higher order filters, based on Volterra series, is used.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>El-Gamal, Mourad N.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r284q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w155d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63sx692"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dynamic clock management circuits for low power applications</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brynjolfson, Ian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Low power methods employing dynamically controlled clock rates offer potentially powerful energy saving capabilities. Dynamic clock management is a system level technique that benefits from the relationship between operating frequency and power consumption through the variation of clock speeds based on demand. This thesis provides robust and scalable clock management circuits for dynamic clock control. A complete Programmable Clock Manager (PCM) has been designed, implemented, integrated into a Systems-on-a-Chip and tested. The PCM incorporates two novel circuits who enable dynamic clock management, the Range Shifting Phase-Locked Loop (RSPLL) and the Dynamic Programmable Clock Divider (DPCD). The self-calibrating RSPLL extends operating bandwidth while reducing jitter. Such a Phase-Locked Loop design also provides easier system-level integration and range-independent usage. The design is scalable to the higher bandwidths and lower voltages, associated with future technologies. The DPCD is capable of dynamic clock division without exhibiting glitches. Both of these robust circuits are easier to use for all clock managment purposes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zilic, Zeljko</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px834.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sx692</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kj165"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Heat transfer augmentation by modification of impingement flow region for planar and non-planar target surfaces</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bi, Zhi Yuan, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Heat transfer enhancement under a single semi-confined turbulent slot jet for planar and non-planar surfaces was studied experimentally by modification of flow region using several configurations of nozzles and turbulence generators (turbulators).

For planar surfaces the insertion of turbulence generators in the jet flow was also examined to see their effect on the impingement heat transfer.

These can only originate from the Inuit themselves: those attending and employed in Adult Education Centres in Nunavik, graduates of both vocational and academic adult education programs, Elders, local education committee members, directors of Northern educational institutions and community leaders. This study examined values in Inuit adult education of one Inuit community's educational and community representatives and students, and how these educational needs may be met so as to respect Inuit traditions. In this qualitative study, research methods included: filmed interviews, surveys and open-ended questionnaires, field notes, and participant observation. It was found that the Inuit are in effect finding themselves between two cultures and two education systems. There is a gap in knowledge between the Inuit vision of education and the non-Inuit vision of education. It was concluded that there is a perceived need to integrate the teaching of traditional Inuit skills and knowledge with contemporary curricula: to unite both into a curriculum that embraces the advantages of both traditions and cultures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>White, Boyd</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603r031k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr48p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Inuit -- Education (Continuing education) -- Nunavik (Québec)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abr86b5165"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Racial diversity's journey to constancy : initiatives for redressing the colour imbalance in documentary filmaking at the National Film Board of Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mak, Monica</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explores the National Film Board's Cultural Diversity in Action Initiatives (1997-- ) whose aim is to redress the under-representation of filmmakers of colour in the English Program's documentary film production streams.

Specifically, do second language learners of English use the same Dual Mechanism Model that Prasada and Pinker (1993) have argued is a universally applicable model, or does the Connectionist Model of language processing better explain L2 learning and language processing? The participants in this study were students in a Montreal area CEGEP. The instrument used to gather data was the Prasada and Pinker pseudo-verb list, with modifications suggested by Lee (1994) to create a revised list. Participants were asked to create past tense forms of pseudo verbs. In addition to this task, four participants were asked to do a simultaneous verbal think aloud, orally explaining their responses to the stimulus presented in the study. The results of the studies indicate that English second language learners used both a rule based mechanism and an associative mechanism in the formation of both regular and irregular English verbs. This result provides support for the claims of the Connectionist model of past tense formation of English verbs, but also supports some of the claims of the Dual Mechanism Model. There are possible implications for the teaching and learning of English as a Second Language (ESL). This study also raises further research questions involving rule vs. associative learning in the teaching and learning of language.
