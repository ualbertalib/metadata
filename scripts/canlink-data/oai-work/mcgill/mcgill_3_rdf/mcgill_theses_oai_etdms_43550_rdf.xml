Le fédéralisme d'ouverture symbolisait une approche nouvelle et constructive du rapport entre Québec et Ottawa, qui a dégénéré de manière notable depuis les années soixante. Étant donné l'importance des enjeux de l'unité nationale et des relations intergouvernementales en politique québécoise, il est raisonnable de croire que cette promesse électorale à poussé un certain nombre de Québécois à appuyer le parti Conservateur en 2006. En utilisant les données de l'Étude électorale canadienne et de l'Observatoire sur les médias et les politiques publiques, il est démontré que la proposition de fédéralisme d'ouverture a influencé le vote des Québécois en faveur du parti Conservateur, par-delà l'effet d'autres facteurs importants tel que le scandale des commandites, les valeurs conservatrices et le vote stratégique.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to establish whether or not Open Federalism contributed to the rise in the Conservative party's vote share in Quebec in the 2006 Canadian federal election. Open Federalism represented a fresh, constructive approach to Quebec-Ottawa relations, which had soured considerably since the 1960s. Given the importance of national unity and intergovernmental relations in Quebec politics, there is reason to believe that this campaign proposal motivated many Quebecers to support the Conservatives in 2006. Using data from the Canadian Election Study and the Observatory on Media and Public Policy, this study provides empirical tests of the effects of Open Federalism on voting behaviour in Quebec. It is demonstrated that the proposal did in fact contribute to the Conservative vote share among Quebecers, even once other relevant factors such as the sponsorship scandal, conservative values, and strategic voting are taken into account.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eric Belanger</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wj81x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bb94r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science - General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623d11b"><ual:graduationDate>2010</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and iron status in infants of gestational diabetic mothers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Virasith, Helene</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and iron are important nutrients for infants and are hypothesized to be compromised in infants of diabetic mothers (IDM).

Analyses of covariance between AA, DHA and iron revealed that AA in infants was positively correlated with iron status overall, but this was not the case for DHA.

Diaphragm  muscle dysfunction and ventilatory pump failure are well documented phenomena in  animal models of sepsis. However, the primary cellular mechanisms underlying  respiratory muscle dysfunction in sepsis are poorly understood. In addition, most  investigations of respiratory muscle dysfunction in sepsis have been performed in  models involving high doses of bacterial endotoxin and these investigations have  been criticized on the basis of questionable relevance to human sepsis. Therefore,  the objective in the first study of this thesis was to study respiratory muscle  dysfunction in a more clinically relevant animal model, namely, the Pseudomonas  aeruginosa pulmonary infection model. Remote inflammatory processes in different  diseases, such as cancer, arthritis, sepsis, and cystic fibrosis are known to  contribute to muscle wasting and weakness through more widespread systemic effects.  In keeping with the above notion, we hypothesized that sustained P. aeruginosa lung  infection would cause diaphragmatic and limb muscle weakness. In this thesis, we  demonstrate for the first time that persistent pulmonary infection with P.  aeruginosa induces significant dose- and time-dependent contractile dysfunction of  the diaphragm. By comparison, prototypical slow- and fast-twitch hindlimb muscles  were not influenced by pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection. Because skeletal muscles can express a variety of immune  modulating molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and major  histocompatibility molecules, the objective of the second study in this thesis was  to study the possible role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in diaphragm muscle  dysfunction in our animal model. Our results indicate for the first time that  intra-diaphragmatic pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression (TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha,  IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-18) is highly up-regulated in infected animals and the  magnitude of such upregulation is dependent upon the dose of P. aeruginosa lung  infection. Parallel to the absence of muscle contractile dysfunction in hindlimb  muscle under the same conditions, P. aeruginosa infection did not alter the levels  of pro-inflammatory gene expression within the hindlimb muscle. To further address  the involvement of muscle-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines in diaphragmatic  contractile dysfunction, we have employed recombinant adenovirus (Ad) as a vehicle  for systemic delivery of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, in order to shift the  balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines within the diaphragm toward a  more anti-inflammatory profile. We report here that systemic delivery of Ad-IL-10  suppresses pro-inflammatory gene expression and improves force generating capacity  of the diaphragm in P. aeruginosa infected animals. This finding emphasizes the role  of anti-inflammatory cytokines as beneficial immune modulators in respiratory muscle  failure caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines. P. aeruginosa lung infection is a major cause of morbidity and  mortality among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and many patients with CF have weak  peripheral and respiratory muscles. Although the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines  has been extensively studied within the lungs of CF patients, the involvement of  these cytokines in skeletal muscle dysfunction in animal models of CF or in human CF  patients has not been studied. Therefore, in the third study of this thesis we have  used mice sharing the same genetic defect as CF patients (Cftr knockout mice), in  combination with our model of P. aeruginosa lung infection, to address several  fundamental questions related to muscle function in CF. Our first objective in this  portion of the thesis was to determine if diaphragmatic skeletal muscle cells  express the CFTR mRNA. Our second objective was to ascertain whether intrinsic  differences between CF and wild-type muscle cells could be detected in vitro, which  might differentially affect the regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators in the  setting of infection/inflammation. Our third objective was to evaluate possible  differences in the ability of respiratory muscles to generate force prior to and  after P. aeruginosa lung infection in Cftr knockout mice, as compared to their  wild-type littermates. Finally, we aimed to determine if the absence of CFTR  expression would predispose to muscle dysfunction triggered by up-regulation of  intra-diaphragmatic pro-inflammatory gene expression. Our major results indicate  that: First, in vitro stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha,  IL-1alpha, and IFN-gamma) and LPS (extracted from Pseudomonas aeruginosa) triggered  increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (iNOS, RANTES, MIP-1alpha,  MIP-1beta, MIP-2 and KC) in both Cftr -/- and wild-type diaphragmatic myotubes, but  the magnitude of cytokine/chemokine upregulation was significantly greater in CF  than in wild-type diaphragm muscle cells. Sec In the final study of this thesis, we sought to test the  hypothesis that increased diaphragm muscle activation would lead to increased  production of intra-diaphragmatic cytokine expression, since this could possibly  explain the greater susceptibility of the diaphragm to express pro-inflammatory  cytokines in response to pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection as compared with the  hindlimb muscle. To test this hypothesis, we subjected rats to inspiratory resistive  loading (IRL), corresponding to 45-50% of the maximum inspiratory pressure, and  described that mRNA levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and to a lesser extent, IL-4, IL-10,  TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma were all significantly increased in a time-dependent  fashion in the diaphragm but not hindlimb muscle (gastrocnemius) of loaded animals.  In addition, elevated protein levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 in response to loading  were confirmed with immunoblotting and immunostaining. We also detected significant  IL-6 protein to be localized inside diaphragmatic muscle fibers of loaded animals.  We conclude that increased diaphragm muscle activity during resistive loading  induces upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the diaphragm,  which could also provide an explanation for the greater cytokine expression observed  in the diaphragms of animals with P. aeruginosa lung infection.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t240j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074v60w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988k359"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The sequential insertion of carbon monoxide and imines into nickel-carbon [sigma]-bonds : synthesis, reactivity and multi-component couplings</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Davis, Jason L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The development of new methods of generating alpha-amino acid  derivatives via multi-component reactions remains an important challenge. The  primary goal of this study is to develop new transition metal-mediated routes to  synthesize these alpha-amino acid derivatives using combinations of simple reagents,  such as imines, carbon monoxide, acid chlorides and organotin reagents. The proposed  approach requires the sequential insertion of imine and carbon monoxide into late  transition-metal sigma-bonds, as well as the further reactivity of the  products. In chapter 2, the ability of the nickel complex L2Ni(CH  3)N(R)=C(H)R'+X- (L2 = chelating nitrogen ligands, X- = non-coordinating  counteranion) to mediate the insertion of imines is examined. Although  L2Ni(CH3)N(R)=C(H)R' +X- does not undergo direct imine insertion into the Ni-CH3  bond, the addition of CO leads to the generation of the novel nickel complex  (L2)Ni[n2-CH(R')NRCOCH 3]+X- via the insertion of imine into the nickel-acyl bond of  L2Ni(COCH3)N(R)=C(H)R' +X-. This demonstrates as proof of concept, that these nickel  complexes can mediate the sequential insertion of CO and imine into nickel-methyl  bonds, in direct analogy to well known CO/olefin insertions. Further reactivity  studies have demonstrated that the amide bound nickel chelates generated via the  sequential insertion of CO and imines are generally inert towards subsequent  migratory insertion with CO, imine and olefins (Chapter 3). These complexes are also  inert towards auxiliary ligand exchange or amide de-chelation, with both mono- and  bidenate nitrogen and phosphine ligands. Studies involving the use of imines and alkenes as  interchangeable insertion substrates, (Chapter 4) resulted in the first example of a  metal mediated cyclocarbonylation incorporating imine as a formal insertion  substrate. Based on these studies, one-pot sequential insertion cascade of CO,  olefin, a second unit of CO, and imine was developed for the synthesis of 5 and 6  membered lactams. In addition, the competitive insertion propensity of imines and  alpha-olefins was examined, and clear steric and electronic effects were  identified. The isoelectronic palladium-bound amide complexes, generated via  the oxidative addition of N-acyl iminium salts (R(H)C=N(R')COR") to Pd2(dba)  3·CHCl3 can undergo a Stille-tye coupling with organotin reagents to  generate alpha-substituted amide derivatives (Chapter 5). This reactivity was  extended into a convenient and general one-pot synthesis of alpha-substituted amides  and N-protected amines by a palladium-catalyzed three-component coupling of imines,  acid chlorides or chloroformates, and organotin reagents. Mechanistically, this  process provides an oxidative addition/reductive elimination-based alternative to  nucleophilic approaches to C-C bond formation with imines, in which the imines are  activated towards addition to palladium by RCOCl.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zn89n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988k359</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Inorganic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fc05k"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cellular biomechanics investigated by atomic force microscopy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Smith, Benjamin A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Living biological cells are highly complex, multifunctional  systems whose physical attributes are relatively unknown. Critical functions  involving plasticity of cell morphology, connectivity and response to stimuli are  proposed to be fundamentally related to the micromechanical character and the  ability of the cell to exert directed mechanical signaling. Unique abilities of  atomic force microscopy in measuring cellular viscoelastic properties (on length  scales from nanometers to microns) are explored with specific applications to (1)  airway smooth muscle cells and (2) hippocampal neurons. Surface indentation  techniques for stiffness mapping, as well as quantitative measurements of  frequency-dependent complex rheology are featured. Structural and molecular  determinants of dynamic mechanical behavior are identified. In smooth muscle cells,  an isotropic fiber network provides strong resistance to deformation. Actin  polymerization is largely responsible for stiffening following contractile  activation, not myosin cross-bridge formation as expected. On neuronal dendrites,  stiffness contrast correlates with known distributions and stability of cytoskeletal  elements: microtubules along the shafts and dynamic actin in the spines  (micron-sized surface protrusions). Focus is given to dendritic spines as the  post-synaptic contact sites for most excitatory transmission between neurons. Large  heterogeneity is observed in spine mechanical properties, but stiffer spines appear  to be associated with axon-like contacts. Spines may stiffen in response to synaptic  stimulation, in agreement with recent observations of actin-based stabilization of  spine shape (reduced motility) following excitatory treatments. Remarkably, the frequency dependence of the complex shear moduli  (0.5-100 Hz indentations) of both cellular systems is described well by the same  rheological model: that of soft glassy materials existing just above the glass  transition. The central feature of this model is that storage ( G') and loss moduli  (G") scale in parallel as a weak power-law function of frequency. Power-law  exponents (alpha), measured to be of the order 0.1, are related to the level of  molecular agitations in the cell and determine the degree of solid-like (G' &gt;&gt;  G" with a glass transition at alpha = 0) or fluid-like behavior (G'  &lt;&lt; G" with alpha = 1 for a pure fluid). The soft glassy  hypothesis is founded on the concepts of disorder and metastability of structural  elements. A Newtonian viscosity (pure fluid) component is also identified with  significant effects for high frequency deformations. Together these properties are  critical for describing cellular remodeling: contraction in smooth muscle cells or  synaptic plasticity at dendritic spines.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053g52q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc05k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117p363"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Growth and dynamics of polyelectrolyte multilayer thin films</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Smith, Rashida</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Polyelectrolyte multilayer thin films adsorbed onto colloidal  particles have been studied by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  spectroscopy in order to characterize the dynamic properties of the film components.  In addition, the growth of the multilayer films was observed directly for the first  time and quantification of the amount of polyelectrolyte adsorbed during each step  was achieved. NMR relaxation measurements demonstrate that the polyions are more  mobile when incorporated into a multilayer film than when in the bulk complex. The  polycation, poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) was found to exhibit  greater mobility than the polyanion, poly(styrene-4-sulfonate) (PSS), becoming  increasingly less mobile as layers were added to the multilayer assembly.  Solid-state deuterium NMR further demonstrates the limited mobility of the PSS chain  when incorporated into a multilayer film. No significant motion is observed on the  kHz timescale under ambient conditions for PSS in a strong-strong polyelectrolyte  film. However, a small mobile fraction, the result of loops and tails or chain ends  is present when the multilayer films are exposed to humidity and salt  solutions. The behavior of the adsorbed water within this multilayer system  was found to be dependent on the nature of the terminating layer. The changes in  water mobility represent changes in the environment throughout the entire film,  while the observed changes in the polymer dynamics are associated only with the  surface layer. Additionally the water is found to be more closely associated with  the polyanion, associating with the polycation only when it is the terminating  layer. The behavior of the water for films comprised of a weak-strong  polyelectrolyte combination are similar to that of the strong-strong multilayer  system, when films are assembled with the polyions having high charge density. An  increase in polyelectrolyte mobility is observed when the polyanion is the  terminating layer in the poly(allylamine hydrochloride)  (PAH)/poly(styrene-4-sulfonate) system, the reverse of what is observed in the  strong-strong system. These differences are due to the differences in intrinsic  mobility between the polyions within the multilayer film. Finally multilayer films of PAH/PSS were prepared on alumina  membranes and both the flux and selectivity could be controlled over a wide range,  simply by varying the pH of the layer assembly and pH of the filtrate solution.  Membranes assembled at pH 3 and pH 9 have water flux values which are dependent on  the solution pH, while membranes assembled at pH 7 have constant flux regardless of  filtrate solution pH. The selectivity for PAH/PSS modified membranes for dye  molecules in pH 7 solutions was found to be the greatest and was the result of a  combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of the polyelectrolyte  chains at this pH value.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612p101.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117p363</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Physical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arx913q376"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Peer talk : children with specific language impairment in dyadic and group interactions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pesco, Diane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research for this dissertation focused on how children with  Specific Language Impairment (SLI) use language in their interactions with peers.  The study had three broad objectives: (1) to ascertain patterns of language use by  the children with SLI in different contexts, (2) to evaluate the relationship of  those patterns to difficulties in peer interaction reported in the literature, and  (3) to explore the ramifications of groups composed uniquely of children with SLI  for peer talk and peer interaction. The participants were several children (mean age 4 years, 10  months) enrolled in a preschool language program designed specifically for children  with SLI. These children were observed in a number of contexts over a period of  several weeks. The children with SLI were first observed in dyadic play with  different conversational partners. Initiating and responding, communicative acts,  and communication breakdowns were examined. Dyads composed of two children with SLI  were more successful in some aspects of conversation, while mixed dyads, composed of  one child with SLI and one with TLD, were more successful in others. The  conversational behaviours of the children with SLI were, however, generally quite  similar to their peers with TLD. The same children with SLI were observed during recess and  during free play in their classroom. There were no significant differences in  interactional patterns across the two group play contexts. In both contexts, the  children with SLI spent significantly more time in interactive activity than in  solitary activity, and most of that interaction was verbal. They tended, even during  recess when other interlocutors were available, to talk and interact among  themselves, and there was evidence of stable friendships within the SLI  group. Snack, circle time, and pretend play sequences were also  observed. A schema for the analysis of children's discourse was piloted. The  analysis showed that the children with SLI used language for a variety of  instrumental and interactional purposes, and did so in ways that were consistent  with those reported in the literature for children with TLD. The combined results indicated pragmatic strengths and  successful peer interaction in this group of children with SLI. These results can be  explained by characteristics of the children and of the program in which they were  enrolled.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h4851.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913q376</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Speech Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m707h"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Running out of place : the language and architecture of Lewis Carroll</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dionne, Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines the links between architecture and  literature through the work of English author/mathematician/geometrician Lewis  Carroll/Charles L. Dodgson. The premise is that throughout Carroll's work, questions  concerning the position of the body in relation to its surroundings---the  possibility for one to forge a sense of place---are recurrent. Carroll stages a  series of bodily movements in space: changes in scale, transformations, alterations,  translations from bottom to top, from left to right, from the inside to the outside,  and so on. Reading the work, one is constantly reminded that one's perception of  space, as well as one's understanding of where one stands, are phenomena that take  place in language, through utterances, through words. Approaching Carroll's work  with particular attention to the space of bodily movements and to plays on language,  one can access a subterranean architectural discourse. This discourse is oblique,  suggested rather than explicit, but nonetheless raises pertinent questions  concerning the formation of architectural meaning: the relationship of sense to its  limits---to nonsense---in architecture. The following texts are studied: Carroll's two architectural  pamphlets; the two Alice stories with their convoluted spaces; a long epic poem  dealing with the space of discovery; a drama on geometry and a logical exposition on  the paradoxes of movement. Throughout Carroll's multifaceted work, nonsense guides  the construction of the texts. Working at the limits of language and literary  genres, Carroll's parodies possess strong allegorical powers: sense travels  obliquely and the work remains enigmatic. However, the reader somehow understands  the work; the experience of the work produces a certain kind of  knowledge. In architecture, meaning is also tied to its outer limits---to  the polysemy of nonsense.

I argue that  ethnoarchaeology meets its epistemic raison d'etre by achieving theoretical  independence from archaeology's general theories. Independence is  "built-in" to ethnoarchaeological study by focusing explicitly on the way  material culture is used in daily practice; in particular, by re-embedding material  culture in the "modern" contexts where it is used. Ceramic exchange in the  Inland Niger Delta can not be understood apart from either the exchange and  consumption of other industrial household vessels or the political economies women  experience within patrilineal households. Household vessels are distinctly women's  tools in the Delta and their consumption is an intimate part of the way women resist  exploitation and the appropriation of their wealth within household political  economies. The different roles vessels play are manifest in the distances these  objects travel during consumption and are also materialized by their location within  house compounds. Enamel vessels are used in displays of social and economic capital  related to marriage that insulate women from exploitation; aluminum vessels are  expensive items bought as part of marriage trousseaus; and plastics are relatively  low value items given as small gifts or bought in local markets to insulate small  amounts of wealth from appropriation. Pottery is relatively marginal within  household economies; yet, potters rely on the income ceramic production creates.  Thus, potters use extensive marketing strategies to sell their wares to a relatively  disinterested clientele in order to meet their own obligations within patrilineal  households and to buy the other types of household vessels that they desire.

Phytoplankton have adapted  to persist in these environments by reducing their requirements for iron (Fe) in key  metabolic pathways, in some cases by replacing Fe-containing catalysts with their  iron-free functional equivalents. This thesis examines the requirements and  biochemical roles for copper (Cu) and manganese (Mn) in Fe-limited centric marine  diatoms. A major finding of my research is that diatoms have elevated requirements  for Mn and Cu when grown in Fe-deficient seawater. Iron deficiency induces oxidative  stress and increases the cellular concentrations of toxic oxygen radicals and damage  products in Thalassiosira pseudonana. The increased Mn-requirement is used, in part,  to activate Mn-containing isoforms of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase.  Cultures co-limited by Fe and Mn exhibit high levels of oxidative stress and an  inefficient detoxification pathway that further reduces cell growth. Diatoms  isolated from the metal poor open ocean require more Cu to divide than related  species from metal-rich coastal waters. This pattern is in stark contrast to all  other known nutritive trace metals. One part of the diatom Cu requirement that is  independent of provenance is for efficient Fe transport. The additional Cu  requirement of oceanic species appears to be due to the constitutive expression of a  Cu-containing electron transport protein, possibly plastocyanin. Coastal species,  which have higher Fe-requirements for growth, retain the Fe-containing functional  homologue cytochrome c6. By employing metals other than Fe within photosynthesis and  antioxidant pathways, marine diatoms are able to increase their fitness in  Fe-deficient environments. However, Mn and Cu also occur in low concentrations in  the open ocean and thus may co-limit growth of natural populations of phytoplankton.

A high-pressure sliding  plate rheometer in which the shear rate, temperature, pressure, and CO2  concentration are uniform, was used in the present study. The effects of CO2 and  pressure on the viscosity, stress growth function, and creep compliance of a high  density polyethylene (HDPE) were determined. To separate the effects of pressure and  CO2, samples were first pressurized without CO 2, and then pressurized and saturated  with CO2. It was possible to use shift factors for pressure and CO2 concentration to  obtain a master curve. For the purpose of comparison, the effect of nitrogen on the  viscosity is also determine. Another important concern in plastics processing is  molecular structure, which has a strong effect on melt flow properties.

RPA participation in these pathways is  mediated by single-stranded DNA binding and protein interactions. We have identified  a novel RPA protein interactor, Replication Protein Binding Trans-Activator (RBT1),  in a yeast two-hybrid assay employing the second subunit of human RPA (RPA32) as  bait. RBT1-RPA32 binding was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and  co-immunoprecipitation. Fluorescence microscopy indicates that over-expressed green  fluorescence protein-tagged RBT1 is localized to the nucleus in vivo. RBT1 mRNA  expression, determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, is significantly higher in  cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75, SaOS-2 and H661, compared to normal non-immortalized  human mammary and bronchial epithelial cells. Further, yeast and mammalian  one-hybrid analysis shows that RBT1 is a strong transcriptional co-activator.  Interestingly, mammalian transactivation data are indicative of significant variance  between cell lines; the GAL4-RBT1 fusion protein has significantly higher  transcriptional activity in human cancer cells compared to human normal primary  non-immortalized epithelial cells. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably overexpressing  RBT1 meet several criteria of transformed cells, including lack of contact growth  inhibition, growth of colonies in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice; HCT116  colon carcinoma cells overexpressing RBT1 exhibit an enhanced growth rate in culture  and form extremely aggressive tumors in vivo. BLAST analysis of the human genome localizes RBT1 to chromosome  19g13.1-q13.2 adjacent to the coding region for TRIP-Br1/p34SEI-1 in a region  characterized by frequent amplification in ovarian carcinomas. Further analysis of  amino acid homology places RBT1 in the TRIP-Br protein family consisting of at least  four members (RBT1, TRIP-Br1 (p34SEI-1), TRIP-Br2, and HEPP (cdca4)). While not much  is known about this protein family, TRIP-Br1 has been found to interact with the  cyclin-dependent kinase, cdk4, and modulates E2F transcriptional activity (Hsu et  al., 2001). In vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation assays suggest that RBT1  interacts with at least cdk1, cdk2 and cdk4, and modulates E2F1 transcriptional  activity indicative of one possible mechanism by which higher levels of RBT1 can  both promote and enhance tumorigenesis. We propose that RBT1 is a novel transcriptional co-activator  that interacts with several important cellular proteins including RPA and cdk4, and  that RBT1 may promote tumorigenesis when its protein product is over-expressed.  Enhancement of E2F1 transcriptional activity by overexpressing RBT1 suggests that  this novel protein has implications on cell cycle regulation and  progression.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375w79d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d4742</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25x911g"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The compartmentalization of folate metabolism in mammalian cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Patel, Harshila</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Folate metabolism is compartmentalized between the cytoplasm and  the mitochondria of mammalian cells. Certain folate-dependent enzymes are present in  both of these compartments, such as methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenases, which  are required to interconvert one-carbon substituted tetra hydrofolates. In the  cytoplasm, there is a trifunctional NADP-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate  dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase-synthetase (DCS). Its mitochondrial counterpart is a  bifunctional NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase  (NMDMC), expressed during embryogenesis and in immortalized cells. A comparison of  the 3' untranslated region of the NMDMC cDNA with the synthetase domain of the DCS  cDNA and gene among different species have revealed significant regions of homology.  This suggests that the mammalian mitochondrial NAD-dependent DC evolved from an  NADP-dependent DCS precursor through a change in cofactor specificity of the  dehydrogenase from NADP to NAD. Although the folate pathways are compartmentalized, the  mitochondrial folate pathway makes an important contribution to total cellular  folate metabolism. Mouse fibroblasts that have a completely inactivated NMDMC gene  are glycine auxotrophs. Furthermore, growth of these Nmdmc-/- cell lines is  stimulated by supplementation with formate or hypoxanthine. These cell lines also  show enhanced incorporation of radioactivity into DNA from formate as compared to  serine, demonstrating that formate is a preferred one-carbon donor for the Nmdmc-/-  cell lines. This indicates that NMDMC is required for optimal purine biosynthesis  during periods of rapid cellular proliferation such as embryogenesis and  tumorigenesis. The rescue of these Nmdmc-/- cell lines with NMDMC expression  reversed the glycine auxotrophy and the formate to serine incorporation ratio  reverted toward the wild type ratio. The rescue of these Nmdmc-/- cell lines with  the NAD-dependent monofunctional dehydrogenase activity also reversed the glycine  auxotrophy but these cell lines did not grow as well as the NMDMC-rescued cell  lines. This indicates that although the cyclohydrolase activity is not required in  the mitochondria, the rate of 10-formyl-THF production is not optimal in its  absence. Furthermore, when these Nmdmc-/- cell lines were rescued with the  expression of the NADP-dependent DCS in the mitochondria there was reversal of the  glycine auxotrophy as well, indicating that the NAD cofactor specificity of the  mitochondrial methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase is not absolutely essential to  maintain the flux of one-carbon metabolites.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795819f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x911g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45q944h"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification and characterization of two novel spliced forms of Synaptotagmin I from the nervous system of Aplysia californica</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nakhost, Arash</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Synaptotagmin I (Syt I) is thought to act as the calcium sensor  during regulated exocytosis. We have discovered two novel splice forms of Syt I in  the nervous system of Aplysia californica. In the first one, an alternative exon  entry site adds two amino acids, V and Q, to the juxtamembrane region that separates  the transmembrane domain from the first C2 domain. This splicing event is conserved  over the evolution. Overexpression of this form, called Syt IVQ, blocked the ability  of serotonin (5-HT) to reverse synaptic depression, while overexpression of Syt I  did not. This effect was specific to the reversal of depression as there was no  effect on the ability of 5-HT to facilitate non-depressed synapses. The reversal of  depression is mediated by PKC and Syt I is a putative PKC substrate. In vitro  phosphorylation studies showed that PKC phosphorylates both Syt I and Syt IVQ  isoforms on a conserved residue in the juxtamembrane segment. Phorbol ester-induced  synaptic recovery from depression was not affected by overexpression of Syt I  isoforms, suggesting that the effect of Syt I VQ is upstream to the activation of  PKC. These results suggest a novel role for the juxtamembrane domain of Syt  I. The second Syt I splice form is the result of an alternative  exon usage in the second C2 domain (Syt I C2B-beta). This alternative exon is also  found in C. elegans but is not present in either Drosophila or vertebrates. All of  the known important amino acids in the C2B domain are conserved in this spliced  form. Syt I C2B-beta shows greater stability in the absence of calcium and increased  ability to undergo calcium independent homo-dimerization than other Syt I isoforms.  However, there does not appear to be a difference in the calcium affinity of these  isoforms. We have mapped this change in C2B properties to a single amino acid  residue (T358). We have also cloned SNAP 25 in Aplysia and show that Syt I C2B-beta  binds it with a higher affinity than Syt I C2B-alpha. Together these results suggest  that this splicing changes the structure of the C2B domain and subsequently may  affect its function.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g3210.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45q944h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A00000051g"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Language, identity, and integration : immigrant youth 'made in Quebec'</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Allen, Dawn, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explores the relationships between the integration  experiences of adolescent newcomers in one francophone secondary school in Montreal  and the current policies and programs related to educational integration. The  research draws on observations and participants' descriptions and insights to  address three principal questions: How is integration experienced by adolescent  newcomers in a francophone school in Montreal? How do these students' experiences  inform our understanding of the relationships among host (second) language  learning/teaching, integration, and identity construction? What are the implications  of these newcomer students' integration experiences for educational theories,  policies and programs/practices that target such newcomers? These questions emerge  from a consideration of theories of identity construction current in a variety of  disciplines. The study offers an overview of Quebec's past and present  immigration and integration policies and programs. It considers those policies in  light of identity theory and, more specifically, focuses on the relationships  between language learning, integration, and identity in the experience of adolescent  immigrants within a francophone secondary school in Montreal. Based on interviews  and participant observation conducted over 15 months, the study describes the ways  in which the participants' integration and identity are shaped by school discourses  and the standardizing imperative of most North American educational institutions.  Findings suggest that the participants resist the school's discourses in order to  assert themselves dialogically and relocate their sense of identity in their host  society. However, the dialogic relationships that the students are able to establish  with and within the school discourses are imbalanced, leaving several students to  feel dislocated both physically and psychically throughout the study. The study  indicates that a distributed notion of the Self might improve theory, policy, and  pedagogy related to newcomer integration. Finally, specific suggestions are made for  building on current educational-integration research and practice.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831ck49w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000051g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Immigrants -- Education (Secondary) -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ethnicity -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>School integration -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zt836"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Magnetic polarisation of palladium in palladiumiron multilayers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cheng, Li, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is devoted to the studies of structural and magnetic  properties of Pd/Fe multilayers with the principal goal of determining the extent to  which the Pd layers are polarised by the Fe atoms and the average moment induced on  each Pd atom. Although Pd/Fe multilayers have been the subject of several previous  studies, no consensus on the behavior of magnetically polarised Pd has emerged. This  work has the novel feature of applying a wide range of characterization techniques  on the same sample. These techniques included x-ray diffraction, conversion electron  Mossbauer spectroscopy (CEMS), magnetometry and polarised neutron reflectometry.  Ag/Fe multilayers were first characterized to confirm the validity of the analysis  of the small-angle x-ray reflectivity to obtain layer thicknesses, as well as to  determine the temperature dependence of the Fe moment from GEMS  data. From the intersection of the results from the complementary  measurements on Pd/Fe multilayers, for the first time, an unequivocal understanding  of the behavior of magnetically polarised Pd has been achieved. We find, there is a  clear excess magnetisation associated with Pd polarisation. At 4.5 K, the Pd in  contact with an Fe surface is polarised with an average moment of 0.32 +/- 0.02 muB  to a depth of 20 +/- 4 A (9 +/- 2 atomic layers). These results indicate a large  exchange splitting of the Pd d-bands for a significant distance from the Fe surface,  leaving the spin-up band full, and a moment in the Pd arising from the 0.36 holes in  the spin-down band. We also find that the Fe moment at the Pd/Fe interface is  slightly enhanced to 2.42 +/- 0.05 muB for about 2.0 +/- 0.3 atomic layers,  suggesting that the magnetic properties of Fe is less affected by Pd as compared to  the influence of Fe on Pd. Neither the extent of Pd polarisation nor the interface  Fe moment agree with values predicted by theoretical calculations (the calculated Pd  polarisation depth is 2 atomic layers, and the interface Fe moment is 2.7 muB). The  band structure calculations will have to be refined in the light of the results from  current study.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w041v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zt836</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k5446"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Gender differences in the fragility of close same-sex friendships</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Christakos, Athena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study examined the discrepancy in the literature  regarding the absence of gender differences in the stability of same-sex close  friendships. One hundred and twenty children and adolescents (60 females and 60  males) from three grade levels (5, 7, and 9) participated in the study. An interview  measure was developed to assess for the level of intimacy, the social context in  which the friendship occurred (dyad vs. group), and perceptions of equality of  achievement for both current and former same-sex close friendships. Intimacy and  equality are features most closely associated with the social context of girls'  same-sex friendships. It was theorized that the more intimate, dyadic nature of  girls' friendships would contribute to interpersonal difficulties within their  friendships. Individual interviews were conducted with each participant. It was  hypothesized that girls' close friendships would be more unstable than those of boys  and that girls' friendships would show more signs of vulnerability to dissolution.  Statistically significant gender differences were obtained, that were consistent  with the hypothesis, when only the very closest same-sex friend for both genders was  included in the analyses. Girls' current same-sex closest friendships were shorter  in duration compared to boys, girls' were more likely than boys to report that their  current closest friends had already done something to threaten their friendship, and  girls' were more likely to report a history of break ups with former same-sex close  friends. Girls were also more likely to report greater distress when asked to  imagine the potential dissolution of their current friendships and more likely to  both anticipate and to have experienced a greater life change following the imagined  and actual dissolution of their current and former friendships, respectively.

High  levels of uPA are associated with invasive and metastatic characteristics of cancer.  I examined the differential regulation of uPA expression by DNA methylation in  normal, hormone responsive and hormone insensitive human breast and prostate cancer  cell lines. Lack of uPA expression in normal and hormone responsive cells is due to  methylation of uPA promoter. Treatment of these cells with a demethylating agent  resulted in induction of uPA, higher invasive capacity of the cells, and significant  increase in tumor volume. These studies demonstrated that DNA methylation is the  molecular mechanism responsible for uPA gene silencing in normal and hormone  responsive cancer cells. Since levels of uPA production is already a reliable  prognostic marker of disease progression, determination of uPA promoter methylation  status can potentially serve as a reliable early marker for induction of uPA and  thus progression of cancer into metastatic stages. I therefore examined the  methylation status of uPA promoter in surgical biopsy samples from patients with  breast cancer of different grades and found that hypomethylation of uPA promoter is  in fact associated with induction of uPA expression and poor grade in these  patients. Determination of uPA promoter methylation status can therefore serve as an  early reliable indicator of uPA production in breast cancer patients. Since uPA  expression and its hypomethylated state is strongly correlated with the malignant  phenotype, I utilized uPA gene in the highly invasive human breast cancer cells as a  model system to test the hypothesis that pharmacological reversal of the uPA  hypomethylation can result in its silencing and inhibition of metastasis.

Observations of grain boundary sliding along boundaries with different  misorientations were made. It was established that Sigma = 9 coincidence boundary  slides faster than boundaries of general type. Grain boundary sliding along  coincidence boundary was activated at higher stress and only in the presence of  intragranular slip. Sliding along coincidence and near-coincidence boundaries is  accompanied by regular boundary migration whereas sliding along general boundary is  not. The sliding-migration behavior of coincidence boundaries was explained in terms  of DSC-dislocations associated with steps. Sliding along general boundaries was  described in terms of non-DSC grain boundary dislocations having infinitesimal  Burgers vector. It is established in bicrystals with individual boundaries that  crystallographic slip can increase significantly the rate of grain boundary sliding.  Two mechanisms of stimulation of sliding by slip are proposed. Intragranular slip  can make a direct contribution to grain boundary sliding in incompatible conditions  of deformation. Identical deformation of grains can increase the rate of sliding  only by its accommodation at boundary irregularities. The close relationship between  sliding and slip at incompatible deformation makes intragranular slip strongly  dependent on boundary structure and geometry of slip and independent of the Schmid  factor. It is demonstrated that deformation of textured fine-grained  Zn-1.1%Al alloy in the direction favorable for intragranular slip decreases the  contribution of grain boundary sliding to the total strain. Deformation in the  direction unfavorable for slip increases its contribution. This shows that grain  boundary sliding and intragranular slip are concurrent and independent processes  during superplastic deformation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rp18c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gw679</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bp73q"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Computer simulation of the film blowing process incorporating crystallization and viscoelasticity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Muslet, Iyad A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A comprehensive two-dimensional simulation of the film blowing  process is developed based on a mathematical model that incorporates the Phan-Thien  and Tanner (PTT) and the Neo-Hookean constitutive equations with crystallization  effects. The PTT constitutive equation is employed in the liquid-like region, while  the Neo-Hookean constitutive equation is employed in the solid-like region, to  describe the rheological behavior of the film. The effects of the process variables  and parameters on the stress balance and overall behavior of the film were  evaluated. The orientation-induced crystallization is accounted for by incorporating  the Nakamura non-isothermal equation along with the Ziabicki equation. The proposed  model provides predictions of the bubble shape and dimensions, the position of the  freeze-line, and the evolution of temperature, crystallinity, birefringence,  stresses and deformation in the blown film. The predictions of the model show good  agreement with experimental results reported by various workers.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k7769.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bp73q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82k778v"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Acoustic echo cancellation over nonlinear channels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lu, Xiaojian, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is an essential component of  effective hands-free telephony. Conventional AEC systems employ linear adaptive  filters; therefore transmission channel nonlinearities caused by nonlinear  components (especially the vocoders in digital networks) can severely degrade  performance. This dissertation examines the performance of popular  conventional AEC algorithms based on adaptive filtering theory in nonlinear  channels. In order to study the degradation of the algorithms in nonlinear channels,  properties of nonlinear devices such as vocoders and loudspeakers are investigated,  and a local linearization model is developed for the analysis of the nonlinear  devices. This local linearization model is justified by experiments. A variable step-size adaptive cross-spectral algorithm is  proposed so the acoustic echo can be suppressed even during double-talk (DT)  periods. This is important since adaptation is frozen during DT periods in order to  avoid divergence of the conventional adaptive filtering algorithm; therefore the  power of the residual echo may become higher than that of the original echo in  nonlinear channels. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not need a DT detector,  which is still part of AEC. To compensate the echo attenuation loss of AEC algorithms caused  by channel non-linearities, post-filtering techniques are exploited. Combined with a  linear adaptive filter, post-filters based on various approaches, namely:  Wiener-type post-filter, spectral subtraction, subspace method and pitch extraction,  are proposed to further attenuate the echo. Experimental results show that the  combined AEC system can suppress the acoustic echo to a satisfactory level in the  nonlinear channel. Subband adaptive filtering is also studied to reduce the  computational complexity of the AEC system so that it can be implemented in  real-time. To this end, an improved simple design of DFT filter banks is proposed.  Furthermore, a post-filter is integrated with an adaptive filter in the subband to  significantly suppresses the acoustic echo in the presence of channel  nonlinearities. This approach also significantly reduces the computational  burden. Finally, a psychoacoustic approach based on the masking of the  human ear is exploited in order to mitigate the artifacts resulting from the  abovementioned post-filters. Testing indicates that the proposed method  significantly reduces the distortion of near-end speech when DT occurs. This makes  any audible residual echo sound more natural since it has less musical  noise.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Champagne, Benoit</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r9674191.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k778v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap5547r87q"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Biochemical and functional characterizations of PTPase CD45 interacting proteins</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wu, Liangtang, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>T cell receptor (TCR) engagement triggers a series of  biochemical and signaling cascades including protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)  activation, tyrosine phosphorylation of adapter proteins and multiple  protein-protein interactions. CD45 plays a critical role in regulating TCR-mediated  signaling. Here, we report evidence of in vivo interaction between CD45 and the Src  kinase-associated phosphoprotein (SKAP55), which acts as its substrate for  dephosphorylation. Further, we demonstrate and confirm by mutational analysis that a  critical residue of SKAP55, Tyr-232, mediated the association with CD45. In Jurkat  cells, SKAP55 induced tyrosine phosphorylation by anti-CD3 stimulation. Biochemical  analysis revealed that adapter protein SKAP55 formed homodimers through its SH3  domain and SK region. The amount of SKAP55 homodimer was enhanced in T cell  activation induced by anti-CD3 stimulation. SKAP55 as a substrate interacted with  Fyn kinase in vivo. In Jurkat cells, interaction between SKAP55 and Fyn kinase was  dependent on TCR activation. Stable overexpression of SKAP55 in Jurkat cells caused  MAP kinase activation following TCR engagement. Anti-CD3 stimulation also promoted  the interaction of SKAP55 with Grb-2 in T-cells. Mutational analysis revealed that  Tyr-271 in SKAP55 played a pivotal role for interaction with both Fyn kinase and  adapter protein Grb-2, indicating that the Fyn-phosphorylated SKAP55 transiently  associates with adapter Grb-2 to mediate MAP kinase activation. Intriguingly, TCR engagement dramatically induced the  translocation of endogenous SKAP55 to lipid rafts, while Fyn kinase, which was  observed in lipid rafts in resting T cells, was found in increased amounts upon TCR  activation. The association between SKAP55 and Fyn kinase was also found in lipid  rafts, suggesting that the positive function of SKAP55 via its association with Fyn  and other signaling components may have been involved in raft-mediated T cell  activation. Overexpression of SKAP55 in these cells induced transcriptional  activation of the IL-2 promoter, while total suppression of the IL-2 promoter  activity was observed for the SKAP55-Y232F mutant. Furthermore, overexpression of  SKAP55-Y232F also caused the tyrosine-hyperphosphorylation of Fyn with a decreased  kinase activity. Thus, SKAP55 is an essential adaptor which couples CD45 with the  Src family kinase Fyn for dephosphorylation, and acts thereby as a key component for  positive regulation in TCR signaling.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shen, Shi-Hsiang</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pn412.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547r87q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vh26b"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Phylogeography of Southeast Asian seahorses in a conservation context</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lourie, Sara Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates the potential role of historical  isolation of ocean basins in promoting diversification among marine organisms in  Southeast Asia. It also questions the possible effects of Pleistocene exposure of  the Sunda Shelf on present day marine distributions and genetic diversity. Four  species of exploited seahorses (genus Hippocampus), with differing ecological  parameters, are used to test historical hypotheses. The results (based on cytochrome  b DNA sequencing) suggest that significant phylogeographic structure does exist  among seahorse populations in Southeast Asia, but that the patterns are only  partially concordant across species. Distinct phylogeographic breaks are seen in H.  barbouri, H. kuda, and H. trimaculatus, whereas greater spatial overlap of  haplotypes in H. spinosissimus indicates more extensive gene flow. The  phylogeographic history of the two shallow water species (H. barbouri and H. kuda)  appears to have been primarily shaped by fragmentation and/or long-distance  colonisation events. Both species show patterns consistent with hypotheses of  divergence mediated by ocean basins separations. The deeper water species (H.  spinosissimus and H. trimaculatus) show more evidence of range expansion and  isolation by distance. Hippocampus trimaculatus shows a deep east-west  phylogeographic division at right angles to that predicted by the separation of the  Indian versus Pacific Ocean basins and instead parallels the terrestrial division  known as Wallace's Line. Different species have also responded differently to the  reflooding of the Sunda Shelf at the end of the last Ice Age: the two deeper water  species have colonised it extensively suggesting limited barriers to movement,  whereas the shallow water species have not. It is possible that the populations of  H. kuda now inhabiting the shelf may stem from populations that found refuge in  brackish water lakes when the shelf was exposed to the air.

The efficacy of retinoids  in vitro and in vivo correlates with the expression of the estrogen receptor alpha  (ERalpha). The role of ERalpha in mediating RA-induced sensitivity is not understood  and is further complicated by the recent discovery of ERalpha. This dissertation  explores the transcriptional, as well as proliferative, response to RA in human  breast cancer cells expressing ERbeta or ERbeta. First, ER-negative breast cancer  cells were stably transduced with ERalpha-deletion mutants using retroviral  technology. We compared the effect of the ERalpha wild-type, ERalpha-deletion  mutants or the parental ER-negative cells on transcriptional activity from the  RARbeta2 promoter, a gene regulated by retinoids and potentially involved in  retinoid-mediated growth inhibition. We observed that expression of ERalpha  suppressed basal expression of the RA-responsive gene RARbeta2, while allowing it to  be strongly induced by RA. Repression of basal RARbeta2 transcription was confirmed  by transient expression of a reporter plasmid containing the RARbeta2 minimal  promoter. We further determined that RARbeta2 induction required the N-terminal AF-1  containing region of ERalpha, including the DNA-binding domain, but was independent  of the C-terminal ligand-binding domain. The effect of ERalpha was specific for  RAR-mediated transcription and did not alter transcription from vitamin D or thyroid  hormone response elements. Moreover, the cross-talk between ERalpha and RAR was not  mediated by sequestration of a number of common co-regulators. To characterize the  growth and transcription effect of ERbeta on retinoid-mediated pathways, we  generated stable transfectants using this isoform. Significant RA-mediated growth  inhibition was observed in the ERbeta-positive cells and not in the parental  ER-negative cells. Furthermore, RA altered ERbeta-me</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Miller, Wilson H., Jr.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dw06d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc074</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
