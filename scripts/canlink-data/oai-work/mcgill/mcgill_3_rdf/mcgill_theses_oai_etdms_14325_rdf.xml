The isomers chosen, thiazolo [4,5-e]isoquinoline (I) and thiazolo [5,4-c]isoquinoline (II), were those in which the thiazole ring is fused to the heterocyclic ring of the isoquinoline nucleus. These two isomers differ only in the orientation of the thiazole ring on the heterocyclic ring of the isoquinoline nucleus.

It is not coincidental that one of these eleven panels bears the portrait of a Muslim, and it is even less coincidental that this portrait is of Abū-L-Kalām Āzād.

They correctly ascribed the phenomenon to oxygen lack. The data accumulated on the subject up to 1959 has been well reviewed by Korner (38) who points out that while it is possible to present a fairly clear picture of the gross circulatory changes accompanying hypoxia, the mechanisms of the control of the cardiorespiratory alterations remain unknown.

The medium was instrumented to study the characteristics of the compression wave. It was found that the wave attenuates exponentially and the velocity of propagation increases with depth. The wave front progressing through the medium was non-planar.
