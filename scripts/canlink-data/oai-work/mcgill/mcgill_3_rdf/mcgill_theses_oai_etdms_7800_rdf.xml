These sciences have served to improve modem agriculture and have succeeded in setting it on a level with other applied and industrial sciences of the day.

Gasoline, prior to its utilization as a source of power was a little thought-of by-product of crude oil and was used almostexclusively for cleaning purposes and in necessarily small quantities. The potentialities of this hydrocarbon were easily recognizable.

Until falr1y reoent times the function of the spleen was amatter of mere conjecture. Aristotle doubted its use.

We now know from the work done by Russel (11) and others that other forms of soil organisms also increase the supply of nitrogen in thesoi1 when conditions are favorable. The forage crops that are grown for their stems, 1eaves and roots require large quantities of nitrogenous food during their early growth. This can be secured by having them follow leguminous crops and by applying manure rich in nitrogen. The cereal crops that require a larger proportion of phosphates can be placed to advantage following the rank growing forage crops which use up the abundanoe of free nitrates from the clover sod and the farmyard manure.

Today, however, we know as also the rest of the world knows, that the finest quality wheat in the world is produoed north of this boundary, in the three prairie provinoes of Canada, and the area of wheat production is still extending northwards. Within more recent years a belief paralleling that already mentioned existed in regard to the growing of corn. It is but a very short time ago that the belief held that corn oould not be grown successfully as far north as the international boundary. But once again Scienoe has prevailed and has overoome the obstacles set up in her path by Nature, for we have today thousands upon thousands of acres devoted to the production of corn each year in the Canadian Prairie provinces and the acreage is steadily increasing.

These authors injected an aqueous extract of the whole gland into an anaesthetized animal and obtained a rise in blood pressure. Later, in 1898, Howell (2) localized this pressor activity in the posterior lobe of the gland. Subsequent investigations have shown that extracts of the posterior lobe have physiological activities which manifest themselves on the cardio-vascular, renal, smooth muscle, and glandular structures of the body. The most important of these activities are generally held to be thepressor, oxytocic, and renal actions, or, as the latter is sometimes termed, diuretic-antidiuretic. As the experiments reported in this paper deal with the unity or multiplicity of the constituents responsible for these three activities, a resume' of the history and present state of our knowledge concerning them is given below.

I have not given the biographical facts of writers resident in Canada, but only of those who have left their home land and are too frequently considered natives of other countries. I do not presume to speak with finality. After all, in drama as well as in all forms of literature, time is the supreme test, and either fortunately or unfortunately, a graduate student does not belong to that aristocracy of time, by which a work of art is ultimately judged. Canada has been so busy building her house, hewing it, as it were from a wilderness, that she has had little time to decorate it. Statements are frequently made, however, that Canada has produced neither playwright, play nor player. This is not justified by the facts. What I have tried to do in this discussion, is to examine that statement and to disprove it, by evidence, some of which has been exceedingly difficult to obtain.

Being the first part of south-eastern Quebec to be surveyed after the English manner, it was divided into counties, townships, ranges and lots instead of into seigniories, and parishes, according to the custom that prevailed during the French rule in Canada. Thus the distr is generally known as the "Eastern Townships." These early surveyors instead of dividing the district symmetrically into rectangular areas, split up the oountry in a most complicated, and irregular manner. Then, as if not satisfied with the puzale already created, they proceeded to number the ranges and lots in a still less systematic manner. The compiling of maps, particularly on small scale, is thus rendered slow and tedious.

Although this product has been exported in varying quantities since the introduction of mechanical refrigeration on steamships in 1897, the period of rapid growth prior to the war steadily reduced the volume available for export, until in 1913 this country imported six times as much as she exported. More recently, there has been a decided increase in butter production, not only in Ontario and Quebec, but also in the three Prairie Provinces. In the latter, the phenomenal growth of the dairy industry can be attributed largely to the development of a system of mixed farming, as a result of the poor returns from grain-growing after 1920. Thus these provinces, which not long ago imported butter, now manufacture nearly as much as is made in Ontario. Unlike the latter province, these provinces have few industrial centres to provide a home market, and are forced to seek a market for any surplus farther afield.
