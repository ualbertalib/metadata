Atrophy is distinguished from lack of regeneration, and is shown to be solely dependent upon adequacy of total volume of liver blood flow, and not any trophic substance or specific type of flow. This concept is extended to the problems of revascularization and atrophy of auxiliary liver transplants. A model is described and evaluated utilizing renal vein blood as "portal" inflow to the transplant, leaving intact portal blood supply to the damaged host liver. Excellent survival and function results, suggesting possible clinical application of this model as a temporary means of hepatic support with the expectation of potential recovery and regeneration of the host liver undeprived of its portal inflow.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacLean, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246w03x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773z748</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43p134d"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Relationship between spina bifida occulta, spina bifada cystica and anencephaly</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tourillon, Paule</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The high familial rate of anencephaly and spina bifida was used to test whether spina bifida occulta is a minor form of neural- tube defects. Occulta's were identified from X-Rays taken in hospitals and reproductive histories obtained from the mothers, thus ascertaining dysraphic conditions in 100 families. Out of 525 brothers and sisters, 3 malformations (1 spina bifida, 2 spina bifida-like) were found whilst at least 25 were expected from the rate observed in studies in which anencephaly and spina bifida cystica were indicators. The findings do not support that the occult type belongs to the pathological line of major dysraphic malformations. A finer division of the cases, combined with a more complete ascertainment of other relatives in addition to the sibs would possibly bring to light situations where high neuro-dysraphical risk exists. Spina bifida occulta in general appears not to be a minor neural tube anomaly.

The main function of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway is generally regarded as being the breakdown of glucose and the production of energy. This, however, is not the case with the pentose phosphate cycle, since NADPH does not appear to be linked to the electron transport chain and its production is not accompanied by oxidative phosphorylation (7).

A rat model for testing this hypothesis using peritoneal exudate cells is described. Problems in methodology are noted and discussed with suggestions of alternative techniques. The unrecognized non-syngeneic nature of recipient "Lewis" animals is noted as a major cause of experimental failure once the method had been mastered.

Techniques used to remove other toxic substances from the plasma of patients have had limited success in the removal of bilirubin. This lack of success is probably in large part due to the high degree of binding of bilirubin to albumin.

The stimulated ammonia production observed in fasting humans contrasted with the depressed ammoniogenesis reported in starving dogs. This discrepancy could not be ascribed to differences in hepatic ketogenesis between the two species but can perhaps be related to a better utilization of ketones by canine peripheral tissues. Owing to the complex metabolic adaptations that occur during starvation, the influence of ketones on renal ammoniogenesis could not be determined. However, the rate of ammonia excretion was depressed in both men and dogs infused with ketones. In dogs, ketones actually depressed renal ammoniogenesis without altering the systemic acid-base equilibrium. This effect was associated with a marked reduction of renal glutamine extraction. The possibility that ketones may influence renal ammoniogenesis through a direct metabolic effect within the kidney has been raised.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lemieux, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sg72m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g316c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An009w544g"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Autotransplantation of the small intestine</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poulin, Eric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In autotransplanting the whole small intestine, one of the problems has been the difficulty of getting long term survivors consistently.

The objective of this project is to study a number of technical variations during small intestine autotransplantation and their effect on the intestinal mucosa during the operation and the immediate post-operative period. Over seventy small bowel autotransplantations were done on dogs and forty-four were included in the present study. Histologic and Biochemical studies were performed on tissue and blood of the animals pre-operatively, intraoperatively and in the immediate post-operative course. Various diets were used in the pre-operative feeding. A number of arterial perfusates and cooling temperatures were used after vascular severance of the organ. Intra-luminal perfusion of the bowel was also studied. The findings of this study will help develop an operative protocol for the study of longer term survivors in the auto or allo-transplantation model.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hinchey, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fm26h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w544g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bm467"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nerve regeneration in free skin transplants</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Orgel, Michael G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A method has been described by which the total population of regenerating cutaneous nerves can be studied, and has been sequentially applied to free skin grafts in the rabbit.

This was demonstrated by an increased number of nerve bundles, an increase in the number of unmyelinated fibers, a decrease in the number of myelinated fibers, and an absence of end corpuscles in the grafts. It is concluded that nerves enter the graft very shortly after their placement, and distribute in a random and imbalanced fashion.

The seven species of coccidia occurring in the domestic chicken are all members of the genus Eimeria, a genus characterized by the formation of four sporoblasts within the oocyst and by the ultimate development of two sporozoites within each sporoblast in the infective stage. While the oocysts of each species differ in respect to shape, size and sporulation time it is most difficult, as pointed out by Becker (1934), to distinguish the species on the basis of oocyst characteristics alone. One should also take into consideration the location of the parasite in the intestine, the position of the parasite in the intestinal mucosa, the prepatent period and the macroscopic lesions. The problem of identifying species is further complicated by the possibility, of the occurrence of multiple species in a single host species.

It appears that sulfinpyrazone prevents the vascular lesion of hyperacute rejection in canine renal allografts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacLean, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m9973.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q735z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72pb42v"><ual:graduationDate>1947</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Investigation of the effects of flooding on the phosphorus status of soils</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Paul, Harry, 1914-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>[...] Within recent times soil chemists (8, 26) have shown that different soils vary in their fixing capacity for phosphorus, and measurements of the fixing power of soils have been based on the solubilities of the phosphorus compounds in dilute acid solutions. It will be shown, however, in this paper that certain acid extractants have failed to give a true picture of the phosphorus-supplying ability of the acid clay soils of British Guiana, and that the estimation of exchangeable phosphorus of soils will undoubtedly reveal some of the misconceptions of phosphorus fixation. A clear conception of the mechanism of phosphorus fixation in acid soils, of the factors governing fixation, and of the distribution of the various forms in which phosphorus tends to accumulate and remain in acid soils, is required for a more economic utilisation of phosphatic fertilisers. This investigation has had a twofold objective; firstly to understand and elucidate what happens to the phosphorus when soils are flooded with water and with sugar solution, and secondly to study the factors inter-related with phosphorus response in the Blairmont clay soils.

Its experimental rationale is reviewed and the results of experiments, designed to determine its safety and effectiveness for prolonged application (4 hours), are presented. The findings in normal dogs demonstrated that counterpulsation was well tolerated. It maintained normal cardiac output, arterial pressure and peripheral circulation for three hours with slight deterioration in the final hour. These parameters correlated with a normal arterial lactate concentration during the first three hours. Plasma hemoglobin and blood gases did not change significantly.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rosensweig, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956k02v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hg24j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x444t"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Immunofluorescent studies in pituitaries</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marwaha, Raj K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Antibodies to human growth hormone were detected in 13 patients on long term HGH therapy for (2-7 years) by using immunofluorescence methods.

On diluting the sera 1 to 8 immunofluorescence was inhibited completely in 4 patients who showed no binding to iodinated PGH. Acidophils stained were both somatotrophs and carminophils. Complete inhibition of fluorescent staining was only observed when these sera were incubated with both PGH and PLR and then used for immunofluorescent staining.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McGarry, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r623j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x444t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666785p"><ual:graduationDate>1947</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The validity of physical and chemical tests for determining the quality of flax fibre produced in various types of retting</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Siminovitch, Helen Elizabeth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Grading of flax fibre in Canada, and in all other flax-producing countries, is done by professional graders who judge the flax by appearance (cleanness, glossiness, length of fibre, colour), by handle or feel (weight, softness), and by strength (breaking a few strands of fibre in the hands). Because this method is based on human judgment, two graders may award different grades to samples of the same fibre. It was felt that if some scientific method for ascertaining grades could be obtained, it would be a valuable contribution. Hence, a series of chemical determinations was made on flax fibre of various grades produced by water and dew retting in an attempt to assess the quality of flax fibre by chemical analysis. Concurrently, use was made of the Pressley Cotton Fibre Strength Tester to determine whether or not this machine could be adapted to flax fibre and yarn to differentiate between grades by means of physical tests. An investigation was made also of various types of chemical retting procedures. Because of the speed with which flax straw can be retted by chemical solutions, an attempt was made to determine if fibre of quality equal to that obtained by water and dew retting could be produced thereby. The chemically retted fibre then was subjected to the physical and chemical tests used in the attempts to appraise flax produced by water and dew retting.

A procedure employing gelatin sedimentation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation was developed for harvesting appropriate white cell populations. Significant inhibition of migration was obtained when the cells from animals immunized with killed mycobacteria were tested with particulate antigen. PPD failed to give similar results under the same conditions of experiment. Migration inhibition was also obtained with cells harvested from animals immunized with ovalbumin. No conclusive results, however, were obtained in attempts to induce in vitro reactivity towards keyhole limpet haemocyanin. In those animals immunized with killed mycobacteria in addition to a soluble antigen (ovalbumin and KLH) a suppression of the delayed dermal response to old tuberculin was noted. The tuberculin reactivity appeared, however, at a later date in the KLH-immunized animals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Matheson, B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612r715.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c144p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Microbiology and Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s3374"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A fluorescent compound obtained from two of the lens proteins of the dogfish eye</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Louis, Diana J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>γ-crystallin and albuminoid from the lens of the dogfish eye produce, on hydrolysis in 6N HCI, a substance which fluoresces at 445nm.

The fluorescent substance is characterized by a complicated UV absorption spectrum with peaks at 273 and 360nm and a shoulder at 305nm, and an activation spectrum which corresponds to the absorption spectrum except for the relative peak heights which differ slightly. It is soluble in water, ethyl acetate and dichloroethane and fluoresces weakly in the latter two solvents. It is ninhydrin-negative and does not appear on alkaline hydrolysis of the source proteins.
