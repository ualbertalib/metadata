T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The term nuclear isomerism was originally applied to an excited state of the nucleus whose lifetime was abnormally long. It is now increasingly being applied to any excited state of the nucleus whose lifetime has been measured. Nuclear isomerism was first discovered by Hahn in 1921 and since then about 150 examples have been reported with half lives ranging from 5 years to lo-14 seconds. This thesis describes a method of measurement and results obtained for a number of isomeric states in the region of half life 5 x 10-5 to 5 x 10-2 seconds.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408175x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xq398</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
