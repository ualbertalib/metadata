This isomer decays with a half-life of 15.5 hours predominantly by electron capture to Br76 and is followed by a strong Ml gamma ray of 45.6 kev in energy. Indeed the conversion lines for six gamma rays were observed to decay with the 15.5 hour half-life. An isomeric transition in Kr76 was not definitely recognized among the many weak conversion lines.

By comparison with Lower Ordovician strata elsewhere, the Beekmantown in southern Quebec is relatively unfossiliferous. As a result, interest in the group has been slight. This study is a dissertation on the stratigraphy and palaeontology of the Beekmantown group as exposed in the Quebec portion of the St. Lawrence Lowlands.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stearn, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2677039t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569792v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r074z797"><ual:graduationDate>1958</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>the Role of Eye Movements in Perception</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bryden, Mark Philip</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A series of experiments initiated by Mishkin and Forgays (7) has established that a response may be more easily elicited by stimulating one area of the retina rather than another.
