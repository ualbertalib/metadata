If the lung were very distortable (liquid-like) ΔVy would equal - ΔVx. If the chest wall were very disortable, ΔVy would equal zero. If neither were distortable, ΔAy would be very much greater than zero. At low VL, ΔVy max was -12.5% of ΔVx max. At high VL, ΔVy max was zero. Measured pleural surface pressure differences between lobes were large. Results indicate that; 1) lung distortabllity decreases as volume increases; 2) the pressure cost of chest wall deformations is substantial and results in marked regional differences in pleural surface pressures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macklem, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225f252.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f436h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
