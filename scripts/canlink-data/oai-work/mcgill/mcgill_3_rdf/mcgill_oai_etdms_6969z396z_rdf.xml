After pulse labeling, mesothelial cells from the seross lining gastrointestinal tract and spleen had higher labelling indices (0.59% ± 0.16% - 2.98% ± 0.50%), than those of the cavity walls (0.10 ± 0.09 - 0.26% ± 0.07%) and of liver and kidney (0.30 ± 0.03% - 0.46% ± ± 0.24%.). After continuous infusion the labeling index increased with duration of infusion. Turnover rates calculated from regression equation for each region of the gastrointestinal tract were very low, ranging from 0.05% per day for the ileal serosa to 0.31% per day for the colon. Hence, mesothelial cell populations should be considered like the populations of internal organs which show low proliferative activity in adults (so called "expanding" populations). However, mesothelial cells are readily induced to divide by a variety of stimuli.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz8063177.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z396z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
