AO delayed multiple breath N2 washouts and markedly increased the slope of the alveolar plateau of the single breath N2 curves. To detect diffusion gradients, the HE/SF6 ratio was measured during expiration following a single breath of these gases. Before AO we found small gradients. However, after AO, we consistently found the initial gas HE rich and later samples SF6 rich. Absolute concentrations of both gases fell during expiration. Breathholding reversed both effects. Gas sampled from a catheter wedged into an airway of a normal lobe was consistently SF6 enriched. Thus, HE and SF6 must separate during inspiration, possibly by radial diffusion of HE, allowing SF6 to penetrate deeper into the alveoli. Diffusion equilibration across collateral channels is slow and the distribution of ventilation to the collaterally ventilated space is abnormal even though its tidal volume is normal.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macklem, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4307781.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x2378</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adr26z129z"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of intestinal motility: (with comments on post-operative paralytic ileus)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guisan, Yves J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The peristaltic reflex is regulated by complex nervous and hormonal mechanisms.

Typical enterochromaffin cells do not divide, but undergo renewal by differentiation of unrecognized precursors in the lower half of intestinal crypts. Labeled enterochromaffin cells appear in crypts by 1-1/2 days, and in villi by 3 days after the infusion started. At 8 days, 80 percent cells were labeled both in crypts and villi.

Leukocytes subjected to 2,000 r x-irradiation were still capable of producing BF. In contrast, mixtures of purified lymphocytes, untreated or irradiated, did not release factor. The response of purified lymphocytes to BF was also much reduced compared to the reaction of non-fractionated leukocytes. Interaction between lymphocytes and BF was however demonstrated by culturing cells preincubated with phytohaemagglutinin and by the capacity of purified lymphocytes to absorb out BF activity. The degree of stimulation of leukocytes depended on the concentration of the BF in the medium: the optimal BF concentration was independent of the number of responding cells in the culture. Subjecting target cells to stimulation simultaneously to BF and mitomycin-treated allogeneic cells indicated that BF is probably not transplantation antigen.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gordon, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fc437.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p7807</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r180q"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of CO2 and pH on local anaesthetic action</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Catchlove, Richard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Local anaesthetics with different combinations of CO2 and pH were applied to sheathed and desheathed frog nerves during conventional stimulation and recording of the compound action potential. While CO2 (1-50%) or local anaesthetic (1 mM) caused a small degree of block, together they had much greater effect, greater at a higher pH (7.3). The permeability of the nerve sheath to radioactive lidocaine and sucrose was measured by perfusing these solutions through a tube of isolated sheath. Samples were taken from a bath surrounding the sheath. The permeability to the anaesthetic was proportional to the fraction of non-ionized lidocaine. It was not changed by CO or H+. It was concluded that CO potentiates the action of local anaesthetics by 1) a direct effect of CO on the axon, 2) concentrating local anaesthetic inside the nerve trunk, 3) converting local anaesthetic to cation through its effect on H+ and 4) summation of effects of CO2 and local anaesthetics on the axon membrane.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Krnjevic, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qm98v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r180q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap2676z86t"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on Deoxynucleoside Triphosphate Pools during the mammalian cell cycle</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bray, Geraldine M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Deoxynucleoside triphosphate pools in bath asynchronous and synchronous cultures of mammalian cells were examined.

Hailer develops from his naturalistic first novel to the romance form of his later novels in an effort to solve the problem of the paradoxical nature of power. This central problem is posed in terms of an oedipal struggle between a young man and his father-symbol. Mailer 's turn toward the romance genre can be seen in his later heroes who resemble the Adamic heroes of the nineteenth century American romance; and, in the shift from an objective to a subjective view of nature in his fiction. This increasingly subjective point of view leads to a private mythic framework characteristic of the romance tradition in American literature.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reichertz, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pw950.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c374h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967680n"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Centre communautaire regional de santé mentale--plantification et design</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>LeFriant, René</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study concerns several aspects of the environmental design of the psychiatric hospital and the organization of mental health services in a semi-rural area of the Province of Quebec.

However, correlations between the two measured sets of attitudes and the physical performance of sons were not shown to be significant.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pedersen, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qg384.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f919b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795b95p"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Kinematics of deformation of inhomogeneous solids</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Haller, Julian K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of the present work is to study the deformation of polycrystalline materials when subjected to a general force field using the classical field and probability theories. Fundamental relations related to the proposed theory of deformation will be treated first. Two basic assumptions are made, e.g. that the medium is composed of a finite number of grains or crystals which are randomly distributed in the configuration space, and that each grain can be treated as a finite continuum obeying the laws of the classical field theory. Continuum field theories and some essential points of statistical and probabilistic mechanics are discussed first. The probabilistic model upon which the proposed theory is based is then developed. In its light the kinematic relations for the deformation process are formulated. Finally, the measurable or macro-quantities are evaluated in terms of first moments of the deformation field. Spatial correlations of the random fields are also formulated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Axelrad, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278x50d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795b95p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mechanical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c375s"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Light and electron microscopic studies on the effect of hydrocortisone on the thymus of neonatal ICR/Ha inbred mice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wowchuk, William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this experiment was to study cytological changes in the thymus of neonatal mice during hydrocortisone induced involution and regeneration with the light and electron microscopes. Neonatal mice of strain ICR/Ha were used in this study. They were injected subcutaneously with 0.1 mg hydrocortisone within 24 hours after birth. The weights, mitotic indices, and histology of the treated thymuses were compared to the control groups at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 3, 15, and 30 days post-treatment. An analysis of the ratio of the thymic weight to body weight in the treated group showed a significant decrease at 24 hours, and 3 days after treatment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Joneja, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75rc07c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c375s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6d570080f"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The organizational structure of the stock exchange and the availability of capital in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fulop, Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the aspect of the metropolis/satellite relationship of the United States and Canada that exists between their respective stock exchanges. The analysis is not limited to an examination of the stock market out is more directed to the economic, psychological, and social factors that are revealed about these two countries’ relationship by the operations of their stock exchanges. This research was carried out to determine how capital gets drained out of Canada and is thus not available for investment in Canadian enterprises. The date revealed that this occurs because the New York market offers many advantages to Canadian investors, such as very profitable growth stocks that are unavailable in Canada and liquidity to deal in large blocks of stock. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dixon, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hn48b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d570080f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sociology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s1619367"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sur le caractère moral de la méthode prescrite dans Le Prince de Nicholas Machiavel</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Arcand, Gabriel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cette brêve description du comportement ambivalent de Laurent le Magnifique contient plus que le simple mépris de l'auteur à l'endroit de cet illustre représentant de la famille Médici.

Observations suggest that in most instances the immunoglobulins G and A can be predicted on a semiquantitative basis from the electrophoretic densitometer pattern by inspection using simple parameters and that elevated values in many patients can be excluded with a considerable degree of confidence. It is not possible to predict effectively the value of immunoglobulin M. Data for analysis have been derived from thirty-five healthy subjects and two hundred patients. Protein fractionation was performed by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate membranes using the Beckman Microzone system and an Analytrol densitometer-integrator. The immunoglobulins G, A and M were determined using an agar gel immunodiffusion technique with commercially prepared plates and standards (Hyland). Multiple correlations were made with the aid of a computer, to determine the best parameters for predicting the immunoglobulins.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gault, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sk45s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537413p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Investigative Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr172130m"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of infected bile in experimental pancreatitis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Poncelet, Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The etiology and pathogenesis of pancreatitis remain a very-controversial problem despite a large amount of clinical and experimental work.
