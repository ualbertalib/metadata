B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a comparison of how the federal government and the provincial and municipal governments of Quebec and British Columbia dealt with a comparable welfare problem during a period of extensive and prolonged unemployment during the year ending May 31, 1955. The writer wondered what public resources were available to meet the income maintenance needs of the unemployed worker. He also wondered how the available public resources measured up to the demands placed upon them by this stressful situation. Secondary materials have been used to compare the federal, provincial, and municipally administered provisions available to the unemployed employables in each of the two provinces, both at the start and at the end of the twelve month period studied.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Younge, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fq62d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580r34d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
