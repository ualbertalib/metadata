Instrumentation work included a VLF logging tool compatible with a field digital computer configured to perform log instrumentation control, numerical data acquisition and recording together with video screen graphic display. Significant improvements in the overall precision and reliability of the logging operation has been realized through the use of digital technology. The field tests included the measurements of the following parameters: electrical resistivity, induced polarization, spontaneous polarization, electromagnetic field ratio and phase difference and temperature. The tests were performed for a wide variety of environments and targets including massive and disseminated sulfides, structural problems, coal and gold fields on properties located in Eastern Canada from Sudbury to Cape Breton Island. The interpretation of the data yields information complementing core information such as detection of materials with some electric property contrast, localization of off-hole mineralization both in massive and disseminated form and determination of absolute value of specific in-situ rock physical properties. A better understanding of several underground processes (such as SP, uniform field induction, etc.) has resulted from the project.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526d00k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35t919x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electric prospecting</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geophysical well logging</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472x095"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Edwin S.

It will show that Edison studio policy in the period would have discouraged such an achievement and that the crucial first step in the elaboration of the early film narrative was the development of a compositional aesthetic derived from the staged or 'fake' newsreel. Based on that aesthetic between 1904 and 1907 film directors including Edwin Porter turned out a short-lived, tableau-action narrator-dependent story film in actuality style that became the basis of the nickelodeon boom dating from 1906. The social and industrial pressures engendered by that success led to the fragmentation of the complete action tableau and the displacement of the tableau narrative by a shot-dependent, autonomous narrative constrained by the formal features of actuality composition. The final chapter analyzes a leading example, the 1907 emergence of parallel editing in the production of one-reel screen tales of last-minute rescue.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924c41d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472x095</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Porter, Edwin Stanton</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motion pictures -- United States -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motion pictures -- Editing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214p769"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A rule-based expert system for image segmentation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nazif, Ahmed M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A major problem in robotics vision is the segmentation of images of natural scenes in order to understand their content. This thesis presents a new solution to the image segmentation problem that is based on the design of a rule-based expert system. General knowledge about low level properties of an image is formulated into production rules. A number of processes employ the rules to segment the image into uniform regions and connected lines. In addition to the knowledge rules, a set of control rules are also employed. These include meta-rules that embody inferences about the order in which the knowledge rules are matched. They also include focus of attention rules that determine the path of processing within the image. A third set of rules contains the strategy rules which are data-driven inferences about the control rules. They dynamically modify the processing strategy. Different rule ordering and focus of attention strategies are selected according to a set of performance parameters. These measure the quality of the segmentation output at any point in time. Experiments with the knowledge rules resulted in an optimal set based on output quality and processing efficiency. Overall system performance is shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively superior to previous segmentation algorithms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246s705.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214p769</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Optical data processing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer drawing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computers -- Optical equipment</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73pw74z"><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>ACP-EEC trade cooperation under the Lome II convention : a critical analysis and exposition of the legal and institutional aspects of ACP-EEC trade cooperation with particular emphasis on the sugar protocol</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Singh, Ajit Swaran</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The general principles underlying ACP-EEC trade cooperation, as exemplified by the Lome II Convention, are singularly innovative and unprecedented in international economic relations. However, trade liberalization measures are valuable only in so far as they encourage the expansion of trade. Protectionism inherent in the EEC's common agricultural policy, and certain uncoordinated and inconsistent policies being pursued by the Community and its Member States have greatly impaired the benefits that would otherwise have inured to the ACP States. This thesis seeks to analyse the Lome II Convention and to evaluate it in the light of international law, and in particular the NIEO. If the Lome II Convention is modified and implemented in the manner recommended, it could prove to be a viable model for relations between the developed and the developing countries which is compatible with the aspirations of the international community for a more just and balanced international economic order.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fm144.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73pw74z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social

The study describes the structure of Tsvetaeva's artistic universe: its mutually opposed worlds ("this", non-authentic, and "the other", authentic) and its different types of characters. Particular attention is given to the peculiarities of Tsvetaeva's lyric hero, notably intensity, the "two-fold nature", and the predilection for conflict. Analysis focuses on various forms of conflict of the lyric hero--with the world, with life, and with the self.

In order for one to successfully transact with the community, their fears and expectations must be clearly understood and respected. This study begins in Chapter I with an examination of the types of financing available, and Chapter II discusses how these financings may be funded. Chapter III contains a detailed consideration of the types of security required to secure such obligations, while Chapter IV sets out the types of insurance required. Any financial transaction must take into consideration the impact of taxation, and Chapter V contains a study of the various types of taxes normally encountered in aerospace financing. Chapter VI discusses some of the usual provisions normally found in aerospace finance documentation and Chapter VII sets out some of the special requirements to be met. This is followed by a final analysis, conclusions and recommendations in Chapter VIII.

The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E  (eIF4E) binds this structure directly and is repressed by the eIF4E-binbing proteins  (4E-BPs), which in turn are regulated through the FRAP/mTOR pathway by a multitude  of extracellular stimuli. The focus of this thesis is to investigate the function of  the 4E-BPs in the cell by the use of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in which  both the genes for 4E-BP1 (Eif4ebp1) and 4E-BP2 (Eif4ebp2) were disrupted. We first  examined the role of 4E-BPs in encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection.  35S-methionine metabolic labeling of MEF proteins revealed that 4E-BPs are not  essential for EMCV replication. We then decided to identify mRNAs regulated by  4E-BPs. This was achieved by polyribosomal analysis of specific mRNAs. Our results  showed that translation efficiency of c-myc and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNAs  is enhanced in double knockout cells. We also tested MEFs for their sensitivity to  rapamycin, a drug known to inhibit FRAP/mTOR. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting  (FACS) analysis demonstrated that 4E-BPs contribute to rapamycin-induced growth  arrest. Finally, we studied Eif4ebpl-/- ;Eif4ebp2-/- mice in order to test whether  they show a phenotype similar to Eif4ebp1 -/- which are known to be smaller and  display a lower blood glucose compared with their wild type counterparts.  Surprisingly, Eif4ebp1-/-;Eif4ebp2 -/- mice were neither small nor hypoglycemic. The  above results emphasize the importance of the 4E-BPs in the cell, thus encouraging  further investigations in order to better understand their function.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sonenberg, Nahum</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881m54n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278t619</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m2303"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mechanisms of mechanical (needle) transmyocardial revascularization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Luo, Chwan-Yau, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR), a procedure for  enhancing myocardial perfusion, is used to treat patients with refractory angina.

We conclude that, both experimentally  and clinically, the validity of TMR as an effective therapy for myocardial ischemia  remains questionable and that the placebo effect in TMR treatment cannot be  excluded.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chiu, Ray C-J</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn508.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m2303</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603qz06v"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Preparation and characterization of Tungsten tips suitable for molecular electronics studies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lucier, Anne-Sophie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A technique for preparing tips with a radius of a few nanometers  from tungsten wire is investigated. The sharp shape is obtained by electrochemical  etching; further tip processing and characterization is done in ultra-high vacuum.  Tips are cleaned through a high temperature annealing process and their sharpness  can be quickly estimated from their field emission behaviour. Sufficiently sharp  tips are imaged with a field ion microscope; full atomic characterization of the tip  apex can be obtained from an analysis of the resulting images and field evaporation  can be used to atomically engineer the tip apex into a desired configuration.  Starting from single crystal, (111) oriented tungsten wire, a sharp tip terminating  in three atoms can be fabricated; due to its geometry and its stability, this apex  configuration is well suited for applications as an atomically defined electrical  contact in a single molecule conductivity experiment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Grutter, P.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pn519.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603qz06v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801pg83v"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Biosynthesis of phenolic lipid models using oleyl alcohol and triolein</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lue, Bena-Marie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The overall objective of this study was the optimization of a  model enzymatic system in organic solvent media for the biosynthesis of selected  phenolic lipid compounds. The model enzymatic system consisted of cinnamic acid and  oleyl alcohol as substrates using commercial immobilized lipase (Novozym 435) from  Candida antarctica. The experimental findings showed that an increase in the  hydrophobicity of the solvent mixture and a decrease in the aw values of the  reaction medium increased the initial enzymatic activity and bioconversion yield;  the use of an iso-octane and butanone solvent mixture (85:15, v/v) and an initial aw  of 0.05 resulted in an initial enzymatic activity of 192.7 nmol product/g enzyme/min  and a corresponding bioconversion yield of 95.3% after a 16-day reaction period.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kermasha, S.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612p187.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pg83v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Phenols -- Synthesis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lipase</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plant lipids -- Synthesis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kb345"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Genotoxicity of methylmercury in North American river otters (Lutra canadensis)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Loupelle, Christianne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Methylmercury (MeHg) is the most toxic form of Hg to wildlife,  partly because of its ability to biomagnify through the food chain. Previous studies  have shown that river otter (Lutra canadensis) is particularly susceptible to  increased exposure and body burdens of MeHg due to the piscivorous nature of its  diet. The objectives of this study were to attempt to establish a relationship  between MeHg concentrations in otter tissues and DNA fragmentation using single cell  electrophoresis (comet assay) as well as evaluate the effectiveness of the comet  assay as a tool in genotoxicity assessment in field samples. Results of preliminary  experiments indicate that both time and storage temperature markedly influence the  rate of spontaneous DNA degradation. Increased numbers of freeze/thaw cycling also  appear to have a negative effect on DNA integrity. In addition, a cell culture  experiment was set up to measure the effects of differing levels of MeHg on a  neuroblastoma cell line.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, Laurie Hing Man</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n860s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kb345</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Methylmercury -- Bioaccumulation -- Nova Scotia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lutra canadensis -- Ontario</dc:subject><dc:subject>Methylmercury -- Bioaccumulation -- Ontario</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetic toxicology -- Ontario</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetic toxicology -- Nova Scotia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lutra canadensis -- Nova Scotia</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
