Space mapping methods, the relatively new and very efficient way of optimization which are used in microwave filters and structures will be investigated in this thesis and applied to the time domain optimization of digital interconnects. The main advantage is that the optimization is driven using simpler models called coarse models that would approximate the more complex fine model of the real system, which provide a better insight to the problem and at the same time reduce the optimization time. The results are always mapped back to the real system and a relation/mapping is found between both systems which would help the convergence time. In this thesis, we study the optimization of interconnects where we build certain practical error functions to evaluate performance in the time domain. The space mapping method is formulated to avoid problems found in the original formulation where we apply some necessary modifications to the Trust Region Aggressive Space Mapping TRASM for it to be applicable to the design process in time domain. This new method modified TRASM or MTRASM is then evaluated and tested on multiple circuits with different configuration and the results are compared to the results obtained from TRASM.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w9505394s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/000003513</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Interconnects (Integrated circuit technology) -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Integrated circuits -- Very large scale integration -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881q548"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The component structure of pre-literacy skills : further evidence for the simple view of reading and an exploration of links to parent literacy practices</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Aouad, Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Simple View of Reading (SVR; Gough &amp; Tunmer, 1986) provides a conceptual framework for describing the processes involved when readers comprehend text and strong evidence for the SVR comes from factor analytic studies showing dissociation between decoding and comprehension skills. The aim of the present study was to investigate if pre-decoding and comprehension components exist in Canadian English-speaking pre-readers (n = 36) with the use of Principal Components Analysis and to create a parent literacy questionnaire that contains parent literacy practices that may predict children's pre-decoding and comprehension skills. All children were administered a battery of pre-reading measures and parents completed a literacy survey. Principal Components Analysis demonstrated that listening comprehension and pre-decoding measures loaded as distinct components. The findings provide support for the SVR framework. No clear patterns were identified between parent literacy practices and children's pre-reading skills. Further work is needed with a larger and more representative sample.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jf66f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881q548</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reading comprehension</dc:subject><dc:subject>Word recognition</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qt384"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Exploring older people's everyday experiences of loss in late life</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ferrer, Ilyan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Normative ideas of age and stage-based transitions are built into policies and practices related to aging. However, how the issues of loss and depression impact older people's experiences of transition are often less prevalent. This paper discusses the sub-theme of loss identified within data from the Late Life Transitions Project; a SSHRC funded research project. In this thesis, qualitative interviews were analyzed from 30 community-residing seniors from diverse social backgrounds. Focused exploration of the everyday ways in which older people discussed major transitions and turning points revealed a strong subtheme of loss. Findings presented are related to the types of loss, the various barriers to integrating loss, coping mechanisms and the impact of social location on loss. Such discussions inform understandings of the ways in which older people discuss and make sense of their loss, and may provide guidance to plan interventions that are more relevant to older people's late life experiences.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903348g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qt384</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Life change events</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aging -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Old age -- Social aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gh35q"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Volunteerism in social services : structural determinants to engagement</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Higginson, Carolyn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The relationship between provincial social service spending and subsequent rates of volunteerism in Quebec was evaluated using information contained in a Montreal volunteer database (N = 2784) and revenue and expenditure data from the Department of Finance.

However, much is still needed in the developing world. In this study 153 people living with HIV/AIDS in Egypt were interviewed, along with their caregivers. Data were collected on demographics, burden and strain level of caregivers, as well as psychological, psychosocial and health needs. Using a cross-sectional design, it was found that HIV infection had a negative psychosocial impact on both those infected with and affected by it. Perceived or actual stigma, discrimination, health needs and sexual health status added to this impact. It was also found that caregivers' burden and strain level was higher than a sample of caregivers of renal transplant patients and a sample of caregivers of stroke patients respectively. This suggests that provision of different forms of psychosocial support would help people living with HIV and their caregivers in Egypt cope with the negative impacts of the infection.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bg18r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jx965</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>AIDS (Disease) -- Egypt</dc:subject><dc:subject>Caregivers -- Egypt</dc:subject><dc:subject>HIV infections -- Egypt</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644w19n"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of stigma associated with being older and mentally ill on self-image</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ziv-Yodelevich, Noga</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore and better understand the stigma experienced by a specific subgroup of the population experiencing mental illness---older adults.

Several devices such as the electrolarynx and the tracheo-esophageal valve prosthesis (without oscillation) have been commercialized in order to restore speech. However, such voice restoration prosthesis are still limited for certain patients. The development of a new device using a valve of variable resistance entrained by a linear electromechanical transducer was investigated as a way to produce speech for patients with total laryngectomy (ablation of vocal folds). The concept was to undertake the design of a varying air flow resistance valve, built around existing Blom-Singer valves. The oscillating valve features a spherical head making it possible to block the opening in the wall between the trachea and the esophagus in a sinusoidal periodic fashion. A physical model of the vocal tract was built and used for preliminary in-vitro verification studies. The relationship between pressure and flow rate through the valve was determined from pressure measurements. The orifice discharge coefficient of the orifice was then calculated and the parameters of a variable resistor model were identified. Radiated sound pressure produced from the change in flow rate at the valve orifice was then compared to the original voice output to assess the accuracy of the design prototype. Results showed that the forced oscillating valve prosthesis model has lower power efficiency but can produce better sound quality than the electrolarynx.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2774013x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wh09t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Laryngectomy -- rehabilitation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prosthesis Design</dc:subject><dc:subject>Larynx, Artificial</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zm24w"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mobility, risk and closure : unaccompanied and separated child asylum-seekers and the construction of &amp;quot;risk identity&amp;quot;</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bryan Catherine A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to decipher the means by which the identities of particular people, specifically unaccompanied and separated child asylum-seekers, are socially constructed as risk. Theorized here as "risk identity", this has occurred within a global context increasingly preoccupied with security. Racialized and imbued with ideological notions of citizenship, this preoccupation and the anxieties contained within it, are effectively yet unduly transferred onto individuals, who for a variety of reasons not innately related to security, are seen as undesirable. The "risk identity" classification becomes the means by Which their exclusion is legitimized and perpetuated. The increased movement of unaccompanied and separated children across international borders has occurred within this global context. Positioned largely in opposition to citizens of the industrialized west, unaccompanied and separated children seeking asylum in Canada are constructed as risk in myriad ways. Based on 13 interviews, 9 with stakeholders and 4 with youth, this study highlights four interconnected categories of risk, which serve to construct unaccompanied and separated minors as risk. These are anti-refugee discourse, anti-youth discourse, as it relates to juvenile justice discourse, prejudicial attitudes and the fear of difference, and securitization discourse.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591c60f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zm24w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Refugee children -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Discrimination -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Abandoned children -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247dw82t"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Long-term supply mix planning of power systems accounting for greenhouse gas emissions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Momen, Mustafa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent scientific findings have generated considerable concern about the adverse effect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the world's climate in general and global warming in particular. In Canada and many other countries, this concern has led to the adoption of legal and political steps with the aim of curbing GHG emissions. The first part of this thesis describes the steps taken by Canada in this regard. Such steps provide a strong incentive to Canadian power systems to incorporate reduction of GHG emissions in their planning process. Thus, in the second part of the thesis, a long-term supply mix planning model is developed. Since significant decrease in GHG emissions is unlikely to occur without removal of highly polluting power plants, this model allows for decommissioning these power plants. Finally, the supply mix planning model is applied to evaluate the strategy of joint planning (as opposed to separate planning) of the power systems of Quebec and Ontario. Results obtained from the model leads to the conclusion that joint planning is preferable from the point of view of overall social and financial cost.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v628p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247dw82t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Greenhouse gas mitigation -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric power production -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric utilities -- Canada -- Management</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848t99g"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Discrete-time crossing-point estimation for switching power converters</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Smecher, Graeme</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a number of electrical engineering problems, so-called "crossing points" -- the instants at which two continuous-time signals cross each other -- are of interest. Often, particularly in applications using a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), only periodic samples along with a partial statistical characterization of the signals are available. In this situation, we are faced with the following problem: Given limited information about these signals, how can we efficiently and accurately estimate their crossing points? For example, an audio amplifier typically receives its input from a digital source decoded into regular samples (e.g. from MP3, DVD, or CD audio), or obtained from a continuous-time signal using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In a switching amplifier based on Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) or Click Modulation (CM), a signal derived from the sampled audio is compared against a deterministic reference waveform; the crossing points of these signals control a switching power stage. Crossing-point estimates must be accurate in order to preserve audio quality. They must also be simple to calculate, in order to minimize processing requirements and delays. We consider estimating the crossing points of a known function and a Gaussian random process, given uniformly-spaced, noisy samples of the random process for which the second-order statistics are assumed to be known. We derive the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimator, along with a Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) estimator which we show to be a computationally efficient approximation to the MAP estimator. We also derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on estimator variance for the problem, which allows practical estimators to be evaluated against a best-case performance limit. We investigate several comparison estimators chosen from the literature. The structure of the MMSE estimator and comparison estimators is shown to be very similar, making the difference in computational expense between each technique largely dependent on the cost of evaluating various (generally non-linear) functions. Simulations for both Pulse-Width and Click Modulation scenarios show the MMSE estimator performs very near to the Cramer-Rao bound and outperforms the alternative estimators selected from the literature.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30px32x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848t99g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Digital-to-analog converters</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pulse-duration modulation -- Mathematics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Analog-to-digital converters</dc:subject><dc:subject>Signal processing -- Digital techniques -- Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257j29p"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Computationally efficient approaches for blind adaptive beamforming in SIMO-OFDM systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gao, Bo, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), adaptive beamforming at the receiver side can be used to combat the effect of directional co-channel interference (CCI). Since pilot-aided beamforming suffers from consuming precious channel bandwidth, there has been much interest in blind beamforming approaches that can adapt their weights by restoring certain properties of the transmitted signals. Within this class of blind algorithms, the recursive least squares constant modulus algorithm (RLS-CMA) is of particular interest due to its good overall CCI cancelation performance and fast convergence. Nevertheless, the direct use of RSL-CMA within a SIMO-OFDM receiver induces considerable computational complexity, since a distinct copy of the RLS-CMA must be run on each individual sub-carriers. In this thesis, we present two approaches to reduce the computational complexity of SIMO-OFDM beamforming based on the RLS-CMA, namely: frequency interpolation and distributed processing. The former approach, which exploits the coherence bandwidth of the broadband wireless channels, divides the sub-carriers into several contiguous groups and applies the RLS-CMA to a selected sub-carrier in each group. The weight vectors at other frequencies are then obtained by interpolation. The distributed processing approach relies on the partitioning of the receiving array into sub-arrays and the use of a special approximation in the RLS-CMA. This allows a partial decoupling of the algorithm which can then be run on multiple processors with reduced overall complexity. This approach is well-suited to collaborative beamforming i~ multi-node distributed relaying. Through numerical simulation experiments of a SIMO-OFDM system, it is demonstrated that the proposed modifications to the RLS-CMA scheme can lead to substantial computational savings with minimal losses in adaptive cancelation performance.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f953n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257j29p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wireless communication systems</dc:subject><dc:subject>Beamforming</dc:subject><dc:subject>Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adaptive antennas</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abk128f530"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Legal aspects of safety management systems and human factors in air traffic control</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Maldonado, Michelle M., 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The job of an air traffic controller is stressful by nature. Conditions like aircraft congestion in the skies, an outdated air traffic system and understaffing at control centers can add to the daily stresses of controllers and often cause fatigue. These conditions describe the current status of Air Traffic Services (ATS) in the United States. If left unaddressed, they could compromise safety, the primary objective of air traffic control. The purpose of this thesis is to assess the regulatory framework surrounding ATS specifically in the area of Safety Management Systems (SMS) and Human Factors and determine the course of action to be taken to improve safety in air traffic control. This thesis begins with a description of what air traffic controllers do and the issues that ATS face in the U.S. It then examines the regulatory framework of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the U.S. regarding ATS, specifically SMS and Human Factors. A comparison is made between the privatized air traffic system of Canada and the government owned air traffic system of the U.S. and how privatization makes a difference economically, politically and legally when implementing standards and regulations and enforcing them. Finally, suggestions are made in order to improve the legal framework of air traffic services in the U.S.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214s708.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128f530</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Air traffic controllers -- Employment</dc:subject><dc:subject>Air traffic rules</dc:subject><dc:subject>Air traffic control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics -- Human factors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Air traffic controllers -- Legal status, laws, etc</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics -- Safety measures</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418r762"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Satellite placement using a partial space elevator</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Woo, Pamela</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The space elevator has been proposed as an alternate method for launching cargo into space. However, the construction of such a structure requires a material much stronger than any currently in existence. Instead, a partial elevator is considered for satellite placement. In the first part of the thesis, the fundamentals of very long tethered systems are studied. From static analysis on a simple two-body system, it is demonstrated that an assumption made in the conventional analysis does not apply to very long tethered systems. For a uniform tether, the axial stress distribution is obtained. Following the Lagrangian approach, the equations of motion governing the planar librations of a multi-body tethered system are derived. From a linearization of these equations, the libration frequencies are found. Then, by solving the nonlinear equations numerically, the responses to various changes in the system parameters are determined. In the second part of the thesis, the use of a partial elevator in satellite placement is studied. In the case of single climber transit, residual librations occur, which alter the shape and size of the orbit of a satellite launched from the climber. An approach using two climbers is investigated in order to decrease the residual libration and thereby reduce orbit placement errors. Also, some energy calculations are done to determine whether the partial elevator offers significant advantages.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x4763.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418r762</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tethered satellites</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tethered space vehicles -- Dynamics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Artificial satellites -- Launching</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak35697756"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The experience and perceived benefits of students with intellectual disabilities acting as tutors : an interpretative phenomenological analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Borisov, Christine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigated the reported benefits of adolescent students with an intellectual disability as tutors or teacher assistants in physical education.

Results suggested that children with DCD have not developed accurate and consistent movement patterns.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mg40p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558h623</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eye-hand coordination</dc:subject><dc:subject>Developmental disabilities</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af4752m39d"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La domesticité juvénile en Haïti : une vision à travers la lentille du pluralisme juridique</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Clouet, Johanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we present the outcomes of a research conducted on children's domestic labor in Haiti. In addition to being engaged in housekeeping work -- which has a negative impact on access to basic education -- children in domesticity are generally victims of harmful disciplinary measures as well. Consequently, our main objective is to expose the actual norms and practices regarding the education and the physical treatment of young domestic workers. Based on legal pluralism, the approach undertaken during this research combines both theoretical and empirical research, and focuses on law and norms existing at multiple levels. First, we present the information gathered from our theoretical approach. After exploring the notion of "Haitian child domestic servant", sketching social profiles of actors engaged in the practice of domesticity, and identifying the most significant contingent factors, we underline the principal national and international norms guaranteeing children the right to education as well as to physical integrity. Second, we explore the local norms related to the education and to physical treatment of young domestic servants through the results of empirical research carried out in Haiti in the form of observation and interviews with relevant actors. We conclude by identifying the framework of norms that govern the behaviour of families that host domestic children. Understanding that framework allows jurists and other actors to identify and implement the actions more likely to improve the quality of life of child domestic workers.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vp49d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752m39d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Household employees -- Legal status, laws, etc</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children -- Legal status, laws, etc</dc:subject><dc:subject>Educational law and legislation -- Haiti</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child labor -- Law and legislation -- Haiti</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Haiti</dc:subject><dc:subject>Household employees -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Haiti</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child labor -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Educational law and legislation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A765374424"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Biochemical system simulation on a heterogeneous multicore processor</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Al Assaad, Sevin, 1984-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Biological system simulation is an increasingly popular field of study that provides biologists with the tools necessary to simulate biochemical systems in order to obtain quantitative models.

It simulates molecular diffusion via Brownian movements, and particle interactions are dependent on their locations. We present here a parallel adaptation of the algorithm, implemented on a heterogeneous multicore processor, i.e. IBM Cell Broadband Engine (CBE).

Using chemically similar alkylthiols it was possible to study the reaction in the absence of perturbing factors, enabling detailed mechanistic and kinetic studies to be explored. It is found that the reactions are zero order in incoming ligand and overall follow a second order diffusion limited Langmuir rate law. In the case where there is little chemical distinction between the incoming and capping ligands, the reactions proceed to an endpoint consistent with a Keq=1. The rate of the reaction is dependent on the chain length of the capping ligand and the AuNP core size. The related dialkyldisulphide for-alkylthiol AuNP exchange reaction is consistent with the same rate law and also proceeds to a well-defined endpoint. However, the rate constant is 20-fold less than the alkylthiol case. These results lead to a convergent model of PERs where the rate limiting process involves both incoming and outgoing ligands, with diffusion of the incoming ligand to the AuNP surface as the major controlling factor of the reaction rate.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149t11z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806356x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Monomolecular films</dc:subject><dc:subject>Colloidal gold</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gold films</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thiols</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nanoparticles</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445ch74n"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 in post-natal cartilage and bone metabolism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Valverde Franco, Gladys, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>FGFR 3 is one of a family of four high affinity receptors for FGF ligands. Activating mutations in FGFR 3 result in skeletal dysplasias that vary in severity from undetectable to neonatal lethal. Mice with congenital deficiency of FGFR3 develop severe kyphosis and skeletal overgrowth. FGFR3 is also expressed in calvarial pre-osteoblasts, osteoblast and articular chondrocytes, although it biological role in these cells remains undefined. By changing the genetic background of the Fgfr3-/- mice we were able to extend their lifespan and examine its impact on post-natal skeletal growth. To investigate the implication of FGFR 3 in post-natal cartilage and bone metabolism we used a combination of imaging, classic histology, molecular biology and biomechanical testing. The results demonstrated that the synovial joints of young adult Fgfr3-/- mice revealed a progressive deterioration, loss of the joint space width and changes in the subchondral bone. These alterations were accompanied by an increase of cartilage matrix degradation. Increased aggrecan and collagen type II degradation products, generated by MMPs were detected with DIAPEN and COL2-3/4C antibodies. Increased collagen type X, cellular hypertrophy and loss of proteoglycan at the articular surface were also demonstrated. A novel micro-mechanical indentation protocol revealed that the humeral heads of Fgfr3-/- mice were less stiff than those of wild type littermates. On the other hand, young adult Fgfr3-/- mice are osteopenic due to reduced cortical bone thickness and defective trabecular bone mineralization. The reduction in mineralized bone and lack of trabecular connectivity observed by micro-computed tomography were confirmed by histological and histomorphometric analyses, which revealed a significant decrease in calcein labeling of mineralizing surfaces and a significant increase in osteoid in the long bones of 4-month-old Fgfr3-/- mice. Primary cultures of adherent bone marrow-derived cells from Fgfr3-/- mice expressed markers of differentiated osteoblasts but developed fewer mineralized nodules than Fgfr3+/+ cultures of the same age. These data point to a major role for FGFR3 signaling in development and homeostatic maintenance of cartilage and bone post-natally and identify FGFR3 as a potential target for intervention in degenerative disorders of cartilage, osteopenia and those associated with defective bone mineralization.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q5100.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445ch74n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mice, Transgenic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bone and Bones -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cartilage -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 -- genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bone Diseases, Developmental -- genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225f58m"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Strategic Genco offers in electric energy markets cleared by merit order</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hasan, Ebrahim A. Rahman</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In an electricity market cleared by merit-order economic dispatch we identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which the market outcomes supported by pure strategy Nash equilibria (NE) exist when generating companies (Gencos) game through continuously variable incremental cost (IC) block offers. A Genco may own any number of units, each unit having multiple blocks with each block being offered at a constant IC. Next, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) scheme devoid of approximations or iterations is developed to identify all possible NE. The MILP scheme is systematic and general but computationally demanding for large systems. Thus, an alternative significantly faster lambda-iterative approach that does not require the use of MILP was also developed. Once all NE are found, one critical question is to identify the one whose corresponding gaming strategy may be considered by all Gencos as being the most rational. To answer this, this thesis proposes the use of a measure based on the potential profit gain and loss by each Genco for each NE. The most rational offer strategy for each Genco in terms of gaming or not gaming that best meets their risk/benefit expectations is the one corresponding to the NE with the largest gain to loss ratio. The computation of all NE is tested on several systems of up to ninety generating units, each with four incremental cost blocks. These NE are then used to examine how market power is influenced by market parameters, specifically, the number of competing Gencos, their size and true ICs, as well as the level of demand and price cap.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36v195s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225f58m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electric utilities -- Rates -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oligopolies -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric utilities -- Costs -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Game theory</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214s71j"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Expression of a Brassica napus mitochondrial gene region associated with cytoplasmic male sterility : transcript initiation, editing, splicing and nuclease processing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Elina, Helen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited trait of higher plants that can be suppressed by nuclear restorers of fertility ( Rf) genes that normally down-regulate the expression of a CMS-associated mitochondrial gene. In Brassica napus, nap CMS is associated with the expression of the orf222/nad5c/orf2101 mitochondrial gene region and is suppressed by the restorer gene Rfn. I present here an extensive analysis of the expression of the orf222/nad5c/orf2101 region in nap CMS and fertility-restored plants. Using RT-PCR methodology, I mapped transcript initiation sites, processing sites, and 3' termini. I identified two processing events, one within and one immediately downstream of orf222, that are specific to fertility restored plants and I suggest possible mechanisms by which the Rfn protein may recognize cognate RNA substrates. Unexpectedly, I also found that levels of atp8 transcripts are much lower in CMS than in restored plants. nad5c, one of the components of the nap CMS-associated region, is the small central exon of the nad5 gene. In higher plants, nad5c transcripts must be joined to exons b and d through two group II intron trans-splicing events. I found that in the dicot Brassica and the monocot wheat, proper splicing requires exon c and d joining occur prior to the splicing of c with b. Joining of c to a/b transcripts prior to c/d splicing results exclusively in mis-spliced products in which the 5' end of c is joined to cryptic sites within exon b. It is suggested that intron sequences downstream of c base-pair with exon a, leading to mis-folding of the b/c intron and mis-splicing. In Oenothera, where the c/d intron is further fragmented into a tri-partite intron, mis-splicing does not occur. I suggest that avoidance of mis-splicing may be a factor that drives fragmentation of trans -splicing group II introns and may have contributed to the eventual evolution of spliceosomal RNAs from a group II intron precursor.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752m405.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214s71j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cytoplasmic male sterility</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rape (Plant) -- Cytogenetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289n46v"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Signalling and mediators of Angiopoietin-1 in endothelial cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abdel Malak, Nelly</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), the main ligand for the endothelial cell (EC)-selective Tie-2 receptors, promotes survival, proliferation, migration and differentiation of these cells. Despite its importance in various aspects of vascular biology, the mechanisms of action of the Ang-1/Tie-2 receptor pathway have not been fully explored. To identify the downstream modulators of Ang-1, we evaluated changes in the transcriptome of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with Ang-1 protein for four hours by employing the oligonucleotide rnicroarray technology. Eighty-six genes were significantly upregulated by this treatment and forty-nine genes were significantly downregulated. These genes are involved in the regulation of cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, transcription and differentiation. Furthermore, we found that the Erk1/2, PI3-Kinase and mTOR pathways are implicated in promoting gene expression in HUVECs in response to Ang-1. Analysis of the microarray data employing the Ingenuity Pathways analysis software to place the regulated genes in the context of biological networks revealed several highly connected nodes including the chemokine Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and the transcription factor Early growth response-1 (Egr-1). Due to the importance of these genes in promoting angiogenesis, we decided to evaluate their roles in Ang-1/Tie-2 receptor signaling and biological effects. Ang-1 induced IL-8 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner in ECs through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. To study the functional role of Ang-1-induced IL-8, we generated HUVECs that overexpress Ang-1. In these cells, neutralizing IL-8 significantly reduced EC proliferation and migration. IL-8 promoter activity experiments and gel shift assays revealed the involvement of the transcription factor AP-1 in Ang-1-induced IL-8. Ang-1 stimulated the phosphorylation of c-Jun through activation of Erk1/2, JNK and PI-3 kinase pathways. Similarly, Ang-1 provoked the expression and DNA binding of Egr-1 in HUVECs. Employing siRNA and DNAzyme to specifically knock-down Egr-1, we found that Ang-1-induced Egr-1 also promotes EC proliferation and migration. We conclude that Ang-1 provokes a coordinated response intended to promote EC survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis and to inhibit EC apoptosis. Ang-1 induces EC proliferation and migration in part through the secretion of the soluble mediator Interleukin-8 and through induction of the transcription factor Egr-1.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xq18h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289n46v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Interleukin-8 -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Endothelial Cells -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Umbilical Veins -- cytology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Early Growth Response Protein 1 -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Angiopoietin-1 -- metabolism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214s72t"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Geomechanical behaviour of biaxially loaded rock</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yun, Xiaoyou, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The stress state at the boundary of any underground mine opening is that of plane stress. This planar state of stress can be simulated in laboratory by subjecting a cubic rock specimen to a biaxial loading condition. Thus, research on the behaviour of biaxially loaded rock is important for better understanding of the stability of mining fronts such as crown pillar skin, drift face or shaft floor. The objective of this research is to study the geomechanical behaviour of biaxially loaded rock. Three rock types were selected, namely limestone, granite and sandstone. The laboratory work was conducted using a newly developed, 500-tonne biaxial loading frame, that is equipped with a servo-controlled load and displacement system. Recently patented in China, the new biaxial loading frame is spatially symmetric and equally rigid in both directions. Steel brush platens and solid platens with and without MoS2 were developed to help examine the end friction effect on biaxial strength. It is found that the biaxial strength can decrease up to 26.7% with the increase of cubic specimen size from 75 mm to 150 mm. The biaxial strength increases by 29.3% with the increase of loading rate from 1 MPa/s to 10 MPa/s, for granite. The biaxial strength of granite specimen decreases by nearly 6% when either solid platens with MoS 2 lubricant or brush platens are used. A comparison of the sigma 1-sigma2 failure envelopes reveals that the shape of the envelope and the location of the peak biaxial strength are dependent on the rock type. Varying intensities of rock spalling generally initiate at the free faces of the specimen when sigma1 and sigma2 exceed sigma c/2. Ultimate failure occurs in the form of an out-of-plane shear failure, which splits the rock specimen into two or more wedges. It is shown that both Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown criteria underestimate the biaxial strength of the rock. The Drucker-Prager failure criterion appears to provide poor correlation with experimental results. A new empirical biaxial rock failure criterion for intact rock is derived and another, accounting for rock mass characteristics through the Geological Strength Index (GSI), is then proposed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94ht173.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214s72t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rock deformation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Axial loads</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qw28q"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Consolidation of clay-granular medium composites</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ghiabi, Hani</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis deals with the study of soil composites that are constructed by combining regions of soft clay and granular materials in various spatial configurations. The underlying basis for the work stems from the practical application of the results of the research to offshore land reclamation practices. Due to depletion of local coarse-grained soil sources and the high cost of imported granular fill, the use of dredged and excavated marine clay has become the preferred source of materials in reclamation activities. A common reclamation technique involves placing dredged clay lumps directly on top of other layers; these lumpy fills contain large initial inter-lump voids with the result that the fills experience substantial compression purely due to the closure of the void space. A practical solution therefore is to fill the void space with a granular soil to enhance the load-carrying capacity and to minimize the settlements of the reclaimed fills. In this research a coordinated experimental investigation was undertaken to examine the consolidation behavior of composites fabricated using a number of spherical and disk-shaped clay inclusions placed within an artificial granular medium (ballotini). The results of this experimental research program indicated that the volume fraction, shape, configuration and the constitutive properties of both the clay inclusions and the granular component are all important factors that could affect the mechanical response of the soil composites. A computational scheme, validated using the results of the bench-scale experiments, was used to analyze the response of an idealized composite lumpy fill subjected to self-weight stresses, surcharge and a load applied through a rigid footing. The computational results indicated that the consolidation behavior of the composite lumpy layers can be significantly influenced by the volume proportion, location and configuration of the clay inclusions interspersed within the granular fill. The incorporation of the constitutive behaviors of the soil components, used in reclamation activities, into such a computational analysis could assist engineers in designing reclaimed fills where the least ultimate settlement occurs within the shortest time.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107260x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qw28q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reclamation of land</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soil mechanics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Clay soils</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pf12h"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Spatial scale and the ecological determinants of the distribution and diversity of fishes in Ontario lakes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gardezi, Tariq</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Data on the occurrence of freshwater fishes in Ontario lakes were used to evaluate the scale of the processes that are primarily responsible for shaping their distributions and patterns of diversity. In Chapter 2 it is shown that, regardless of the scale of analysis, the most important factors structuring their distributions are climatic measures of energy, suggesting that species tend to be able to survive heterogeneous conditions falling within large areas encompassing their climatic affinities. In Chapter 3 it is shown that the relationship between species richness and energy (annual potential evapotranspiration) changes according to the scale on which it is measured. The species-energy relationship is weak at the local scale and stronger and steeper at increasing regional scales. This scale dependence is due to the ability of high energy regions to accommodate relatively large numbers of rare or infrequent species, and reflects the regional scale at which species respond to environmental gradients, particularly those related to energy. In Chapter 4 the relationship between local and regional species richness is examined. It is found that mean richness of lakes is linearly related to the species richness of the watersheds in which they reside. Together, the results point to the importance of processes that are regional in scale for shaping species' distributions and patterns of diversity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x477c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pf12h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Freshwater fishes -- Variation -- Ontario</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freshwater fishes -- Ontario -- Geographical distribution</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freshwater biodiversity -- Ontario</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
