The question is examined through three independent yet interrelated motifs: the legend of the Golem, the symbol of the Western Wall in Jerusalem, and the literature of Franz Kafka. An understanding of these three motifs, in all their implications, can provide valuable commentary and insightful reflections so that a discourse on a possible moral and ethical ground for affirmative creation can be engaged. It is imperative, in light of the destructive potentiality of our creative making, to address this discourse if architecture is to regain cultural relevance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts41d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq55w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kafka, Franz, 1883-1924</dc:subject><dc:subject>Golem</dc:subject><dc:subject>Western Wall (Jerusalem)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816n33f"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language/><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Prelude, chorale and fantasy : Ecclesiastes 12</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Howard, Chris, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Prelude, Chorale and Fantasy is a tonally conceived work for orchestra with a duration of approximately twenty minutes which uses as its inspiration the final chapter of Ecclesiastes. It is constructed from a relatively small number of germinal elements which function throughout the work as connecting forces and icons. In it can be found musical ideas used to represent the Trinity, the most significant of which are the quotations of the hymn "How Brightly Shines the Morning Star" which appear throughout. A greater understanding of the work can be gained by approaching it first on a philosophical level, making connections between the Biblical text and the music and extrapolating from those connections. Following this, a step by step analysis will show the microscopic structure of the work and its relationship to the larger form.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z1673.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816n33f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music -- Manuscripts -- Facsimiles</dc:subject><dc:subject>Howard, Christopher A., 1967- -- Manuscripts -- Facsimiles</dc:subject><dc:subject>Orchestral music -- Scores</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hg338"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Entomology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Seuil économique et programme d'échantillonnage séquentiel pour le thrips de l'oignon (Thrips tabaci Lindeman) sur l'oignon</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fournier, François</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Very high infestation levels of Thrips tabaci Lindeman were observed on onions at Ste-Clotilde (Quebec) with seasonal means of 149 and 161 thrips/plant for 1988 and 1989 respectively. No significant differences in thrips densities were detected among six yellow onion cultivars (Capable, Flame, Norstar, Progress, Rocket, Taurus) through weekly comparisons in 1988 and biweekly comparisons in 1989. A new variable, the cumulative number of thrips-days/plant, was used to model the impact of T. tabaci on onion yields. This variable allowed for better-fitted models, especially in 1989 where greater variability of the onion yields was observed. A modified Gompertz equation gave the best fit for 1988. No yield reduction due to T. tabaci was observed up to the 1000 cumulative thrips-days/plant point, beyond which the thrips impact first increased with the feeding pressure and then gradually decreased to a minimal level corresponding to a yield loss of 43%. In 1989, thrips impact was immediate and best described by an exponential model with a maximal yield loss of 34,5%. Economic thresholds of 964 and 251 cumulative thrips-days/plant were calculated for 1988 and 1989 respectively. Converted to thrips/leaf these correspond to 2,2 and 0,9 thrips/leaf. This conversion could facilitate their use in a field situation. Spatial distribution of T. tabaci was analyzed in ten commercial onion fields. Within field, density was homogeneous in the majority of cases. In some fields, higher thrips densities were temporary (two consecutive weeks at most) in one or two field margins. The Iwao method was used to calculate the acceptance boundaries of sequential sampling plans for the economic thresholds of 0,9 and 2,2 thrips/leaf and onion growth stages of 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 green leaves.

It is apparent throughout the present study that the method of Muslim learning is not simply a technique by which a student seeks to deal, in an appropriate manner, with any academic assignment, but rather, an approach, the very heart of which rests on the problem of ethics, which brings a student into a situation where he maintains his commitment to God, his respect to his teacher, and his invigorated desire in the search for knowledge. The fundamental reason for such an approach to learning is that knowledge ('ilm) in Islam is placed in a religiously special position in that it is recognized as derived from God and given by Him for the nobility of human beings, so that the search for knowledge is a part of the Muslim's religious manifestations of submission to God ('ibadah li-Allah).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Adams, Charles J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb3979160.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247ds915</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zarnūjī, Burhān al-Dīn, 12th/13th cent.

The analysis is based on an elitist perspective which permits a more satisfactory integration of all levels of Somali society than is possible with familiar "clanist" or "social theory" interpretations. The paper gives details of the three leading ideological groups in Somalia over the past three decades--the Tribalists, Nationalists and Islamists. It demonstrates how the future of the nationalists' imported models of government and policies to contain tribalism culminated in the re-emergence of tribalism, now in more militant political form. The author presents Islam as an important political component and analyses the Islamic Movement in Somalia as a potential alternative political force for the future. The Islamists may be successful if they overcome internal divisions, personality cults and isolation from society, and adopt a moderate realistic attitude on social issues.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s5665.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wg76x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islam and politics -- Somalia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tribes -- Somalia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881m81j"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The analysis of case-cohort studies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Seshadri, Usha</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Epidemiologic cohort studies often require a follow-up of and obtaining exposure and confounder information for several thousand subjects. This process can be time consuming and expensive. A sampling scheme which reduces costs is the case-cohort design. It involves obtaining exposure and confounder information for all cases and a random sample of the remainder of the cohort. In this thesis we consider the analysis of data from a case-cohort sample under the assumptions of a proportional hazards model. Specifically we review and describe techniques for point and interval estimation of parameters and tests of hypotheses first for a full cohort, then for a case-cohort sample.

The effects of these two pathologic entities on the cytolytic activity of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were investigated. Left lung allotransplantation was performed on sixteen mongrel dogs of which twelve were available for complete studies. All animals received cyclosporine A, azathioprine and prednisone for 2 weeks. Four grafts developed left lower lobe Gram negative pneumonia. The eight remaining recipients progressed gradually to severe rejection following acute reduction of immunosuppression. Cytolytic activity of blood and left lung BAL lymphocytes was quantitated by the natural killer (NK) and lectin dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (LDCMC) assays. Two additional groups serving as controls were either given a ten day course of immunosuppressants or had right lower lobe pneumonia induced by transbronchial inoculation of gram negative bacteria. Immunosuppressed control animals showed significant depression of PBL and BAL lymphocyte LDCMC and NK activity. Similarly, BAL lymphocytes expressed very low LDCMC in normal allografts (2.8 $ pm$.8%). Once rejection developed and progressed, LDCMC became significantly higher (15.6 $ pm$ 2.2% and 52.7 $ pm$ 2.8% in moderate and severe rejection respectively). There was no detectable NK activity in rejecting lung allografts. BAL lymphocytes from infected allografts, on the other hand, showed an elevation of both NK and LDCMC activity (9.1 $ pm$ 1.1% and 14.6 $ pm$ 1.0% respectively). Similarly, bacterial pneumonia in control animals manifested an increase in NK and LDCMC activity in lung and blood. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of lung allograft recipients, however, had increased NK and LDCMC activity in both rejection and infection. LDCMC/NK activity ratio (LM/NK index) of lung lymphocytes was significantly higher in rejecting allografts (11.2 $ pm$ 1.0 and 12.4 $ pm$ 1.6 for moderate and sev</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shennib, Hani</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cr24r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494936q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab8515p219"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Role of atrial natriuretic factor in experimental high-output heart failure</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Qing, Gefei</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It has been hypothesized that the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure (CHF) may be due to a relative deficiency of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and/or blunted responsiveness to ANF in this state. The work presented in this thesis evaluates the role of ANF in rats with chronic moderate high-output heart failure by (1) characterizing plasma and tissue ANF levels, hemodynamics and renal function at different stages of the development of heart failure; (2) assessing the contribution of the atria and ventricles to plasma ANF levels; and (3) investigating the role of ANF and renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) in rats with aorto-caval (A-C) shunts. Chronically increased cardiac filling pressure stimulated not only ANF release but also ANF synthesis in each cardiac chamber. This in turn contributed to elevated plasma ANF levels in A-C shunt rats. An attenuated renal response to endogenous ANF and sodium and water retention were apparent in A-C shunt rats. Under inhibition of RAS, plasma ANF may exert its actions more effectively. Thus, chronic ACE inhibition and ANG II receptor antagonism improved hemodynamic conditions, diminished water retention, reversed cardiac hypertrophy, and restored plasma and tissue ANF to more "normal" levels in rats with moderate high-output heart failure. Taken together, elevated plasma ANF levels may play an important role in maintaining hemodynamic and body fluid homeostasis by opposing the neurohormonal vasoconstrictor systems in A-C shunt rats. However, a relative deficiency of plasma ANF and/or an attenuated response to endogenous ANF, mediated by activated neurohormonal vasoconstrictor systems, may contribute to the pathophysiology and development of heart failure at different stages.

Cytokines IL-2, TNF-a and IFN-g were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and plasma samples at 1, 4, 24 hours and 1 week postoperatively. In the allograft there was an early postoperative increase in all cytokines in BAL which decreased after 24 hours. The same trend was seen for IL-2 in the autograft. In contrast, TNF-a and IFN-g levels in the autograft remained unchanged. Using immunohistochemical staining techniques, MHC II antigen expression was observed on lung allograft bronchial epithelium which was less intense in the autograft. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung biopsies revealed early evidence of lung injury and also grade 1-2 rejection after 1 week in the allograft. Injury was not as severe in the autograft. We conclude that a temporary elevation of cytokines early after allotransplantation is partly due to ischemia/reperfusion injury and graft allogenicity. This early cytokine release may play an important role in the development of early graft dysfunction and rejection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shennib, Hani</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161705t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jh343t02g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t007d"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>What are biological species? : the impact of the current debate in taxonomy on the species problem</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Leroux, Nicole</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>For the past twenty years, taxonomy has been in a state of turmoil.
