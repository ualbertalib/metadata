To some, the French Revolution was incontrovertible evidence that the Day of Judgement was near, and that the end of the century would coincide with the end of time. To others, elaborate mathematical calculations produced the same conclusion. Many writers became self-proclaimed prophets who depicted new revelation of the future in detail, and their audience became a culture of anticipation who eagerly awaited the fruition of prophecy and the descent of the New Jerusalem. William Blake was at once related and opposed to this Literature of Anticipation. The collection of illuminated texts known as his "Bible of Hell" adopts the familiar form of prophecy, but acerbically criticizes the action---or inaction---of Blake's contemporaries, and seriously questions the foundation of Christian theology and the beneficence of the Christian God. What emerges from Blake's Bible is a concept of prophecy that stresses an immediacy of vision in sharp contrast with the fruitless waiting of millennialist prophets, and an internal locus of responsibility that dissolves all ties to tyrannical authority.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Treadwell, James</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pv45k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xd46x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Blake, William, 1757-1827 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prophecy in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv935476r"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Does virtue ethics contribute to medical ethics? : an examination of Stanley Hauerwas' ethics of virtue and its relevance to medical ethics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jotterand, Fabrice, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this thesis is to examine the concept of virtue ethics in Stanley Hauerwas's understanding of virtue and delineate how that contributes to his ethical reasoning and his comprehension of medical ethics. The first chapter focuses on the shift that occurred in moral theory under the stance of the Enlightenment that eroded the traditional idea of morality as the formation of the self, allowing space for new concepts that dismissed the importance of the agent in the ethical task of seeking the good. In the second chapter, the three main ideas (character, vision, and narrative) that make up Hauerwas' ethical theory are examined with a particular attention to the importance of agency in moral life. The third chapter describes how Hauerwas' medical ethics, informed by his moral theory based on character, vision, and narrative, is relevant to medical ethics. Hauerwas argues that because medicine is a form of human activity with internal goods and standards of excellence intrinsic to its practice, it requires taking into account the notion of agency in the healing relationship. Finally, in the last chapter the specific religious discourse of Hauerwas' ethics is discussed in relation to secular medical ethics. In other words, this thesis raises the question of whether the reduction of medical ethics to a set of principles, as it is mostly the case today, represents a suitable picture of the reality of moral life in medicine.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baum, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k442p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935476r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, General</dc:subject><dc:subject>Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>History, Asia, Australia and Oceania</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wf56s"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Jewish Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Engagement and dialogue : pluralism in the thought of Joseph B.

Soloveitchik," run two concerns: Soloveitchik's epistemology and metaphysics, and his account of inter-religious dialogue. Critically and creatively engaging important currents in twentieth century thought such as Neo-Kantianism, phenomenology, pragmatism, and post-classical physics, Soloveitchik borrows and combines elements from each, developing a position that emphasizes the close connection between the human way of knowing and reality's way of being. Developed in his early writings, his epistemology and metaphysics bring together the constructive and receptive elements proper to cognitive experience and describe reality as processive, multi-dimensional, and capable of being handled according to different systems of thought. In his later writings, no longer concerned with refining his philosophical system, Soloveitchik considers the status of inter-religious dialogue. Distinguishing between participation in the general cultural enterprise of humankind and inter-religious dialogue, Soloveitchik contends that members of different faith communities are mandated to confront one another and acknowledge the uniqueness of their different faith commitments and theological logoi . Soloveitchik's epistemological pluralism and the metaphysics underlying it thus complement his later and sometimes ambiguous avowal of religious pluralism and parity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levy, B.

In the first novel of this cycle, cinema occupies such an important place as a theme that it influences the characters' life. In the two other novels, it appears less as a theme than through cinematographical devices that transform the author's literary style. This thesis attempts to explain in what way cinema influences the novelistic writing of Marguerite Duras.

The purpose of this thesis is to explore otherness from a closer point of view by analysing the discursive allusions of the inhabitants of the South of the French Kingdom, particularly those of the "Province de Languedoc" throughout a collection of texts from the second half of the 16th century, whether they be strictly of a literary, historical or geographical source. Using the imagology method, the idea of the South being a key space in the emergence of the French identity is challenged. First of all, the South legislates as a land of industrious administrators. However, even if it shows a claim for independence---a secularly evidenced fact---it nevertheless remains subject to the French Crown. Southerners, with identical customs as those of the French, are already part of this political entity. Schismatic area par excellence that tears the State apart, shown by numerous Huguenot patches in the Languedoc region, it is about to embrace the faith of the Same. This tendency occurs together with the linguistic phenomenon: the use of the French language develops at the same time as the practice of Law. The various parameters that distinguish the Other from the Same tend to converge to make the Southerner a subject per se of the Kingdom of the Valois. Far from questioning the foundation of the modern French identity, the people of Languedoc and other Southerners, with a rich distinct set of customs, contribute to it in several ways.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515q17x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55md629</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Languedoc (France) -- Description and travel</dc:subject><dc:subject>French literature -- 16th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Languedoc (France) -- In literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t094r"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The binary sonata tradition in the mid-eighteenth century : bipartite and tripartite "First halves" in the Venice XIII collection of keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Campbell, Alan Douglas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Comparatively few theoretical studies exist on the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti. His music remains largely unexplored. This study investigates formal and functional aspects of the "first halves" in the Venice XIII collection (K 514--K 543) and reveals links to the aesthetics and traditions of his contemporaries. It suggests and examines relationships to the development of the sonata genre. To accomplish this, the study proposes a theoretical base for critical analysis and presents a specialised terminology to examine the features of mid-eighteenth-century sonata forms. The arguments of Michelle Fillion, J. P. Larsen, and Wilhelm Fischer are central to the discussion. Studies by William Caplin, Barbara Foster, Klaus Heimes, Ralph Kirkpatrick, and James Unger also contribute to the development of the theoretical base.

One of these, accommodation, refers to an individual's willingness to respond constructively, rather than destructively, to his or her partner's transgressions. Until now, commitment has been measured using mainly self-report methods. This study sought to show that cognitive accessibility of commitment may also be able to predict the relationship maintenance behaviour of accommodation. Participants either encountered the relationship threat of an attractive opposite-sex confederate or encountered no threat. They then complete measures of the accessibility of commitment and accommodation. Results revealed that for women only, the accessibility of commitment was a significant predictor of accommodation in both conditions, independent of self-reported commitment. The implications for understanding relationship maintenance processes and commitment, as well as the study of romantic relationships are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lydon, John</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096897d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv46v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Man-woman relationships</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adjustment (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Commitment (Psychology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25xb33q"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Un train en cache un autre, suivi de, Rêves et récit onirique chez Milan Kundera</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bessebs, Véronique</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Various characters tell the story of their participation in a series of events that take place in and around a casino, in a strange, almost magical atmosphere.

Pain is a major symptom of arthritis and can be exacerbated during mechanical stimulation of the joint. In this project, we investigated whether changes occur in sensory neurotransmission in an animal model of monoarthritis and the neurochemicals that underlie such changes. Monoarthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the tibiotarsal joint of the rat. This model was characterised by a significant increase in ankle circumference and sensitivity to mechanical stimulus, as well as a decrease in ankle flexibility. Electrophysiological recordings from dorsal spinal cord neurones in intact animals demonstrated that the baseline activity of dorsal horn neurones was significantly higher in CFA-injected rats compared to vehicle-injected rats. Furthermore, the magnitude of the response of dorsal horn neurones to von Frey hair stimulation of the joint was significantly increased after CFA injection and was followed by a slowly decaying afterdischarge that was not present in control rats. Joint movement in arthritic rats caused an enhancement of the responses of wide dynamic range neurons to iontophoretic application of glutamate receptor agonists. This enhancement lasted 10--15 minutes and was blocked by pretreatment with the selective NK-1 receptor antagonist CP-96,345 (5mg/kg i.v.). These experiments suggest that joint movement in arthritic animals causes the release of substance P at central terminals within the dorsal spinal cord leading to a sensitisation of synaptic transmission. The enhancement of cellular excitability following an innocuous stimulus such as joint movement is at least partially mediated via activation of NK-1 receptors in the dorsal spinal cord and may underlie the exacerbation of the pain during arthritis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Henry, James L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cg140.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924d50k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anp193b71x"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Flux maximizing geometric flows for 2D and 3D blood vessel segmentation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vasilevskiy, Oleksandr</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The visualization of two-dimensional and three-dimensional vascular structures is of significant interest in image-guided surgery. This assists clinicians in pre-operation planning, real-time operating room decision making, and post-operation monitoring. In order to achieve this goal, vascular networks must first be segmented from intensity data such as CT or MR angiography images. A framework for addressing this problem is the use of geometric flows where a curve (in two dimensions) or a surface (in three dimensions) is evolved under constraints from image forces so that it clings to features of interest in an intensity image. Recent variations on this theme take into account properties of enclosed regions and textures and allow for multiple curves or surfaces to be simultaneously represented. However, it is not clear how to apply these techniques to images of low contrast elongated structures, such as blood vessels. To address this problem we derive the gradient flow which maximizes the rate of increase of flux of an auxiliary vector field through a curve or surface. The calculation leads to a simple and elegant interpretation which is essentially parameter free. We illustrate its advantages with level-set based segmentations of 2D and 3D angiography images of blood vessels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Siddiqi, Kaleem</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q5925.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193b71x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57ns70g"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sequence evolution of copia-like retrotransposons in diverse plant genomes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Navarro Quezada, Aura Rocio</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In plants, retrotransposon copy numbers have been shown to vary from several hundreds to several million.

Evidence of purifying selection was detected in an enzyme directly involved in transposition. Genomes with less than 10,000 copia-like elements showed significantly smaller dN /dS ratios and fewer stop codons compared with genomes containing more than 10,000 copia-like elements.

The current treatment options may prolong survival but none of them are curative. Allogeneic gene therapy is a novel vaccine strategy that can augment anti-tumor immune responses and cause remission in some non-hematologic cancers. Immunogene transfer has been successfully performed in human and murine myeloma cells using viral vectors. We used immuno-magnetic negative selection to purify myeloma cells from bone marrow (BM) specimens. We investigated the possibility of in vitro culture of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) and myeloma cell enrichments. We used liposomal and adenoviral vectors to transduce myeloma cell lines. We cloned the allogene HLA-B7 into a recombinant adenoviral transfer plasmid and, subsequently, produced a recombinant, HLA-B7-positive, adenoviral vector. We evaluated allogene expression by the adenoviral vector in myeloma cell lines. In three of four BM samples tested, 95--99% purification of primary myeloma cells was achieved. Poor expansion and considerable variability (6--22 days) in the duration of culture of BMMC (two samples) and purified myeloma cells (four samples) was observed. Adenoviral vectors expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were highly efficient (70--94%) for transduction of myeloma cell lines. Using the HLA-B7-adenoviral vector, a small population (13%) of HLA-B7-positive myeloma cells (RPMI-8226 cell line) was identified. These observations support the feasibility of creating a myeloma vaccine by transduction of primary human myeloma cells with an allogene.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ward, Brian J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sx68s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97ks289</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fd57j"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of epistatic interaction on detection and parameter analysis of quantitative trait loci</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wambach, Tina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent scientific support for the involvement of genetic locus interaction in quantitative trait variation and the widespread use of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has resulted in the need to examine those aspects concurrently. Computer software was written to simulate interacting quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in plant populations. Using this software, interacting QTLs were simulated to examine effects of epistasis on the detection of QTLs and the quality of QTL parameter estimates. Simulations involved doubled haploid populations exhibiting two non-epistatic traits and seven epistatic traits, each trait at four levels of heritability. Detection efficiency of QTL main and interaction effects decreased with decreasing heritability. At a given level of broad-sense heritability, traits differed with respect to the relative quality of main-effect detection and interaction-effect detection. Main-effect detection was notably poor for one epistatic locus that has a relatively small additive effect. Position estimates were accurate but their precision deteriorated with decreasing heritability. The quality of QTL effect estimates declined consistently with decreasing heritability, and loss in the accuracy was associated with losses in power of detection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mather, Diane E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tr091.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fd57j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plant genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Quantitative genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epistasis (Genetics)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25xb358"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Paperless assignments : a closer look</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Williams, Delize</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>With the increasing student population at many tertiary level institutions, the management of assignment submissions and results has become a challenging feat. This thesis proposes that one way to address these challenges is to develop methods for automating the submission of assignments to support the administrative effort. This will not only enable many administrative tasks to be automated, but will also support and in some cases, improve the learning experience available to students. The features of four paperless assignment submission systems are presented, compared and analyzed with the goal of exposing instructors to the varied benefits that such systems can provide, thereby encouraging them to use such systems in their course delivery. It is also the intent that this thesis will form the basis from which further developmental work will be performed on such systems in general, and on VisualCM in particular. (VisualCM is a paperless assignment submission system currently used within the School of Computer Science at McGill University).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ratzer, Gerald</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v729m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xb358</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education, Technology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405sc088"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Theoretical investigation of mercury reactions with halogen species in the Arctic troposphere</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Viswanathan, Balakrishnan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mercury is one of the most toxic elements present in the geosphere, present in many chemical and physical forms. Nearly uniform mixing ratios are observed within a hemisphere, the concentration being higher in the northern than in the Southern Hemisphere. Lack of kinetic data regarding mercury reactions prevents an explanation of the behaviour and deposition pathways of mercury from the atmosphere. Theoretical calculations have been carried out using DFT theory to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reactions of Hg0 with Cl, Br, ClO, and BrO radicals and with Cl 2 and Br2. The results from these calculations were used to evaluate the kinetic rate constants at 298.15 K and 238.15 K for the reactions involving gaseous mercury. In this paper, the results of this study are presented and relevance to the chemistry of the Arctic is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ariya, P.

Traditional photolytic oxidant production channels are not sufficient to account for the observed atmospheric sulfate load. It has been suggested that sulfur oxidation is oxidant dependent, especially in urban areas and during the wintertime. The ozonolysis of alkenes, a dark reaction, could potentially produce additional oxidants (HO• and H₂O₂). This study used MOCCA (Model of Chemistry Considering Aerosols), a zeroth dimension chemical box model to study the potential impact of the ozonolysis of alkenes on the aqueous phase chemistry of sulfur. The study was conducted at mid-latitudes using both winter and summer, urban and remote settings. It was found that during the winter time, the ozonolysis of alkenes can enhance the aqueous oxidation of sulfur by approximately a factor of 20. The impact of ozonolysis was found to be independent of direct HO• yield but linearly dependent with H₂O₂ yield. While preliminary, results suggest that the impact of the ozonolysis of alkenes can still be felt 4 days after an air parcel has left the polluted urban environment with elevated acidity and aqueous S(VI) levels. During the summer runs, the lack of a growth mechanism in the aerosol component of the model lead to an overestimation of the aerosol acidity. While this led to an underestimation of the impact of ozonolysis, we still calculated a approximately 7 fold increase in the aqueous sulfur oxidation rate.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ariya, P.

These measures have led to lower volumes of water discharged by those mills recirculating water, and also to increasing problems in the mills. One of these problems is the loss of effectiveness of the PEO-cofactor retention aid systems, due to the increasing concentration of dissolved solids in the water. The results show that the presence of high surface area compounds such as fines, clay and organic compounds, like abietic acid can indeed affect the efficiency of PEO. The development of a laboratory scale twin wire sheet former has helped study the retention aid system described above under conditions which resemble those found in a mill. This apparatus has helped study the effect the retention aid system had on water drainage and fines retention. The fines retention improved as the concentration of PEO was increased but the water drainage had decreased. Bentonite was added to the system to study its effect on the fines retention and the drainage. Bentonite combined to a PEO-cofactor retention aid system was found to have a positive impact on both the retention and the drainage.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Garnier, G.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>van de Ven, T.

On 11 May 1999, a shortwave trough moved northward from British Columbia and continued its passage over the Northwest Territories. A hail storm developed in an environment of small convective available potential energy. To understand the processes responsible for the formation of the storm, the Canadian Mesoscale Compressible Community Model (MC2) is used to simulate the case. The addition of a second soil type to the lower boundary of the model allows for a realistic simulation of the location and time of the storm. The results indicate that the dynamics associated with the shortwave trough, coupled with diurnal heating effects over the more realistic soil type, produced the weakly-forced hail storm that passed directly over Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yau, Peter M.

Mosses contribute to long-term accumulation of organic matter and storage of nutrients as well as to short-term nutrient release. In the boreal forest of northwestern Quebec, the effect of mosses on nutrient cycling was examined within the framework of a chronosequence ranging from 25 to 300 years of age. Laboratory and buried bag incubations, total nutrient digests, respirometric and root abundance measurements as well as moisture and temperature measurements were done to characterize the nutritional status of the organic matter profiles. In general, no change in moss accumulation, or nutrient storage or availability across the chronosequence could be detected. There were, however, differences between feather mosses and Sphagnum mosses, the latter having significantly lower levels of nutrients than the former in terms of mineralizable nitrogen and total carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium content. The nutritional profile of moss cores showed different horizons, reflecting differences in organic matter quality down the organic layer. More specifically, nitrogen availability on a concentration basis as well as root abundance decreased with depth. Forest floor temperature seemed to confine the most biologically active horizon, referred to as the active layer, to a shallow depth, however neither temperature nor moisture seemed to explain the nutritional differences between feather mosses and Sphagnum mosses. These results may lead to practical consequences in that they show a clear distinction between the effects of feather mosses and Sphagnum mosses in nutrient cycling, suggesting that moss cover, might be useful as an indicator of site nutritional status. The results also show that accumulation of nutrients in organic surface horizons, as has been observed elsewhere, does not appear to occur in blac</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fyles, J.

Using a probe identified by differential display-PCR, we cloned a 3.1 kb cDNA LGL1 (AF109674) encoding a deduced polypeptide of 480 amino acids. Northern blot analysis showed that LGL1 is induced by glucocorticoid and is expressed in fetal lung adjacent fibroblasts but not in the epithelium. LGL1 is detectable in fetal rat heart, kidney and intestine, and is conserved across human, rat and mouse adult lungs. RT-PCR analysis detected LGL1 expression in human fetal lung, kidney, heart and intestine. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that LGL1 expression is restricted to the mesenchyme, while FISH mapped LGL1 to human chromosome 16824. LGL1 demonstrated homology to P25TI, a polypeptide with weak trypsin inhibitor activity, as well as the CRISP family of androgen-regulated, cysteine rich secretory proteins. We expressed a hexahistidine tagged LGL1 in an E. coli expression system in order to facilitate characterization of the protein and determine its role in fetal lung maturation. The data gathered thus far are consistent with LGL1 having a role in lung development via the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kaplan, Feige</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644t32s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074x04z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720f66c"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Impact of hepatitis C virus coinfection and highly active antiretroviral therapy on human immunodeficiency virus associated morbidity and mortality</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Klein, Marina B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection on HIV related morbidity and mortality is debated, particularly in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Using the Montreal Chest Institute HIV clinic database, a retrospective cohort spanning 1990--1999 was formed to determine the effect of HCV status on risk of opportunistic infection, death and hospitalisation before and after the introduction of HAART. While HCV- subjects experienced rate reductions for all outcomes after HAART, no such decrease was observed for HCV+ subjects. No effect of HCV status on outcomes was observed before HAART. In contrast, HCV infection was associated with an increased risk of death (RR, 1.80; 95% CI 0.88--3.65) and hospitalisation (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.19--3.05) in the post HAART era after adjustment for age, duration of HIV infection, history of AIDS, antiretroviral use and time-updated CD4 cell and HIV viral load measures. In conclusion, HCV coinfection appears to be preventing the realisation of substantial health benefits associated with HAART.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Suissa, Samy</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53wx635.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720f66c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407z99x"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Finite pivot algorithms and feasibility</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kaluzny, Bohdan Lubomyr</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis studies the classical finite pivot methods for solving linear programs and their efficiency in attaining primal feasibility.
