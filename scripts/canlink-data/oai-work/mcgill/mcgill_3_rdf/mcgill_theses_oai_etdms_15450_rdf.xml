Some of this land is being turned into tree farms and more of it could be so utilized if some problems could be overcome. The chief difficulties existing are mainly those of uneven topography, poor drainage and low fertility status of the soil. This latter problem could be possibly the easiest difficulty to overcome provided adequate knowledge existed of the effects of fertilization on reforested areas. To assess relative fertility levels of soils for purposes of reforestation methods of soils analysis as well as plant analysis may be useful. These must be developed in conjunction with fertilizer application experiments either in the field or in the greenhouse under a controlled environment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacKenzie, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33s111v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vs08h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Soil Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36v199w"><ual:graduationDate>1964</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of electroconvulsive shock on memory</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Corson, John.

It will then go on to deal with the literature on ECS and will pay special attention to the affect of ECS on memory when it is interpolated between learning and a retention test. Use of ECS for the study of memory and retention seems to be the result of three quite separate lines of thinking. Two of these are somewhat less important now: the idea, which has lasted for several centuries, that shock or stress of any kind is useful in treatment of mental illness; and a long-standing biological interest in the effects of electricity on the animal body. The third line, much more recent in origin and also more germane to our present concerns, involves the fusion of ideas about retrograde amnesia and retroactive inhibition in the theory of the consolidation period in learning.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hebb, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72pb90h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v199w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abr86b697k"><ual:graduationDate>1964</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Somesthetic function after focal cerebral damage in man</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Corkin, Suzanne.

Stoichiometric oxygen-hydrogen mixed with different amounts of helium made up the combustible charge. The electrode configurations were of the spherical-spherical or point-plane type. The parameters of the experiment were: 1. loading pressure 500, 800, 1200 and 2000 psia; 2. percentage helium 65, 70, 75 and 80%; 3. electrode gap spacing .002 to .010 inch. The tests showed that detonation-free combustion could be achieved over the complete pressure range, with mixtures containing between 70% and 80% helium. The point plane type was found to be the most suitable electrode configuration. For the same gap spacing, the breakdown voltage of the point-plane type was 20% below that of the spherical-spherical type, and could initiate combustion with a smaller gap. In a mixture containing 83% helium, the breakdown voltage in a quasi-uniform field, for partially conditioned electrodes, was found to be approximately linear with the product of pressure times gap spacing, when the product was greater than 2 lb/in. In the breakdown voltage versus pressure plot, the point-plane configuration, for the same mixture, exhibited a double inflection between 1400 and 1800 psia.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pavlasek, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rm76d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712mb405</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electrical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak3569777r"><ual:graduationDate>1964</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the origin of urinary steroids</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Clark, Albert.

This 5 year survival rate improves to seventy-five per cent if there are no regional or distant metastases and falls to around thirty per cent if the axillary lymph nodes are involved by metastatic disease. This tact stresses the importance of early diagnosis and treatment in carcinoma of the breast. Every year 25,000 American women die of cancer of the breast.

Symptoms of enteritis were reproduced artificially by contaminating the drinking water of the pigs with a live culture of one of the two strains of E. coli. The same strain of E. coli was isolated in very large numbers from the fecal samples of artificially infected animals. 4. The infection of this strain of E. coli was transmitted naturally by housing susceptible animals with the scouring animals.

Their studies were concerned with the application of this type of flow system to a mobile fuel nuclear reactor where fine uranium or uranium oxide partials are continuously carried into the top of the reactor core in the form of dilute slurries, allowed to settle on the bed already formed in the core, and are exhausted through the restricting orifices at the ends.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chon, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483n70d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c176z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jx97f"><ual:graduationDate>1964</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agriculture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The microbial fixation of nitrogen in soils</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chang, Pin-Chuan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nitrogen tantalizes mankind with the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty. All living things on this planet must have nitrogen in their food. The earth’s atmosphere contains far more than enough nitrogen to satisfy the requirement, yet relatively few of the species populating the earth are able to metabolize nitrogen from the atmosphere. This circumstance gives rise to important ecologic and economic consequences, and poses challenging questions for several branches of science. The first isolation of free living nitrogen fixing bacteria by Winogradsky and Beijernck stimulated attempts to assess the importance of non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the nitrogen economy of the soil. Though numerous papers have accumulated, they also provide opportunities for controversy ranging from polite disagreement to acrimonious debate, and most of them need careful reevaluation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Knowles, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w817m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jx97f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural Bacteriology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sk76s"><ual:graduationDate>1964</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Point-block development Maharaj Road, Bangkok, Thailand</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chakrabandhu, Peradej</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Thailand, an area of about 200,000 square miles in the heart of Southeast Asia, stretches from latitude 5 30" North to 21 North, or not quite 1,000 miles. The longitudinal extent is half this distance, from 97 30" East to 105 30" East. It thus falls entirely within the tropical climate region. The country is bordered on the north-east by Laos, on the south-east by Cambodia, (these two countries, together with North Vietnam and South Vietnam, comprising the area once known as French Indo-China,) on the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaya and on the north-west and west by Burma. The whole country is made up of river plains, forested mountains, and plateaus. It is a tropical land where rice cultivation in the river basins is the primary mode of existence for its approximately 25.5 million people.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hazeland, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860b306.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sk76s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1v53k165n"><ual:graduationDate>1964</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of various experimental conditions on the concentration of materials with acetylcholine-like activity in brain and muscle</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chabrol, John.

The necessity of regulating the legal obligations resulting from such incidents, in a convention level, in order to obviate the application of the various domestic laws on the matter which do not contain standard liability provisions, among other things, was long felt. Such need stems from the economic policy obtaining in international air law to define, regulate and limit an aircraft operator's liability from catastrophic losses that usually results from a single aviation accident, and extend reasonable protection to the rights of end-users, including innocent third parties, who may have suffered injury or sustained damage as a result of aircraft operations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Matte, N.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2774016r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246w488</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Air and Space Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj139561q"><ual:graduationDate>1964</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Attitudes towards selected adolescent characteristics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Carniol, Benjamin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study focused on the conflict of views about adolescence that confronts group work practitioners. The study explored attitudes held by selected adolescent and adult groups in an attempt to contribute to a clarification of the extent to which adolescents rebel against adults and belong to a strong subculture of their own. Furthermore, it was hoped that such data might point a direction for effective social group work with adolescents. Following an attitudinal measurement model of Abraham J. Tannenbaum, ‘Adolescent Attitudes Toward Academic Brillance’ (New York: Columbia University, 1962), data were gathered on attitudes towards adolescent characteristics representing reliance on adults, peers, and convention. These characteristics were described by verbal stereotypes to which respondents were asked to give social acceptance ratings.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shiner, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bm955.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139561q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cv26x"><ual:graduationDate>1964</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Positron annihilation in metals</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Carbotte, Jules.

There is therefore little need to give a detailed historical survey of its development; we will limit ourselves to a brief summary of the state of the theory as reviewed by Farrell and then pass immediately to a discussion of some of the more recent work which has a direct bearing on this thesis. In a typical positron annihilation experiment, a high energy positron from some β+ decay source penetrates deep into a thin metal sample and quickly becomes thermalized. This low energy positron then "migrates" through the sample and eventually annihilates with one of the metallic electrons with subsequent emission of two quanta.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kahana, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b698v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cv26x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abn999b16b"><ual:graduationDate>1964</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The activity of the papillary muscles and their role in the function of the atrioventricular valves of the heart</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Busse, Edward.

Current surgical techniques tend to destroy the normal relationships of the papillary muscles and there is some clinical evidence (16.20) that this is detrimental to the cardiac dynamics. Current understanding of the importance of the papillary muscle mechanism is limited by a lack of information describing the activities of the papillary muscles. It is the object of this thesis to investigate the activity of the papillary muscles and to relate these observations to an understanding of the role of the papillary muscles in atrioventricular valve function.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dobell, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bq10x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999b16b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
