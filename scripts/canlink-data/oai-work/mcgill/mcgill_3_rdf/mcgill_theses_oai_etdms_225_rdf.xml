Mutations affecting the formation and/or action of the hAR cause androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). The majority of mutations identified to date are within the DNA- and hormone-binding domains; very few have been identified in the transactivational modulatory domain, encoded by exon 1. This work presents an analysis of exon 1 and the 5$ sp prime$-flanking region of the hAR in a set of subjects whose AIS was believed to be caused by a mutation within these regions. Six of twelve strains had a nonsense or frameshift mutation in exon 1; a seventh strain had two missense and one silent substitution; no mutations were identified in the remaining subjects. The two missense mutations were recreated, individually and together, in an hAR complementary DNA (cDNA) expression vector and expressed in heterologous COS-1 cells. Their pathogenicity could not be proven with the system and assays used. In addition, mRNA and protein levels were analyzed and correlated with the identified mutations and the subjects' phenotype.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pinsky, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149r64k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s209r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>X chromosome -- Abnormalities</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exons (Genetics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex differentiation disorders</dc:subject><dc:subject>Androgens -- Receptors</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278w21r"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evaluation of the performance of the generalized estimating equations method for the analysis of crossover designs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Valois, Marie-France</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Crossover designs are widely used in clinical trials. The main advantage of this type of design is that the treatments are compared within subjects. That is, every subject provides a direct comparison of the treatments he or she has received. In general, a smaller number of subjects is needed to obtain the same precision than with a cross-sectional design. However, because of the correlations within subjects arising from the repeated measurements, the usual analysis of variance based on ordinary least squares (OLS) may be inappropriate to analyze crossover designs. Some approximate likelihood based tests that take into account the structure of the covariance matrix have recently been proposed in the literature. The aim of this thesis is to compare the performance of the OLS method and two of the approximate likelihood based tests to a non-likelihood based method, the generalized estimating equations, for testing the treatment and carryover effects, in crossover designs, under the assumption of multivariate normality.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bellavance, Francois</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nd083.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278w21r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Statistics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7h149r65v"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nutritional implications of microbial phytase supplementation in the diet of early weaned piglets ; Lignin as a purified dietary supplement for piglets</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Valencia, Zully</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two trials were conducted in order to assess the efficacy of microbial phytase supplementation in improving the bioavailability of certain nutrients in the diet of early weaned piglets. In trial I, a low-phosphorus, corn-soybean meal diet supplemented with phytase significantly improved the apparent digestibilities of phosphorus (P, p = 0.0004) and calcium (Ca, p = 0.04). The average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were also improved by supplemental phytase. In trial II, addition of acetic acid to the low-P plus phytase diet further improved the apparent digestibilities of P and Ca (gp = 0.01, p = 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, the apparent digestibility of copper was also significantly improved by acetic acid addition. As a consequence, the piglets fed this treatment showed the best growth performance. Acidification of a diet which provided the NRC recommended levels of available P significantly improved the apparent digestibilities of protein and most of the minerals (P, Fe, Zn, Cu and Mn) but it was not reflected in improved growth performance. These results indicate that microbial phytase not only released P from the phytic acid molecule but it also cleaved other minerals bound to this complex.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chavez, E.

Among those pathologies, the spinal cord injury (SCI) at the suprasacral level leads to the development of detrusor hyperreflexia associated with detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia. The dyssynergic voiding results in a high voiding pressure which is the origin of upper urinary tract damage observed in spinal cord injured patients. The ultimate goals of the management of neurogenic bladder in suprasacral SCI are to achieve low-pressure urine storage, low-pressure and adequate urine emptying, control of detrusor hyperreflexia and catheter-free state. Different attempts varying from medication to sphincteric surgery or denervation have been tried in the past few decades to achieve these goals. The use of neurostimulation to achieve some of these outcomes in neurogenic bladder had also been attempted in the past with variable results. Electrical stimulation of selective sacral roots has been used in the management of neurogenic bladder secondary to SCI. However, since the ventral S$ sb2$ root contains mixed somatic fibers innervating the external sphincter and autonomic fibers innervating the bladder, electrostimulation of this root could even worsen the dyssynergia. In this acute canine work, we evaluated the feasibility of the principle of selective high frequency blockade of the somatic component of the sacral root. A stimulus was delivered by a new functional stimulator via a single bipolar electrode. This stimulus is composed of two independent current waveforms. The selectivity is caused by the inhibition of the somatic fibers by the high frequency component while the autonomic fibers are stimulated by low frequency stimuli. Using this technique of high-frequency blockade, we evaluated and showed the possibility of reduction of bladder outlet resistance during simultaneous detrusor contraction thus achieving a normal physiologic pattern of micturition.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Elhilali, M.

The specific activity (SA) of tyrosinase determined as the change in absorbance at the selected wavelength per $ mu$g protein per sec ($ delta$A/$ mu$g protein/sec) in chloroform was much higher than that obtained in aqueous media. The optimal amount of enzymatic protein for tyrosinase biocatalysis in chloroform was found to be 44.0 mg protein/L for CT and VA, 31.6, 180.5 and 90.3 mg protein/L, respectively, for CA, pAP and HQ. The optimal pH for the oxidative activity of tyrosinase in chloroform was 6.0 for all the substrates; however, the optimal temperature for enzymatic activity was 30$ sp circ$C for CT and 25$ sp circ$C for the other four substrates. The use of 1.25 and 6.65 mM catechol in chloroform medium activated the tyrosinase activity maximally by 56.2% and 267.2%, respectively for CT and CA as substrates; however, no effect from catechol (0 to 7 mM) was found with VA, pAP or HQ. In addition, the use of 4.25, 2.25 and 5.39 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in chloroform, with CT, VA and pAP as substrates, inhibited the tyrosinase activity maximally by 44.3, 84.7 and 67.0%, respectively; however, the use of 4.75 and 1.60 mM EDTA activated the enzyme by 101.9% and 115.9%, respectively, for CA and HQ. The use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) demonstrated the phenolic substrate bioconversion, whereas the spectrophotometric scanning showed the product formation during the enzymatic reaction.

Several types of cultivators were assessed and compared. The effect of mechanical cultivation on crop yield and quality was studied by counting, weighing and grading bean pods, carrot roots and lettuce heads. The effect of mechanical cultivation on disease incidence was studied by surveying fields during the season and by determining the number and weight of diseased pods, roots and heads at harvest. The relationship between the level of Cercospora blight on carrots and potential impacts on yield was also investigated by measuring plant characteristics and the amount of force needed to separate carrot foliage from root. The effect of mechanical cultivation on the phenology of snap bean flowering was studied by determining how long it took for a plant to produce 50% of its flowers and counting how many flowers and pods a plant produced. In general, mechanical cultivation did not affect normal crop production and may be used to replace or complement conventional weed control methods. There was little variation among different cultivators within one season, but cultivator effects differed among crops and from one year to the next.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Paulitz, Timothy</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qb80k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qb79t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vegetables -- Phenology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Beans -- Weed control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lettuce -- Weed control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Weeds -- Control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vegetables -- Yields</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vegetables -- Diseases and pests -- Control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carrots -- Weed control</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2f75r9728"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular self-assembly of long chain alcohols, thiols, and carboxylic acids on a single substrate via acid-base hydrolytic chemistry</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tong, Samuel S. Y., 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis reports a novel route to molecular self-assembly based on simple acid-base hydrolytic chemistry involving the reactions of aminosilanes with organic species containing acidic protons. From detailed solution chemistry of trimethyl-, trimethoxy-, and triphenyl-chloro/amino-silanes, two general processes have been developed for the self-assembly of long alkyl chain terminated alcohols, thiols, and carboxylic acids on inorganic oxide surfaces i.e., glass, quartz and single crystal silicon. The first method involves three successive reactions with the surface moieties where the initially formed silylchloride layer is converted to a silylamine, which is then reacted further to give the organic monolayers. The second method involves a single reaction of the surface with surfactant species formed first by reacting trimethoxysilylchloride with the appropriate chromophore. The chemistry and comparative advantages of these two methods are discussed. A discussion on the complete characterization of newly formed thin films by employing surface techniques, such as wettability, FTIR-ATR spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and X-ray reflectivity, is provided. These results indicate that thin films formed using simple acid-base hydrolytic chemistry are comparable to those obtained from more established techniques, such as trichlorosilanes on glass, thiols on gold, and carboxylic acids on silver or alumina. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that the acid-base hydrolytic chemistry is a viable and widely applicable method to molecular self-assembly and can be considered as a unifying approach to literature methods.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kakkar, A.

In adult rats, the behavioural response is related to the log of the formalin concentration. Very brief pain responses can be produced by injection of inflammatory mediators, and combination of 5-HT with other mediators produces a synergistic increase in the response. The present study has two aims: (1) to determine the behavioural indices that best measure formalin-induced pain in 3 and 15 day old rat pups, and (2) to examine the behavioural response of infant rats to intraplantar injection of single inflammatory mediators and paired combinations of mediators. In Experiment 1, ascending concentrations of formalin were injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one rear paw. In Experiment 2, ascending doses of 5-HT, PGE$ sb2$, bradykinin, or substance P were injected and the measures that were quantitatively related to formalin concentration used to assess pain. The data suggest that strong responses to formalin in young neonatal rats are not only a consequence of the continuing development of brainstem-spinal inhibitory systems, but may also be due to immaturity of peripheral pain transduction mechanisms.

Immediately after unilateral vascular decortication, adult rats received for seven days, via minipump, vehicle, NGF (12 $ mu$g/day) and/or GM1 (1.5 mg/day) into the cerebroventricular space. Thirty days after the lesion, the animals were perfused with histological fixatives, the brains removed and relevant sections processed for dopamine $ beta$-hydroxylase (DBH) and somatostatin immunocytochemist at the light and electron microscopic levels. The lesion caused a reduction in the total length of the DBH immunoreactive (IR) fiber segments, which was not attenuated by either NGF or GM1 treatment or both combined. The somatostatin-IR network, on the other hand, was unaffected by the lesion and there was no sprouting of the somatostatin fibers with trophic factor therapy. I observed, however, a marginally significant decrease in the somatostatin fiber network when NGF and GM1 were administered simultaneously. I also found no significant differences in the size and number of synapses of both the DBH-IR and somatostatin-IR boutons, following lesion and drug treatments.

From 1989 to 1993, rubella susceptibility in women aged 15 to 44 averaged 4.6% overall, but was significantly higher in women aged 15 to 19 years, averaging 14%. The positive predictive value of a rubella vaccination record was 92% overall, but it differed by type of vaccine product and vaccine viral strain; 99% for any monovalent rubella vaccine, compared to 81% for recipients of HPV-77 DE-5 strain MR (measles rubella) or MMR (measles mumps rubella) vaccine. The postnatal rubella vaccination program failed to provide testing for 13% of pregnant women in the province in 1992, and 10% of susceptible women in 1992 were not subsequently vaccinated. These results suggest that women of childbearing age in Newfoundland remain at risk of having children with CRS. The rubella vaccination record is not adequate proof of immunity for some of these women, and the postnatal vaccination program requires some improvement in order to prevent cases of CRS in the future.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tannenbaum, Terry Nan</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n315r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483m129</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awd375z39v"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The development of a fuzzy decision-support system for dairy cattle culling decisions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Strasser, Mark</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In order to investigate the use of fuzzy logic in decision-support systems (DSS) for dairy cattle breeding, a first-generation prototype software system was developed.

The goal of the prototype DSS was to make culling decisions on the basis of monthly production data. An analysis of the development process of this prototype demonstrated the importance of creating a thorough methodology for the elicitation and implementation of knowledge. A framework for the development of fuzzy decision-support systems was established, consisting of four phases: the project groundwork phase, elicitation of knowledge from the expert, implementation of that knowledge, and system validation. In this framework, it is proposed that, in the case of multiple experts, knowledge can be amalgamated or aggregated. Once this framework was established, a second-generation prototype DSS was developed. Contrary to the first-generation prototype, where the encoded expertise was limited to three experts from the same domain, the second-generation prototype considered the knowledge of two individuals from each of three domains (Dairy researchers, Producers, and Dairy herd improvement specialists). An aggregation approach was used which involved the development and maintenance of separate modules, each containing the compiled expertise of one of the six experts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wade, Kevin M.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Kok, Robert</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t8297.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375z39v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fuzzy logic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Breeding -- Decision making</dc:subject><dc:subject>Decision support systems</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0g354h28f"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Optimal software pipelining : integer linear programming approach</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stoutchinin, Artour V.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In optimizing the code for high-performance processors, software pipelining of innermost loops is of fundamental importance.

In this thesis, we discuss the application of the integer linear programming to software pipelining and design a pipeliner for the MIPS R8000 superscalar microprocessor. We extended the previously developed ILP framework to a full software pipelining implementation by: (1) establishing an ILP model for the R8000 processor, (2) implementing the model in Modulo Scheduling ToolSet (MOST), (3) integrating it into the MIPSpro compiler, (4) successfully producing real code and gathering runtime statistics, and (5) developing and implementing a model for optimization of the memory system behavior on the R8000 processor. The ILP-based software pipeliner was tested as a functional replacement for the original MIPSpro software pipeliner. Our results indicate a need of improving the ILP formulation and its solution: (1) the existing technique failed to produce results for loops with large instruction counts, (2) it was not able to guarantee register optimality for many interesting and important loops, for which optimal scheduling is necessary in order to avoid spilling, (3) the branching order, in which an ILP solver traverses the branch-and-bound tree, was a single significant factor that affected the ILP solution time, leading to a conclusion that exploiting scheduling problem structure is essential for improving the efficiency of the ILP problem solving in the future.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gao, G.

We present a new model that combines steady-state homogeneous nucleation theory with the classical Lifshitz-Slyozov mechanism of growth. This model considers the substantial correlations between droplets and naturally incorporates the crossover from the early-stage, nucleation dominated regime to the scaling, late-stage, coarsening regime within a single framework, without ad-hoc assumptions. This is achieved by the development of a set of self-consistent interface equations which describe the decay of metastable states. The model is implemented numerically and some interesting dynamical behaviour is observed, including the reproduction of the expected late-time scaling and power-law growth laws for the key mean-field variables.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Grant, Martin</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wf768.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687k204</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290c53f"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of specific opiate receptor antagonists on the habituation of novelty-induced analgesia</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Spreekmeester, Emma S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Animals exposed to nociceptive stimulation for the first time display a novelty induced hypoalgesia (NIH) that habituates with repeated exposure to the same stimuli.

Its presence in the testis and epididymis suggest important roles for this enzyme and their substrates in male fertility and reproductive functions. The main focus of this investigation was to analyze the effects of a deficiency of these isoenzymes within the male murine reproductive tract. Disruption of the Hexa gene encoding the $ alpha$-subunit of $ beta$-hexosaminidase led to the generation of a mouse model of human Tay-Sachs while disruption of the Hexb gene encoding the $ beta$-subunit of $ beta$-hexosaminidase led to a mouse model of human Sandhoff disease, thus providing the opportunity to analyze the effects of Hex A and Hex B deficiency on epithelial cellular morphology of the male reproductive tract. Analysis of the testis, efferent ducts and epididymidis of 5 weeks, 3, 5 and 12 month old Tay-Sachs (Hexa $-/-$) and 1 and 3 month old Sandhoff (Hexb, $-/-$) was performed; the wild-type (Hexa +/+, Hexb +/+) mice at all ages were also examined as controls.

Previous related research has focused on the potential of parasitoids to control bruchids; the role of generalist predators in this application has not yet been extensively explored. The anthocorid true bug Xylocoris flavipes (Reuter) exhibited a Type II density dependent functional response to five species of adult bruchids. The rate of kill of these large prey was quite low but fairly consistent and female predators were generally more effective. Of the species examined, only the eggs and neonate larvae of A. obtectus were accessible and predation on these stages was high. Population interaction studies evaluating the effects of predator density and of time elapsed between infestation of commodity and predator addition indicated that adding the predator simultaneously with the pests significantly reduced the number of F$ sb1$, bruchid progeny for all species. Predator density contributed less to bruchid suppression than time of predator addition and bruchid progeny suppression was much greater than anticipated given the rate of kill observed in the functional response experiments. Reproduction by A. obtectus was almost entirely inhibited by the predator. The high levels of suppression achieved with the predator indicated a significant biological control potential; however, the more fecund bruchid species with inaccessible immature stages continued to produce a large number of progeny. The predator was then combined with larval parasitoids capable of utilizing the internally-developing stages of the bruchids; bruchid suppression was considerably enhanced over the predator alone, and for the most fecund pests, suppression was greater than for the parasitoids alone.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stewart, R.

Focus group discussions and a food preference assessment were conducted with adults in order to identify the cultural, ecological, and socioeconomic factors (food attributes) as well as the individual preferences which influence the consumption of vitamin A and calcium-rich traditional and market foods in K'asho Got'ine. The major attributes limiting intakes of traditional food rich in vitamin A and calcium included: lack of equipment for hunting/fishing; seasonality; distance traveled to obtain certain foods; occasional unhealthy appearance of food; no hunter/fisher in the household. The major food attributes reported as barriers to greater intakes of selected market foods were: cost, freshness, intolerance to certain items, availability and unfamiliarity. Foods that received the highest preference scores were rabbit liver, loche liver, and Canada goose meat (smoked/dried) for vitamin A-rich foods and connie eggs, rabbit flesh, woodland and barrenland caribou head for calcium-rich foods. Criteria for selection of traditional and market foods to promote in the community included: (1) convenience of the food; (2) difficulty to overcome barriers to increasing food consumption; (3) concentration level of contaminants in certain traditional food; and (4) food preference score. This study identified available and underutilized traditional and market foods rich in vitamin A and calcium which are most acceptable to the community, and may be promoted in future nutrition intervention programs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Receveur, Olivier</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4306661.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870x88n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vitamin A in human nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Calcium in human nutrition -- Northwest Territories</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nutrition -- Northwest Territories -- Evaluation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adf65v9739"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Population dynamics of Anisakis simplex in harbour porpoise (Phocoena Phocoena) from the Gulf of St. Lawrence</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Simard, Manon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A prevalence of 76% and a mean intensity of 42.7 Anisakis simplex was found in harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) (N = 78) by-caught in cod gill nets set by fishers from the Gaspe area in summer 1993. No young-of-the-year porpoises (N = 12) were infected. Prevalence and mean intensity among immature and adult porpoises as well as between sexes and length-classes were not significantly different. Anisakis simplex was present in the three stomach compartments of harbour porpoises. Adult stages were proportionately less abundant in the main and pyloric stomachs than the forestomach. Percent intensity of A. simplex was influenced by maturity of harbour porpoises. Gravid female A. simplex contained up to 818,000 eggs. Egg number was highly correlated with worm uttering volume. Density effects were not demonstrated, possibly due to high variability of egg number, total length, uterine and total worm volume between parasites from each stomach and between stomachs of harbour porpoise.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Whoriskey, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623f55m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v9739</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Harbor porpoise -- Parasites -- Saint Lawrence, Gulf of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anisakis -- Saint Lawrence, Gulf of</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182n20m"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Gap junctional intercellular communication in quiescent and heterocellular mammary populations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sia, Michael Augustine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Gap junctions are protein transmembrane channels formed between apposing cells whose primary role is in mediating intercellular communication. This study addressed (1) the role of gap junctions in mammary epithelial cells during the transition from proliferation to quiescence, and (2) the mechanism of gap junction formation between different mammary cell types (heterocellular gap junctions). In the first part, proliferating mammary epithelial cells were induced to enter quiescence by serum deprivation or contact inhibition. Using Western blotting, we observed a dramatic reduction (up to 20-fold) in the expression of the gap junction protein, connexin43 (Cx43), during quiescence. Microinjection of the dye Lucifer yellow, however, revealed that there was no corresponding loss in gap junctional communication. Immunofluorescent staining for Cx43 revealed that intracellular pools of Cx43 were redistributed to the cell surface, possibly to maintain intercellular coupling. In the second part of our studies, the role of the cell adhesion molecule, E-cadherin, was studied in order to determine its role in the formation of heterocellular gap junctions between mammary fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Transfection of E-cadherin into fibroblasts was insufficient to increase the incidence of intercellular communication between the two distinct cell types. Interestingly, an intermediate cell type with properties of both epithelial cells and fibroblasts was able to bridge the communication gap. These studies may lead to insight into the role of gap junctions in mammary gland growth, development, and neoplasia.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Laird, Dale W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c258x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182n20m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v4929"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Upper Devonian sponge-algal mud mounds, southern flank of Miette reef complex, Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shiraki, Masahiro</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A series of small mud mounds are exposed in the McConnell and Miette thrust sheets on the southern flank of the Miette reef complex. They occur on the southeastward inclined carbonate clinoforms of the late Frasnian Arcs Member. These mounds are rooted on marine, argillaceous lime mudstones and are surrounded by lime mudstones of several prograding clinoforms of the upper Arcs Member or dolomitic siltstones of the lower Ronde Member. Mounds are approximately 17 to 36 m high and 32 to 81 m wide and columnar to domal in shape. The lower part of the mounds consists of sponge-rich wackestones and packstones, and locally laminar stromatoporoid boundstones. Calcareous green algae tend to predominate in the upper parts of the mounds. Variable cavities occur and are filled with geopetal sediments, isopachous fibrous and blocky calcite cements. The most common cavity types, irregular and irregular stromatactoidal cavities, might be related to organic origins, possibly the decay of sponges in conjunction with submarine cementation. Abrupt mound margins indicate that the mounds grew upwards more rapidly than the accumulation of the adjacent basin and clinoforming slope sediments.

Three sets of experiments have been performed, each consisting of a control run and with two different imposed Gulf SST anomalies. The first is a uniform increase or decrease of the SST by 5K over the entire Gulf. The second and third experiments use 5K SST anomalies of smaller extent, characteristic of warm core rings shed off the Loop Current in the Gulf. The experiments are carried out for either 15 or 30 days, and statistics are computed after discarding the first 5 days of the integration. The response of the SST anomalies are qualitatively similar in the three cases, except the response to the anomaly over the entire Gulf is stronger due to the much larger extent of the anomaly. For a positive SST anomaly, precipitation and moisture over the Gulf and southeastern U.S. both increase. The 1000mb temperature field shows a clear warming over the Gulf and adjacent areas, delineating the imposed SST anomaly. A low level cyclonic circulation forms over the Gulf and southeastern U.S. region, while an anticyclonic circulation develops at the upper levels. The negative SST anomaly experiments show a qualitatively similar response, except it is of opposite sign with a smaller magnitude.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lin, Charles A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cs48j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xt77r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physical Oceanography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qp01w"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Does psychological status influence recovery in workers compensated for acute low back pain?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sewitch, Maida</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The influence of psychological status on recovery from a first lifetime episode of acute low-back pain was assessed in compensated workers seen in a physiatry clinic.

The objectives were to determine the evolution of psychological distress, well-being, pain, self-reported disability and spinal flexibility, and to determine the psychological factors associated with return to work and recurrence. Improvement occurred post-treatment in all measures except well-being which did not fluctuate over the year. Additional improvement in functional disability occurred at 6 and 12 months. Using multiple logistic regression, low baseline psychological distress predicted late return to work and high baseline well-being predicted recurrence.

This approach combines several image synthesis techniques, such as the construction and rendering of parametric bicubic surfaces, texture mapping, and transparency effects. The appropriate selection of these techniques provide a new physically motivated yet heuristic approach to the problem.
