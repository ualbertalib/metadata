In rats, the rate of maturational development of drug-oxidative activity appears to be limited by development of electron transfer capacity, while in rabbits there is a closer relationship between increasing drug oxidation and increasing microsomal concentration of P-450. In immature male rats, NADPR cytochrome P-450 reductase activity increases more gradually than microsomal P-450 and consequently drug oxidation remains below adult levels until 5 weeks of age although P-450 reaches adult concentration by 3 weeks of age. This underdevelopment of mechanisms for the reduction of P-450 may be partly overcome in vitro through enhancement of NADPR cytochrome P-450 reductase by a Type l substrate (aminopyrine). Phenobarbital has been shown to "induce" all components of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism to adult levels or greater within 2 weeks of birth and this implies that the gene-expression system in the newborn rat hepatocyte is complete and capable of full synthetic activity in response to appropriate exogenous or endogenous stimuli. Preliminary data from humans suggest age-related deficiencies in hepatic microsomal drug oxidation and electron transport during infancy and during the sixth decade of life.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eade, N.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42nb96k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bp730</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848t64c"><ual:graduationDate>1973</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Alternate pathways for the biosynthesis of diplamitoyl lecithin in the adult rabbit lung</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Keyi-Aboagye, Kwabena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Studies of the relative incorporation of palmitate and glycerol, or glucose or choline revealed that more palmitate than the other subtrates is recovered as dipalmitoyl lecithin (DPC) indicating that DPC is not formed exclusively by de nova synthesis. Although in homogenates DPC is formed by the de novo synthesis pathway, the direct acylation of palmitoyl lysophosphatidyl choline (PLPC) with palmitoyl-CoA, and the intertransacylation of two molecules of PLPC, it appears some palmitate is esterified even in the absence of added PLPC, ATP and CoA, suggesting an additional pathway. Free palmitate exchanges with fatty acids esterified in lecithin, especially oleate, in both lung slices and homogenates. In homogenates, Ca++ (and probably Mg++) is required for the palmitate: oleate exchange. The lung contains sufficient l-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-lecithin to support this mechanism. It is concluded that palmitate is incorporated into DPC by exchange with oleate in l-palmitoyl-2-oleyl lecithin. It appears this involves two mechanisms, both of which my involve phospholipase A2. In vivo studies are consistent with this postulate.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rubinstein, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74ct74c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848t64c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811kn71b"><ual:graduationDate>1973</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structural studies on DNA using two single-strand specific nucleases from Neurospora crassa</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kato, Ann C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An exonuclease and an endonuclease from N. crassa, highly specific for single-stranded nucleic acids, were used in structural studies on DNA. The exonuclease was used in the identification of repetitive sequences in E. coli DNA. Sheared, denatured E. coli DNA was annealed at 600 at a Cot of land treated with the exonuclease. Approximately 8% of the DNA was recovered as renatured, double-stranded DNA by chromatography on methylated albumin kieselguhr. This DNA was denatured a second time and annealed at various Cot values; about 40% ( 3% of the starting material ) reassociated at rates faster thon the total DNA indicating that a small portion of the E. coli genome comprises a heterogeneous collection of repetitive sequences. The endonuclease "nicked" UV-irradiated native DNA faster than unirradiated DNA; increasing doses of UV resulted in an increase in the nucleolytic activity. These results suggest that the endonuclease may be involved in an excision repair process. Superhelical RF 1 DNA was more sensitive to the action of the endonuclease than nonsuperhelical DNA suggesting that single-stranded regions may occur in superhelical DNA. The effects of UV-irradiation on superhelical DNA were also studied. The results of this investigation support the theory that superhelical DNA contains negative twists.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fraser, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kt42b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kn71b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296x2271"><ual:graduationDate>1973</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mechanisms involved in developmental changes in auditory short-term memory</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Frank, Hallie S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A series of studies was undertaken with the aim of specifying the mechanisms responsible for age-related improvement in auditory short-term memory.

The techniques of temporal grouping and running memory span were employed to evaluate the sensitivity of rehearsal strategies to changes with age. The stimulus suffix paradigm was used to uncover developmental changes in the precategorical storage system. The results suggest that spontaneous rehearsal strategies undergo significant developmental changes. Evidence for age-related changes in the precategorical storage system is not compelling.

The former reactions were similar on halided surfaces of all the metals. Kinetics and activation parameters were determined. Although all the chloride was retained during each reaction in the latter category, surface deactivation occurred rapidly for all the metals except titanium and manganese. Where possible, reaction order and activation parameters were determined. Initial reactions on unreacted or lightly reacted surfaces were also studied and three types of behavior detected: dehydrohalogenation, retentive adsorption and hydrogenation.

KC-18 also exerted anti-anaphylactic activity in actively sensitized guinea pigs. In addition, KC-18 inhibited histamine-induced hypotension and gastric acid secretion, but it could not antagonize the histamine-induced contraction of the isolated guinea pig ileum. The investigations also resulted in obtaining a highly purified oak gall extract which exerted potent anti-inflammatory activity in rats when tested by the carrageenan-induced paw edema test.

All four are derived from epithelial cells which are rich in free ribosomes and therefore, considered to be immature; they are situated next to Paneth cells at the base of the crypts. Young stages of each cell type are similar to the immature epithelial cells. This resemblance is gradually lost with age as the cells migrated away from the crypt base. Columnar and mucous cells behave in a similar way. Young cells are proliferative; as they mature they migrate up the villi and are lost into the lumen of the intestine. Most young argentaffin cells are not proliferative. Mature cells are also lost from the population via the villous tips. Paneth cells do not proliferate nor migrate but degenerate in situ and are phagocytosed by adjacent immature epithelial cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p129j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dg72f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p096b10z"><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Experimental salmonellosis in mice: studies on the nature of the immunity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rose, Esmie A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Immunity to Salmonella typhimurium was investigated in a susceptible (C57BI/6J) and a resistant (A/J) strain of mice.

Normal macrophages of both strains were equally phagocytic but those of the susceptible strain were twice as bactericidal as those of the resistant strain. Therefore, susceptibility in this instance did not result from inability of macrophages to phagocytize or to kill the organism. Macrophages from resistant animals intensively immunized with a phenol-killed vaccine demonstrated increased bactericidal activity in the absence of specific antibody. Similar immunization did not increase macrophage bactericidal activity in susceptible animals, but activity was enhanced by antibody. Immunity was, therefore, conferred by the combined activities of macrophages and antibodies. Initially, host macrophages restrict bacterial multiplication allowing development of a more potent bactericidal mechanism. The latter involves development of increased bactericidal capacity by macrophages and production of antibodies which act synergistically with them.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vas, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246v99j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096b10z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fp872"><ual:graduationDate>1972</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of deficiencies of iron, copper and riboflavin in the rat on monoamine oxidase activity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Symes, Aston L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The mitochondrial monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity of livers from rats deficient in iron, copper or both those elements was compared with the activity in livers from normal rats. The activities towards isoamylamine, tyramine and benzylamine were studied by means of oxygen uptake using an oxygen electrode. MAO activity of the livers decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.01) when the levels of liver iron decreased. Copper-deficiency had no effect on the enzyme. Expired radioactivity collected from rats injected with [1-14C]n-pentylamine (5 microCi/kg) was measured as l4CO2 . The rate of catabolism of the amine decreased progressively in iron deficient rats, reaching about 60% of control values in 3 weeks. Feeding with iron yielded normal rates within 6 days. Catabolism of amyl alcohol, which shares a common pathway with n-pentylamine via valeraldehyde, was unaffected by iron-deficiency. These results are consistent with a function of iron in the maintenance of normal MAO activity in vivo. Some iron chelators and hemolytic agents also inhibited MAO.

In principle, the basic determinants of desired level of reserves turn out to be not only the levels of such variables as exports, aid/capital flows, lines of credit and the opportunity cost of holding reserves, but also the standard deviation of these variables. In order to make the theory amenable to empirical testing, use is made of an adjustment mechanism by which countries adjust their actual stocks of reserves to their desired levels in terms of a distributed lag analysis. Using data for the 1951 - 1965 period, our empirical analysis indicates that, on the average, developing countries are able to complete only less than half of the desired change in their reserves each year; that the reserve-import ratio is a more reasonable decision variable than the absolute level of reserves; and that, in the short run, the critical determinants are past reserve holdings and the current level of the ratio of capital goods imports to total imports, a "development" variable used as a proxy for the opportunity cost of holding reserves. On individual country basis, however, the above generalizations break down.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Handa, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150n032.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816q51s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m992q"><ual:graduationDate>1972</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Experimental streptococcal glomerulonephritis in rabbits and further studies on the nature of nephrotoxin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ng, Wei-wei</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of the extracellular, dialysable nephrotoxin produced by a group A type 12 streptococcus on the rabbit was studied critically for the similarities to human acute glomerulonephritis.

It was concluded that the mechanism of the anti-inhibitory action of thebaine and strychnine is very similar and their interaction is probably a reflection of the competition of the two drugs for the same receptor site in the inhibitory synapse.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Esplin, D.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Esplin, B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t2368.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92gb34n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r171r"><ual:graduationDate>1972</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The head of the rat spermatozoon and its formation during spermiogenesis: an electron microscopic study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lalli, Michael F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The chronological formation and development of three rat spermatozoon head components - the nucleus, acrosomic system and perinuclear theca - were investigated by electron microscopy during spermiogenesis and transit through the epididymis. Chromatin condensation involves an intermediate step of coarse chromatin filament formation. Coarse filaments aggregate into coarse chromatin clumps which, in turn, fuse into a dense homogeneous mass late in spermiogenesis. The completely formed acrosomic system is composed of the acrosome and head cap, both enclosed in a continuous unit membrane, and a separated portion of the head cap called the ventral flap running on the antero-ventral part of the head. During spermiogenesis, the acrosome and head cap are formed as distinct morphological entities, and the ventral flap ls split off from the head cap during step 14 of spermiogenesis. Perinuclear material forms adjacent to the nucleus in three areas which eventually become connected. The material of this continuous layer condenses during the last steps 18 and 19 of spermiogenesis to form the perinuclear theca, a continuous layer over the nucleus except around the attachment site of the flagellum.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m2513.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r171r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak3569737s"><ual:graduationDate>1934</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The stream of consciousness in recent English fiction by women</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Milburne, Kathleen Estey</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis traces the birth and growth of the stream of consciousness method in English fiction, paying particular attention to the way it has been handled by such literary artists as Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf, and the late Katherine Mansfield. Chapter One deals with the growth of Modern Subjective fiction, from the writing of Henry James to that of James Joyce. Chapter Two endeavours to show how Dorothy Richardson has used the method in her series of novels, Pilgrimage. Throughout the ten volumes she has never gone outside the consciousness of her main character, Miriam Henderson. Chapter Three deals with Mrs. Woolf's experiments which have demonstrated with variations of technique, what heights of sensitive artistry the stream of consciousness can attain. Chapter Four studies the work of the late Katherine Mansfield, who by introducing the stream of consciousness method into the short story, has created original beauty and fresh technical resources in that medium.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Files, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z3934.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569737s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>ENGLISH FICTION -- HISTORY AND CRITICISM</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02871012w"><ual:graduationDate>1972</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The habenulo - interpeduncular pathway</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lake, Norma</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Electrophysiological studies with extracellular macro- and micro-electrodes in 58 cats revealed spontaneous rhythmic oscillations in the interpeduncular nucleus, ranging tram 3 - 4 HZ to 9 - 10 Hz under different anaesthetics. There was little obvious correlation between these waves and the spontaneous firing patterns of interpeduncular units. Possible origins of the waves are discussed. Stimulation of the habenula evoked in the nucleus brief positive-negative waves followed by a slow negative, and then a slow positive wave. The majority of interpeduncular units excited by habenular stimulation initially fired during the brief early waves. The unit discharge was either (i) a constant latency spike, which followed repetitive stimulation at 100 Hz or more, or (ii) at relatively variable latency, a single spike or a short burst of 2 - 6 spikes at 500 - 1000 HZ. Same units showed, after the habenular stimulus, sequences of initial excitation followed by inhibition, while other units showed pure inhibition. Over 80% of units either excited or inhibited by habenular stimulation were excited by acetylcholine applied micro-iontophoretically; this excitation was potentiated by neostigmine and blocked by atropine.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Au cours d'une étude électrophysiologique conduite sur 58 chats à l'aide de micro-électrodes, il a été mis en évidence dans le noyau interpédonculaire des oscillations spontanées rythmiques dont la fréquence varie de 3 ou 4 HZ á 9 ou 10 Hz selon le type d'anesthésie. La corrélation entre ces activités globales et les modalités de décharges spontanées des neurones du noyau interpédonculaire est faible et incertaine. Les origines possibles de l'activité ainsi décrite sont discutées. La stimulation de l'habénula évoque dans le noyau interpédonculaire une réponse qui se compose d'une onde rapide positive-négative suivie d'une onde lente négative et enfin lente et positive. La décharge initiale de la majorité des neurones interpédonculaires, en réponse à la stimulation de l'habénula, est synchrone des ondes rapides précoces. La réponse cellulaire est: soit un spike de latence constante pouvant suivre une stimulation répétitive à 100 Hz ou plus, soit, à une latence variable, un spike unique ou un train de 2 à 6 spikes à 500-1000 Hz. Quelques cellules sont excitées puis inhibées par la stimulation habénulaire et d'autres purement inhibées. Plus de 80% des cellules influencées d'une manière ou d'une autre par la stimulation habénulaire sont excitées par des injections micro-iontophorétiques d'acetylcholine; cette excitation est potentiée par la néostigmine et bloquée par l'atropinè.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Krnjevic, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580q76q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02871012w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526g353"><ual:graduationDate>1972</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on skin allograft reactions in ALS-treated mice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kongshavn, Patricia A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Various factors that influence the skin allograft reaction were studied in mice, with the aid of anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS). H-2 incompatible allografts were rejected more rapidly in female than in male hosts treated with ALS. Male mouse submandibular glands contained a substance that was immunosuppressive for both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. This substance, although only present in males, was not responsible for the sex difference in skin allograft survival. The sex difference was due instead to an immunopotentiating effect exerted by the ovaries of the female. ALS treatment was used in a weak histocompatibility system (H-1) to investigate the origin and possible role of a nonsensitized cell population in the allograft reaction. Bone marrow but not thymus or spleen cells were demonstrated to act as effector cells in allograft rejection. The experimental results are discussed in relation to a proposal that this effector cell is a monocyte-macrophage.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bliss, J.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Lapp, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f907j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s7526g353</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awd376076c"><ual:graduationDate>1972</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Implication of cyclic AMP in the physiopathology of labile high blood pressure</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hamet, Pavel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The etiology and the physiopathological mechanism of essential hypertension is, in 1972, still unknown.

This latter conclusion is based on the fin ding that lymphoid cells of a sensitized rabbit lost the capacity to transfer the delayed hypersensitivity skin reactivity to a normal recipient or to be inhibited in their migration in vitro by the specific antigen although the cell donors were still capable of giving optimal delayed hypersensitivity skin reactions. It was also demonstrated that the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are activated through different and independent cell pathways. These studies of the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in normal outbred rabbits therefore suggest the existence of multiple pathways mediating these two types of immune response.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Richter, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wq84h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r855p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6682x684n"><ual:graduationDate>1972</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The gastric mucosal barrier</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Greenberg, Leonard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bidirectional chloride and sodium ion fluxes,and net hydrogen ion fluxes were measured across segments of gastric oxyntic gland mucosa with intact blood supply, in anaesthetized dogs.

Peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were obtained from the peritoneal cavity 72 hrs after i. p. injection of beef heart infusion broth (B.H.I.B.). Anti-T2-phage antisera were prepared in both rats and rabbits. Evidence for the requirement of opsonin (IgM or IgG) from homologous or heterologous sera was provided by using in vitro sensitized antigen for phagocytosis by rat PEC in vitro. Homologous serum containing 7S IgG antibodies provided the highest degree of enhancement of antigen uptake by rat PEC. The specific opsonin was isolated by starch block electrophoresis of anti-T2-phage rat serum and identified by immunoelectrophoresis as IgG class of antibodies. The presence of specific anti-T2-phage antibodies was demonstrated by the phage neutralization technique. When antisera and opsonin were reduced with 0.2 M 2-ME and alkylated with iodoacetate and iodocacetamide, the phagocytosis promoting activity was reduced considerably. The attachment of antigen-antibody complexes onto the surface of phagocytic cells seems to be dependent on the intactness of the antibody molecule. An attempt was made to detect in vitro synthesis of anti-T2-phage antibodies by culture of lymph node fragment, using RNA preparations from macrophages which had been incubated in vitro with antigen. Only sma1l amounts of antibody were detected. Difficulties were encountered in the isolation of undegraded RNA from peritoneal exudate cells, which were attributed ta the presence of RNase in PEC. RNase activity ·in PEC was higher than in any of the other rat tissues examined, e.g., lymph nodes, thymus, spleen and liver. Polyvinyl sulfate was found to be the best of a number of RNase inhibitors tested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sehon, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wt529.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tg16v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720g90n"><ual:graduationDate>1972</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The structure and metabolism of galactosylgalactosyiglucosylceramide</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Clarke, Joe T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Galactosylgalactosylglucosylceramide (CTH) was purified from normal human kidneys, and the kidney of a patient with Fabry's disease (characterized by a defect in the catabolism of CTH).

CTH and lactosylceramide labelled in the terminal galactose residues were used to show that the terminal galactosidic linkage of CTH, but not lactosylceramide, was susceptible to hydrolysis by an alpha-galactosidase from coffee beans. Labelled CTH and p-nitrophenyl- alpha-D-galactopyranoside were used to demonstrate concomitant deficiencies of CTH galactohydrolase and nonspecific alpha-galactosidase in the kidney of a patient with Fabry's disease. Following renal transplantation the excretion of CTH in the patient's urine fell from 35 times to 4-8 times normal levels. The concentration of CTH in the plasma decreased transiently then returned to preoperative levels. These findings indicate that 1) CTH cOlltains a terminal alpha-D-galactopyranosyl residue, 2) the nonspecific alpha-galactosidase deficiency observed in patients with Fabry's disease is a direct reflection of the deficiency of CTH galactohydrolase, and 3) renal transplantation has no place in the treatment of nonuremic patients with Fabry's disease at present.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wolfe, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207ts21h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720g90n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tz148"><ual:graduationDate>1972</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The organ sources(s) of the cells mediating a cellular immune reaction in vitro</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Behelak, Youssef</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this investigation was to establish an in vitro counterpart to the in vivo graft-versus-host reaction.

Spleen and lymph node cells were less effective in inhibiting the in vitro immune response whereas thymus and bone marrow exhibited no inhibitory activity. It was demonstrated that the inhibition of the generation of plaque-forming cells is not mediated by the release of cytotoxic antibodies directed to the memory spleen cells by the allogeneic lymphocytes. Following immunization with the appropriate antigen, allogeneic lymphocytes or SRBC so as to induce cell mediated and humoral responses respectively, the effector cells were shown to migrate to the thymus, whereas antibody forming cells were shown to migrate initially to the Peyer's patches.
