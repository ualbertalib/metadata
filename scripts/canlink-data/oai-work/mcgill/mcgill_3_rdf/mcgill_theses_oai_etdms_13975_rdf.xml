"Neurones" was used by Waldeyer (1891) to describe the nerve cells which includes the nucleated cell body as weil as ali of its processes. Nerve cells are separated from but intermingled with its neighbors. There is no continuity between adjacent processes as was previously believed. lnstead, a synapse (Sherrington, 1897) was thought to be present at the point of contact between any two links in the chain of cells (Schafer, 1900).
