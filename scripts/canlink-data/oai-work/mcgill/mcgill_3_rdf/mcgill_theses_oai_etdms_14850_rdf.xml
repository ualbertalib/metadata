A theoretical investigation has revealed some of the sources of error inherent in present earpiece optical arrangements which have limited the overall accuracy of the technique. These errors cannot be corrected for in practice but may be eliminated or minimized by improved earpiece construction. Several methods of evaluating the accuracy and reliability of both instantaneous and continuous absolute oxygen saturation measurements are suggested.

The average week end reduction in smoke is about 20 percent. Readings adjacent to Mount Royal Park are reduced by nearly one half, but no attempt is made to separate out the effects of the Park acting as a smokeless zone, and the mountain acting as an obstacle to the wind flow. Data from the elevated location, together with visual observations, suggests that at night the smoke over the city is usually confined to a layer several hundred feet deep. A simple model is developed to consider the modification of stable air as it moves across a city acting as a heat and smoke source. An adiabatic mixing layer of increasing depth builds up due to the accumulation of heat. Applying this model indicates that half of the smoke in mid-winter is due to heating of buildings.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, J.

A modified Stewartson transformation is employed to transform the compressible integral momentum equation to an equivalent incompressible plane, adopting approximate temperature-velocity relations of the Crocco and van Driest forme A semi-empirical auxiliary equation, developed by M. R. Head for incompressible flow and using the concept of mass entrainment into the boundary layer, is rearranged for use in the transformed plane. The theoretical results obtained by this method are then compared to McLafferty's lag-length theory, and to experimental data obtained by C.E. Kepler and R.L. O'Brien. It is seen that the mass entrainment theory is in good qualitative agreement with the reported data, and in reasonable quantitative agreement.The latter may be improved by postulating a relationship between temperature and velocity in the boundary layer which is in closer agreement with experiment. It appears that the mass entrainment theory indicates the point of separation of the compressible, turbulent boundary layer, in accordance with conventional incompressible separation criteria.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Molder, S.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Newman, B.

P. (Peter Peet)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Since the invention of calculating machinery, the attention of mathematicians has been turning from the search for methods of integrating differentia! equations to the investigation of theorems of existence. Recent advances in storedprogram digital computer technology have contributed to the acceleration of this trend and quickened interest in numerical analysis as well. Numerical techniques now exist for the integration of all ordinary and many partial differential equations; but it is clearly imperative to know beforehand whether the sought solution exists at all. The need for existence proofs is frequently neglected by engineers on the supposition that any physical problem must surely have an answer, most likely even a unique one. As any physical problem must first be described by a conceptual model and only the model transformed into a mathematical problem, this simple view is unfortunately not valid. There exist techniques in many fields for checking the correctness of the mathematical description of models; but the creation of the models themselves is at best an uncertain art.

Anand and Brobeck (1951) were the first to demonstrate that bilateral lesions placed lateral to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus in both rats and cats were consistently associated with the development of a temporary or permanent aphagia (refusal to eat). This finding has been duplicated in various other animal species including birds (Andersson, Fabricus, Svensson &amp; Akerman, 1960: Feldman, Larsson, Dimick, &amp; Leprovsky, 1957) and monkeys (Anand, Dua &amp; Shoenberg, 1955).

Specific antibody proteins have been isolated and characterized from such a system. However, non-specific radioactive proteins which coprectpitated with heterologous precipitates were also found in the culture medium (Ketson and Katchen, 1956; Wolf and Stavitsky, 1958; Stavitsky 1958, 1960, 1961; Dutton et al., 1958; Askonas and Humphrey, 1958; Vaughan et al., 1960; Bussard and Huynh, 1960; and Thorbecke, 1960). The so-called non-specific proteins were produced by normal and immunologically competent cells; they had the capacity to absorb to antigen-antibody complexes and were found in the alpha and beta globulin protein fractions. These properties suggested that such non-specific proteins might be complement. In this laboratory, non-specific coprecipitating proteins were also found to be present in culture medium in which immunologically competent cells were Incubated. This observation,as well as those previously mentioned, initiated this investigation in order to determine whether or not these non-specific proteins were identlcal with complement and also to identify the tissues concerned with the synthesis.

Since the early work of Klüver and Bucy (1937) and Papez (1937), a great deal of experimentation has centered on this particular region of the brain. There now appears to be at least some general agreement on the gross changes in behavior which follow lesions and stimulation in the various areas of the limbic system. But in most cases precisely how these general changes in emotionality affect behavior in specifie circumstances is still not known, and how the limbic system functions, in whole or in part, to modify behavior is far from clear.

Furthermore, we can see in them the germs of his later thought.
