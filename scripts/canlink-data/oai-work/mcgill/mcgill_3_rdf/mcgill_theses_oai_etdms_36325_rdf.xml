This is based on the truss concept, and requires consideration of shear studs in the hole region as vertical tension members. According to this, a structural action between the concrete slab and shear connectors for carrying or transferring vertical shear to the steel beam was clearly identified. On the basis of the slab behaviour identified, truss idealizations capable of determining the slab shear carrying capacity in a rational manner were developed. Then, the ultimate strength for composite beams at web holes was formulated including the truss idealizations. Another ultimate strength analysis accounting for the slab shear carrying capacity in a simple manner, which was also developed during this research project, is given. This provided the fundamental solution procedure for the plastic analysis used. A series of nine tests was carried out with particular attention being directed to the verification of the proposed truss analogy. The major test parameters included the configurations of the studs in the hole region, the width of the concrete slab and stud detailing near the high moment end of the hole. The ultimate strength predictions were made by the two methods developed, and compared with previous and present test results.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kk29x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q7060</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623d323"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Representations of exact distribution of random volume from beta type-2 random points</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chu, P.

The moment expressions for $ nabla$ = r! $ Delta$ are available in the literature if the random points are (1) uniformly distributed, (2) beta type-1 distributed and (3) beta type-2 distributed. We will focus on the random points coming from beta type-2 distribution in this thesis. By considering the structure of moments and using the method of transformations, various series representations for the exact density of W, a constant multiple of $ nabla sp2$, are derived. Gamma type approximations and Pearson curves approximation to the exact density of W are discussed. Some numerical computations are given to compare the accuracy of each method. Two asymptotic normality results are obtained, which are analogous to the result conjectured by Miles (1971) for the case of uniformly distributed random points. Some applications are also considered.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732d971f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d323</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cr073"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fault tolerant arrays</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>LaForge, Laurence E. (Laurence Edward)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We investigate the existence and computability of a fault cover for a configuration architecture; that is, a setting of switches that achieves an array despite the presence of faulty elements and broken interconnect. The switches may be stuck open or closed. For a preponderance of architectures these questions are NP-complete. This is not the case with local sparing, a fundamental approach that can, in fact, be applied to any nominal architecture. We give an algorithm that decides and computes a fault cover in time that is subcubic in the size of a locally spared array whose neighboring blocks of h elements each can be connected in any of h x h ways. We measure scaling in terms of the probability of a fault cover (coverage), the fraction of faults we can tolerate (tolerance), and the ratio of the size of the architecture to the size of the nominal array (redundancy). We establish a threshold tolerance to faults such that, for arbitrary coverage less than 1, a local spares fault cover exists. We prove that the stochastic tolerance of a two-dimensional array spared by local blocks is much better than when spares are arranged by rows and columns. As to the latter, we treat two architectures: homogeneous and dedicated spares, the worst-case tolerance of which is much better than that of local spares. The fault tolerance of each of these architectures is inferior to the general grid scheme of (Leighton and Leiserson 1985). However, the longest wire in an array configured from a general grid is almost never shorter than that of an array configured by local spares. Although it is not the most tolerant configuration architecture, the combined test and configuration tolerance of local spares is essentially the same as the configuration tolerance alone. Moreover, the stochastic test redundancy of local spares matches the lower bound of (Scheinerman 1987) and (Blough 1988). We show that convergent hypergeometric and binomial distributions of faults do not imply convergent coverage. We characterize homogeneous spares whose complementary external graph consists of a vertex-disjoint packing of star graphs; this solves exactly a subset of the problem of Zarankiewicz.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tg126.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cr073</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zv026"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Italian</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The parabola of pleasure : a study of the cornice of the Decameron</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Muto, Lisa M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this dissertation I examine the narrative parts of the so-called cornice of the Decameron. The core of my interpretation is to be found in Chapter I where I show that the frame story--the novella portante, as it has been called--with its "parabolic" rather than "rectilinear" progression is intended to illustrate the brigade's pursuit of pleasure, without any ulterior motive such as, for instance, the restructuring of the decaying Florentine society. A careful study of the members of the brigade (Chapter II) and of their songs (Chapter III) obviously forms an integral part of any analysis of the frame story. The Appendix deals with the illustrations of the cornice: the rich iconographic tradition of the Decameron, at least before this century, appears to have accorded more significance to the frame story than has literary criticism.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/000000727.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zv026</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Boccaccio, Giovanni, 1313-1375.

A necessary assignment is one which must be made in order to find a test--there is no test in the half-space define by the opposite assignment. Certain other assignments are nonconflicting in the sense that they narrow the search space and never lead to backtracking--if the fault is testable, then there is at least one test vector in the half-space defined by the assignment. The remaining assignments are arbitrary--they may or may not lead in the direction of a test and may or may not cause backtracking. Since necessary and nonconflicting assignments do not lead to backtracking, an efficient test pattern generation algorithm should determine and apply them prior to any arbitrary branching. This thesis presents algorithms based on the mathematical properties of images and inverse images of set functions to identify necessary and nonconflicting assignments in combinational logic circuits. Issues relating to the efficient implementation of these algorithms, are addressed from both a theoretical and practical perspective. Experimental results obtained on a variety of benchmark circuits show that algorithmic assignment identification can be used to reduce or eliminate backtracking in automatic test pattern generation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c3527.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w552k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451j227"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The goals of the world historians : paradigms in world history in twentieth century</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Costello, Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Following Nietzsche, Oswald Spengler posed the central problems of the cyclical history of civilization in the twentieth century. Subsequent world historical theorists have attempted to answer Spengler's nihilistic perspective on the destined rise and fall of all cultures by rescuing a progressive movement which transcended the downfall of civilizations. World history since Spengler has been written in pursuit of an answer to the crises of modernism: to the 'Death of God,' the problem of progress, the emergent technological order with its bureaucratic management of society, and the need sensed by the metahistorians for a new 'mythical' grounding to avert the fall of the West. The "Crisis of the West" dominates the perspectives of the world historians. Their goals for the solution of 'modernism,' through the religious transformation of society or political and cultural world unity, are central to their motivation as writers and to the formulation of their paradigms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tm74r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451j227</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>History -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>History, Modern -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Civilization, Modern -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3t945r468"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mycorrhizal effects on 15N-transfer from legume to grass intercrops, plant growth and interspecific competition</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hamel, Chantal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>N-transfer from legume to grass when the two were intercropped in the field and the mechanisms of this transfer were studied. Studies involving either alfalfa-grasses or soybean-corn intercrops, were undertaken. Mycorrhizal and P-supplemented (to compensate for the lack of mycorrhizae) intercrops were compared. In these studies, the legume component of intercrops was labelled with $ sp{15}$N and any excess of the label was looked for in the associated grass plants. There was no reversal of N transport at the legume-fungus interface. N-transfer from legume to grass must therefore, proceed via excretion of N by legume roots and subsequent uptake by grass roots. Soil microorganisms and proximity of plant root systems are important factors affecting N-transfer. Mycorrhizae enhance the transfer by increasing the absorptive efficiency of the receiver plants. Mycorrhizal fungi enhance the competitiveness of the most mycotrophic component of the mixtures by either improving P uptake or the general nutrient balance of the plant. Mycorrhizal inoculation can decrease the level of P competition between corn and soybean by increasing the availability of P. The observation that mycorrhizal plants differ in many regards from P-supplemented plants, emphasize the generally poor comprehension of the mycorrhizal symbiosis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mg16b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945r468</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Intercropping</dc:subject><dc:subject>Legumes -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Crops and nitrogen</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grasses -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mycorrhizas</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rm013"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The maximum entropy principle as a basis for statistical models in epidemiology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>LeBlanc, Raymond</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We propose an approach for the construction of statistical models based on the maximum entropy principle in conjunction with a constructive method relying on a precise description of the individual contribution of each possible unit of observation of the population. This procedure is applied to the analysis of 2 x 2 tables, ubiquitous in biostatistics. This approach provides a new perspective and understanding of the fundamental nature of logistic regression, of Cox's proportional hazard model and of the noncentral hypergeometric model. Application of this method to analyse the odds ratio produces new distributions for this random variable and gives new means of estimating the odds ratio by confidence intervals. We present basic properties of these distributions and compare results with other methods. Finally, this constructive approach that proceeds from the lower level of the individual contribution of the experimental units to the global level of the population is applied to sample size determination for comparative studies when, in the compared groups, there is attrition due to noncompliance to the specific regimen. This attrition reduces the apparent treatment effect in the analysis. This presentation constitutes a foundation for a more general and elegant solution to the problem.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j74d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rm013</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mv87x"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the structural properties of cominational circuits and their application to fault simulation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Maamari, Fadi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A new fault simulation framework is proposed for combinational circuits, supported by a detailed analysis of the complexity of each of the three fault simulation components: fault-free (logic) simulation, explicit simulation of reconvergent fanout stem faults, and critical path tracing within fanout-free regions. The complexity analysis, measured in terms of the number of required gate evaluations, is implementation independent. The new framework achieves a reduction of the complexity of each component at both the static (input vector independent) level and the dynamic (input vector dependent) level. At the static level, structural properties determined by a reconvergent fanout analysis are used to reduce the explicit simulation of fanout stem faults. At the dynamic level, dependencies between fault detectabilities are identified and used to reduce both the critical path tracing and explicit simulation components. In addition, fault-free simulation is reduced by tracking areas outside of which it is not required. The dynamic analysis reduces the fault simulation even further through a selective choice of the order in which the three simulation components are performed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv27b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mv87x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bc25j"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The analogy between virtue and crafts in Plato's early dialogues</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tankha, Vijay</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates Plato's analogy between virtue and crafts, a comparison made extensively in the early dialogues. I first detail the model of technical knowledge that Plato uses as a paradigm of knowledge. An application of this model shows the inadequacies in some claims to know or to teach virtue. Applying the model to the Socratic dictum, 'Virtue is knowledge' enables us to understand what such knowledge is about. Such knowledge is identified as 'self-knowledge' and is the product of philosophy. Philosophy is thus revealed as the craft of virtue, directed at the good of individuals. One problematic aspect of the analogy between virtue and crafts is the possibility of misuse. Virtue conceived as self-knowledge enables Plato to explain both why such a craft cannot be misused and why it alone can be the basis for benefiting others.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq455.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc25j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plato -- Contributions in theory of knowledge</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self-knowledge, Theory of -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Knowledge, Theory of -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv935367k"><ual:graduationDate>1978</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ice ablation measured by stakes and by terrestrial photogrammetry : a comparison on the lower part of the White Glacier, Axel Heiberg Island, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Arnold, K.
