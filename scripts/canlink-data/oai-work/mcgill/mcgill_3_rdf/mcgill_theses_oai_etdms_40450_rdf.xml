The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS; Schopler, Reichler, &amp; Renner, 1986) was used as a continuous diagnostic measure in order to correlate performance on the measures with the severity of autism. On the FTII, as autistic symptomatology increased, the percent of time a child oriented to novel stimuli in both immediate and delayed conditions also increased. On the ESCS, as autistic symptomatology increased, joint attention behaviors decreased. Comparing the ESCS and the FTII indicated that as joint attention behaviors decreased, selective attention to novelty increased. With respect to the new attention measure, children with typical development oriented more than 85% of the time to all stimuli, whereas children with more features of autism oriented less frequently to social and auditory stimuli, and were slower to orient to auditory stimuli. The findings represent preliminary behavioral evidence for a social attention deficit in children with autism. The implications for these findings are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burack, Jake</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Doehring, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zw42c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cg379</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social interaction in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Autistic children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arb68xd66d"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Political philosophy of al-Ghazzālī : an analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kamarudin, Russli</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the political philosophy of al-Ghazzali from an analytical point of view. It focuses its examination on his theory regarding the imamate and sultanate. This examination is based on four of his works, namely, Fad&amp;dotbelow;a'ih&amp;dotbelow; al-Bat&amp;dotbelow;iniyah wa-fad&amp;dotbelow;a'il al-Mustaz&amp;dotbelow;hiriyah, al-Iqtis&amp;dotbelow;ad fi'l-i'tiqad, Ih&amp;dotbelow;ya' 'ulum al-din and Nas&amp;dotbelow;ih&amp;dotbelow;at al-muluk . It begins with an account of past scholarship on al-Ghazzali's political thought. Until recently scholars have focused on al-Ghazzali's theories without giving due consideration to the circumstances that led him to develop them. This thesis shows how they were shaped by his encounter with the 'Abbasid court and the Seljuq sultanate, and how his own theological and juridical concerns coloured his interpretations. The practical necessity of justifying his concept of the imamate was forced upon him by the challenge posed by the Fat&amp;dotbelow;imid caliph in Egypt, and by the reality of power politics in Baghdad, where the caliph exercised only nominal control. Throughout his writings he demonstrates an overriding concern for a stable society in which Islam can be practiced in full, even at the cost of living under an oppressive system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lawson, Todd</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sv78w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xd66d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ghazzālī, 1058-1111 -- Views on imamate</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ghazzālī, 1058-1111 -- Views on sultanate</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag732db914"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>National consciousness and the Communist Revolution in China, 1921-1928</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Karrar, Hasan Haider</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This essay examines the relationship between national consciousness and the Communist Revolution in China between the years 1921 and 1928. In tracing the trajectory of the national consciousness in our stipulated time period we can discern three distinct phases in its manifestation. Up until 1919 national consciousness was confined primarily to an intellectual elite whose primary concern was the decadence of the Imperial and Confucian state. Following the May Fourth movement (1919), these concerns came to be diffused amongst the urban population. After the formation of the Chinese Communist Party, the Party addressed nationalist concerns by focusing on the role of imperialists and warlords. This continued following the alliance with the Nationalist Party, the Guomindang, under the United Front. By 1925 there was the growth of populist movements with distinctly anti-imperialist overtones. The same time also saw a growing interest in the potential of the peasantry as the vanguard for the nationalist revolution. After the April 12, 1927 coup, the Party focused exclusively on the peasantry to carry on with the Nationalist Revolution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Szonyi, Michael</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Nuomoff, Sam</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10ws302.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732db914</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zhongguo gong chan dang -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nationalism -- China -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Communism -- China -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>China -- History -- Republic, 1912-1949</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rw43d"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ita</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Italian</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La giovane narrativa : narrativa, società ed economia negli anni ottanta</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kaspar, Harach</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Italian literature which came to life in the Eighties broke with the tradition of the preceding period during which fiction was but a fertile ground for social criticism.

And, if so, under what conditions? The study suggests that the Merger Control Regulation does, indeed, cover cases of collective dominance. It recommends, however, that a proposed transaction should only be blocked on grounds of collective dominance if it raises substantive doubts that the transaction will create an anti-competitive market structure (like, for example, the Gencor/Lonrho case). Should the doubts not attain the required level, then a two-stage approach is suggested. The first stage would have to screen the proposed transaction as being reasonably capable of guaranteeing a competitive environment (despite the initial doubts as to the collective dominance issue). The second stage would be opened only if the Commission has legitimate reasons to believe that the firms concerned are effectively involved in either concerted practices (Art. 85 EEC Treaty) or in a collective abuse of a dominant position (Art. 86). Interestingly, the Commission seems to have adopted a similar approach in some of the latest border-line cases. After an extensive analysis of the landmark decision Nestle/Perrier, this thesis finds that the described two-stage approach would also have been appropriate in this case.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Richard, Janda</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182n15r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g214m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214r08k"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Distributed channel allocation simulation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Alleyne, Peter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Distributed discrete event simulations can be used to solve many real world problems. The obvious benefit in solving large complex problems using parallel versus serial techniques is speed. In this thesis, I will examine a solution to the problem of channel allocation with specific applications to cellular communication or mobile computing. The distributed simulation, based on conservative simulation techniques, utilizes a deadlock avoidance approach. The distributed simulation is performed on a BBN multiprocessor computer. The simulation utilizes seven independent processors which tessellate into the geometric shape of a hexagon. The simulation is a true distributed message passing application whereby a communication layer is used to pass messages between processors. The channel allocation algorithms examined are based on fixed channel allocation using channel borrowing techniques. The channel reorganization algorithms are done to free channels within the network for requesting calls. Empirical results are examined in terms of efficiency of the simulation, grid size and the inclusion of channel reorganization. Results show that the NULL message approach to deadlock avoidance is favorable when the message density to the network is high. At high message densities as little as five percent of the total messages processed are NULL. At low message densities upwards of 90 percent of messages processed are NULL. The fixed channel allocation using channel borrowing techniques along with channel reorganization showed favorable results. By using channel reorganization, upwards of 20 percent of calls that were initially not connected using channel borrowing schemes were connected after reorganization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tropper, Carl</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074x171.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214r08k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rw44p"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Lahontan et l'évolution moderne du mythe du "bon sauvage"</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Basile, Paola</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this work is to measure the influence of the Dialogues of Lahontan (1702--3) on contemporary thought relative to the myth of the Noble Savage. The text is divided into two parts: (1) Lahontan and the idea of the "noble savage" at the beginning of the 18th century in which we deal with the life of Lahontan, the historical and cultural background in New-France and in Europe at the turn of the 18th century, the Indian tribes of Northeastern America, and finally the Dialogues of Mr le Baron de Lahontan et d'un Sauvage, which consist in a comparison between two ways of life: the "civilized" i.e., European and the "savage" i.e., Amerindian. (2) The idea of the "noble savage" in the XXth century: a study of four representative authors. This part is divided in four chapters relative to the authors chosen. In chronological order: Charles Eastman who published his works at the beginning of the century, Sun Bear in the 70s, Georges Sioui and Jean Pictet after 1970. Each author's ideas are compared with those of Lahontan and, where it applies, with those of the other authors. The conclusion underlines the fact that the ideas expressed in the four contemporary texts, having of course characteristics marking them as belonging to their specific historical milieu, borrow much from Lahontan and finally go back to a trend of thought that originated in Antiquity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tichoux, Alein</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dp360.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rw44p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Noble savage</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lahontan, Louis Armand de Lom d'Arce, baron de, 1666-1715?

The latter amounts to, up to this day, one hundred and sixty eight titles, to which we must add several outside the series. How can we explain the readers, craze for such works? A possible explanation resides in the quite particular style which distinguishes them. There are any number of neologisms and various styles and levels of language are merrily mixed therein, reminding us of the Rabelaisian tongue to which it is often compared. But shall we end the parallel between San-Antonio and Rabelais solely at the level of linguistics? After reading Mikhail Bakhtine's study devoted to Francois Rabelais et carnivalesque literature, it seems that this comparison must be taken much further. The distance taken by San-Antonio toward the classic detective novel seem to indicate a strong level of carnivalisation and that is what we will study in this thesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, Andre</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g213b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354h26w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dard, Frédéric -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c2510"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role and application of horticultural therapy with institutionalized older people</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McDowell, Mary Jane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an exploratory examination of the role of horticultural therapy with institutionalized older people. Chapter one considers the demographic trends which are taking place in Canada with respect to the aging population. The need for service provision is discussed from a social work perspective. The traditional medical and custodial models of care in institutions are critiqued and the psychosocial model, which incorporates a consideration of 'higher' needs such as quality of life and attainment of meaning, is presented as an alternative. Chapter two provides an introduction to horticulture as therapy and includes a literature review and comprehensive history of this therapeutic modality. The theoretical principles of horticultural therapy are explored, with special emphasis on its application with older people in long-term care. Chapter three presents the methodology for field research which involved phenomenological qualitative interviews with nine older people who were living in institutions. Chapter four introduces the research findings. Analysis of the narratives of these participants found that horticultural therapy offers significant benefits, including increased quality of life. Chapter five concludes with proposals for further research and social work practice implications.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rowe, William</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603r041t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c2510</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Older people -- Institutional care -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gardening -- Therapeutic use</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182n161"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mothering multiracial children : indicators of effective interracial parenting</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Smit, Nicolette</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this descriptive/exploratory study was to examine the behavior and attitudes of eleven white and five non-white mothers involved in raising multiracial, preschool-aged, biological children. A theoretical framework based on research carried out with multiracial individuals was used to define interracial parenting strategies that promoted strong racial and personal identities in their children. Through individual interviews, using a questionnaire, an opinion survey, and four vignettes that described racially complex situations, two areas of parenting were examined: contact maintained by mothers with the child's minority background, and the mothers capacity to effectively problem-solve. Little difference was found between the responses of white and non-white mothers. However, among white mothers, the younger, less educated mothers had considerably more contact with the minority culture than did the older, highly educated mothers. The latter, however, performed significantly better than their younger counterparts in providing responses that displayed more of the attitudes and parenting strategies recommended in previous research.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duder, Sydney</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913r78n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182n161</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Racially mixed children -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mother and child -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Identity (Psychology) in children -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m599b"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fractured beings : exploring theories of identity formation, while encouraging social change</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Evoy, Brian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explores both modernist and poststructuralist theories of the identification process as a vehicle for understanding the makeup of individuals and their relationship with social movements.

This essay develops the theory of the fractured being to account for these arrangements and asserts that individuals continually rearrange their identity in order to negotiate axiomatic activities. By demonstrating that it is possible to affect change at micro and macro levels, the fractured being retains agonistic power relations. Theories that demonstrate how individuals resist norms on a daily basis are explored through an examination of daily events, popular culture, and a qualitative interview.

The network of choice for carrying these transmissions will be the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network using the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) transmission protocol. In particular, ATM is well suited for handling variable-bit-rate (VBR) transmissions because it is capable of statistical multiplexing. VBR coding is also advantageous because it is conducive for producing consistent image quality. This thesis outlines the conversion of a software MPEG-2 video coder to operate as a VBR coder and then as a traffic shaping one. The rate controller for the traffic shaping coder is based on the Leaky Bucket policing algorithm to ensure conformity to the network traffic descriptors. First, comparisons are made between constant-bit-rate encoded sequences and their VBR counterparts. As expected, the VBR sequences possess superior average peak signal to noise ratios (PSNRs) while maintaining a more consistent PSNR between frames. Secondly, traffic shaped sequences are introduced for comparison. Compared to the VBR case, these sequences exhibit a less erratic bit rate profile but also a lower average PSNR. However unlike the open-loop encoded data, the traffic shaped bit streams are not likely to encounter any network intervention when transmitted in any realistic network scenario. The effects of varying each network traffic descriptor (peak bit rate, sustained bit rate, and maximum burst size) are examined and the projected network-induced bit losses in the absence of traffic shaping are provided.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dubois, Eric</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fz675.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784n67p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wh985"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A systems approach to modelling and design of high strain shape memory alloy actuators</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lu, Xuemei, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A simulator is developed to model and design high strain shape memory alloy (SMA) tension actuators. The simulator may be used to predict characteristics of a given actuator, or to design its geometry under specifications such as force, speed, stroke and size. The accuracy of the model is verified experimentally in reference to an existing NiTi shape memory alloy prototype actuator. Having developed some confidence in the model, the performance of the proposed actuation mechanism is compared to other existing technologies. In particular, the force-displacement and speed characteristics of a micro-solenoid electro-magnetic actuator and a muscle-size pneumatic actuator are compared to those of the SMA actuators with same dimensions. A new concept of designing shape memory alloy bending actuator is presented in the end of the thesis. Part of the modelling work is accomplished in this research by developing a software simulator which is capable of predicting the geometric transformation of the actuator during bending. As a result, the dynamic strain of each SMA fiber in the actuator can be computed given a bending axis and angle. Graphical display of the bending transformation is implemented using in house software package. Further investigation of modelling and control of the SMA bending actuator is left as future work.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayward, Vincent</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dv09m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wh985</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jg807"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A Saw-based commutation signaling modem for broadband indoor wireless communication</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kipens, George</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Commutation signaling is a bandwidth expanding modulation scheme that is robust to multipath induced intersymbol interference. Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) technology is very suitable for implementing high-speed commutation signaling modems. A SAW-based commutation signaling modem for broadband indoor wireless communication is described. The differential coherent detector is a key element since it performs IF matched filtering and differentially coherent demodulation of the received signal. A commutation signaling differential coherent detector has been implemented using SAW and analog silicon technologies. The bit rate is 40 Mb/s, the chip rate is 200 Mc/s and the operating frequency (IF frequency) is 1 GHz. A multicarrier commutation signaling modem uses frequency-division multiplexed subcarriers to combine a number of lower rate bit streams in order to achieve high-rate data transmission.

Due to its hexagonal crystal structure, magnesium has poor ductility at room temperature. Magnesium's ductility improves significantly above about 200°C due to thermal activation of additional slip systems. This has lead to efforts to form auto-body panels with commercial AZ31 magnesium sheet at elevated temperatures. In this work, various AZ31 magnesium alloy materials were used to investigate the influence of deformation conditions on texture and microstructure. Moreover, it is to define the correlation between formability and different deformation mechanisms. It was observed that only basal slip and twinning contributed to room temperature deformation. As deformation temperature increased, an increase in ductility in Mg contributed to dynamic recrystallization occurring readily at elevated temperatures (≥300°C). Even coarse grain material experienced significant tensile elongation due grain refinement. Depending on temperature and strain rate, different deformation mechanisms were activated and lead to different failure modes (moderate necking, cavity, strong necking). More specifically, deformation at elevated temperature in the low-strain-rate regime with stress exponent n about 2-3 and activation energy close to grain-boundary diffusion of Mg (Q = 92 kJ/mol) is characteristic of GBS. Deformation at elevated temperature in the high strain rate regime showed that the stress exponent increased to a value close to 5 and that the activation energy was consistent with the one for Mg self-diffusion (135 kJ/mol) and for diffusion of Al in Mg (143 kJ/mol). This was indicative of a dislocation creep deformation mechanism. Plus the six-fold symmetric patterns of the {1 100} and {1120} pole figures and the splitting of basal plane distribution are another indication of slip mechanism or of dislocation creep mechanism. The optimum deformation behavior for AZ31 sheet was found to be for the material with fine grain microstructure. The highest elongation of 265% was obtained with the material having initial grain size of 8 mum. In addition, strain-rate sensitivity, which is a good indication of material's ductility, also was the highest in material with 8 mum grain size. As a common trend, the strain-rate sensitivity increased with decreasing strain rate, increasing temperature and decreasing grain size. In terms of drawability of AZ31 sheet, the deformation controlled by GBS resulted in a fair drawability/formability property with r-value about 1 whereas a deformation mechanism controlled by dislocation creep showed a good drawability with r-value above 1.5. Due to activation of additional slip systems (non-basal &lt;a&gt; and &lt;c+a&gt;), the thinning of the sheet was prevented, in particular at deformation conditions of 450°C with 0.1s-1 where r-value was highest. This deformation condition might suggest good forming process parameters, especially for deep drawing, for the commercial AZ31 sheet under investigation. A preliminary study of Forming Limit Diagram for AZ31 sheet was performed by the Limit Dome Height test method at 300°C. The FLD0 of AZ31 was found to be 67%; the part depth of biaxial forming was 1.86 in; and the maximum LDH varied from 2.4 to 2.6 in.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73pw33q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pn12m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aluminum-magnesium-zinc alloys -- Microstructure</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aluminum-magnesium-zinc alloys -- Thermomechanical properties</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apk02cb02n"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Production, characterization and testing of Tempered Martensite Assisted Steels (TMAS) obtained via subcritical annealing of cold rolled TRIP steels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jayaraman, Vikram</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The requirement for lighter, safer and fuel efficient cars has created a major stir in the steel research society to develop advanced automotive steels. Since there is a trade off between strength and ductility, most of the conventional high strength steels do not address the strength-formability combination. With the realization of the TRIP phenomenon first in austenitic stainless steels, a new generation of advanced steels called TRIP steels were realised with an inexpensive and easier to process C-Mn-Si chemistry. TRIP or TRransformation Induced Plasticity is a phenomenon where the timely strain induced transformation of Retained Austenite (RA) to Martensite locally strengthens the steel at the point of plastic instability, causing failure by necking to be postponed and shifted elsewhere along the steel. This phenomenon repeated over and over again allows increased levels of strength and ductility, prior to fracture. In current TRIP grades, the retained austenite particles present have to posses certain characteristics such as, optimum carbon concentration, optimum grain size and morphology etc. in order to account toward mechanical properties. Such limiting characteristics in turn minimize the processing window and make TRIP processing expensive and difficult to control. In this work, it is suggested that Tempered Martensite Assisted Steels (TMAS) obtained from TRIP steels via subcritical annealing of cold rolled TRIP steels may potentially replace TRIP steels. Relationship between the retained austenite volume fractions and mechanical properties was developed for TRIP steels. The effect of variation of retained austenite on tempered martensite volume fraction in TMAS, which in turn affect the mechanical properties was also investigated in depth. Results indicate that tempered martensite particles in TMAS do not have any limiting factors as in the case of RA in TRIP steels, in order to contribute toward enhancement of mechanical properties. Results also indicate that TMAS offers better strength levels compared to TRIP steels for same the level of formability. Retained austenite volume fractions in TRIP steels were measured through XRD. Cold rolling of the samples was done in a laboratory scale rolling machine. The microstructures were analysed using conventional and color etching techniques. A new color etching technique for viewing all the four major phases in TRIP steel was developed in this work. The mechanical properties of both TRIP and TMAS were assessed by shear punch testing. And finally, the relationship between tempered martensite volume fraction and TMAS properties was developed and was compared to TRIP properties.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f369j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb02n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tempering</dc:subject><dc:subject>Martensitic transformations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel -- Metallography</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel -- Mechanical properties</dc:subject><dc:subject>Austenitic steel -- Mechanical properties</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apk02cb03x"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Combined gravity and lateral loading of light gauge steel framewood panel shear walls</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hikita, Katherine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Methods for the design of steel frame/wood panel shear walls used as a seismic force resisting system have been developed. These methods, which can be used in conjunction with the 2005 NBCC, were based on the results of shear wall tests carried out using lateral loads alone. The research program was extended to determine the influence of gravity loads on the lateral performance of the shear wall. An initial series of stud column tests was completed to determine an appropriate predication method for the axial capacity of the principal vertical load carrying members. Recommendations for appropriate effective length factors and buckling lengths were derived from the results of 40 tests. A subsequent series of five single-storey shear wall configurations were designed using capacity based methods. These shear walls were tested under monotonic and cyclic lateral loading, where two of three shear walls were also subjected to a constant gravity load. In total, 32 steel frame/wood panel shear walls composed of 1.09--1.37 mm thick steel studs sheathed with DFP, CSP or OSB panels were tested and analyzed. The equivalent energy elastic-plastic analysis approach was used to determine design values for stiffness, strength, ductility and overstrength. The data from this most recent series of tests indicates that the additional gravity loads do not have a detrimental influence on the lateral behaviour of a steel frame/wood panel shear wall if the chord studs are designed to carry the combined lateral and gravity forces following a capacity based approach. A resistance factor of 0.7 was found to be in agreement with previous tests that did not include gravity loads. The calculated seismic force modification factors also agreed with the previous test results, which suggest that Rd = 2.5 and Ro = 1.7.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25x887m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb03x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Shear walls -- Testing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930bx43m"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Non-destructive corrosion monitoring of steel reinforcement in concrete</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jean-Louis, Marjorie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The inadequate and inaccurate application of corrosion monitoring techniques for testing reinforced concrete structures had led to considerable early deterioration of these facilities and has resulted in high restoration and replacement costs. The prospect and diligent use of readily available early damage detection tools for use in regular maintenance of these structures could permit timely interventions for restoration and upkeep. This research program was aimed at determining the effectiveness of selected nondestructive testing methods as reliable indicators of early onset corrosion in steel-reinforced concrete. The methodology analyzed the onset of corrosion in a set of steel reinforcing rebars at a specific depth from the concrete surface, and used the resulting data as a predictor of corrosion activity in other reinforcing bars at different depths. Two series of tests were conducted: the first series included nine individually reinforced concrete samples with varying cover thicknesses; the second series consisted of nine reinforcing steel bars, distributed equally in concrete specimens at different depths from the concrete cover. All specimens were subjected to accelerated corrosion using methods developed at McGill University to reproduce corrosion of steel rebars in a naturally aggressive environment as closely as possible. The research results concur with the findings of other research programs, affirming that these monitoring tools are adequate predictors of corrosion. Nonetheless, they lack precision and are unable to track the time to corrosion initiation in structural concrete elements.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935319x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bx43m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asq87bt81x"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Karl May's Winnetou : the image of the German Indian, the representation of North American First Nations from an Orientalist perspective</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Perry, Nicole</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Karl May is considered Germany's most published author of popular literature. His influence on generations of German youth cannot be overlooked. Winnetou is one of his major works and depicts the adventures of Old Shatterhand, the German immigrant, and his Blood Brother, the Apache Winnetou. Generations of children grew up reading their adventures and escaping in their imaginations to battle unsavoury Yankees as well as hostile tribes. May's descriptions of the First Nations of North America have aided in skewing the perception of the North American First Nations in Germany. This thesis aims to work with some of these misperceptions and explain how they came to be. Through the use of Edward Said's theory, Orientalism, which will be applied to Winnetou I-III, this thesis attempts to interpret the role of the European and the non-European, or the Other, within the context of the story. The power structure between the European and the non-European will be one of the main focuses. May's use of the Bible as the perceived 'right' way of dealing with situations and people in comparison to the Apache or Yankee way is an obvious exertion of European thought and control over the non-European way of life. Winnetou is situated in a unique role in the power struggle between the European and the non-European. He is often seen as having mentalities and beliefs that come across as more European than non-European, and therefore places him in a unique situation, that of a Noble Savage, not a 'red devil'. It is exactly this perception of North American First Nations, that has survived many generations and still lends credit to Winnetou being called an 'apple Indian', red on the outside, white on the inside.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rh241.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bt81x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>May, Karl Friedrich, 1842-1912 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indians in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8336h222n"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Southern Sudan : the challenges of peace</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Philippe, Catherine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the tensions that have continued to plague Southern Sudan since the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). It investigates factors that, if left unchecked, may lead to renewed conflict. Ethnic tensions have been exacerbated by two decades of war and divide-and-rule tactics, creating a fragile post-conflict environment in which ethnic-based militias continue to operate. Weakened by claims of ethnic discrimination, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement struggles to establish its legitimacy as the southern ruling party and demonstrate its ability to provide equitable power and wealth sharing. Vast oil resources have raised the stakes of conflict for all parties, including the northern ruling National Congress Party (NCP) which risks losing its share of oil revenues if the South secedes---a possible outcome of the CPA. This thesis argues that, to ensure its own survival, the NCP fuels southern divisions to undermine the implementation of the CPA.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nk80s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h222n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sudan -- Politics and government -- 1985-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Southern Region (Sudan) -- Politics and government</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580m916"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Jewish Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Ha'amek Davar of Naftali Zevi Yehuda Berlin</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Oser, Asher Charles</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Rabbi Naftali Zevi Yehuda Berlin's commentary to the Pentateuch, Ha'amek Davar, was first published in Vilna in 1879-1880. The work grew out of a daily class that Berlin taught at the famed yeshiva Etz Hayyim of Volozhin, where he was dean from 1853-1893. This study of Ha'amek Davar focuses on Berlin's exegesis of Noah's three sons. Because Berlin often conceals his sources and their previous discussions, one of the great challenges of working with Ha'amek Davar is trying to recognize which interpretations were original to Berlin and which were adapted from elsewhere. Because my discussion was limited to a few passages, it was possible to outline how different aspects of Berlin's exegesis interacted. The historical context of Nineteenth Century Czarist Russia had a strong impact on Ha'amek Davar, and some of Berlin's comments are viewed in light of what was being written in the Russian Jewish press of the time.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sq38n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580m916</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Berlin, Naphtali Ẓevi Judah, 1817-1893</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214p31z"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The case of immoral art : &amp;quot;uncensoring&amp;quot; BLIND DATE</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Perlini, Tania</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Looking at John Duncan's 1980 art performance, BLIND DATE, and its morally controversial content, I propose to investigate the nature of art's relationship to morality.

Historical analysis, close reading of the text, interpretation and commentary revealed that, contrary to what had until recently been believed, Les Faictz was more than a mere translation of Passional Christi und Antichristi, an anti-papal Lutheran satire, issued in 1521, in Germany. The analysis of the classical sources employed by the anonymous writer(s) also exposed the virulent attack directed by the radical French reformers against the medieval institution of the papacy. Moreover, its new textual long addition offered enough evidence to place Les Faictz among the sacramentarian works published by Vingle between 1533-1535. Thus, likewise Marcourt's famous eucharistic writings, it refutes the sacrificial character of the mass, the doctrine of the real presence, and transubstantiation, aiming at no less than the abolition of the mass and the reestablishment of the Lord's Supper in its original purity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494872c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290958d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reformation -- France</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
