The present thesis was not an exhaustive integration of theories on Civic Virtue. Rather, it highlighted virtues (i.e., authenticity, moral wisdom, trust, reciprocity and tolerance) selected for their value in educating members of social capital groups toward a broader understanding of the self and others in a deliberative, pluralist democracy. This thesis relied primarily on theories from the disciplines of political philosophy and philosophy of education. Three major conclusions emerged from the present investigation. First, schools are not the only venue in which education for civic virtue occurs. Indeed, social capital groups provide a vital context for civic learning. Second, the existence of diversity within social capital groups enhances the educational potential of participating in civic life. And third, social capital groups can potentially have a socially progressive impact in a liberal, deliberative democracy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McDonough, Kevin</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569624h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rw29k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Community organization</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social participation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Civics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r4943"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Jewish Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The status of the Jewish law in the messianic era from the Biblical period to the seventeenth century</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pardo, Deborah Elaine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis covers the status of the Jewish law in the messianic era as it was anticipated in Jewish texts from the biblical period until the seventeenth century. Although the predominant perspective is the law's perpetuity, a future idealized version was particularized in each age and stylized by various groups. The view of the law's continuity was challenged by streams of thought and ambiguities in the texts that allowed for changes and cessations in the law in messianic times. Concrete messianic movements, such as that of the New Testament in the first century and the Sabbatean movement of the seventeenth century, brought some of these underlying currents to the forefront with their reinterpretations of the law and their antinomian behaviour.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levy, B.

An English-language publication, Weekend Magazine largely overcame the difficulties which beset the Canadian magazine industry in the 1950s and 1960s by circulating as an insert in the Saturday edition of local newspapers across the country. As a national magazine aimed at a general audience of Canadians, Weekend was involved in the difficult pursuit of inventing a kind of national entertainment for its readers, while representing the diversity of local identity without betraying the integrity of the national context. This thesis is the study of a certain representation of the 1960s in Canada---an interpretation of the way in which the most widely-circulated magazine reflected and represented the nation in a period of significant transition. In the first half of the Sixties, Weekend was about the articulation of the various local identities within Canada, but always with regard to a power structure that maintained certain racial, sexual and regional divisions. Yet, in the second half of the decade, we can witness a transformation of this power structure, and with it, a disintegration of the sense of unity that had been implied before. As Weekend begins to move from an either/or understanding of otherness in Canada towards a more complicated recognition of local identities, its vision of a united Canada begins to break down. This thesis considers various representative articles from the period 1963 to 1973 in an effort to establish the shift in the representation of otherness in Weekend's Canada. The key theme is explored through representations of Gender, Youth Culture, Foreignness and Nationalism in the magazine. A summary and review of historiographical and theoretical literature constitutes the first chapter of the work.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morton, Suzanne</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j38608690.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708z633</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada -- In mass media</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b591b187"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>L'education "ideale" dans un monde "ideal" : le Dunham Ladies' CollegeSt. Helen's School et l'elite anglicane du diocese de Montreal (1870-1930)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Harbec, Marie-Eve</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The idea of establishing a denominational college for young women in the Anglican Deanery of Bedford was first submitted to the Montreal's Synod in 1873. Following a contest which was held between local municipalities, the overwhelmingly Anglo-Protestant rural village of Dunham won the honors and six years later, the Dunham Ladies' College (the college would become St. Helen's School in 1913) opened its doors. This thesis examines the reactions and readjustments of the Anglican Church, and those of their followers, attributable to its disestablishment (in the 1840's and 1850's) and to the rise of liberalism and to the transformation of traditional social order that went on in the same age. The example that we have selected---the DLC/ SHS---will allow us to scrutinize de 1870 to 1930 period. It will demonstrate the importance of religion in the construction of women's social identities: education being a means borrowed by the local and diocesan Anglican elite (both lay and ecclesiastical ones) to promote the new spiritual mandate of the Church and a conservative vision of social organization. The elite's men wished for the DLC/SHS to be an oasis of peace and of purity, the ideal place for young ladies to become gentlewomen. Throughout our study of the methods employed for their education, we will demonstrate how this elite planned the education of these young ladies in a way that would insure their becoming conveyances of the values necessary for the implementation of a spiritual Anglican society.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Young, Brian J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515q19g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591b187</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Montréal (Québec) -- Social conditions -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Montréal (Québec) -- Social conditions -- 19th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Church colleges -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women's colleges -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579v04g"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nationalism, archaeology and ideology in Iraq from 1921 to the present</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Haider, Hind A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the use of archaeology in the development of national identity in Iraq from the period before the establishment of the Hashimite monarchy in 1921 to the present Ba'th regime and S&amp;dotbelow;addam H&amp;dotbelow;usayn. During King Faysal I's period (1921--1933), archaeology was used to highlight the 'Arabness' of the ancient Mesopotamians so as to keep the nation on a pan-Arabist course and steer away from developing a regional identity. Iraq's pre-Islamic heritage was approached with much reserve since the government feared alienating the majority Muslim population by glorifying the country's achievements before the advent of Islam. In contrast, 'Abd al-Karim Qasim's regime (1958--1963) focused unbridled attention to the Mesopotamian heritage in an effort to distance the newly established republic from the pan-Arabists' call to join with the United Arab Republic. Between the two poles of identifying the national identity with either the Arab or Mesopotamian character, the Ba'th regime embarked on a cultural campaign that used both identities in defining the modern Iraqi man and woman. While the campaign was relegated strictly to the cultural sphere of the nation, the intent was political in that the regime shifted to stressing the Muslim-Arab identity of Iraq when appealing to support from other Arab nations; and to the pre-Islamic Mesopotamian identity when dealing with the religious and ethnic cleavages in Iraqi society.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turgay, Uner A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n509r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579v04g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Iraq -- Civilization</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Iraq</dc:subject><dc:subject>National characteristics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Iraq -- Antiquities</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hr49z"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cultivating Aristotelian rationality through the arts : a philosophical and practical perspective</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Honig, Valerie Amelina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a description of a five-month project involving the educational unit of a large urban museum and its interaction with a group of elementary-aged students from a disadvantaged community. The description is framed within a philosophic premise that puts emphasis on aesthetic experience. Within this framework, I argue that aesthetic experience can be a valuable component in the development of a range of human faculties---intellectual, affective and imaginative. Moreover, borrowing from Aristotle's conception of rationality, I maintain that only when an individual cultivates and employs all his or her faculties can he or she be considered a rational individual. With this perspective in mind, in the final section, I argue that non-traditional educational projects emphasizing aesthetic experiences, such as the one examined in this study, can enhance an educational system that makes knowledge acquisition its priority.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>White, Boyd</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb3979976.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr49z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Art -- Study and teaching (Elementary)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alternative education</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20sv56v"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Active retrieval processes and the mid-ventrolateral prefontal cortex : an event-related fMRI study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Penelope, Kostopoulos</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In recent years, although a number of functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated a relationship between activity in the prefrontal cortex and memory retrieval, it has been difficult to relate specific aspects of retrieval processing to specific regions of the prefrontal cortex. The present event-related fMRI study focuses on the role of the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in active retrieval processes, leading to the dissociation of different aspects of mnemonic information. Thirteen normal volunteers were scanned with a 1.5-T Siemens Vision Scanner. Functional images sensitive to the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal were acquired in an event-related fashion. In the experimental condition one of four different faces was briefly presented at one of four different locations on the screen. This encoding phase was followed by a question phase during which a cue in the center of the screen instructed the subjects to either retrieve the particular face of the initially presented stimulus or its location. After a delay, a test stimulus was presented and the subjects had to decide whether it corresponded to the aspect of the encoded stimulus instructed by the cue (i.e. the particular face or location). In the recognition control condition for the same sequence of events the subjects had simply to recall the encoded stimulus in order to recognize it in the test phase. The subtraction method was used to compare the signal between these two conditions. Correlation maps computed for the group revealed, relative to the recognition condition, selective increases in activity in the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex when subjects were involved in active retrieval processes both for visual spatial (i.e. location) and visual non-spatial (i.e. face) material. These results support the hypothesis that the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortical region is selectively involved in active mnemonic retrieval.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Petrides, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580p30w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sv56v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Psychobiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Cognitive</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j292w"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Air circulation inside refrigerated semi-trailers transporting fresh produce</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hui, Ka Po Catherine, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In North America, refrigerated semi-trailers are commonly used to transport large volume of produce. They are equipped with refrigeration and air circulation systems to provide an optimum transit enviromnent for the produce. Air circulation plays a vital role in maintaining produce temperature during transport. Its performance is greatly affected by the availability of air channels through and around the load. This study is an attempt to evaluate the performance of the air circulation system. Air temperature data was gathered from 20 mixed loads of produce transported in trailers having a variety of accessories and using different loading patterns. Pearson correlation coefficient was used as an indicator to describe the air distribution inside the semi-trailers. The results showed that the air distribution inside semi-trailers is generally not uniform. In most cases, the areas that received little amount of airflow were the middle section along the length and width, and the middle and bottom sections along the height of trailers. The variability in the results precluded any determination of the effect of trailer accessories and loading patterns on the air distribution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vigneault, Clement</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Raghavan, Vijaya</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gj18z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j292w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Refrigerated trailers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Farm produce -- Transportation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6d56zz36c"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The construction of Palestinian identity : Hamas and Islamic fundamentalism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hamade, Joyce</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>My thesis focuses on modern Palestine and the role of nationalism and fundamentalism in the construction of Palestinian national identity. Ḥamas provides a case study of Islamic fundamentalism in Palestine. The movement developed during the late 1980's as a reaction to the failures of the secular project. Ḥamas is a reflection of a region-wide phenomenon. It is not solely a reaction to modernity. Rather, Ḥamas is the result of specific condition that led to the politicization of Islam after the Intifaḍa . Today the nationalist PLO and Ḥamas struggle to define Palestinian identity and to shape the emerging Palestinian state. Palestinian national identity like that of other modern nations has been constructed. Nation-building or identity construction in Palestine can be divided into four historical stages. Each stage is characterized by overlapping and competing identities: Ottoman, Arab, religious, local and kinship. These identities are not mutually exclusive and often a combination of identities became prominent historically depending on the internal and external forces pressuring society.

Many disputes caused by such extraterritorial application have been settled in dispute settlement procedures of the GATT and World Trade Organization (WTO). However, some argue that the WTO is not an appropriate forum to settle extraterritorial disputes since competence of the WTO is limited to "trade" issues and the legitimacy of extraterritorial measures should be assessed by applying all relevant international norms. This paper argues, by analyzing the nature of extraterritorial disputes and by comparing past approaches taken to extraterritorial disputes with the WTO procedures, that the WTO can provide effective solutions to extraterritorial disputes procedurally and substantially. This paper also argues that WTO can contribute to the development of the international legal system in the course of its resolution of extraterritorial disputes by examining state practices after the GATT/WTO dispute settlement.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>de Mestral, A.

The thorough analysis will show that the two jurisdictions and, presumably, the common and civil law traditions, diverge in the field of marine insurance in the legal concepts as such, but not so much in the substance of the contract. The duty of utmost good faith permits the insurer to be fully and properly informed about all circumstances material to the assessment of the risk and to making of the contract and its terms. Despite relative coherency of the regulation of the issues of materiality and causality between the breach of the duty of utmost good faith and the loss occurred, the sanctions for the breach vary significantly between the civil and common law jurisdictions. It will be examined how the warranty, a typical common law concept, has been replaced in civil law jurisdictions. Various methods of harmonization will be examined and discussed in the light of possible application in the field of marine insurance. In the conclusion, it will be argued that reconciling fundamental legal concepts inherent to various legal traditions is a demanding task and may not be as advantageous for the respective field of law as it is expected to.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tetley, Q.

This amendment took place through the tacit acceptance procedure implemented by IMO, thus it has a mandatory character for SOLAS Contracting States. The Code was established to have effect in two stages, the first stage took place on July 1 1998, and the second stage will take place on July 1 2002. The ISM Code establishes requirements, which, although not completely new to the maritime industry, will have great incidence in the way maritime activities are carried out to date. Shipping Companies will suffer alterations on their management structure and certain principles in maritime law will probably be changed with the introduction of the Code, however, the precise effects of the ISM Code cannot be outlined before its full implementation takes place in 2002.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tetley, William</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526f101.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dx20f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rj96g"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Whether APAs are a long term solution to transfer pricing disputes?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shourie, Arunachal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Transfer pricing is an area of major concern for tax administrations. The growth of multinational enterprises and an increase in cross border transactions has highlighted the significance of a regulated transfer pricing system. However, this regulated system imposes high penalties for improper transfer pricing. To reduce the risk of high transfer pricing penalties, multinational enterprises have resorted to advance pricing agreements with tax administrations. These agreements, though, are not a simple solution to reduce the risk of penalties. The process of executing these agreements carries with it the major drawback of information disclosure. Given this drawback, the APA programs in the United States and Canada, as they stand today, are not long term solutions to transfer pricing disputes which arise out of improper transfer pricing or improper adoption of transfer price determination methods.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stevens, David P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333420r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rj96g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw37638811"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Montreal convention of 1999 : problems and prospects</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Amana, Idorenyin Edet</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>After international transportation by air became a reality, the need to fashion out an appropriate global regime to govern the new relationships created by this development led to the signing of the Warsaw Convention in 1929. As time went on, the need to adjust this original Convention to contemporary technological and legal realities necessitated the enactment of several other instruments that were not new Conventions in themselves, but were merely welded to the original 1929 Convention. With the absence of consolidation, the undesirable result was total confusion created by the concurrent operation of the multiple regimes of the Warsaw System. The overwhelming need to modernise and consolidate all instruments of the Warsaw system into a single uniform text culminated in the signing of the Montreal Convention on 28 May 1999. This thesis attempts to x-ray the Montreal Convention in the light of its potentials to alleviate the numerous problems of the Warsaw system, including the prospects of its ratification. In the same vein, the inherent deficiencies and imperfections of this new instrument, which might militate against its ratification, have been overtly highlighted for reference. This treatise also analysed the need for developing and African nations to ratify the new convention notwithstanding that their interests were given minimal considerations. The conclusion is a call to all nations, particularly the US, to ratify this new convention without further procrastination, in order to enable it come into force without further delay, lest it become just another relic in the kitty of the very Warsaw System that it sought to replace.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nz99n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w37638811</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Liability for aircraft accidents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p8903"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Wittgenstein and the panel's and appellate body's activism in United States - Antidumping Act of 1916 : bases for rethinking the conventional wisdom of competition issues under the WTO</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Alvarez, Alberto</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is aimed at challenging the conventional wisdom regarding trade and competition under the World Trade Organization, namely, that the WTO does not deal with competition matters. This thesis shows that this wisdom cannot be upheld when viewed in conjunction with Karl Wittgenstein's theories of language and with the panel and Appellate Body's decisions in United States-Anti-Dumping Act of 1916. These decisions confirm the application of such theories to the WTO and indicate, first, that the WTO limits concerning trade and competition are not as clearly defined as followers of the conventional wisdom suggest, and, second, that the Appellate Body and future panels may be willing to incorporate other competition issues within the realm of the WTO, if they are properly presented before it by Member States.

The position stems from the decision of the International Court of Justice that held the United Nations has duties corresponding to its rights. By the analogously application of the rules of state responsibility, the United Nations is responsible for breach of rules of self-determination in the de-colonization process of Eritrea. The responsibility of the organization emanates from an imposition of a lopsided resolution. The resolution gave more weight to political and strategic interests while setting aside 'genuine and free will' of the people of Eritrea. The United Nations is also responsible for omission of its duty when Ethiopia abrogated the federal scheme in violations of international law. The thesis concludes by saying the world organization has legal and moral duties to make reparation to the people of Eritrea.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Provost, Rene</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j9764.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n046f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az316q333w"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The position of the business judgment rule in different corporate cultures and structures : a study and analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ashraf, Zeeshan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The American courts developed business law by devising principles for resolving the rift between shareholders and the management. An important principle in this respect is the Business Judgment Rule (BJR). The BJR has attained an important position in the American corporate law. However, it has failed to find such position in the laws of other jurisdictions. In the current era, when different economies are integrating into a global market, corporations are forming global alliances. This thesis will study the role of the BJR in global alliances by examining the case of the Star Alliance as an example. It will focus in particular on the position of the BJR in the interplay of different corporate structures and cultures. The thesis will review corporate cultures of Germany and Japan. It will conclude that the BJR's importance is growing and finding place in jurisdictions other than America.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Janda, Richard</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881n839.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q333w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21th25g"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Predicting the variations in water quality along an irrigation canal in Punjab, Pakistan</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Amin, Muhammad Anjum</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) irrigates 16 million ha of land in Pakistan. The irrigation water is also used for domestic consumption in rural areas and where the ground water is brackish. Many major cities and towns dispose their untreated wastewater directly into the irrigation canal network, which ultimately has adverse impacts on the downstream water quality. In order to better understand the water quality variations, several parameters were measured along a 45 km long irrigation canal (Hakra-6R) in Punjab, Pakistan during the year 2000. The parameters measured were: biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate (NO3), ammonia (NH3), Escherichia coli (E.coli), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and water temperature. The PC-QUASAR model was used as predictive tool to simulate the water quality concentrations along the downstream locations of Hakra-6R canal. The measured data were used to validate the PC-QUASAR model. The model efficiencies ranged from 0.40 to 0.96 for selected parameters. A sensitivity analysis showed that the nitrification, denitrification, BOD sedimentation, and BOD algae rate were the most sensitive parameters of model performance. The BOD decay and sediment oxygen rates have negligible influence on model output. Water quality analysis showed that irrigation water was highly contaminated regarding microbiological aspects (E.coli ~ 4000 N/100ml).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Madramootoo, C.

To study marrow stromal cells (MSCs) induced angiogenesis. To examine the possible mechanisms involved in the process. To evaluate neovascularization following implantation of MSCs in ischemic hind limb model. Methods and result. Using murine Matrigel angiogenesis model, we compared MSCs related angiogenesis to that produced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor. We found that MSCs result in an efficient and organized angiogenesis, arteriogenesis and vasculogenesis. MSC-related angiogenesis is VEGF dependent. MSCs in vivo produce VEGF that through paracrine effect induces local angiogenesis and through an autocrine loop stimulates FLK1+MSCs to differentiate into endothelial cells. MSCs implanted into ischemic hind limb resulted in marked improvement in blood flow and collateral vessels formation. Conclusion. MSCs spontaneously induce efficient and mature angiogenesis in ischemic/hypoxic tissues with significant arteriolar component resulting in increased blood flow. They are also capable of spontaneous differentiation into endothelium. VEGF appears to be necessary for MSC-related angiogenesis and vasculogenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chiu, Ray C-J</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Lachapelle, Kevin</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n9732.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sv574</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asq87bw34z"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Transforming growth factor-1 : a study of its effects on CNS innervation and cerebrovascular function</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Aucoin, Jean-Sebastien</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) implicates several pathogenic processes, but their relative importance remains a highly debated issue. The purposes of the present studies were (1) to evaluate the implication of the over expression, in transgenic mice, of a mutated form of the amyloid precursor protein (V717FhAPP), or of the cytokine Transforming Growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), on cerebral and hippocampal innervation, and (2) to determine if TGF-beta1 can affect vasomotor responses of cerebral blood vessels. While the mice over-expressing TGF-beta1 did not show cholinergic denervation, the mice over-expressing V717FhAPP showed selective cholinergic deficits in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. On the other hand, acutely increased levels of TGF-beta1 differentially affected the efficacy and/or potency of the vessel responses to serotonin (5-HT), endothelin (ET) and acetylcholine (ACh). These results suggest that the overproduction of V717FhAPP is a sufficient factor for cholinergic denervation and that TGF-beta1 can alter some aspects of cerebrovascular function.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hamel, Edith</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k688g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bw34z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462725w"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Protein-phenolic interactions in food</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ali, Haroon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Our objective was to investigate the mode of interaction between selected food proteins and phenolic compounds. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine beta-lactoglobulin, and soybean glycinin were used with the following phenolic compounds; 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid (gallic acid), 3,4-dihydroxy cinnamic acid (caffeic acid), p -hydroxycinnamic acid (courmaric acid), and 5,7-dihydroxy 4-methoxy isoflavone (biochanin A). The interaction was investigated using incubation temperatures of 35°, 45° and 55°C at pH 5, 7 and 9. Native and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to identify protein-phenol interactions. Certain phenolic compounds combined with BSA and prevented protein aggregation. In general, the thermal stability of the proteins increased as a result of interaction with phenolic compounds; the most pronounced effect was observed with beta-lactoglobulin in the presence of gallic acid at pH 7. The interaction of the phenols with the proteins resulted in changes in protein secondary structure.

One of its limitations lays in the respiratory motion of the                target during treatment. For this technique, high precision and accuracy on the dose                delivered to the target is critical. This work produced a measurement method for the                target's position and motion, during treatment, without giving extra dose to the                patient. This method is based on a statistical analysis of the position of implanted                metallic markers, visible on treatment portal images. The method was implanted in a                software written entirely in Real Basic (Real Software, Texas, USA) code. The                software was tested with images of a respiratory phantom of known motion. The motion                statistics detected by the software corresponded to the measured values.

Une des limites de cette                thérapie réside dans la difficulté d'irradier la cible précisément et exactement à la                dose prescrite, puisqu'elle est constamment induite en mouvement par la respiration                du patient durant le traitement. Ce travail a permis de concevoir une méthode de                mesure de la position et du mouvement de la cible, durant le traitement, sans donner                de dose additionnelle au patient. Cette méthode est basée sur une analyse statistique                de la position de marqueurs métalliques implantés chirurgicalement près de la cible                et visibles sur des images portales prises durant le traitement.

Plus                d'informations sur les mécanismes et les gènes impliqués dans l'alvéolarisation sont                nécessaires afin de mieux comprendre la physiopathologie de cette maladie et aider au                développement de nouvelles interventions thérapeutiques. Lgl1 est une glycoprotéine                sécrétée dans le poumon qui est induite par les glucocorticoïdes et finement régulée                lors du développement [3]. Dans les modèles animaux de toxicité d'O2 qui mimique la                DBP, les niveaux de Lgl1 sont réduits puis redeviennent normaux lors de la                récupération dans l'air [4].

Un déficit de Lgl1 a                révélé un phénotype complexe, incluant notamment : l'hyperplasie des cellules                caliciformes, la production de mucus, l'augmentation de l'expression des                interleukines 4 et 13, la perturbation du développement pulmonaire, la fragmentation                de l'élastine et la perturbation de la fonction mécanique du poumon suggérant que la                carence de Lgl1 pourrait contribuer à la DBP dans la période néonatale.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract> Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease characterized by an arrest                in alveolar development, remains one of the leading causes of morbidity in very low                birth weight newborns [1, 2]. Insight into the mechanisms and genes involved in                alveolarization could be used to better understand the lung pathophysiology of this                disease and help with the development of new treatment interventions.

The molecular mechanisms that                control their distribution to signaling platforms of the plasma membrane remain                poorly understood. In the present study, we define four cell spreading stages for                adherent astrocytes, termed stage 1 to 4, and defined by the state of spreading of                the cell in culture. Immunocytochemistry analysis reveals that DG and integrins                distribute differentially depending on the stage, and both receptors get recruited to                leading edge of the cell, possibly to GM1-rich lipid rafts, in scratch-induced                migration. Treatment of reactive astrocytes with cytochalasin-D or colchicine                confirms that the formation of MT-rich protrusions is not actin-independent. However,                cortical actin localization is independent of the polarized MT network.
