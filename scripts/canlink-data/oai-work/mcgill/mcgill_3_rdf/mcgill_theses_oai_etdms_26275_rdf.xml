The marketplace currently offers post-theft solutions but most depend on software in place on the stolen item. This is a critical vulnerability as it places the theft recovery technology in the hands of the thief. This thesis is an investigation into the feasibility of abandoning this limitation by moving the theft recovery technology into the server, beyond the hands of the thief. The contents are divided into two complimentary sections. The first is the creation of a theft detecting DHCP server with acceptable performance levels for production environments. The second involves investigation into the ramifications of widespread adoption of such a server by exploring the countermeasures open to an adversary. Questions of difficulty and reliability of such techniques are explored, in both hardware and software. Also discussed is the possibly of countering such countermeasures.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579s47v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182k43h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472w748"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Measurement of the inclusive cross section of p°, f₀(980) and f₂(1270) mesons in deep inelastic scattering at HERA</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Robichaud-Véronneau, Andrée</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The production of neutral meson resonances in deep inelastic scattering has been studied in DESY with the ZEUS detector at the HERA collider.

In these systems, a spin reorientation process, which is a pure rotation of the magnetic structure relative to the crystal axes, can be used to determine the anisotropic contributions to the transferred hyperfine fields at the Sn sites. The anisotropic contribution has been shown to be substantial in the MnSn2 and FeSn2 compounds, and is an important fraction of the overall transferred hyperfine field. A spin reorientation transition can be either temperature-induced, or field-induced (spin-flop). The temperature-induced spin reorientation generally results from a competition between the magnetocrystalline anisotropies of the rare earth and Mn sublattices. The substitution of Sn with Ga strongly affects the anisotropy, shown here to decrease the spin reorientation temperature with increasing x by 255 +/- 18 K/Ga in TbMn6Sn 6-xGax. However, the sublattice anisotropies seem unaffected by In substitution, and the spin reorientation temperature is nearly constant throughout a large range of In concentration. A field-induced spin-flop can be achieved by applying a large enough field perpendicular to the direction of the moments. In this study, we show how both the temperature-induced SR and field-induced SF allow for the anisotropic field to be isolated from the isotropic contribution. The consistency between the two measurements of the anisotropic field indicates that the magnitude of the anisotropic contribution is independent of the driving force of the reorientation. We show that a complete 90° spin reorientation occurs in the ErMn6Sn5.89Ga0.11 and TbMn 6Sn6-xGax compounds (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.8), as well as in TbMn 6Sn5.46In0.54 at room temperature for an applied field of 0.57(3) T. The site preference for Ga substitution is investigated and compared with former results. Finally, the anisotropic contribution at one of the Sn sites is shown to exceed 40% in all of the compounds investigated, and this site assignment is confirmed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc14f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j67314160</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zh16k"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes of three peatlands in the La Grande Rivière watershed, James Bay lowland, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pelletier, Luc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes were measured between May 2003 and August 2004 on vegetated surfaces and pools of three peatlands located in the La Grande Riviere watershed, James Bay lowland, Quebec, Canada. Gas flux measurements were made using static chambers on a variety of sites in the three peatlands, chosen to represent the different biotypes present, from hummocks with water table position 35 cm below the surface to pools 100 cm deep. Average CH4 fluxes for the different biotypes on vegetated surfaces sampled during summer 2003 ranged from 3.5 to 197 mg m-2 d-1 while summer 2004 average floating chamber pool fluxes ranged between 6.2 and 3165 mg CH4 m-2 d -1. Mean daily CH4 fluxes on vegetated surface are strongly correlated (r2 &gt; 0.75) with summer average water table depth, greater fluxes occurring where water table is close to the surface. The vegetated surface CH4 fluxes were also correlated with peat temperature as fluxes increase with increasing peat temperature during the summer. Most net ecosystem productivity values calculated for the different biotypes in the three peatlands showed release of CO2 during both early and mid growing season periods. An annual budget calculated for the LG2 peatland showed that the peatland emitted CO2 to the atmosphere at a rate of 0.77 g m-2 d-1. The overall release of CO 2 may have been caused in part by dry conditions in the peatlands during summer 2003, due to high temperature and low precipitation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p063c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zh16k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Atmospheric carbon dioxide -- Québec (Province) -- Grande River Region (Nord-du-Québec)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atmospheric methane -- Québec (Province) -- Grande River Region (Nord-du-Québec)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peatlands -- Québec (Province) -- Grande River Region (Nord-du-Québec)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c0798"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Vitamin A supplementation reduces reinfection with Ascaris in indigenous Panamanian preschool children</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Payne, Leslie G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Vitamin A deficiency and intestinal parasitism coexist in developing countries. This study evaluated whether a national program of vitamin A supplementation (200,000IU retinyl palmitate every 6 months), if combined with deworming (400mg albendazole), slows reinfection with Ascaris . A baseline survey of 595 indigenous preschool children in the Bocas del Toro region of Panama showed high rates of stunting (61%) and nematode infection (Ascaris 79.5%, Trichuris 19%). All children were dewormed and 328 were included in the 5 month follow-up study. Of these, 106 children received vitamin A supplementation through the Ministry of Health (Vit A S+) and 222 children received no supplementation (Vit A S-). At 3 months post deworming, both the prevalence (P= 0.0004) and intensity (P= 0.0124) of Ascaris infection were higher in Vit A S- children than in Vit A S+ children, indicating that reinfection occurred more slowly in supplemented children. When the two supplement groups were further sub-divided by stature, Vit A S+ resulted in lower reinfection rates (P=0.0002) only in normal height children, and not in stunted children. Despite the tendency of public health policy to target malnourished children our study provides evidence of increased benefit of vitamin A supplementation in normal height children living in areas with chronic parasitosis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741s13m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c0798</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vitamin A deficiency in children -- Panama</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ascariasis in children -- Treatment -- Panama</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ascaris lumbricoides -- Panama</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722h918p"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Abnormal brain connectivity in schizophrenia : investigations into episodic memory networks</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pelletier, Marc, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Abnormal connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and other brain regions has been demonstrated in subjects with schizophrenia. We tested if abnormal connectivity, particularly between PFC and the medial temporal lobes (MTL), underlies the reduced brain activity and level of accuracy observed in schizophrenia subjects during episodic memory tests. We used fMRI to examine activation in fifteen chronic, medicated schizophrenia subjects and eighteen control subjects in two different recognition memory tests. The item recognition memory test required subjects to make old/new judgments, and the associative recognition memory test required them to make intact/rearranged judgments. We examined brain connectivity separately, with a structural equation modeling, based on anatomical links found in the literature. During associative recognition memory, subjects with schizophrenia failed to demonstrate the significant connectivity bilaterally between different areas of PFC and posterior MTL/fusiform regions that was observed in control subjects. However, during recognition memory of individual items, subjects with schizophrenia demonstrated significant connectivity between the anterior part of the MTL and medial PFC similar to control subjects. These findings provide evidence of a lack of proper integration between PFC and fusiform/MTL areas underlying episodic memory deficits of visual objects in schizophrenia, particularly during associative recognition memory.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375w474.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722h918p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Physiological</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50gw49c"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sulfur concentration at sulfide saturation in anhydrous silicate melts at crustal conditions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liu, Yanan, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The sulfur concentration in silicate melts at sulfide saturation (SCSS) was experimentally investigated in a temperature range from 1250ºC to 1450ºC and a pressure range from 500 MPa to 1 GPa in a piston-cylinder apparatus. The investigated melt compositions varied from rhyolitic to basaltic. All experiments were saturated with a FeS melt. Temperature was confirmed to have a positive effect on the SCSS and no measurable pressure effect was observed. Oxygen fugacity was controlled to be either near the carbon-carbon monoxide buffer or one log unit above the nickel-nickel oxide buffer, and found to positively affect the SCSS. A series of models were constructed to predict the SCSS as a function of temperature, pressure, melt composition, oxygen fugacity and sulfur fugacity of the system. The coefficients were obtained by the regression of experimental data from this study and from data in the literature. The best model found for the prediction of the SCSS is: lnSppm =-996T+9.875+0.997lnMFM+0.1901lnf O2-0.0722(PT )-0.115lnfS2 where P is in bar, T is in K, and MFM is a compositional parameter describing the melt based upon cation mole fractions: MFM=Na+K+2 Ca+Mg+Fe2+Six Al+Fe3+. This model predicts the SCSS in anhydrous silicate melts from rhyolitic to basaltic compositions at crustal conditions from 1 bar to 1.25 GPa, temperatures from ~1200 to 1400ºC, and oxygen fugacities between approximately two log units below the fayalite-quartz-magnetite buffer and one log unit above the nickel-nickel oxide buffer. For cases where the oxygen and sulfur fugacities cannot be adequately estimated a simpler model also works acceptably: lnSppm =-5328T+8.431+1.244 lnMFM-0.01704P T+lnaFeS where aFes is the activity of FeS in the sulfide melt and is well approximated by a value of 1. Additional experiments were performed on other basalts in a temperature range from 1250ºC to 1450ºC at 1 GPa to test the models. The model predictions and the measurements of the SCSS agree within 5%. Although I cannot fix exactly the stoichiometric coefficients of the reaction controlling sulfur dissolution, my experiments and models suggest that the solution reaction for sulfur in melts saturated with sulfide is similar to: 8FeSsulfide +3FeOsilicate+4O2-silicat e+2O2gas ↔4S2-silicate+2S 2gas+11FeOsulfide where the subscripts indicate the phase and O 2- represents "free" oxygens in the silicate melt. </dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956g12g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gw49c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bf22w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Predictors of smoking cessation in adults from two low socio-economic status communities in Montreal, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liu, Aihua, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objectives. Few studies have identified longitudinal predictors of smoking cessation in disadvantaged communities. This study identified predictors of cessation in a 5-year longitudinal cohort of adults aged 18-65 years and living in low-income, inner-city neighborhoods of Montreal, Canada. Methods. Secondary analysis of data from the non-randomized evaluation of Coeur en Sante St. Henri, a community-based intervention program designed to decrease cardiovascular disease risk (CVD) factors. Data on lifestyle behaviors were collected in telephone interviews of a representative sample of residents at baseline and five years later. Independent predictors of cessation were identified among 303 subjects who smoked at baseline, using multiple logistic regression. Results. After 5 years, 20% of baseline smokers reported quitting including 22% of female smokers, and 17% of male smokers. From among 7 potential predictors only two were retained in multivariable analysis, including having a post-secondary or higher education relative to secondary school or less (OR=1.88, 95%CI: 1.01-3.51), and number of cigarettes smoked per day (OR=0.95, 95%CI: 0.91-0.98). Conclusions. Few predictors of cessation emerged in this disadvantaged community. It is notable that even in a disadvantaged community, increased education predicts cessation. Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which education leads to higher quit rates may help the development of cessation programs targeting disadvantaged communities.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mp96f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bf22w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Epidemiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494876g"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Three-dimensional blade position and orientation during a stationary ice hockey slap shot</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lomond, Karen V.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the three-dimensional movement profile of the blade during a stationary slap shot, as a function of blade construction properties and player skill level. A total of fifteen subjects participated in this study; eight were classified as elite and the remaining seven were recreational. Performances were evaluated by simultaneously recording the movements of the stick's lower shaft and blade with high-speed video (1000 Hz), the time and duration of stick-ground contact with two uniaxial forceplates, and time of blade-puck contact with a uniaxial accelerometer mounted within the puck. Data were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA for several dependent variables, including: linear kinematics, temporal phase data, and global angles. The results indicated that elite shooters tended to alter timing parameters (i.e. phase length), magnitude of linear variables (i.e. displacement, etc.), and the overall blade orientation to achieve a higher velocity slap shot. These analyses helped to identify a unique rocker phase within the execution of the slap shot in both groups. Further studies are needed to discern the precise role and function of the rocker phase, in order to advance the cause of hockey stick, specifically blade design and development.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rw94m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494876g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hockey players</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hockey -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awd375w48d"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Bayesian estimation of diagnostic test parameters in the presence of verification bias</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lu, Ying, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The statistical evaluation of diagnostic tests may be affected by several potential biases. These biases include those caused by a study design that results in a non-representative sub-sample who are further verified by the reference test (verification bias), and those caused by the absence of a definitive diagnostic test (gold standard test) for many diseases and conditions. In practice, an imperfect reference test is often assumed to be a perfect gold standard, potentially resulting in a large bias. Both Bayesian and frequentist methods have been proposed to adjust for each of these biases independently. To our knowledge, there is no Bayesian solution for that adjusts for both of these biases simultaneously. The objective of this thesis is to present a Bayesian method for the evaluation of diagnostic tests when both of these potential biases may be operating simultaneously. We develop a likelihood function that models both sources of bias, and suggest convenient prior distributions that simplify deriving posterior distributions. The models are based on dichotomous test results and the parameters of interest are estimated using a Gibbs sampler. Using both simulated and real data examples, we demonstrate that the method presented here can correct the verification bias even when a perfect gold standard test does not exist.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999697q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375w48d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78tc27r"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nutrient removal using a constructed wetland in southern Québec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>LaFlamme, Christina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A study was conducted to assess the efficiency of a constructed wetland for sediment and nutrient removal from a riverine source containing non-point source pollution (NPS) in a Nordic climate. The constructed wetland, built near the town of Mystic, Southern Quebec, consists of a sedimentation basin, a sinuous subsurface horizontal flow section and an open water body or pond that continuously receives up to 5% of Walbridge Creek. Flow into and through the system is controlled by gravity. There is a gate on the intake structure, which allows inflow into the wetland to be adjusted, along with three composite weirs; located at the outlet of each section of the wetland. Water samples were analyzed for orthophosphates (PO4), dissolved phosphorus (DP), total phosphorus (TP), ammonium (NH4+) and nitrates (NO3-) The study occurred from May to December 2003 and from May to December 2004. In 2003, there was a 33.6% reduction in TP load from intake to outlet with a retention rate of 2.23 g m-2 year-1. The greatest reduction in TP load during 2003 took place during the summer months (32.2%). In 2004, there was a further reduction of 42.8% in TP load from intake to outlet with a retention rate of 1.56 g m-2 year-1 compared to 2003. The largest reduction in TP load during the operational year of 2004 took place during the summer months (43.7%). Within the wetland, both the submerged flow section and open water basin showed similar and significant reductions of TP load in 2003 and 2004 annually and seasonally. Both annually and seasonally in 2003, NO3- showed no significant decrease in load from intake to outlet or within portions of the wetland. In 2004, there was a 22% annual load reduction from intake to outlet with a retention rate of 43.9 g m-2 year-1. The largest reduction in NO3- load during 2004 took place during the summer months (25.6%). Within the wetland, the submerged flow section showed the greatest reduction in NO3- concentrations annually and during the summer months of 2004. These results confirm the range of treatment efficiencies that can be achieved using a constructed wetland for NPS pollution in a Nordic climate.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kb035.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tc27r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Phosphorus -- Environmental aspects -- Missisquoi River Watershed (Vt. and Québec)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Constructed wetlands -- Missisquoi River Watershed (Vt. and Québec)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agricultural pollution -- Missisquoi River Watershed (Vt. and Québec)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nonpoint source pollution -- Missisquoi River Watershed (Vt. and Québec)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30ps99g"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Metabolic function of cytoplasmic methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase-Cyclohydrolase-Synthetase activities</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kuzmanov, Uros</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The NADP-dependent trifunctional methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase-Cyclohydrolase-Synthetase (DCS) is responsible for the interconversion of one-carbon substituted tetrahydrofolates (THFs) required for methylation reactions and nucleotide synthesis in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells.

Although problems, such as sparking between the electrode surfaces of the decelerator, prevented it from being operated at potentials high enough to decelerate a 60 keV beam, its implementation proved, as in the simulations, that high-energy ions could indeed be decelerated to energies that would allow for their injection into an RFQ ion-guide by this design.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kq73q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jb762</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Nuclear</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mj24w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Rheological and thermal properties of sorghum dough</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kulamarva, Arun</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sorghum is a gluten free cereal and forms the staple diet of a majority of the populations living in the semi-arid tropics dough. It is usually consumed in the form of bread made from the grain flour. Dough made with sorghum flour has poor viscoelastic properties compared to wheat dough and mechanical methods for production of sorghum roti are scarce. This study was conducted to elucidate the rheological and thermal properties of sorghum dough to establish its behavior. The temperature and amount of water used for preparation of the dough and the composition of the flour were varied. Wheat, soya and black gram flours were used to prepare the composite doughs. Sensory characteristics of roti made with these dough samples by the traditional method and mechanical compression were studied. The results are presented and their implications are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q6624.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mj24w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sorghum as food</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dough -- Mechanical properties</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sorghum products</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mv46p"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Metal accumulation in surface sediments of salt marshes in the Bay of Fundy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hung, Grace Ann</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the most recognised values of tidal salt marshes is the ecosystem service they provide as natural sinks for contaminants such as metals. This study examines net accumulation of metals (As, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn and V) over a 5-yr period, from 1997 to 2002, in surface sediments of salt marshes in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Metal accumulation has been measured in seven sites that extend from outer to inner Bay and in low and high marsh areas within each site. Overall, sediment metal concentrations are at or near their natural levels. Concentrations of metals show variability among marshes but are not significantly different between low and high marsh. Concentrations of As, Hg, Pb and V appear to be influenced by anthropogenic inputs. Calculated sediment loading rates for these metals generally showed gradients of increased loading from outer to inner Bay. Variability in sediment deposition rate is the driving force behind this spatial pattern. Results of this study suggest that the value of salt marshes as a sink for metals may be enhanced by high sedimentation rates.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h2271.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mv46p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Estuarine sediments -- Fundy, Bay of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Salt marshes -- Fundy, Bay of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Heavy metal content -- Fundy, Bay of, Region</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wn15p"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ethics beyond borders : how Canadian health professionals experience ethics in humanitarian assistance and development work</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hunt, Matthew, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Canadian health professionals are involved in humanitarian assistance and development work in many regions of the world. They participate in primary health care, immunization campaigns, feeding programs, rehabilitation and hospital-based care. In the course of their work clinicians are frequently exposed to complex ethical issues. This thesis examines how health workers experience ethics in the course of humanitarian assistance and development work. A qualitative study was conducted to consider this question. Five core themes emerged from the data including experiencing a tension between respecting local customs and imposing values, knowing how to respond when basic care is impossible, addressing differing understandings of health and illness, questions of identity for health workers, and issues of trust and distrust. Recommendations are made for standards and organizational strategies that could help aid agencies better support and equip their staff as they respond to ethical issues.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vb606.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wn15p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, General</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Public and Social Welfare</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405s9646"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Time to reperfusion therapy in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Huynh, Thao Thanh, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objectives of this thesis are to describe door-to-reperfusion therapy wait times in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at selected hospitals in Quebec, and to identify factors associated with prolonged wait times. We undertook an observational study of patients with STEMI who received reperfusion therapy, at 17 hospitals in Quebec in 2003. Door-to-reperfusion therapy wait times were available for 1,189 of 1,432 patients for patients who received reperfusion therapy. The median door-to-reperfusion therapy wait times were 32 minutes for patients who received fibrinolytic therapy, and 145 and 109 minutes for patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with and without inter-hospital transfers, respectively. We conclude that door-to-reperfusion therapy wait times for STEMI approached recommended times for fibrinolytic therapy, but remained prolonged for primary PCI at these 17 hospitals in 2003. Efforts are needed to reduce door-to-reperfusion therapy wait times and especially wait times to primary PCI, to assure maximum benefits from prompt delivery of reperfusion therapy for patients with STEMI.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nt82z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405s9646</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Epidemiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az316q177j"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nervous control of sperm release in the snail, Cantareus aspersus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hutcheson, Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The primary objective of my research was to test the hypothesis that the sperm release mechanism in the garden snail, Cantareus aspersus , is under nervous control. It was discovered that separate branches of the intestinal nerve innervate the seminal vesicle and the distal ovotestis duct, and sperm release from the seminal vesicle was achieved by electrical stimulation of this nerve. Stimulation of the penis nerve, right cerebropedal connective nerve, right mesocerebrum, visceral ganglion, and the everted reproductive organs elicited similar responses. Neurobiotin fills of the penis nerve (towards the penis) revealed putative sensory receptors at the base of the penis and within the genital atrium. Spermatophores from mated snails whose reproductive organs were treated with the local anaesthetic Lidocaine weighed significantly less than spermatophores from mated control snails, suggesting that mechanical stimulation during copulation triggers sperm release from the seminal vesicle.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t208s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q177j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Brown garden snail -- Nervous system</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brown garden snail -- Reproduction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brown garden snail -- Sexual behavior</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612n929"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Thermo-physical and rheological properties of mango puree as influenced by soluble solids, temperature and high pressure treatment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gundurao, Anuradha</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two classes of parameters are important in product quality control and process design: thermo-physical and rheological properties. Reliable estimates of thermal properties (thermal conductivity, diffusivity, density, specific heat, and glass transition temperature) are needed to model the rate of heat transfer during food processing. Measurements of rheological parameters like viscosity and elasticity have been recognized as important tools to provide fundamental insights on structural organization of the food. Small amplitude oscillatory testing is useful in evaluation of gel characteristics and texture development in different food products. Proper design of industrial plants, modeling and automation in food process industry require data on these properties for better quality control and improve the shelf life. Thermal processing has been a traditionally accepted method for developing safe and shelf-stable products. However, a disadvantage of thermal treatment is the reduced sensory and nutritional qualities. High pressure (HP) treatment, a novel non-thermal preservation technique, is used for producing high quality products. HP processing can also be used to achieve products with better textural properties and improved nutrition when supplemented with proteins. This research was carried out in two parts. In first part, experiments with mango pulp were carried out at four temperatures (20, 40, 60 and 80°C) and total soluble solids concentrations (15, 20, 30 and 40°Brix) and their rheological and thermo-physical properties were evaluated and modeled. Thermal properties of mango puree were primarily dependent on the moisture content of the sample, and increased with temperature and decreased with concentration. Density showed a reverse trend. Glass transition temperatures increased with an increase in concentration indicating better stability. Separate models were developed for each thermal property as a function of temperature and concentration (R2 &gt;0.90). Mango puree exhibited pseudoplaticity during steady shear measurements, and the power law model well described their flow behavior. Consistency coefficient increased with concentration and decreased with temperature. The flow behavior index decreased with concentration and generally increased with temperature beyond 40°C. Dynamic oscillation shear measurements revealed that mango puree behaved like a weak gel and demonstrated visco-elastic properties. In the second part, experiments were divided in to two parts. In first part, the original soluble solids in mango puree (28°Brix) was lowered to 20, 23 and 26°Brix and each was supplemented with 2, 5 and 8% of whey protein. Effect of HP treatment at 425, 500, and 575 MPa with 0, 3 and 6 min holding times on rheological properties were evaluated. Pressure treatment resulted in a positive effect on elastic (G') and viscous modulii (G") as well as complex viscosity (eta*). Values of G' were higher than G" demonstrating the product to behave more and more like a gel. The changes in rheological parameters at 500 MPa were modeled based on soluble solids and protein content. In the second part of the experiments, the protein (P) and soluble solids concentrations (S) were simultaneously varied maintaining a total solids content at 28% (same as in the original mango puree) and their combined influence (P/S: 2/26, 3/25, 5/23, 7/21 and 8/20) on the rheology of the product after selected HP treatments (425-575 MPa, 0-6 min) were evaluated. The effects of holding time and pressure level were similar to those observed previously in first part of this study. However, the positive effect of added protein was over dominated by negative effect of the simultaneous decrease in the soluble solids concentration, resulting in an overall decreasing effect as protein content increased (with a same magnitude decrease in soluble solids content). Developed models well predicted the combined influence of protein and soluble solids concentration on rheological parameters (R2&gt;0.85). Sensory evaluation of mango puree supplemented with protein (2, 5 and 8%) was performed before and after high pressure treatment (500MPa/3min) using a nine point hedonic scale. The quality parameters chosen were color, sweetness, mouthfeel, flavor and acceptability. Sensory evaluation results indicated that protein enrichment up to 5% level did not adversely affect the sensory qualities.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sg57z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612n929</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>High pressure (Technology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mango -- Preservation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956g13r"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The geography of tuberculosis and its transmission on the Island of Montreal</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Haase, Ian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>While the overall annual incidence of tuberculosis (TB) on the Island of Montreal has been stable at 10 per 100,000 in recent years, incidence varies tremendously by country of birth and by neighbourhood. It is not clear how much of this variation reflects population distribution, and how much reflects localized risk factors and/or local transmission. Precise mapping and spatial statistical analysis allowed for the identification of two types of TB concentrations: hotspots---raw concentrations of cases, and high-incidence zones---where TB incidence significantly exceeds the rate expected. The high-incidence zones were not fully explained by known risk factors for TB, such as high population densities or low incomes, when aggregated at the census tract level. The results were linked with Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotyping data to search for evidence of recent transmission. We found that there is substantial aggregation of TB in Montreal, beyond the concentration of the foreign-born as a group, and evidence of recent transmission contributing to high incidence was uncovered in one area of the city.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rw95w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g13r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tuberculosis -- Transmission -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal Island (Island)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tuberculosis -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal Island (Island)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956g141"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Basic operators for semistructured data in a relational programming language</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gu, Yu, 1969 Jan. 27-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>JRelix is a relational database implementation that supports not only traditional relational algebra and domain algebra but also complex data type and recursive nesting with powerful database programming language.

We use union type domains to increase the flexibility of rigid type definition in relational databases. In addition, we implement the grep operator in the relational algebra to facilitate queries on semistructured data. Grep returns a relation which could contain the type and name of the attribute where it finds the match and the position in that attribute and value of the match. Moreover, we also implement top-level scalar and substring function which are also very useful in a relational database language.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fh410.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g141</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407x533"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Amniotic fluid amino acids as biological indicators of fetal growth in human and rat models</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gurekian, Christine N.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Amniotic fluid (AF) is a protective pool and a resource of amino acids for the growing fetus.

Arginine, 3-methyl histidine and tryptophan were positive predictors of birth weight, while ornithine was a negative predictor. In study 2, we used a diet induced model of IUGR to see if specific AF amino acids were predictive of fetal weight near term. Methionine and phenylalanine were modified by diet, and 12 amino acids were independently modified by gestational age, respectively. Cysteine, lysine, methionine and tyrosine were predictors of fetal weight. Thus, the AF amino acid pool is associated in animals and humans with fetal growth.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r1196.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407x533</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Birth weight</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fetus -- Growth</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amniotic liquid -- Analysis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67jr455"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The international merger control regime : building cooperation without harmonization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bonova, Lucia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Globalization has had two major implications for national merger control regimes: national competition authorities are called more and more to examine transactions with cross-border dimensions and secondly, domestic business practices may be scrutinized by foreign nations. In light of this, divergent substantive standards have become a source of international friction, notably between the two most mature merger control regimes, the European Union and the United States. Facing this new reality, it has become clear that some sort of international arrangement will be needed in order to reduce the inefficiencies created by multijurisdictional review. Various proposals have been made, ranging from ambitious ones that would include the creation of an international competition code and enforcement agency, to more realistic proposals of achieving international coordination of merger control regimes through bilateral and multilateral cooperation amongst antitrust agencies. This thesis argues that the path of large-scale cooperation is the most appropriate way to cope with the problems raised by globalization. As such, cooperation does not imply the harmonization of merger control regimes. The future lies in the hands of the International Competition Network which, despite considerable achievements, must evolve in the near future.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mm551.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jr455</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Conflict of laws -- Antitrust law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Consolidation and merger of corporations -- European Union countries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Globalization</dc:subject><dc:subject>Consolidation and merger of corporations -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tp63d"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement : a constitutional analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Borovan, Nicole A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the Safe Third Country Agreement between Canada and the United States from the perspective of Canada's obligations vis-a-vis asylum seekers under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Safe Third Country Agreement requires asylum seekers to lodge their refugee claims in the first country of arrival, as between Canada and the United States. Asylum seekers on the United States side of the border who are seeking to enter Canada for the purpose of claiming refugee status will be deflected to the United States to lodge their claims there. By deflecting asylum seekers in this manner, Canada effectively conscripts the United States to carry out its obligations under the Charter to furnish procedural and substantive protections to asylum seekers. This thesis examines certain features of the United States asylum system to which asylum seekers deflected under the Safe Third Country Agreement would be subjected, in order to determine whether, according to relevant Charter jurisprudence, deflection constitutes a deprivation of security of the person under section 7 of the Charter and whether such deprivation can be justified under section 1.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93gz818.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tp63d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Refugees -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Asylum, Right of -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada.

This study quantified fit of ice hockey skate boots by measuring the pressure (MP) at the foot/ankle-to-boot interface using three skate sizes. The relationship between perceived pressure (PP), perceived comfort (PC) and measured pressures (MP) also were documented. Methods . 18 male subjects participated. Thirty piezo-resistive sensors recorded MPs from seven areas with the foot/ankle in various positions. A Visual Analogue Scale was used for subjective assessment of PP and PC. Results. Overall fit MP was estimated at 34.2 KPa though significant mixed interactions (p&lt;0.05) occurred between areas, foot/ankle positions and sizes. MP correlations with PP, PC, and foot/ankle dimensions were low though a strong inverse relationship was identified between PP and PC (r = -0.63). Conclusions. The technology and protocol adopted was effective in discriminating "fit" between regional pressure differences as well as responsive to foot/ankle positions. Further examination of other footwear products and different populations is feasible and warranted.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wg29j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mf784</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Skating -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hockey players</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
