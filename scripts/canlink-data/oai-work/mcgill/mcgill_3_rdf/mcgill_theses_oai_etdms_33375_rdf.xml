CD45 function during early events of antigen receptor signaling has been well established, however, the role of CD45 during later stages of T cell activation is only beginning to emerge. Transient tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 has previously been demonstrated. We show this phosphorylation can be sustained through treatment of a T cell hybridoma cell line with the PTPase inhibitor, pervanadate. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 is significantly increased in the presence of an activated form of Lck. Tyrosine phosphorylated CD45 is correlated with the association of a subset of signaling molecules containing SH2 domains. These molecules include p56Lck, p59Fyn, rasGAP, Grb2 and Csk. Although CD45 becomes abundantly tyrosine phosphorylated upon pervanadate treatment, no other SH2-containing molecules that we had tested demonstrated association with CD45. The interaction between CD45 and Grb2 in particular was found to be dependent upon CD45 tyrosine phosphorylation and mediated through the SH2 domain of Grb2. Interestingly, both Grb2 and a close homolog, Grap are able to bind CD45 in in vitro binding assays. Grap does not, however, associate with CD45 in vivo as was observed for Grb2. CD45 contains two Grb2 consensus binding sequences. Deletion of both results in a greatly diminished capacity for CD45- Grb2 association. However, interaction between the two is not completely abolished and appears to result from an unconventional peptide sequence as observed by 2-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping studies. In the process of mapping the phosphotyrosine sequences required for CD45-Grb2 interaction, many tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides have been identified and assigned to tyrosine residues in CD45.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Branton, Philip E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pp65v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sh91g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g6708"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Through drying of machine formed paper and drying nonuniformity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hashemi Aghchehbody, Seyed Jalaleddin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Transport phenomena characteristics were determined for the through air drying of machine-produced printing and heavier papers. The momentum transport is strongly affected by the specifications of machine-formed papers, but of the drying rate characteristics only the critical moisture content varied between the types of paper tested. To determine the impact of individual parameters of commercial papermaking these experiments with machine-formed paper were supplemented by the use of handsheets. The papermaking parameters of beating, wet pressing, formation and pulp blending all strongly affect the momentum transport through the paper but only the quality of sheet formation and composition of TMP-kraft pulp blends influences drying rates measurably. The general phenomenon of nonuniformity in through drying was examined, including its association with nonuniformity of paper structure, with process conditions affecting drying nonuniformity, and implications for minimizing the cost of providing the flow of drying air through semi-permeable grades of paper. The development and decay of non-uniformity during drying was demonstrated through two techniques, one based on the measurement of local sheet moisture content, the other with continuous monitoring of the local air exhaust temperature from the sheet. Drying nonuniformity is quite sensitive to the quality of formation and to drying intensity, and is less severe at both the higher and lower end of the basis weight range. The biggest effect on drying nonuniformity is the improvement possible by reduction in the initial moisture content. In-plane moisture diffusivity was determined to be a very strong function of sheet moisture content, and is not fast enough to reduce the sheet moisture nonuniformity during drying. The study provides guidance in the possible future use of through air drying for application to grades of paper heavier than those for which it is now used.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Douglas, W.

CcP reduces hydrogen peroxide to H2O using cytochrome c as the electron donor. Both parasites are catalase deficient; thus, cytochrome c peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase are the enzymes involved in the detoxification of H2O 2 in these organisms. The enzymatic activity of these two peroxidases may enable S. mansoni and F. hepatica to survive oxidative stress. The main objective of this study was to characterize cytochrome c peroxidase from S. mansoni and F. hepatica . Kinetic studies of this enzyme in crude homogenate and isolated mitochondria of S. mansoni were initially performed, followed by purification studies from S. mansoni and F. hepatica . The parasite enzyme has affinity for horse heart and yeast cytochrome c and it is inhibited by sodium azide and potassium cyanide. CcP was purified close to homogeneity and identified as a protein containing heme. The antioxidant capability of F. hepatica CcP was tested in vitro , demonstrating that CcP protected the sugar deoxyribose from oxidative degradation. Exposure of adult worms to H2O2 caused a decrease in S. mansoni CcP activity in vivo. An attempt was made to clone the S. mansoni CcP gene. The experiments did not result in the cloning of the CcP gene, but led to the identification and cloning of another protein, a component of a cytosolic chaperonin, t-complex polypeptide one (TCP-1). TCP-1 from S. mansoni is highly homologous to TCP-1 proteins from different organisms including, Chinese hamster, human, Drosophila and yeast and carries ATP binding amino acid motifs indicating that it has ATPase activity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Prichard, R.

The process involves reducing MgCl2 activity within a fused salt mixture via complexation and reacting any contaminating oxides that are mostly MgO with HCl(g). This process would not be possible nor economical if the MgCl2 activity was not reduced via complexation. This system is modeled here by treating the complexation as decreasing the MgCl2 activity coefficient in a fused salt mixture. The chlorination was modeled thermodynamically using recently published thermodynamic data presented by Thompson et al. The model was experimentally verified. A kinetic model was also developed for the heterogeneous reaction between injected HCl gas and the MgO in fused salt. It was found that the rate of MgO elimination was proportional to C2/3MgO in the fused salt during the course of a kinetic batch test. The implication is that the rate of transport per unit area of MgO, of HCl to the MgO surface is constant for any particular condition which is only possible if the mass transport of HCl to the MgO particle surface is rate limiting. The kinetics of MgO conversion were measured as a function of superficial gas velocity and mixing power per unit volume. The following relation empirically describes the conversion rate per unit area of MgO particle surface area wt%/min/m 2 for a given operating condition. km=0.001895Pg Vm0.8 3Vst 0.92 Analysis of the kinetic information, confirmed the hypothesis for the mechanism of MgO elimination.

Although this cytokine is very beneficial to the host when released in small amounts or in localized fashion, abnormally high levels of TNFalpha can however be very detrimental. The biological effects of this cyokine is thus dependent on its timing, location and extent of release. In recent years major interest has been placed on the AU rich elements (ARE) present in the 3' untranslated region of the TNFalpha mRNA as it plays a pivitol role in the posttranscriptional control of TNFalpha protein production. We have previously shown that a protein binding site within this main ARE (positioned between bases 1291 and 1320) has the ability to bind to three protein complexes (A,B,C). In this study we describe a second AU rich element which also has protein binding capabilities. This second protein binding site (located 158 bases downstream from the first ARE) is 31 nucleotides long and contains a single AUAUUUAU sequence. Fractionation experiments have enabled us to show that a protein complex (complex D) present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic cell compartments can interact with this second binding region. The binding of this second ARE to this complex is readily competed for by other AU rich elements present in the mRNA of certain protooncogenes and cytokines such as c-fos and IL-1beta. The importance of binding of macrophage proteins to the ARE in the posttranscriptional regulation of TNFalpha was evidenced by the fact that polymorphisms (GAU trinucleotide insertional mutation) in the main ARE (positioned between bases 1291 and 1320 of the 3 ' untranslated region) of TNFalpha mRNA results in the decreased binding of macrophage protein complexes to the element. The GAU insertional mutation in the main ARE hinders the binding of a protein named HuR to the region. This protein is a nucleo-cytoplamic shuttling protein previously shown to play a prominent role in the stability and translatability of mRNA containing ARE. In order in elucidate and further our understanding of signalling mechanisms which regulate the function of proteins binding to ARE we verified if priming of macrophages with IFNgamma is important in the posttranscriptional regulation of TNFalpha mRNA. We show that priming of macrophages with IFNgamma prior to LPS treatment posttranscriptionally upregulates TNFalpha production by increasing the stability of the message and the levels of mRNA present on translationally active polyribosomes. The involvement of IFNgamma in the posttranscriptional regulation of Overall data presented in the thesis will further our understanding of how ARE in the 3'UTR of the TNFalpha mRNA posttranscriptionally regulates the expression of TNFalpha.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Radzioch, Danuta</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zz21r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gv280</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881n66n"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The orbitofrontal cortex : sulcal anatomy and cytoarchitectonic correlations</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chiavaras, Mary M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The sulcal patterns of the human orbitofrontal cortex have not been adequately characterized. Classical authors, as well as more recent investigators, have attempted to identify and label the sulci of this part of the brain. Nevertheless, there is considerable confusion regarding the orbital sulcal patterns with inconsistencies in the naming of orbitofrontal sulci in many modern texts. Moreover, a correlation between specific landmarks and architectonic areas has not been demonstrated. A clarification of the patterns of the orbitofrontal sulci and their relationship to architectonic subregions is necessary if the results of functional neuroimaging and other physiological and anatomical findings are to be properly interpreted. Although studies have reported altered activity in the orbitofrontal cortex in relation to various sensory processes and pathological states it has been difficult to relate these changes to specific orbitofrontal regions because of a limited understanding of the anatomical landmarks. The absence of reliable reference markers forces the use of vague terminology (e.g., "orbital frontal activation") in describing the location of functional changes in the orbital frontal cortex. The aim of this doctoral thesis was to gain a better understanding of the sulcal pattern of the human orbitofrontal cortex and its relation to the underlying cytoarchitecture. The first study resolved the confusion associated with the orbitofrontal sulci by identifying, quantifying, and precisely localizing the various orbital sulci from fifty human magnetic resonance scans that were transformed into the standardized stereotaxic space of Talairach and Tournoux (1988). The second study compared the individual sulci and sulcal patterns of these fifty human brains with the brains of fifty adult rhesus monkeys. Having examined the orbitofrontal sulci in these two species, a nomenclature for the human orbitofrontal sulci was established which was based on comparable sulci in the less convoluted macaque monkey brain while trying to preserve many of the familiar labels associated with this region in the human brain. The final part of this thesis examined the orbitofrontal cytoarchitecture of 10 human adult cerebral hemispheres to determine if a correlation exists between the different orbital sulci and the borders of the architectonic subregions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Petrides, Michael</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng32b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881n66n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2n49t366w"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Signalling mechanisms underlying Trk function in neonatal sympathetic neurons</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Atwal, Jasvinder K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>NGF acting through the TrkA tyrosine kinase receptor promotes survival and axon growth of developing sympathetic neurons in vivo and in vitro. This thesis examines the signalling pathways and proteins used by Trk receptors to mediate neuronal survival, local axon growth, and growth cone regulation in neonatal rat sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). First, I examined the involvement of key signalling motifs on the Trk receptor in mediating neurotrophin-dependent survival and local axon growth. Using recombinant adenoviruses, I expressed the BDNF receptor TrkB, which is not endogenously expressed in SCG neurons, either in wild-type form or mutated at defined effector binding sites. Ectopically expressed wild-type TrkB activated signalling pathways similarly to endogenous TrkA, and supported both neuronal survival and local axon growth in compartmented Campenot chambers. However, TrkB mutated at the Shc-binding site was impaired in its ability to activate PI3-kinase/Akt and MEK/ERK, and was a poor mediator of both neuronal survival and local axon growth. Furthermore, by using pharmacological inhibitors, I found that TrkB-mediated survival and local axon growth required both PI3-kinase and MEK/ERK signalling. Next, I investigated the contribution of Trk signalling to growth cone maintenance in sympathetic neurons. Acute inhibition of NGF/TrkA signalling rapidly collapsed growth cones, as did inhibition of either PI3-kinase or MEK/ERK. I then asked whether the chemorepellent Sema3F collapsed sympathetic growth cones by inhibiting TrkA-mediated growth signals. Sema3F did not disrupt NGF-induced activation of TrkA, Shc, or PLC-gamma but significantly reduced PI3-kinase and MEK/ERK activation. Furthermore, sustained hyper-activation of PI3-kinase and MEK/ERK partially blocked Sema3F-induced collapse, suggesting that Sema3F acts, at least in part, by inhibiting Trk-dependent pathways. Together, these data describe the role of Trk signalling in survival, local axon growth, and growth cone maintenance in cultured sympathetic neurons. The Shc-binding site was found to be critical for TrkB-mediated survival and local axon growth. The PI3-kinase and MEK/ERK pathways were found to be important for survival, local axon growth and growth cone maintenance. Furthermore, the chemorepellent Sema3F collapses sympathetic growth cones, at least in part, by interfering with key neurotrophin-induced signalling pathways.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Miller, Freda</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Kaplan, David</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m345x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t366w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c2218"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ovarian development and function in follitropin receptor knockout (FORKO) mice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Danilovich, Natalia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation examines the ovarian development and function in genetically modified mice that lack FSH receptor (FSH-R) signaling. We propose that a complete or partial loss of FSH-R causes ovarian insufficiency resulting in estrogen deficiency and premature aging in female mice. Targeted disruption of FSH-R caused a gene dose related endocrine and gametogenic abnormality in female mice. The resulting FOllitropin R̲eceptor K̲nockO̲ut (FORKO) mutants were acyclic and infertile due to ovulatory defects, even with very high levels of FSH. Lack of FSH-R signaling in females caused a severe ovarian underdevelopment, producing estrogen deficiency. As a consequence, the null mutants developed obesity and skeletal abnormalities. The expression of nuclear estrogen receptor(s) alpha and beta genes and the corresponding proteins in the ovary and uterus of FORKO mice were maintained intact, as estrogen administration induced uterine growth and decreased accumulation of the adipose tissue. By 12 months of age, 92% of FORKO animals developed ovarian neoplasms of sex cord-stromal type similar to pathology observed in women. Our results showed, for the first time, that the loss of the FSH-R signaling mechanisms predisposes the ovary to molecular and structural changes causing tumor formation. In contrast to acyclic and infertile FORKO (-/-) females, a phenotype of FORKO mice with a partial (+/-) disruption of the receptor gene exhibits irregular cyclicity and reduced fertility, undergoing early reproductive senescence. Our findings also demonstrate that the loss of a single allele of the FSH receptor gene causes a premature exhaustion of gonadal reserves accompanied by age-related changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The study concludes that the FSH receptor signaling offers a protective mechanism, which gradually weakens upon reproductive senescence (menopause in women); therefore this knockout constitutes a unique and promising animal model for studying the physiology and molecular mechanisms of gonadal receptors and hormones.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ram, Sairam M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/765372783.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c2218</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w9168"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Eicosanoid mediationmodulation in spinal nociceptive mechanisms in the normal rat and in a rat model of chronic pain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pitcher, Graham Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The studies presented in this thesis are concerned with physiological and neurochemical characterization of on-going and stimulation-elicited synaptic transmission of sensory information in the dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord. Historically, since the use of willow tree bark extract for pain relief, the recognition that it and related nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) express their analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) and more recently the identification of two forms of COX, inducible (COX-2) and constitutive (COX-1), efforts have focussed on exploring the therapeutic potential of this class of drugs. In normal rats, the response to noxious peripheral stimulation involves at least two distinct discharge responses of dorsal horn neurones, an initial discharge which lasts only for the duration of the stimulus and a slowly-decaying afterdischarge which persists beyond the end of the stimulus. Innocuous mechanical stimulation produces excitation of dorsal horn neurones lasting only for the duration of the stimulus. Characterization of these excitatory responses reveals that the initial discharge in response to noxious or innocuous mechanical stimulation involves only limited activation of the eicosanoid pathway via COX, while the afterdischarge is sustained to a major extent via COX activation, at least in part by COX-2. On-going discharge seems not to involve activation of COX. An animal model of neuropathic pain was induced by implantation of a 2 mm polyethylene cuff around one sciatic nerve in rats. This lowers the nociceptive threshold in the von Frey hair test and induces spontaneous pain behaviour. In cuff-implanted rats, on-going activity is greater compared to that in normal rats. Furthermore, noxious mechanical stimulation evokes an afterdischarge response of dorsal horn neurones which is markedly greater than that in normal rats but the initial discharge is not different. Importantly, a switch in the response to innocuous mechanical stimulation is observed also such that an afterdischarge occurs after the end of the initial discharge, which is not seen in normal rats. Characterization of the synaptically-elicited responses in cuff-implanted rats to noxious and innocuous mechanical stimulation reveals that the initial discharge, and to a greater extent the afterdischarge, are subject to a COX-2-mediated or modulatory mechanism. The elevated on-going discharge in cuff-implanted rats may also be sustained via tonic COX-2 activity. These results demonstrate participation of unique and identifiable physiological and neurochemical mechanisms in the mediation and modulation of on-going and synaptically-elicited responses in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in normal sensory processing and in sensory processing associated with peripheral neuropathy. Ultimately, the data in this thesis may advance understanding of the neurophysiological basis of chronic pain syndromes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Henry, James L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50tt32n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w9168</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666621x"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Predictive rules for the enantioselectivity of hydrolases towards alcohols and amines</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Weissfloch, Alexandra N. E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To help organic chemists use enzymes as synthetic reagents, guidelines are needed to help them choose an appropriate enzyme. We proposed reliable empirical substrate rules that predict the stereochemical outcome of reactions catalyzed by hydrolases. These rules, developed through a combination of substrate screening and literature surveys, are based on the difference in size of the substituents at the stereocenter of substrates. One proposed rule predicts the enantiopreference of cholesterol esterase, lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia, and lipase from Candida rugosa towards secondary alcohols and their esters. A similar rule is proposed to predict the enantiopreference of subtilisins towards isosteric primary amines of the type NH2CHRR' . The enantiopreference of lipases towards primary amines and of subtilisins toward secondary alcohols is reviewed. Lipases and subtilisins have opposing enantiopreferences towards both secondary alcohols and primary amines. We also observed that the regioselectivity of subtilisin is opposite to that of lipases. We offer a rationalization to explain these opposing selectivities, based on known crystal structures of lipases and subtilisin. A similar rule is also found to predict the enantiopreference of lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia towards primary alcohols; this rule excludes substrates having an oxygen atom directly attached to the stereocenter. The favored enantiomer of primary alcohols is opposite to the favored enantiomer of secondary alcohols. Experiments conducted on substrates with two stereocenters and molecular modeling studies suggest that both classes of alcohols bind in the same regions of the active site. We proposed a method to enhance enantioselectivity of lipases and esterases towards secondary alcohols. This technique, based on increasing the difference in size of the substituents at the stereocenter, was successfully applied to the preparation of two useful chiral synthons: (S)-(-)-4-acetoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one and esters of (R)-lactic acid. Using a similar approach, we designed a synthetic scheme for the preparation of both enantiomers of a useful C2-symmetric synthon.

Seven members of this family were identified including furin, PC I, PC2, PC4, PACE4, PC5 and PC7. All of which exhibit a signal peptide, a prosegment, a catalytic domain, a P-domain and a specific C-terminal segment. The present work concentrated on the characterization of two structural elements, namely the prosegment and the P-domain, which are critical for enzymatic function and cellular trafficking. We examined the biosynthesis, functional activity and cellular localization of two PACE4 isoforms generated by differential splicing, the full length PACE4-A and the C-terminally truncated PACE4-CS that lacks 11 amino acids at the end of its chaperone-like P-domain. Cellular expression demonstrated that PACE4-A codes for a functional secretable enzyme capable of cleaving pro7B2 into 7132. However, PACE4-CS is not secreted and remains in the endoplasmic reticulum as an inactive zymogen form, therefore emphasizing the importance of the integrity of the P-domain. The prosegment is presumed to act both as an intramolecular chaperone and an inhibitor of its parent enzyme. We purified recombinant prosegments of furin (pFurin) and PC7 (pPC7) from bacteria. The inhibitory potencies and selectivities of the prosegments were tested in vitro and ex vivo. The pFurin and pPC7 are potent inhibitors (IC50 low nM) of their parent enzymes. Whereas pPC7 is more selective than pFurin. Most of the inhibitory potency seems to reside at the C-terminal region immediately preceding the primary cleavage site of the prosegment with the P1 Arg playing a critical role. Furthermore, overexpression of prosegments in cell lines efficiently blocked precursor processing of the neurotrophins NGF and BDNF.

The dissertation is divided into two parts: the first part introduces Them, the members of the Ligue; while the second part describes (or identifies) the Other, the colonized migrants, the foreigners, the political and ethnic refugees of the interwar period. This research demonstrates that, although in theory these groups were considered equal in the name of universalism, in practice the discourse of the Ligue discriminated against them. The evidence shows that the members of the Ligue des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen despised all foreigners, and established the level of discrimination according to a hierarchy of contempt.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ingram, Norman</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763871s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773x343</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>France -- Politics and government -- 1914-1940</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ligue des droits de l'homme (Paris, France)</dc:subject><dc:subject>France -- Race relations -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Racism -- France -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dh447"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The synthesis of fluorescent chemosensors responsive to cAMP and other nucleotides</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Turkewitsch, Petra</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The overall objective of this study was to develop a fluorescent chemosensor for cAMP by creating recognition sites for cAMP, that contain a fluorescent molecule, in a polymer matrix by molecular imprinting. Such a fluorescent molecularly imprinted polymer may, therefore, serve as both the recognition element and the measuring element for the fluorescent detection of cAMP in aqueous media. Two new fluorescent molecules, known as 4-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)pyridinium salts or dyes, were synthesized as possible fluorescent components of a chemosensor. Upon excitation at 469 run, dye 1, trans-4-( p-N,N-dimethylaminostyryl)-N-vinylbenzyl-pyridinium chloride, displays a dramatic quantum yield enhancement in an emission band centered at ~600 nm, with concomitant slight red shift of the emission maximum, in the presence of the cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, in aqueous solution. Other purine nucleotides (AMP, ADP and ATP) and adenosine induce fluorescence quantum yield enhancements of lesser magnitude than those observed for cyclic nucleotides. The pyrimidine nucleotides, CMP and UMP, have almost no effect on the fluorescence of 1, suggesting a specificity of 1 for purine over pyrimidine analytes. Equilibrium association constants for 1 with the purine analytes, in aqueous solution (pH 7.2) range from 13.9 M --1 for cAMP to 0.15 M--1 for adenine. We conclude that the interaction of 1 with these analytes requires the presence of a purine base, and is enhanced by the presence of ribose and phosphate moieties. Dye 1 and a structurally-similar dye 2, trans-4-(p-N,N-dimethylaminostryl)-N-phenethylpyridinium bromide, also display dramatic fluorescence enhancements in the presence of DNA and proteins, suggesting that they also interact with these biomolecules. The environmentally-sensitive fluorescence of dyes 1 and 2 suggests that such compounds may be useful for developing fluorescent chemosensors for purine nucleotides, especially cAMP, and for the fluorescence detection or staining of DNA and proteins. To increase the recognition ability of 1 for cAMP, we prepared recognition sites for cAMP that contain fluorescent dye 1 in a polymer matrix by molecular imprinting. This is a novel design for such template-selective sites, since dye 1 forms an integral part of the recognition cavity, thereby serving as both the recognition element and the measuring element for the fluorescence detection of cAMP in aqueous media. The polymer displays a concentration-dependent decrease in fluorescence in the presence of aqueous cAMP, whereas almost no effect is observed in the presence of the structurally-similar molecule, cGMP. An association constant of ~105 M--1 was calculated for cAMP binding. Such fluorescent molecularly imprinted polymers could serve as a starting point in the development of highly effective synthetic fluorescent sensors for cAMP as well as other important biological molecules.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Powell, William S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h3455.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dh447</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Analytical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kc34c"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>In vitro enzymatic synthesis and degradation of polyhydroxyalkanoates</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nobes, Geoffrey A. R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Studies of the use of enzymes to both produce and degrade polyhydroxyalkanotes (PHAs) under in vitro conditions are presented in this thesis. PHAs were produced using a lipase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of the corresponding lactones. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), PHB, was obtained in up to 89% yield with a degree of polymerization of 3--12. Polymerization of other lactones, including beta-propiolactone, gamma-butyrolactone, and e -caprolactone, also yielded the corresponding polyesters in good yields with degrees of polymerization up to 25. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy was used to characterize the polymer products. The growth and kinetics of PHB granules produced in an in vitro polymerization were studied using TEM and CRYO-TEM in conjunction with image analysis. The in vitro reaction was confirmed to be a pseudoemulsion polymerization. The average granule diameter and volume increased with reaction time while the number of granules fell throughout the reaction due to coalescence. Basic kinetic parameters including KM, Vmax, and the rate constants of polymerization were determined and compared to those obtained for the in vivo biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate). With the aim of improved understanding of the mechanism of depolymerase action on water insoluble crystalline PHAs, folded chain lamellar single crystals of PHAs were partially degraded with PHA depolymerases and examined using TEM. Enzymatically degraded single crystals of bacterial PHB were found to be splintered by PHB-depolymerase A from Pseudomonas lemoignei parallel to their long axes into a needle-like morphology. These results support an "edge attack" model for the degradation of PHB single crystals and suggest that PHB-depolymerase A has both endo and exo activity. A further study was performed using single crystals of a number of PHAs which were partially degraded with depolymerases from Pseudomonas lemoignei and examined by TEM. In contrast to previous results with single crystals of bacterial PHB, the predominant effect observed with all crystals was a significant narrowing of the lamellae. This suggests an edge attack mechanism which because of lateral disorder of the crystals (caused by the introduction of valerate or repeat units of opposite stereochemistry) leads to a narrowing of the crystalline lamellae as opposed to the splintering effect previously observed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marchessault, R.

These include the phospholipids and the receptors of both membranes as well as the targeting signals found within the precursor proteins themselves. The targeting signals within precursor proteins were investigated in order to elucidate the role of positively charged amino acids and the length and amphiphilicity of the hydrophilic region of a signal-anchor in conferring the orientation of that signal-anchor in the outer membrane of the mitochondrion. It was determined that the retention of the hydrophilic region of the signal-anchor on the cytosolic side of the outer membrane is due to the amphiphilicity of this region and not due to the net positive charge or length of this region. The amphiphilic region has lipid binding capabilities which are decreased upon reducing the hydrophobic moment of this region. The transmembrane region of a signal-anchor was further investigated to determine how stretches of hydrophobic amino acids within precursor proteins function to target preproteins to different locations within the mitochondrion. It was determined that the targeting of a hydrophobic region is dependent on several factors: (1) its net hydrophobicity, (2) whether or not it is permitted to cross the outer membrane, (3) its distance from a matrix-targeting signal and (4) the relative strength of the matrix-targeting signal. Specifically, the mean hydrophobicity of the potential transmembrane region is an important determinant for the insertion of bitopic proteins into the inner membrane of mitochondria. Novel mitochondrial proteins which are potential targets for phosphorylation were also investigated. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV was found to be phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase which is present in both whole mitochondria and in isolated mitochondrial membranes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shore, G.

Definition of complex behavioral disorders is generally phenomenological in nature and guided by pragmatic, rather than genetic, concerns. Consequently, important aspect of genetic analysis is the search for novel phenotypic definitions from the familial/genetic perspective. SLI study 1. SLI denotes an inability to acquire normal language in the absence of peripheral hearing impairment, neurological disorder, and mental retardation. Sibling resemblance for several theoretically derived specific components of the SLI phenotype was examined in families of SLI children.

In a densely affected Anglophone pedigree, 41 sib-pair showed familial resemblance with respect to Derivational Morphology (r = 0.52, p &lt; 0.01). SLI study 2. Family history study in 27 families examined the relationship between attention deficit/hyperactivity in SLI children and familial risk of speech/language disorders. Higher odds of speech/language disorders were observed in first-degree relatives of 13 SLI children who also had a medical record of attention deficit/hyperactivity (15/27 vs. 4/46, p = 0.001).

Like any social construction, it is a product of the values of the culture in which it was developed. The theories and principles that form the cornerstones of Western psychotherapy reflect a number of Western ideals and biases, one of which is individualism. As such, it is important that we examine the impact that such a bias can have on clinical judgment, particularly since so many clients come from collectivist cultures, and since inaccurate clinical decisions that derive from flawed etiologies and character assessment can have such serious repercussions. The following study investigates, both qualitatively and quantitatively, how this individualistic bias in Western psychotherapy influences the clinical judgment and inference-making process. Within a Repeated Measures design, 84 graduate students provided assessments of two different clinical vignettes that were each alternated to reflect a client with either individualist or collectivist values. All participants were also asked to provide qualitative assessments of the casefiles, and a total of seven participants discussed their clinical impressions in greater depth during two different focus groups that were conducted at a later date. The focus groups were organized around four broad-based themes that were intended to clarify the study's earlier findings, and shed light on the processes underlying participants' clinical assessments. Results from this study suggest that clinicians do tend to view individualism as psychologically healthier than collectivism. While the findings indicate that clinicians tend to pathologize collectivism more in men than in women, factors other than gender also appear to interact with individualism-collectivism values to impact clinical assessment. Implications of these findings, as well as proposed directions for future research within the context of this study's limitations, are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dumont, Frank</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322f993.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z258b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Individualism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Collectivism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychotherapy -- Cross-cultural studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2n49t3675"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Subcellar localization of TrkB and its truncated isoforms and search for intracellular interacting proteins of the truncated TrkB.T1 isoform</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kryl, David P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neurotrophins affect neuronal development and plasticity through spatially localized effects but little is known about the subcellular distribution of the Trk neurotrophin receptors and its impact on neurotrophin action. This thesis examined the subcellular location of full-length trkB and trkC tyrosine kinase receptors and truncated trkB isoforms as well as downstream signalling molecules of the truncated trkB isoforms. Epitope tagged receptor isoforms were created to allow their unambiguous identification and localization after transfection. All tagged receptors were appropriately synthesized and full-length myc-trkB and myc-trkC mediated appropriate neurotrophin signaling events. Subcellular localization was studied following the transfection of MDCK cells, dissociated primary hippocampal neurons and cortical neurons within intact brain slices. I found that full-length trkB receptors were excluded from the apical domain of MDCK cells but trkC receptors were present in both apical and basolateral domains. Full-length trkB and trkC were found throughout transfected primary cultured hippocampal neurons and transfected neurons in neocortical brain slices and showed no evidence of vectorial sorting. Truncated forms of trkB were also homogeneously distributed in MDCK cells, dissociated hippocampal neurons and cortical neurons within slice preparations. Levels of full-length and truncated trkB were examined in post-synaptic densities; both receptor isoforms were present but not strongly enriched in these structures. Together, these findings suggest that trk receptors are uniformly distributed in both axonal and dendritic compartments and that local neurotrophin responses are controlled by other mechanisms.

A basic premise is that a coherent understanding of the banana industry and its consequences can only be achieved through the appreciation of the complexity of its organization. That is, the Costa Rican banana industry is a political-economic, socio-cultural, and environmental system articulated through a high degree of interaction at the micro and macro levels. Modernization and world systems theories are shown to provide partial and insufficient accounts of the dynamics at work in the Costa Rican banana industry. An embedded model of world systems theory, which includes aspects of sustainable development, is proposed to address these concerns. The analysis at various levels is intended to support the argument that consideration of environmental dynamics must be addressed in future theoretical accounts of development. Following world systems theory, the strong role of the banana transnationals within the industry and in relation to national development is examined. Other links between the Costa Rican banana industry and the broader international political economy are also examined, including the 'banana wars', as well as environmental issues, such as DBCP and other agrochemical usage. Significant changes in the Costa Rican banana industry since the 1980's are considered. These include: (1) a sharp increase in banana production, and an increase in independent banana producers, (2) the dissolution of the banana unions, and their replacement with a new system of labour relations (solidarismo); and (3) the recent concern for issues of environmental destruction. These changes, combined with the centrality of the banana industry to Costa Rican development, have resulted in significant consequences at the micro level. These are manifested in the organization of banana production and in operations on the plantation, as seen with respect to working conditions, quality control and of transnational power. In addition, environmental degradation, and underdevelopment and marginalization beyond the plantation are examined as direct consequences of the Costa Rican banana industry. This is supported with extensive ethnographic detail.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Locher, Uli</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dh45h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784n387</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Costa Rica -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Banana trade -- Costa Rica</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5t34sm13f"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Methods for detecting abnormal adaptation to protein restriction in humans with special reference to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hamadeh, Mazen Jamal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Postprandial urea production in subjects with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) on conventional insulin therapy is normal when the previous diet is high in protein, but there is an incomplete adaptive reduction in urea production following protein restriction. To evaluate the nutritional implications of restricted protein intake in human diabetes mellitus, it is first necessary to establish a reliable method to measure changes in urea production and amino acid catabolism in response to changes in dietary protein intake. We therefore tested (1) the accuracy of the urea production rate (Ra) to depict changes in urea production, (2) whether sulfate production can be accurately depicted using tracer or nontracer approaches, after establishing the use of electrospray tandem mass spectrometry to measure sulfate concentrations and 34SO4 enrichments following administration of the stable isotope tracer sodium [34S]sulfate, (3) the reproducibility of urea and sulfate measurements following a test meal low in protein (0.25 g/kg) in subjects previously adapted to high (1.5 g/kg.d) and low (0.3 g/kg.d) protein intakes, and compared the metabolic fate of [ 15N]alanine added to the test meal with that of [15N] Spirulina platensis, a 15N-labeled intact protein, and (4) whether we could identify the differences in postprandial urea and sulfate productions between normal subjects and persons with IDDM receiving conventional insulin therapy previously adapted to high protein intake, when the test meal was limiting in protein. Under basal conditions, steady state urea Ra is an accurate measure of urea production. Following changes in urea production, both the tracer and nontracer methods seriously underestimated total urea Ra.

Seed size differences among ten individual A. theophrasti plants significantly (P &lt; 0.001) affected seed germination and dormancy. Higher seed viability (98%) was observed among seeds having a weight above 6.0 mg. The response of A. theophrasti plants that originated from two extreme seed size groups (small &lt;7mg and large &gt;12mg) to the pathogen, C. coccodes, did not change over generations, and the most vigorous plants produced heavier seeds regardless of the initial seed size or infection with C. coccodes. Under field conditions, the application of C. coccodes and the herbicide, bentazon, did not affect the vegetative and reproductive biomass of A. theophrasti plants when grown in monospecific stands. However, a split application of C. coccodes and bentazon significantly reduced the aboveground biomass and reproductive output of A. theophrasti plants when grown in competition with soybean. The frequency distributions of A. theophrasti plant height, aboveground biomass, and stem diameter were positively skewed (L-shaped) when competing with soybean. However, A. theophrasti plant height and stem diameters were negatively skewed (J-shaped) and the aboveground biomass was positively skewed (L-shaped) in monospecific stands. The allometric relationships of A. theophrasti aboveground biomass and stem diameter in comparison with plant height were curvilinear when grown alone and when in the presence of soybean. However, aboveground biomass and stem diameter showed a simple linear relationship on a log-log scale in both monospecific stands and in competition with soybean.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Watson, Alan K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333399q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128c58z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Abutilon theophrasti -- Biological control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Colletotrichum coccodes</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hr39q"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Column flotation scaling up procedure in paper de-inking</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hernandez-Alvarez, Hugo Alberto</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As in mineral processing in the 1980's, column flotation technology has great potential in de-inking of waste paper. Although column flotation shows excellent brightness gain and ink removal efficiency, one problem is the lack of accepted scale-up and design procedure as in mineral flotation. Laboratory and pilot columns were operated on paper pulps to evaluate the effects of gas dispersion and mixing on scale-up. Gas dispersion properties were measured by gas holdup (epsilong), gas rate (Jg ) and the derived parameter, bubble surface area flux ( Sb). To calculate Sb, bubble size (db) was estimated from drift flux analysis. Direct measurement of db using a photographic technique supported the estimation. Mixing was modeled by relating the vessel dispersion number (Nd), determined from residence time distribution measurements made using a conductivity technique, to design and operating variables. From the mixing model, the pulp zone flotation rate constant ( kc) was determined from measured ink recovery vs. time data. The kc was correlated with gas dispersion and showed a linear dependence on Sb, supporting recent findings in mineral flotation. A linear relationship was also found with epsilon g. The improved reliability of scale-up achieved by incorporating the kc alpha Sb relationship is demonstrated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, James A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj01s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr39q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
