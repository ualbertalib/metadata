T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Because stem rust of wheat is of great economic importance, much attention has been given to its control, especially by means of resistant varieties. However, there is very little information upon the nature of this resistance. At the same time, there are several reasons for believing that the differences in resistance between varieties are due to differences in their chemical composition. So far, attempts to find a correlation between the resistance of plants and the presence of certain compounds in them have failed. This failure may possibly be explained by the dependence of resistance on the presence of compounds which may be difficult to detect owing to either their low concentration or their instability.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taurins, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rm932.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gm130</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
