The intensities are, respectively, 74%, 18%, and 8% as Judged by the graphical integration of the areas under the components. The existence of these components and the values of the end points are subject to confirmation by gamma ray and coincidence measurements. As the result of absorption measurements of the gamma rays in lead it is believed that the gamma radiation consists of three components with energies about 0.1 Mev., 0.2 Mev. and 0.8 Mev. respectively.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tj64c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sg834</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abn9999848"><ual:graduationDate>1948</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of erosion surfaces in the southern part of the Eastern Townships of Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stalker, A.

This part of the Appalachians in Canada is, in the main, a continuation of the Green Mountains of Vermont and is known as the Notre Dame Mountains. The System also includes the Sutton and Megantic Mountains. The Topographic Survey of Canada has published contour maps of this region on a scale of one mile to one inch, with a contour interval of twenty-five feet.

They had noted that, out of a group of about one hundred and twenty-five children whom they were treating, most responded well to treatment but a few responded poorly. All were receiving the same instructions and medications. The physicians believed that there might be social and/or emotional factors which hampered the response to treatment in certain cases. It was for this reason that they consulted the Social Service Department of the hospital in regard to a special review of these cases. This was the first opportunity for such co-operative work as the Social Service Department had been newly opened three months previously, after a lapse of five years.[...]</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074z25x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719q398</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wq994"><ual:graduationDate>1948</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Zoology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The biology of the Conularida</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sinclair, George Winston</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This is a study of the morphology and systematics of the order Conularida, as currently restricted, that is to the genus Conularia as generally thought of until 1928., This order consists of animals of unknown nature, now represented in rocks-of Palaeozoic age by phosphatic tubes which were their coverings in life. At one time the Conularida included a wide variety of more or less tubular shells, but some of these have been shown to be worms, others to be pteropods, and all the calcareous forms, Kyolithes, Tentaculites, Styliolina &amp;c., have been removed to other groups.
