Climatic conditions: Taking Canada for example, where there is no comparison between freight rates by sea and land, transportation of such a bulky commodity as coal, must necessarily be done during the summer months. The industrial demand for fuel is practically constant, yet the coal must be stored at hand to meet this demand throughout at least seven months of the year; this holds also for the railways. The demad for fuel for household use is also greatest during the winter months.
