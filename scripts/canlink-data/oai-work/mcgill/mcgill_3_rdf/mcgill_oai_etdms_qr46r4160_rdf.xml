Adult rabbit knees received 2 â€“ 12 weekly injections of hydrocortisone acetate and were sacrificed thereafter. Fissures and cysts occurred in the midzone of weight bearing joint areas. Their number increased with the amount of hydrocortisone given. A linear decrease of hexosamine to less than 50 percent after 12 injections was accompanied by a marginal change in DNA find hydroxyproline content. The synthesis of proteoglycans and proteins was reduced to one third, while the production of collagen dropped to less than 20 percent. The changes in thymidine incorporation were insignificant.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, N.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bf801.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r4160</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
