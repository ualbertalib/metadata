Under harsh acoustic conditions, LPC estimation can become unreliable. This results in poor quality of encoded speech and introduces annoying artifacts. The purpose of this thesis is to develop and test a two-branch speech enhancement pre-processing system. This system consists of two denoising blocks. One block will enhance the degraded speech for accurate LPC estimation. The second block will increase the perceptual quality of the speech to be coded. The goals of this research are two-fold---to design the second block, and to compare the performance of other denoising schemes in each of the two branches. Test results show that the two-branch system can provide better perceptual quality of coded speech over conventional one-branch (i.e., one denoising block) speech enhancement techniques under many noisy environments.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623j064m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jg629</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv935472n"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Comparison of respiratory sinus arrhythmia integration in athletes and non-athletes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Scott, Adrienne S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A comparison of heart rate viability and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) characteristics was performed in 20 athletes and 12 age-matched sedentary controls (CTRL) (22 +/- 2.4 yrs).

Conditions varied with regard to the presence or absence of distractors and their proximity to a target stimulus, and the presence or absence of a visual window within which the target stimulus was presented. Although the study yielded no significant results due to a lack of power, the mean correct reaction times (RTs) indicate that both the adults with Down syndrome and the typically developing children were less efficient at filtering close distractors as compared to far distractors or no distractors. As well, the results suggest that the presence of the visual window failed to facilitate performance in both groups. Further investigation is warranted to determine the status of visual filtering in persons with Down syndrome relative to their level of functioning at an MA level of approximately 5 years, a period that is critical in the development of attentional processes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burack, Jacob A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px788.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r0245</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Down syndrome</dc:subject><dc:subject>Visual perception</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adf65v962s"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The journey within : empathy and ontology in William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom! and Ingmar Bergman's Persona</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Holmgren, Lindsay</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>"The Journey Within" deals with how the receiver (reader/viewer) engages with the novel and the film. The thesis primarily focuses on Faulkner's novel, incorporating Persona largely as a means by which to illustrate the more carefully concealed reader-engagement strategies in Absalom, Absalom! Starting with a review of Faulkner criticism that opens itself up to this inquiry, the thesis leads into a detail study of the engagement strategies used to foster identification, alignment, sympathy, and empathy among receivers. Employing Umberto Eco's criticism involving "Model Readers" who "actualize" texts, as well as other reader and viewer response theory, I demonstrate that certain receivers experience a specific, heightened engagement with the work. This "Model" receiver restructures her ideologies to accord with what the work expects from her. Ultimately, this particular engagement leads to ontological participation in the work among its receivers. Martin Heidegger's phenomenological investigation, Being and Time, helps illustrate this ontological participation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ohlin, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dx16v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v962s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Faulkner, William, 1897-1962.

Allied propaganda therefore celebrated this battle, thus attracting adherents to the cause of "Fighting France", and aiding general de Gaulle's French National Committee in obtaining recognition from the British and American governments. General de Gaulle's challenge was to keep France at war so that France would participate in the Allied victory, offsetting the Vichy's government's collaboration. The legendary epic of the Free French Forces at Bir Hakeim is an important part of the myth, and the reality, of "Fighting France". While the official memory of "Free France" still celebrates the unity of Frenchmen under the banner of "the Cross of Lorraine", the soldiers at Bir Hakeim could not forget the franco-french tensions they experienced.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hellman, John</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hh34r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666633q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- Campaigns -- Libya</dc:subject><dc:subject>France combattante</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bir Hakeim, Battle of, Libya, 1942</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bn521"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Modifying adolescents' illusion of control : a manipulation of reinforcement schedules</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Herman, Jodi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research examined adolescent's cognitive perceptions of the amount of skill and luck involved in gambling and whether these perceptions could be modified through differential reinforcement schedules during a game of blackjack.

Goenka's technique of Vipassana meditation, an approach inspired by the Buddha designed for the liberation of human suffering, and constructive social engagement. The first chapter introduces the general field of Theravada Buddhist meditation practices to demonstrate how Goenka's approach conforms to and differs from traditional Theravada meditation. The second chapter provides an overview of Goenka's reformist movement, while the third chapter investigates his methods of dissemination and the supporting theories behind them in light of traditional Pali canonical sources. The final chapter examines the notion that social reparation depends on the alleviation of individual afllictive mental states. This claim is analysed through reports concerning the therapeutic effects of Vipassana on the practitioner, and through case-studies regarding the integration of the technique into the curriculums of various social institutions in the fields of health, corrections, and education.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayes, Richard</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn3013073.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547t26d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education, Religious</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30pv42r"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>State (under)development, transnational activism, and tribal resistance in India's Narmada valley</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gandhi, Ajay</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines how the Narmada damming project in India is constituted and contested by the state, affected tribal peoples ( adivasis), and a transnational advocacy network led by the Narmada Bachao Andolan (Save the Narmada Movement).

The transferrin receptor (TfR) is a cell membrane-associated protein that serves as a gatekeeper in regulating cellular uptake of Fe from transferrin (Tf) by TfR-mediated endocytosis. TfRs are expressed ubiquitously, but their highest levels of expression are on immature erythroid cells (which are the most avid consumers of Fe in the organism) and on rapidly dividing cells, both normal and malignant. In proliferating non-erythroid cells TfR expression is feedback inhibited by Fe through the interaction of specific binding proteins, iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), with iron responsive elements (IREs) in the 3 ' untranslated region (UTR) of TfR mRNA. However, results from our lab indicate that in differentiating murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, TfR expression responds only slightly to an increase in intracellular Fe. An explanation for this is lacking. Importantly, a second TfR (TfR2) has recently been cloned in humans. TfR2 is highly homologous with the classical receptor, TfR1 (except for the lack of IREs in the 3' UTR), and seems to have a similar function, but shows different tissue distribution. It has been speculated that TfR2 is expressed in erythroid cells since its message is abundant in K562 cells, a human cell line that can differentiate along an erythroid lineage, and can be induced to synthesize hemoglobin. Thus, it is important to determine whether TfR2 is expressed in erythroid cells, since this could possibly explain differences in TfR regulation in erythroid vs. non-erythroid cells. In this study, I have cloned mouse TfR2 (mTfR2) by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and sequenced it. The sequence analysis shows approximately 50% and 82% homology to mouse TfR1 and human TfR2, respectively. Tissue distribution of mTfR2, based on Northern blot analysis indicated that, in the mouse, TfR2 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the liver and its level increased about 2 fold after a</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ponka, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sc03w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dr365</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap2676x49g"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of the haemolymph protein apolipophorin-III on the antimicrobial responses of the insect Galleria mellonella to the bacterium, Bacillus subtilis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zakarian, Robert J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Apolipophorin-III (apoLp-III) is known to influence the haemocyte-mediated induction of antimicrobial peptides in Galleria mellonella and yeast phagocytosis, bind to Gram-negative and Gram positive bacteria and limit the activation of the haemocytes and the prophenoloxidase system by bacterial surface antigens. The effects of apoLp-III on haemocyte adhesion to glass slides and to bacteria were herein examined. ApoLp-III bound to haemocytes limiting the adhesion of both granular cells and plasmatocytes to glass and the contact of the plasmatocytes with Bacillus subtilis. The percentage of granular cells with bacteria was increased by the protein. However, the total number of bacteria adhering to haemocytes in vitro declined in the presence of apoLp-III. Bacterial removal from the haemolymph in vivo by the haemocytes was slowed by the protein. The adhesion of both the granular cells and plasmatocytes to slides was decreased by inhibiting protein tyrosine kinase and increased by inhibiting protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) activity. The latter was confirmed with haemocytes inhibited by the general PKC inhibitor H-7 using phorbol-3-myfstate (PMA) which, by activating PKC, diminished the adhesion of both haemocyte types. Limiting the formation of PKC activation by diacylglycerides which is produced by phosholipase C (PLC), using PLC inhibitor also increased haemocyte attachment. Although binding of B. subtilis to haemocytes decreased PKC activity, the effect of apoLp-III on PKC was inconclusive.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dunphy, Gary B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f772f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676x49g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bacillus subtilis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Apolipoproteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Greater wax moth -- Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax059c9305"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification of a novel protein associated with -dystroglycan in brain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhan, Yougen, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The dystroglycans, alpha and beta-dystroglycan, form the functional core of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex in skeletal muscle. beta-dystroglycan is associated with dystrophin inside the cell, and alpha-dystroglycan binds to laminin outside the cell, thus dystroglycan serves as a transmembrane linkage between the intracellular cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.

Are there novel interacting proteins with dystroglycan that might give it new functions? To address these questions, rabbit antisera against last 15 amino acids of beta-dystroglycan were raised. The affinity-purified antisera were tested by western blots and they recognize only a 43 kD dystroglycan band in brain extracts. Immunocytochemical methods were used to determine if dystroglycan is expressed in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.

Rosenblatt's (1978, 1994) transactional theory of the literary work provided a framework for conceptualizing the performed musical work as a musical event. Halliday's (1975, 1978, 1985) social theory of language use, particularly his notion of 'register' served as the framework for interpreting the intended meanings of conductors' utterances during rehearsals, and for understanding the dialogic nature of language use. Vygotsky's (1962, 1978) socio-psychological theory of the interdependence of thought and language framed my interpretation of the kinds of learning that might take place when student conductors use verbal language to shape performances of musical works. I transcribed 12 videotaped practica, analyzed the transcripts, and interpreted the function and focus of the student conductors' utterances. The findings revealed that the students selected formal and expressive elements for attention, that they used proposals and appraisals to shape these elements in a variety of rehearsal contexts, that they used verbal language to explain, explore, and clarify their musical thinking within and beyond rehearsals. I concluded that the student conductors built up the sense of the musical work with the players by selectively attending to the musical elements they deemed to be musically valuable, and that their verbal language served a mediating function for them both as shapers and as learners of musical ideas. Although there were qualitative differences how they engaged with their scores, and in their use of verbal language, the processes by which they engaged in construction and comprehension of musical meanings were the same and their verbal language played the same role. The study led to the postulatation of three socially situated theoretical constructs that are relevant to a general theory of music teaching and learning: a construct of a transactional theory of the musical work, a construct of a 'rehearsal register' and a construct of the interconnectedness of verbal language and the formation of musical concepts and musical knowledge.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maguire, Mary H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021g78z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mr486</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Conducting</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music -- Interpretation (Phrasing, dynamics, etc.)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17cv618"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Complex visual hallucinations associated with deficits in vision : the Charles Bonnet Syndrome</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Schultz, Geoffrey Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Charles Bonnet syndrome is characterized by complex visual hallucinations in people without psychopathology or disturbance of normal consciousness. This thesis highlights the association of visual deficits with the syndrome, and proposes that it is analogous to the perception of phantom limbs; both conditions arise when normal sensory input to the brain is severely reduced. The five studies that comprise this thesis systematically gather information on the syndrome to answer three basic questions: how can the hallucinations be classified, what are the clinical implications for individuals who experience them, and what might cause the hallucinations. Study 1 examines 64 cases described in the literature. Demographic information on the hallucinators, properties of the hallucinations, initiating factors, as well as etiological mechanisms are reviewed. Study 2 examines the properties of the hallucinations in a sample of 60 subjects and reveals, by statistical analysis, a dimension of the hallucinatory experience that ranges from discrete, singular perceptual experiences to multiple changing experiences. Studies 3 and 4 examine the mental status of hallucinators score within the normal range on tests of anxiety, depression, and psychological symptomology and exhibit no evidence of gross cognitive impairment. A detailed analysis of results show that a small proportion of hallucinators score within the normal range on tests of anxiety, depression, and psychological symptomology and exhibit no evidence of gross cognitive impairment. A detailed analysis of results show that a small proportion of hallucinators endorse comparatively more symptom-oriented items than the remainder of hallucinators, as well as more items non-hallucinators (in Study 4). Finally, Study 5 examines the performance of two hallucinating groups as well as a group of visually impaired non-hallucinating on threshold estimation and signal detection tasks.

Mice were fed zinc-sufficient (Zn+: 60mg zinc/kg diet), zinc-deficient (Zn$-$: 0.75 mg/kg) or pair-fed (PF) diets. Liver and serum zinc concentrations were reduced in Zn$-$ mice, but zinc content of worms was unaffected by host diet. Both zinc deficiency and energy restriction accelerated worm maturation during a primary infection, but zinc deficiency caused stunting of female worms. Energy restriction led to a anteriorad distribution of worms along the intestine whereas zinc deficiency led to a posteriorad distribution. Enhanced parasite survival in Zn$-$ and PF mice was associated with a decreased immune response in both primary and challenge infections. In the primary infection, spleen cell production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-$ gamma$), peripheral eosinophilia and serum levels of IgE and IgG1 were reduced by zinc deficiency, whereas the reduced delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response and impaired interleukin-5 (IL-5) production were attributed to energy restriction. In the challenge infection, reduced antibody levels (total IgE and IgG1, parasite-specific IgG1 and IgG3) and eosinophilia were attributed to zinc deficiency whereas the higher worm numbers were attributed to a combined effect of zinc deficiency and energy restriction. Although the absolute number of spleen cells was reduced in both Zn$-$ and PF mice, neither deficiency altered the proportion of the cell subpopulations. In vitro functional assays in response to parasite antigen (Ag) revealed that T cell proliferation was reduced by a direct effect of zinc deficiency on T cells, and by the effects of energy restriction on antigen presenting cells (APC). Impaired cytokine production in Zn$-$ mice was more complex. Zinc deficiency reduced T cell function (IL-4 production), energy restriction decreased T cell (IFN-$ gamma$ productio</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scott, M.

A series of four experiments with women, Asians, and Blacks examined how disadvantaged group numbers perceive the discrimination that confronts them. These experiments first established that disadvantaged group members sometimes perceive discrimination but more often, minimize the discrimination that is directed at them personally. Second, the results explain why disadvantaged group members are inclined to minimize their personal experience with discrimination, Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that by minimizing discrimination, disadvantaged group members protect their state self-esteem in the social domain, and maintain the perception of control over social and performance outcomes in their lives. Experiment 3 indicates that when there is any ambiguity about having been discriminated against, disadvantaged group members who are low in performance self-esteem but higher in social self-esteem are especially inclined to minimize personal discrimination. Experiment 4 further reveals that disadvantaged group members who are high in performance perceived control and high in social perceived control are particularly prone to minimize discrimination in an achievement context. Thus, disadvantaged group members minimize the discrimination that confronts them because the consequences of doing so, are, on balance, psychologically beneficial. Three of the four psychological processes associated with minimizing personal discrimination are those typically linked with better psychological adjustment: high social self-esteem, high performance perceived control, and high social perceived control.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taylor, Donald M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng223.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fn28p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Discrimination -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social perception</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self-esteem</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axk81jn06d"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Modulation of macrophage functions by components of Entamoeba histolytica</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Séguin, Rosanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite and the causative agent of amebiasis. Activated macrophages are the main host effector cells in host defence against E. histolytica, through the production of nitric oxide (NO) which is cytotoxic for the parasite. NO is upregulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$ alpha$) produced by macrophages. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of amebic components on TNF-$ alpha$ and NO production by macrophages. Soluble E. histolytica proteins stimulated naive macrophages for enhanced TNF-$ alpha$ mRNA expression through PKC signal transduction. E. histolytica-induced TNF-$ alpha$ mRNA expression was unstable, and macrophages pretreated with E. histolytica proteins expressed reduced levels of TNF-$ alpha$ mRNA in response to LPS or IFN-$ gamma$ + LPS. In contrast, the purified galactose-adherence lectin (Gal-lectin) of E. histolytica stimulated naive macrophages for stable TNF-$ alpha$ mRNA expression and protein production. Furthermore, IFN-$ gamma$ primed macrophages produced TNF-$ alpha$ and NO in response to the Gal-lectin. Naive macrophages exposed to Gal-lectin + IFN-$ gamma$ were activated to kill E. histolytica trophozoites in vitro by NO. Anti-lectin monoclonal antibodies that recognize non-overlapping epitopes of the kDa heavy subunit of the Gal-lectin identified amino acids 596-1082 as important in mediating amebic adherence to target cells and TNF-$ alpha$ mRNA induction in macrophages. Likewise, a region between amino acids 596-818 of the 170 kDa Gal-lectin, in conjunction with IFN-$ gamma$, activated macrophages for TNF-$ alpha$ and NO production and amebicidal activity. This research demonstrates the immunogenic potential of the E. histolytica Gal-lectin and the critical regions that could be used as a subunit vaccine candidate against amebiasis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chadee, Kris</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xb06t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jn06d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Entamoeba histolytica</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amebiasis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Macrophages</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agb19f7537"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hard diffractive scattering in photoproduction at HERA</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sinclair, Laurel E.

Cardiotoxic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs may be rate-related or due to intoxication, and may lead to serious and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. The goals of my research were (1) to study the mechanisms by which class IC antiarrhythmic drugs cause ventricular arrhythmias and (2) to explain the mechanisms of action of sodium salts in the reversal of class IC cardiotoxicity. We used flecainide (F) as a prototype of its class to study the mechanism of action of class IC antiarrhythmic agents (AA). Flecainide is a potent sodium channel blocker producing a major effect on conduction velocity and a minor effect on refractoriness. In vitro studies have shown that F causes frequency-dependent reduction of phase 0 upstroke of cardiac action potential (V$ rm sb{max}$) in ventricular tissue. Flecainide, in the physiologic range of heart rates and at clinically relevant concentrations, may produce rate-dependent effects because of its relatively slow binding and unbinding kinetics. We studied the effects of F in humans during exercise and showed that F produces an enhanced slowing of conduction when heart rate is increased, because of use-dependent sodium channel blockade. We demonstrated that a variety of class I AA produce use-dependent QRS prolongation in man with characteristic kinetics, which are similar to the kinetics of V$ sb{max}$ depression in vitro. We and others have reported proarrhythmic events associated with the rate-related cardiotoxicity of flecainide. Using a canine model of myocardial infarction, we showed the importance of previous myocardial infarction in flecainide-induced proarrhythmia. With epicardial mapping, we identified anisotropic reentry occurred in the mechanism for the ventricular arrhythmias. We reported that reentry occurred in the infarct zone around an arc of conduction block in the transverse direction. Cardiotoxicity associated with F includes severe conduction slowing and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Sodium salts have been found to reverse the effects caused by some class I antiarrhythmic agents (AA), but the mechanism of action is unknown. Using electrophysiological and biochemical studies, we investigated the role of extracellular sodium concentration ( (Na$ sp+ sb0$)) in modulating F's actions. In order to isolate the role of (Na$ sp+ sb0$), we used a range of (Na$ sp+ sb0$) and equimolar substitution with choline chloride. Our microelectrode experiments showed the ability of (Na$ sp+ sb0$) to modulate directly F's effects on the phase 0 upstroke (V$ rm sb{max}$). Our radioligand studies of displacement of ($ sp3$H) -batrachotoxinin A 20$ alpha$-benzoate ( ($ sp3$H) -BTXB) binding showed that this interaction was due to an effect of (Na$ sp+ sb0$ (on the binding of F to its receptor. We found that EC$ sb{50}$ values for depression of V$ rm sb{max}$ in electrophysiologic experiments and IC$ sb{50}$ values for flecainide displacement of ($ sp3$H) -BTXB in biochemical studies were highly correlated (r = 0.99). A limitation of our electrophysiologic study was the use of V$ rm sb{max}$ as an index of sodium current (I$ rm sb{Na}$). Using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique we found that increasing (Na$ sp+ sb0$) opposed F's blocking effect on I$ rm sb{Na}$, confirming the role of (Na$ sp+ sb0$ (.

Since these elements have high melting points and low diffusivities in molten aluminum, their dissolution rates are very slow, when they are added to aluminum melts. In order to improve the kinetics of dissolution, several alloying methods have been introduced. All methods of alloying use mechanical stirring of some form or other to enhance dissolution rates by promoting forced convective mass transfer. In the present study, a comparison between the kinetics of dissolution of iron and manganese when added to the melt as discrete alloying particles or as compact briquettes (consisting of alloying elements and aluminum particles) was carried out. This study revealed that exothermic reactions and the local accumulation of heat within the briquettes can accelerate the kinetics of the alloy-making process. Using the results obtained, a model for the dissolution of briquettes in molten baths of aluminum is proposed. Following disintegration of the briquettes into the melt, fine particles disperse freely into the bath, while their dissolution being controlled by mass transfer. To predict the dissolution rates, the relative velocity between fine particles entrained in the turbulent field and the fluid must be known. However, such velocities are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to clarify, since the particles will be moving erratically with a turbulent liquid, in which, random velocity fluctuations will be superimposed on mean bulk flow velocities. As such, the hydrodynamic interactions which control particle-fluid mass transfer in an agitated vessel are highly stochastic and impossible to predict, ab initio. In order to quantify such phenomena two theoretical approaches have been introduced by aqueous model researchers. In this investigation, for the first time, these theories have been evaluated for a high temperature liquid metal system involving the dissolution of alloying particles. In the evaluation of the terminal velocity theory in high temperature systems, water modelling experiments in conjunction with dimensional analysis between cold model and hot temperature system were carried out to study the entrainment behaviour of (heavy) alloying particles. Then, through continuous sampling of the melt, mass transfer coefficients and rates of dissolution of suspended particles in the melt were measured. A comparison between predicted values and measured results indicated that the terminal velocity theory, in conjunction with correlations proposed for aqueous systems, was not applicable to the high temperature alloying systems studied. In Kolmogoroff's theory of local isotropy, mass transfer in a turbulent system can be treated by a single parameter, i.e. energy dissipation rate. High temperature experiments revealed that this approach could be applied to stirred alloying particles-molten aluminum systems. However, at higher rates of mixing, when a fully suspended condition is reached, further increases in input mixing energy have negligible effects on dissolution rates. Thus, as a practical measure, very high mixing rates are not recommended. In this regard, a correlation for mass transfer coefficient as a function of the rate of input energy was presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guthrie, R. I.
