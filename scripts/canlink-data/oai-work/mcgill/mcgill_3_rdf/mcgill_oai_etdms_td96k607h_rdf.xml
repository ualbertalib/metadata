By definition, this study of the petroleum industry is limited in many respects, and must be viewed as only a partial analysis of the pricing of petroleum products and the impact of this pricing on the economy. This study is concerned with the demand for two refined petroleum products - motor gasoline and heating oils. A complete study of the pricing of petroleum products would involve the consideration of the demands for the many other refined petroleum products, as well as an examination of the many and varied supply factors within the industry.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Culliton, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fs491.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k607h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
