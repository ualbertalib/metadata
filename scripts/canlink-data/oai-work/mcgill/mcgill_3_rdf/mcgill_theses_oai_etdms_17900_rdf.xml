It is now increasingly being applied to any excited state of the nucleus whose lifetime has been measured. Nuclear isomerism was first discovered by Hahn in 1921 and since then about 150 examples have been reported with half lives ranging from 5 years to lo-14 seconds.

No density in other countries can compare with it. The population of Hong Kong has increased since the war due to major political events in the Far East that have lead to a large scale migration from China. The population increase has been augmented by a rapidly rising birth rate. In 1954 there was an excess of births over deaths of 1,000 a week in the Colony, and the Government estimates that in ten years this excess may well reach 80,000 a year.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Spence-Sales, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860b54s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d3655</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117s60s"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Design of high-pass acoustic filters with special reference to aircraft engine exhaust manifolds</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kubina, S.

In spite of their use for over one hundred years, the design of Bourdon tubes is still a trial and error procedure. In the study, the leading theories of flat oval Bourdon tube deflection are reviewed and compared with test data. A Bourdon tube design procedure based on test results, is recommended minimizing the number of test samples required to develop a new tube, and the directions of future research are indicated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Edis, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977z71r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65vc30x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bourdon tubes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mechanical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bt05d"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of prestressed concrete</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Issen, Lionel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Almost from the beginning of the use of reinforced concrete as a structural material, attempts were made to improve the quality and strength of the material by applying prestressing forces. In a patent applied for in 1886 entitled "Constructions of Artificial Stone and Concrete Pavements", P. H. Jackson of San Francisco described several methods of applying prestress forces by stretching ties by turnbuckles, screws and nuts and wedges. Later in 1888 C. F. W. Doehring in Germany, and in 1896 J. Mandl in Austria secured patents for applications of steel and concrete that may quite properly be described as prestressed concrete.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>De Stein, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65vc316.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bt05d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20sx57j"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of the spontaneous ignition delay of hot lean mixtures of gaseous hydrocarbon fuels and air in a flow system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Irwin, Roland. E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A new apparatus was designed and built to study the ignition delay of propane and other gaseous fuels when injected into a stream of air heated above the spontaneous ignition temperature of the fuel under study. The apparatus was designed to achieve a homogeneous fuel/air mixture as quickly as possible in order that the ignition delay due to the chemical reactions of combustion primarily might be studied. The study was confined to the lean mixture range up to about one half of stoichiometric. Although the apparatus requires further development and the method of interpretation was cumbersome indications are that the chemical ignition delay does follow an exponential law of the Arrhenius type.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thompson, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128f71x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sx57j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mechanical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mr17f"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on chlorpromazine in experimental haemorrhagic shock in dogs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Inglis, Frederic.

Even in recent times the word has been applied non-specifically to conditions such as syncope due to mental anguish, affects of trauma, both accidental and operative as well as the well-recognized and specific state which results from prolonged loss of effective circulating blood volume. According to Moon (68) the first accurate description of the shock syndrome was recorded by Dr. Samuel Gross in 1872.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webster, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d570125k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mr17f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73q083q"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite of various bacteria</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Idziak, Edmund.

Comparisons or disinfectant compounds were and still are necessary not only for the advancement or knowledge, but also as part of our society or tree enterprise. Thus, when Microbiology became a science, methods were established for testing these disinfectants with various organisms. At the beginning, such comparisons, as made by Koch and others, were unsuitable because they did not take into consideration factors that might affect the efficiency of the disinfectants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wallace, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kx53x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73q083q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural Bacteriology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p096b762"><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular size and configuration of cellulose trinitrate in solution</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Huque, Mohammed.
