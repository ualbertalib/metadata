R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Some critics appreciate the early plays of W.B. Yeats for their lyric beauties and ignore or deprecate the later, more dramatic works because in them dramatic values have replaced the lyric element to a large extent. Others suggest that the plays are not dramatic enough. T. R. Henn, for instance, is of the opinion that the last plays must be considered as dramatic poems. The general tendency has been to ignore Yeats as a dramatist while extolling his genius as a poet.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Walker, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pv47p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gp943</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82kc33b"><ual:graduationDate>1956</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Literature</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Character-portrayal in the ‘Cena Trimalchionis’ of Petronius</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brown, Carl. E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Gaius Petronius, a description of whom Tacitus has left in his Annals, is considered by most scholars to be the author of the Satyricon, the work containing the Cena Trimalchionis. Although most of his life was passed in idleness and luxury, Petronius possessed great ability. This he proved as proconsul of Bithynia and later as consul. An authority on pleasure, he became a close companion of Nero's. His influence with the emperor, however, aroused the jealousy of Tigellinus.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Counsell, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z485n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82kc33b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Classics</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
