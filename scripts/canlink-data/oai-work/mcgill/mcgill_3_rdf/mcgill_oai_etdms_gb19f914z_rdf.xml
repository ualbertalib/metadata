Each condition included two tasks which were requested 15 consecutive times. Subjects demonstrated they could perform the tasks before testing, and their responses were scored according to the similarity between the response and the request. Results demonstrated the autistic and behavior-disturbed subjects responded similarly except when requests required verbal responses, in which case the autistic group was much more negative. The results were suggested as having many direct applications in clinical diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, as well as having implications for understanding the language characteristics of autistic children. Areas for further research were discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Doehring, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731707n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f914z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human Communications Disorders</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
