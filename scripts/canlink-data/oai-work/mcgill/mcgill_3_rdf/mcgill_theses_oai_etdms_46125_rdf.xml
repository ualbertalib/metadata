The development of new experimental technique for making these measurements had, of course, a theoretical objective, viz. an elucidation of the equilibria existing in these systems, especially as there is an intensely practical side to this elucidation. To make this clear it is necessary to elaborate on previous investigations undertaken in this laboratory which culminated in the work to be described.

On the quantitative side progress has not been so marked, the calculation of reaction rates from the properties of the reactant substances apparently having been considered somewhat too hopeless a task to be attempted.

The observed decrease of the current with time has been shown to be due to the growth of a back voltage in the crystal. In these crystals a reverse current flows when the crystal is illuminated, without an external field, shortly after the passageof a photocurrent. This reverse current has been shown to be an ordinary photoelectric current due to the back voltage.
