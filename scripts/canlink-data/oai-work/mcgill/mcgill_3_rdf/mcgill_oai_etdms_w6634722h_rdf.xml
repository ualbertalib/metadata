Traditional sources of occupational orientation and guidance such as parents, relatives, teachers and friends no longer suffice because the choice of a career has become more and more complex. This complexity is due to increasing differentiation within occupations and to the level of training and skill required to enter many occupations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Younge, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hd46g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634722h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
