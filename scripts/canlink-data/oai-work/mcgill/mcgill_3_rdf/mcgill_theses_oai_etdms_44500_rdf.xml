The  model is based on the solution of the 3D time-averaged turbulent momentum  (Navier-Stokes) and energy equations. The momentum equations are modified with a  Darcy-type source term to simulate motion of the melt in the mushy region. The  buoyancy force term is implemented in the model through the Boussinesq  approximation. The low Reynolds number k-Îµ turbulence model of Launder and  Sharma is used to calculate the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent heat fluxes. A  variable heat transfer coefficient is used along the ingot surface to account for  the different cooling regions. The mathematical model is qualitatively and  quantitatively verified by comparing the computed results with a physical water  model and a real casting experiment, respectively of independent researchers. Each  of the comparisons showed a good agreement. The quantitative verification of the  solidification front depths is improved when the thermal buoyancy force effect is  included in the model. A parametric study has been carried on two casters of variable  aspect ratio each using a different type of inlet melt distribution system. In the  case of the small aspect ratio caster, the physical properties of aluminum Al-3104  are used. For this caster, the studied parameters are the casting speed, the primary  cooling rate, the melt superheat and the combo-bag dimensions. Also, the effect of  complete blockage of the bottom windows of the distribution bag is studied. An  in-depth understanding of some behaviors of the melt flow and solidification profile  in the steady state operational phase of the DC casting process is gained. For  example, the roles played by the angle flow and the upward component of the vertical  recirculation at the wide symmetry plane in controlling both the solidification  front depth and the mushy layer thickness at the slab center are ascertained. This  study has revealed the influence of the melt stream issued from the bottom window of  the bag on the depth and uniformity of the solidification front. The model has  successfully identified a faulty design of the short combo bag. This industrially  favorite design causes what is called the reverse flow, that is, the melt from the  surrounding sump enters the combo bag through the bottom window.

This process has two components: (i)  specification of a 3D template brain, which defines a common coordinate space for  analysis of any subsequent datasets; and (ii) a method to align the template with an  individual 3D brain image, thereby associating each point of the standard template  to a point on the individual. The association should be able to consistently match a  particular template location to an anatomically corresponding location on each  individual of a population. Standardization methods in widespread use employ a 3D affine  spatial transformation to map from the individual to the template, which matches  only overall size and gross shape of the input brain. A wide range of more flexible  image deformation algorithms have been developed in order to better match fine  detail. All such algorithms involve design choices that are subject to debate, and  most have numerical parameters whose value must be specified by the user. In order  to provide guidance for such choices, the first part of this thesis develops two  measures of alignment consistency that are used to evaluate performance of a  standardization method. The performance of different choices for algorithm design,  numerical parameters, and template selection strategy for 3D normalization are  compared. Since the processing of brain function occurs on a thin, highly  convoluted sheet of cortex along the surface of the brain, there has been much  recent interest in studying the structure and function along the brain cortex only,  modelled as a 2D manifold. The second part of this thesis proposes an algorithm for  highly-flexible deformation in 2D of a template cortex to an individual. The  alignment consistency measures developed for 3D are reformulated for the 2D manifold  and used to evaluate the algorithm design and numerical parameters. Finally, the  question of whether it is better to standardize the 3D images or the 2D cortical  manifold is addressed, identifying the problem classes which are best suited to each  type of normalization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Evans, Alan</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Whitesides, Sue</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sq62q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v594h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6682x4473"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of medium versus long chain triglyceride consumption on energy expenditure, substrate oxidation and body composition in overweight men and women</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>St-Onge, Marie-Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) have long been advocated as  potential weight-lowering agents or potential tools in the treatment and prevention  of human obesity. These statements have been made after findings from human and  animal trials that consumption of MCT increases energy expenditure and fat oxidation  compared to long chain triglycerides (LCT). In addition, animal studies have  resulted in lower body weight gain and smaller fat depots when animals were fed MCT  compared to those fed LCT. However, long-term controlled trials studying the effects  of consumption of MCT in humans have not been conducted and the longest trial to  date, 14 d of duration, has shown that the effect of MCT on energy expenditure may  be transient. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether, in controlled feeding  conditions, consumption of MCT for 4 wk would lead to differences in energy  expenditure and substrate oxidation versus consumption of an isocaloric diet rich in  LCT. Furthermore, our aim was to establish whether consumption of MCT for 4 wk would  lead to greater changes in body composition than would LCT consumption. We conducted  two randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trials involving overweight women and  men to test our objectives. A secondary objective was to examine the potential  satiating effect of MCT, and this was tested in men. Finally, a third objective was  to determine whether, when combined with phytosterols and flaxseed oil, MCT  consumption would result in different blood lipid profile compared to LCT. Nineteen  healthy overweight women and 24 healthy overweight men participated in two separate  randomized controlled trials to test these objectives. Energy expenditure and body  composition were assessed at the beginning and end of each experimental phases,  which differed only in the type of fat included in the controlled diets. Blood  samples were also taken at baseline and endpoint of each phase to determine plasma  lipid concentrations.

One such activity, which has gained momentum  and interest in recent years, is the dissemination of a vision. This thesis is an  attempt to investigate the nature of the visioning process in organizational  leadership through theoretical analysis and empirical investigation. An analysis of the visioning process yielded two important  components: the visioning activity and the visioning product. Based on this analysis  and a review of the existing literature, vision was defined as a product with  content and the visioning activity a two-stage process involving vision formulation  and vision articulation. Building on these definitions, a number of vision content  characteristics and visioning behaviors were examined, leading to theoretical  propositions and testable hypotheses. The empirical test of the proposed theoretical framework was  carried out in two studies. Study 1 investigated observers' perceptions of leader  behaviors, vision content characteristics and related attributions of vision and  visionary leadership. This study was conducted using analyses of biographical and  autobiographical accounts. Study 2 sought to replicate the investigation with direct  observations from followers of "real-life" organizational  leaders. The empirical test substantiated the importance of  distinguishing between the various content characteristics of visions as they relate  to attributions of vision and visionary leadership on the part of  observers/followers. The empirical results also support the importance of  distinguishing between the various components of the visioning activity of leaders  as they relate to attributions of vision and visionary leadership on the part of  observers/followers. Finally, the results suggest distinct relationships between the  attributions of vision/visionary leadership and various effects of the visioning  process on followers. In light of these results, suggestions for future research and  implications for leadership practice are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kanungo, Rabindra N.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Jorgensen, Jan</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h247h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp42g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Leadership</dc:subject><dc:subject>Charisma (Personality trait)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Executive ability</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct39j"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Modulation of medial entorhinal cortex layer II neurons by two cation non-specific currents : IH and INCM</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shalinsky, Mark Howard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neurons from layer II of the entorhinal cortex (EC} occupy a  pivotal position in the medial temporal lobe gating the flow of neocortical  information into the hippocampus. Previous "in vivo" studies had shown  that EC layer II generates theta rhythmicity, and "in vitro"  investigations have demonstrated that the main population of layer II projection  neurons, the stellate cells, display intrinsic theta-like autopacemaker properties.  EC layer II cells receive important subcortical serotoninergic and cholinergic input  from the dorsal raphe and basal forebrain, respectively, and these inputs are known  to affect the population oscillatory behaviour of cortical neurons, including the  "theta" rhythm. Using pharmacological and voltage-clamp techniques in the  EC slice preparation, the ionic mechanisms that contribute to the generation of  intrinsic oscillations in the layer II stellate cells, and whether this mechanism  was affected by serotoninergic neuromodulatory influences was investigated. As well,  the aspects of how cholinergic muscarinic actions depolarize EC layer II neurons and  may affect the oscillatory firing properties of these cells were also investigated.  This Thesis confirmed that EC layer II stellate cells display a robust  time-dependent inward rectification and demonstrated that this rectification is  generated by a hyperpolarization activated non-specific inward cation current known  as IH. I H, in conjunction with a low threshold persistent Na+ current was  established to play a crucial role in the generation of the theta-like subthreshold  oscillations. Next, similar to other cortical neurons, serotonin enhances IH by  producing a small but significant positive shift in its activation curve. Finally,  and with respect to cholinergic actions, the mechanism of cholinergic depolarization  consists of both the block of a K+ conductance and, primarily, the activation of a  noise non-specific cationic conductance, distinct from IH, named I NCM.

Despite long-term commercial and horticultural use of the auxin  Indole-3-Butyric Acid (IBA), a full recognition of its natural occurrence in plants  was made only recently. I have used multiple approaches to dissect the role of IBA  in Arabidopsis thaliana. This thesis includes the first characterization of a mutant  with an altered response to IBA that retains wild-type sensitivity to  Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA), the most studied endogenous auxin. This mutant, named  resistant to IBA ( rib1), has modified root architecture and  gravitropism and is resistant to auxin transport inhibitors. As these phenotypes are  reminiscent of those of characterized auxin transport mutants, movement of IAA and  IBA was studied in wild-type and mutant plants. IBA is transported in seedlings in  three distinct flows, like IAA, and this transport is saturable, indicating it is  carrier mediated. However, unlike IAA, IBA is not polarly transported in  inflorescence axes, and IBA transport is not sensitive to IAA transport inhibitors.  These results suggest IAA and IBA transport could be mediated or regulated by  different mechanisms. In rib1 seedlings, all flows of IBA transport are modified,  while IAA transport levels are unchanged. Modifications in IBA transport match  phenotypic differences between rib1 and wild-type, and analyses of the physiological  effects of IBA also suggest IBA has a role in defining wild-type seedling morphology  in Arabidopsis. Though IAA transport levels are not changed in rib1, one flow of IAA  transport is rendered insensitive to IAA transport inhibitors, perhaps revealing  cross-talk between IAA and IBA transport regulation. Additionally, double mutant  analyses reveal that IAA transport and response mutants can suppress some phenotypes  of rib1, and some mutant combinations produce novel phenotypes, further suggesting  cross-talk between IBA and IAA transport and response p</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lasko, Paul</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Waddell, Candace S.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472w951.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935346t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plant growth promoting substances</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arabidopsis thaliana -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Auxin</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zt861"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Central circulatory adaptations to low and high intensity cycling in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Souza, Melissa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by  an expiratory flow limitation, as well as an evident reduced exercise capacity  compared to that of healthy age-matched individuals. Clearly, the expiratory flow  limitation plays a significant role in this exercise intolerance; however, the  extent of the contributions of other systemic factors remains unclear. More  specifically, there is little data thus far on the role of blood flow delivery as a  possible exercise limitation in COPD, especially in light of the potential  interactions between cardiac output (Qc) and pulmonary hyperinflation. Thus, the  purpose of this study was to compare the slope of the Qc versus oxygen uptake (VO 2)  response through several submaximal cycling loads in patients with moderately severe  COPD with that of age-matched healthy control subjects (CTRL). Also examined was the  possibility that ventilatory constraints such as dynamic hyperinflation contribute  to an abnormal Qc response. Cardiac output was measured using the CO2-rebreathing  equilibrium technique during baseline conditions and cycling at 20, 40 and 65% of  peak power in 17 COPD (Age: 64 +/- 8 yrs; FEV1/FVC: 37 +/- 11%; FEV1: 41 +/- 15%  predicted) and 10 age-matched CTRL subjects. Inspiratory capacity (IC) was also  measured for the determination of dynamic hyperinflation during the steady state  exercise bouts. The results indicate that while the absolute Qc values are lower in  COPD than in CTRL during moderately intense (65% peak power) cycling (11.30 +/- 2.38  vs. 15.63 +/- 2.15 Lâmin -1, p &lt; 0.01), likely due to their lower  exercise metabolic demand, the Qc/VO2 response to increasing levels of exercise  intensity is normal or hyperdynamic in COPD. Indeed, the majority of patients with  COPD exhibited Qc/VO2 slopes greater than 7.0, which may be indicative of a  peripheral muscle bioenergetic disturbance that may drive the need for greater  oxygen delivery, and thus result in an exaggerated ce</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w37637378.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zt861</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lungs -- Diseases, Obstructive</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cycling</dc:subject><dc:subject>Blood -- Circulation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abn999722v"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Long-term timing of two young, energetic pulsars</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Livingstone, Margaret Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We report on the long-term phase-coherent timing of two young,  energetic pulsars, PSR B1509-58 and PSR B0540-69, using data from the Rossi X-ray  Timing Explorer, the Parkes Radio Telescope and the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis  Telescope. We present fully phase-coherent timing analyses of both sources, and show  that contamination from timing noise can significantly affect measured timing  parameters. As a result, we also present, a partially phase-coherent timing analysis  which is less sensitive to timing noise. We present an updated measurement of n = 2.839 +/- 0.003 for PSR  B1509-58, and we report a measurement of the second braking index, m = 18.3 +/- 2.9,  in agreement with the prediction from the simple model of pulsar spin-down. We also  examine changes in dispersion measure and present an analysis of the noise,  measuring a low-resolution power spectrum corresponding to a spectral index of beta  = -4.6 +/- 1.0. This implies that the noise cannot be explained by a pure random  walk. We also show that no glitches have occurred in 21.3 yr, implying that this  pulsar glitches less often than typical young pulsars. We measure the braking index for PSR B0540-69, n = 2.140 +/-  0.009 and discuss our measurement in the context of other discordant values reported  in the literature. In addition, we detect evidence for a glitch which has been  previously reported but later disputed.

Thus, it can be deteriorated rapidly after harvest resulting in high  loss and poorer produce quality. Sweet corn's sugar loss is about four times higher  at 10Â°C compared to 0Â°C. Precooling, immediately after harvest, has  shown to be an effective method to maintain the quality for a wide range of fresh  fruits and vegetables during storage. Further, this method leads to reduction in  metabolism and respiration rate of the produce, retardation of its senescence, and  inhibition of growth of pathogens. In addition to diminishing postharvest losses of  the produce, efficient precooling is required for increasing the length of duration  of marketing time for better profitability. Precooling of sweet corn was accomplished by three main methods  including forced-air, water and vacuum cooling. Operating parameters such as  temperature, pressure, orientation of corn cobs, air flow rate and water flow  pattern were defined and studied for optimization. The assessment and comparison of  the performance of precooling systems was achieved by determining the effect of  these parameters on half cooling time and quality of the produce during storage for  7 and 21 days at 1Â°C and 90-95% RH. In addition, room cooling method was  also tested and compared to the three precooling systems. The use of three sweet  corn cultivars was important to compare their quality response to different cooling  methods. Experiments were performed on a lab-scale vacuum cooler and  modified forced-air and water cooler systems. The results showed that changing the  cob orientation perpendicular to the direction of flow medium, using higher air flow  rate in forced-air cooling and immersed water flow pattern in water cooling, can  significantly reduce the half cooling time of the produce. Finally, the best method  to be recommended for precooling sweet corn is by using hydrocooling which results  in superior quality produce and minimum time.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r30c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q6909</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sweet corn -- Postharvest losses -- Prevention</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sweet corn -- Precooling</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870w37z"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>With dads around, kids are sound : assessing the effects of a fathers' support program with military fathers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mayer, Jeremy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this study was to learn more about the experience of  Canadian military fathers who participated in a fathers' support group entitled  "With Dads Around, Kids Are Sound."

The arachidonic acid  (AA) generated by cPLA2 action appears to function as a second messenger in ASP  signaling. ASP also blocks TG breakdown. The calcium-independent PLA2  (iPLA2) zeta has recently been identified as a novel TG-lipase in 3T3-L1 cells.  Bromoenol lactone (BEL), a non-reversible iPLA2 inhibitor, has been shown to  specifically inhibit the TG-lipase activity of this enzyme. Preliminary data  demonstrates that BEL stimulates basal TG synthesis, likely by inhibiting TG  breakdown. The effects of BEL in combination with ASP are non-additive, suggesting  they act through the same pathway. Furthermore, ASP appears to inhibit 3H-AA release  into the media in a concentration-dependent manner.

A cross sectional survey with 152 students ages 12-16 years from  grades 8-10 was conducted in a Montreal public secondary school in September 2004.  Three empirically validated tools were used: the UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell et  al., 1980), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (Zimet et al.,  1988), and the Bullying - Fighting and Victimization Scale (Espelage and Holt,  2001). Results of regression analysis indicated that absence of family and friends'  support and victimization are highly significant predictors of adolescent loneliness  (p â¤ .001). There remains a need to increase support available for  victimized and lonely adolescents at school, at home, and in the  community.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w032356b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw33g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social networks</dc:subject><dc:subject>Loneliness in adolescence</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bullying</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289j47h"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Creating animated mosaic videos</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liu, Yunjun, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Animated mosaics are a traditional form of stop-motion animation  created by arranging and rearranging small objects or tiles from frame to frame.

One of the major clinical concerns is the generation of UHMWPE  particles leading to periprosthetic osteolysis. Because of their low volumetric wear  rate, metal-on-metal bearings have emerged as an alternative. However, metal  particles and ions released from metal hip prostheses due to wear and corrosion have  been essential concerns for the orthopaedic community. In fact, several clinical  studies have demonstrated elevated concentrations of metal ions in the systemic  circulation and in the surrounding tissues in patient having a  cobalt-chrome-molybdenum prosthesis. Moreover, cobalt and chromium ions are known  for their potential to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a Fenton-type  reaction, making them prime suspects for disturbing the cellular balance of  oxidants/anti-oxidants, and thus creating irreversible damage to the cell. Indeed,  recent studies demonstrated that Co2+ and Cr3+ induced cell mortality and oxidation  of proteins in macrophages. However, little is known about the effects of these ions  on the osteogenic cells, which have a crucial role in controlling bone remodeling.  The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Co2+ and Cr 3+ ions in  human MG-63 osteoblast-like cells. Our studies demonstrated that Co2+ and Cr3+ ions decreased the  number of living cells and reduced the cellular activity of MG-63 osteoblasts.  Likewise, microscopic observations revealed clear changes in terms of shape, size,  and number of cells. Furthermore, Co2+ seems more toxic than Cr3+. Western blot  analysis showed the induction of protein oxidation and protein nitration, which are  biomarkers of oxidative stress, in a dose- and time-dependent manner with both ions.  Antioxidant enzymes were also affected by the presence of ions, but in varying ways.  HO-1 expression reached 6.0 and 1.9 times the control after 24h with 10 ppm Co2+ and  150 ppm Cr3+, respectively before decreasing thereafter. GPx expression was  increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner by Co2+ and Cr3+. CAT  expression was decreased in the presence of Co2+ and up-reguated with  Cr3+. In conslusion, our results suggest that Co2+ and Cr 3+ are  cytotoxic, which may include creation of ROS that disturb the cellular oxidative  state of MG-63 osteoblasts. The stimulation of antioxidant enzymes does not seem  sufficient to prevent cell death.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z9030451.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h252c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811kk131"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Depth of field enhancement of a particle analyzer microscope using wave-front coding</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sanyal, Poulomi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis we present an analytical solution to the problem  of improving the depth of field (DOF) of a certain large magnification imaging  system with a high numerical aperture (NA), illuminated with an incoherent source of  light. As there is a definite trade-off between the focal depth and resolution  achievable with such a system, our challenge was to find a system that would achieve  both these objectives and at the same time be cost-effective and easy to  implement. Our choice of technique therefore was a novel optical wave front  manipulation mechanism involving subsequent image restoration via digital post  processing. This technique is known as wave front coding. The coding is achieved  with the help an optical element known as a phase plate and then the coded image is  electronically restored with the help of a digital post-processing  filter. The three steps involved in achieving our desired goal were,  modeling the imaging system to be studied and studying its characteristics before  DOF enhancement, designing the phase plate and finally, choosing and designing the  appropriate decoding filter. After an appropriate phase plate was modeled, it was  incorporated into the pre-existing optics and subsequently optimized. The  intermediate image produced by the resulting system was then studied for defocus  performance. Finally, the intermediate image was restored using a digital filter and  studied once again for DOF characteristics. Other factors, like optical aberrations  that might limit system performance were also taken into  consideration. In the end a simpler and cost-effective method of fabricating  the suggested phase plate for single-wavelength operation was suggested. The results  of our simulations were promising and sufficiently high resolution imaging was  achievable within the entire enhanced DOF region of +/-200 mum from the point of  best focus. The DOF without coding was around +/-50 mum, but with coding the spot  size remained fairly constant over the entire 400 mum deep region of interest. Thus  a 4 times increase in the overall system DOF was achieved due to wave front  coding.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257f68r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kk131</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50gw73f"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Exploring microwave assisted rock breakage for possible space mining applications</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Satish, Hemanth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As humanity prepares to migrate to the frontiers of the Moon and  other planets, the area of mining in space must go along for the purpose of  exploration and in-situ resource utilization. In the present work the literature  that has been developed over the years in the area of mining in space as applicable  to Lunar and Martian environments is reviewed. Subsequently, the key mining  technologies that are most suitable for Lunar and Martian environments are  identified. From the literature review, it is concluded that an optimal combination  of both mechanical methods and novel energy (lasers, microwaves, nuclear energy)  methods for rock destruction drawing a trade off between the energy and mass would  be the most ideal option for space applications. One such technique of applying low power microwaves to the rocks  to thermally weaken them without actually melting them before employing mechanical  methods of rock destruction is investigated. Finite element simulations were carried  out to simulate microwave heating of a calcareous rock to determine the temperature  profiles and thermal stresses at different microwave heating times and powers.  Preliminary experiments were carried out in order to determine the microwave  susceptibility of terrestrial basalt (which has similar composition as Lunar and  Martian rocks). Temperature and strength of the rock sample before and after  microwaving was measured. The results of the finite element simulation indicated that a  calcareous rock with microwave responsive phase and a microwave non-responsive phase  developed thermal stresses of large magnitudes exceeding the actual strength of the  rock. The simulation methodology can be applied to other rock types as well,  provided the thermal, electrical and structural properties of constituent mineral  phases are available. The preliminary experimental results showed that the basalt rock  specimens used were quite susceptible to the low power microwaves. There was a  decreasing trend in terms of the point load index of the rock samples as the  microwaving exposure times were increased, with some rock samples showing visible  cracks at higher microwaving times.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042t57g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gw73f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290998c"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Test core for on-chip metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitance measurement</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Salib, Philippe G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work is motivated by the need for test cores for advanced  CMOS processes characterization, which is a key factor in process-design coupling  for yield and reliability in production ramp-up. The physical properties of the  Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) structure makes of it a diagnostic tool for  determining process parameters related to the technology used in the fabrication of  Integrated Circuits (IC). This thesis covers a study of the existing techniques used  to extract the MOS Capacitor (MOSCAP) Capacitance-versus-Voltage (C-V) curve for  determining certain characterization parameters. It adds to those techniques a  System-On-IC (SOIC) approach by providing a self-contained test structure that only  requires external clock generators and biasing circuitry. This test structure makes  use of a novel technique based on Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) for generating an  on-chip voltage ramp to drive the MOSCAP. The generated current is converted to  voltage then amplified and captured using a complex implementation of a Successive  Approximation Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The output data is a binary-coded  8-bit representation of the scaled voltage-versus-time curve, which can be  translated to the C-V curve by determining the voltage ramp slope from the  generator's clocks' frequencies. As this circuit structure requires mostly digital  logic, the proposed system will take advantage of future down-scaling of digital  integrated circuit technology. The proposed technique is verified with FPGA  implementations and an IC prototype presented in this thesis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wd25k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290998c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axw42n851t"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Efficient algorithms for computing distances between one-dimensional point sets</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Colannino, Justin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Let S and T denote sets of points on the line with the total  number of points equal to n. In this thesis the focus is on computing distance  measures between S and T as defined by different types of assignments . An  assignment is a function, F, which pairs elements of the two sets together. In  particular, we are interested in the distances given by two types of assignment.  When F is a surjection between the sets, the surjection distance minimizes the sum  of the costs of the pairings. When the assignment is restricted only by the property  that all elements in both sets must be paired at least once, the corresponding  distance measure is referred to as the link distance. After a review of the  literature on assignments, including an in depth description of a foundational  result for assignments on the line published by Karp and Li in 1975, new algorithms  are presented which improve the computational complexity of both the surjection and  link distances for one-dimensional sets. In 2003 Ben-Dor et al. proposed a O(n log  n) algorithm for the surjection distance in one-dimension. We provide a  counter-example to their algorithm as well as a new algorithm which has a complexity  of O(n 2), improving the previous best O(n3) result of Eiter and Mannila. Our  algorithm for the link distance in one-dimension also runs in O(n 2) time, improving  the previous best complexity of O(n 3) also due to Eiter and  Mannila.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623d13w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42n851t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w526z"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Approximation methods for the BER performance : analysis of wireless communications systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fonseca E., Otto</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Performance evaluation is a critical stage in the design of  every communications system.

The method is based on numerical optimization of the parameters  of finite series whose mean values can be calculated easily. To that end, a new  error measure that addresses specific needs of the approximations needed for  communications problems is proposed as the cost function of the optimization  procedure. To illustrate the proposed method, we consider two  representative cases: Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) transmissions over  Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI)-inducing channels and adaptive Code Division  Multiple Access (CDMA) linear receivers. Specific low computational complexity  expressions are provided for the BER performance of these systems. It is  demonstrated by numerical studies that the derived expressions provide satisfactory  accuracy, and can outperform previously proposed methods.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375w82q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w526z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s295k"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Computational material science of carboncarbon : composites based on carbonaceous mesophase matrices</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gupta, Gaurav</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Carbon/Carbon composites belong to the generic class of fiber  reinforced composites and are widely used because of their high strength as well as  chemical and thermal stability.

This focus, however, is not only a  representation of what he sees, but is also an attempt to order things to a  political and ethical end. Using the major works of Michel Foucault ( The Order of  Things, The History of Sexuality), the thesis demonstrates how Where the Finest  Young Men... (1987) and Authentic Decor (1988), may be interpreted as achieving a  fundamental ordering and representation of desire. In particular, the thesis shows  how Lukacs intervenes on existing codes and conventions of culture through  heterotopia, and how he articulates political, sexual, and ethical choices through a  concept of self-forming ethics. If one is to situate Lukacs' work within the dynamic of  heterotopia, and support the claim that these paintings not only intercede on  existing codes and conventions, but also manifest ethical choices, then one ought to  read the work against a prior understanding of sexual politics proper to the art  historical and socio-political moment of the 1970s. The basis of that historical  glance is established through the work of General Idea and notions of sexual  identity. The sensuosity and pleasure characteristic of mass media entertainment  formats, such as beauty pageants and variety shows, is similar to that featured in  much of General Idea's work created throughout the 1970s. Importantly, the  aesthetics that General Idea embraces in their brand of performance art increasingly  becomes evident at the end of the 1970s, with the emergence of the New Painting. An  assessment of the so-called "return of painting from exile"---as it  appeared in Italy, Germany, and Canada---considers the output of Lukacs'  contemporaries. The intention there is to establish whether a newer focus exists in  the work of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which supports the hypothesis that what  Lukacs aims to do is to order things to a political and ethical end. Upon setting  forth an examination of the framework in which Lukacs appears, the dissertation then  presents a highly detailed analysis of Where the Finest Young Men... and Authentic  Decor, with particular focus on the function of heterotopia in these works. Finally,  an explication of power and ethics in Lukacs is proposed through the later works of  Michel Foucault, in order to demonstrate how, teleologically, the paintings operate  as political, sexual, and ethical choices.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ross, Christine</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45q948m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz8060305</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Power (Social sciences) in art</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex in art</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lukacs, Attila Richard, 1962-</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
