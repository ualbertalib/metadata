The central issue in this study is the relationship between readers' responses to writing and the goals and values of an organization. The particular focus of the study is managers' responses while reading their subordinates' reports. Conducted over two years in a large company that develops and markets health care products, this study used a variety of qualitative methods. Observations, interviews, and the critical incident method revealed that organizational expectations for writing were closely tied to the organization's mission and its beliefs about how that mission should be accomplished. Respond-aloud protocols from two divisions of the company, Marketing and Management Information Systems, demonstrated that managers' responses while reading their subordinates' reports strongly reflected their beliefs about the particular mandates of their divisions. Furthermore, these protocols also revealed how the divisional cultures reflected the larger framework of the organization. These findings suggest that writers must learn both the organizational and divisional goals and values in order to write reports that meet readers' expectations. Moreover, this study illustrates the importance of readers' responses to the development of theories about writing in the workplace.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dias, Patrick X.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xw564.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr171z76n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Business writing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0v8382118"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The philosophy and social thought of Alfred Fouillée</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Good, Robert, 1959-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Classical scholar and historian of philosophy at France's Ecole Normale Superieure, Alfred Fouillee (1838-1912) heralded the science of psychology as philosophers' sole path to social and political relevance in the modern age, and sought for French society the philosophically based morale that her polarized political tradition seemed unable to provide. His theory of idees-forces identified rationality with an irreducible yet conscious will, lent precision philosophical idealism's often vague exaltation of individual freedom, and promoted psychologically informed discussions about the proper ideals for the French Third Republic. Examined here is the evolution of Fouillee's thought from his earliest writings until his death: the genesis and elaboration of his idealist psychology, its later extension to social and ethical thought, Fouillee's defense of the classical lycee curriculum, and his repudiation of both unphilosophical sociology and the "anti-intellectualism" of the early twentieth century. Alert to both science's potential and its limitations, Fouillee held that modernizing societies like France would adequately define social justice and individual dignity only by joining ancient philosophy's metaphysical impulse and public spiritedness with modernity's liberal precepts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hellman, John W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f279w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v8382118</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fouillée, Alfred, 1838-1912</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x2965"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Transcendental faith</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Grundy, Jeremy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Following the general view of faith provided by Paul Tillich as 'the state of being ultimately concerned,' the present work provides a topography of faith that is designed to reveal the intimate connections between faith and the development of personal identity. As the state of Being-for-one's-ultimate-concern, it is a person's faith which molds and shapes her own unique self, providing depth, direction, and unity to her life. My understanding of faith is that it must be living faith, like living tissue, and this is true in the obvious sense that it is a life lived. Starting from the view that no individual's existence is self-justifying, what is presented is an existential analysis of our actual encounters with faith, brought to show up through the individual's active struggle in responding to the call of her own question-begging existence.

Recent data suggest that anxiety sensitivity (fear of anxiety) may be one common underlying vailable contributing to the large degree of overlap between the panic-related disorders and alcoholism. In fact, some data indicate that the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and alcohol misuse may be particularly strong in women, a group which is generally underrepresented in the alcoholism etiology literature. Research described in this thesis was conducted with the aim of further elucidating the nature of the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and alcohol use/abuse in young adult women. The series of seven experiments included in this thesis demonstrated that: (1) high levels of anxiety sensitivity are characteristic of subjects meeting diagnostic criteria for panic disorder, an anxiety disorder frequently associated with alcohol abuse; (2) female university students demonstrate significantly higher average levels of anxiety sensitivity than male university students; (3) anxiety sensitivity is an important predictor of self-reported rates of alcohol consumption in university women; (4) high anxiety sensitive university students are both more likely to report drinking alcohol primarily to "cope" with negative emotional states, and less likely to report drinking alcohol primarily for social-affiliative motives, than are low anxiety sensitive university students; (5) high anxiety sensitive women display greater degrees of sober subjective-emotional arousal when anticipating aversive stimulation, greater degrees of sober electrodermal reactivity to the aversive stimulation, and greater sensitivity to the dampening effects of alcohol on these measures of reactivity, than low anxiety sensitive controls; (6) high anxiety sensitive women show a sober attentional bias favoring the processing of physically threatening information, which is dampened through th</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pihl, Robert O.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dn89t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n270m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Alcoholism -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Young women -- Alcohol use</dc:subject><dc:subject>Panic disorders</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afq977w57h"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Multifractal objective analysis, rain and clouds</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tessier, Yves</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The study of rain and clouds, even after centuries of research, is still a subject whose theoretical basis is obscure. A major cause of this problem is the extreme variability. The multiplicative cascade models employed in the study of turbulence lead to fields presenting the desired variability over wide range of scales. The fields produced with these models havae scale invariant properties expressed by a function specifying the way each statistical moment is transformed from one scale to the other; they are multifractal. It was proposed to consider rain and clouds as turbulent fields, thus providing a physical basis to statistical modeling of these fields. During this work, we wanted to empirically establish the applicability of these models. We established the range of scales where scale invariance is observed, we determined the transformation functions and established the limits of the model for various fields related to atmospheric water. This verification is further complicated by the inhomogeneity of the measuring networks employed to gather data. In fact, the positions of landmasses, topography and economic constraints have resulted in networks which are not distributed on regular grids (as it might seem desirable) but on the contrary which presents holes at all scales. In fact, it has been shown that such networks are fractals. Rather, we will consider the station density as a multifractal. Multifractal fields analyzed by multifractal networks, this brings us to review the problem of removing the effect of the network from the measured data (the problem of Objective Analysis). The method that we propose (Multifractal Objective Analysis) replaces the homogeneity and regularity hypothesis more or less implicit in usual methods like Kriging by inhomogeneity and scaling hypothesis. It is then possible to develop corrections which allow us to study the multifractal properties of the analyzed field from the measured field.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lovejoy, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rg03n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977w57h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4f16c428c"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Centre for Medical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Knowledge, understanding, and attitudes of family planning by Iranian males</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tavakoli, Reza</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Rapid population growth is now one of the biggest socio-economic and consequently, health problems in the world. The significance of this dramatic increase in population becomes apparent when the limited possibilities of socio-economic growth are considered among developing countries. The use of modern contraceptives in order to control birth rates, on the other hand, is rather limited in these countries. The present study investigates the knowledge and attitudes of family planning programs by Iranian males, who play a major role in all familial decision-making, including the practice of family planning. This research examines subjects' reasoning strategies about practicing family planning. A sample of sixty laborers with various levels of formal education were selected and some methods developed within the domain of cognitive psychology were used in analyzing the data. The results showed that males, as proposed, play a vital role in decision-making regarding the practice of family planning. Formal education appears to have no significant impact on the subjects' knowledge and attitudes toward issues of family planning. Furthermore, early age of marriage, particularly with respect to the girls, appears to be an accepted phenomenon and has strong roots in the belief systems of the population. This research has implications for developing educational programs in the domain of health. It is proposed that future research should devote considerable effort to better understand the role of the males in the process of decision-making regarding the practice of family planning.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Patel, Vimla L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j2714.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c428c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Birth control -- Iran</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g435j"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The conversion of ammonia, phenol and pyruvate into tyrosine by the use of the tyrosine phenol-lyase activity of microencapsulated Erwinia Herbicola</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lloyd-George, Ian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL)-E.C. 4.1.99.2-activity of free and alginate-polylysine-alginate microencapsulated whole cells of Erwinia herbicola, was used to convert ammonia, pyruvate and phenol or catechol into L-tyrosine of dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-dopa). This conversion could serve as the basis of a novel system for the removal of toxic ammonia and phenol from the blood during liver failure. It was found that there were endogenous modifiers in the whole cell TPL system, hence the kinetic parameters vary with the amount of cells in the system. However typically the apparent $ rm K sb{M}$ for tyrosine varied from 0.2 mM to 0.28 mM, while that of phenol was 0.5 mM. Whole cell TPL can display kinetics of great complexity, suggesting that the enzyme is likely to be a tetramer. The effect of process variables on the relative strength of alginate-PLL-alginate microcapsules can be conveniently assessed by entrapping blue dextran (Mwt 2.0 $ times$ 10$ sp6$) within the microcapsules and then agitating them within a rotary shaker.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chang, T.

The effects of modification and/or heat treatment on the microstructure and the mechanical properties of 356 alloy have been investigated on both permanent mold and sand cast samples. Strontium (0.02%) and sodium (0.01%) were used to produce well modified microstructures. The importance of the amount of modifier used was also examined in producing castings with 0.002% Sr and 0.08% Sr. Production parameters such as solution heat treatment time and artificial aging time were examined. Microstructural assessment was done by quantitative metallography using image analysis coupled to SEM while mechanical testing comprised tensile testing, hardness and microhardness measurements as well as impact tests. The greatest improvement in mechanical properties obtained with modification was observed for the lower rates of solidification, i.e sand casting. The effect of modification on the heat treatment response of 356 alloy was investigated. The differences between unmodified and modified microstructures were more important in sand cast samples than in permanent mold cast samples. After one hour of solution heat treatment at 540$ sp circ$C, both permanent mold unmodified and modified microstructures became similar in terms of silicon particle size and sphericity. The processes which led to this were different. Silicon platelets in the unmodified structures segmented while silicon particles in the modified alloy coarsened. The final result was however the same. In sand cast alloy, the initial microstructural differences persisted after up to 12 hours of solution treatment. The coarser the initial as-cast microstructure, the greater the improvements associated with modification and heat treatment. It was also found that porosity caused by modification can negate many of the microstructural benefits by decreasing tensile strength and percent elongation. It was demonstrated that modification also has an influence on the aluminum matrix. The hardness of modified alloy was found to be less after the T6 temper than in unmodified alloy. This was reflected in a lower yield strength of modified 356 alloy. Quantitative microstructure-mechanical property relationships were established for the permanent mold samples. The best silicon-structure characteristics to predict the tensile properties were found to be the particle count per unit area and the particle area. It was also determined that hardness can be a simple and inexpensive means whereby ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of 356 alloy in the T4 condition or T6 condition can be estimated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gruzleski, J.

Typically, the coupling is in the form of magnetic/thermal, magnetic/structural, magnetic/electronic, or possibly a combination of several disciplines. Computer based tools exist for many of these engineering specializations but they are usually "stand-alone" and each requires an experienced designer to use it effectively. This requirement for an expert user places a major constraint on the design cycle, and a lack of communication between the various experts can result in major design errors. This thesis proposes a software architecture that is capable of providing loose coupling between currently available design tools and of absorbing new tools in the future. The structure provides an integration environment for a suite of design programs. The environment automatically allows the iterative solution of coupled problems by loosely coupling individual tools through a comprehensive database and organizing their execution via a rule-based control program. In order to effectively integrate a diverse set of tools and to define the kind of coupling between the various analyses, it is necessary that the input and output requirements of each tool be carefully defined. The BlackBoard for Computational Analysis and Design (BBCAD) is a hybrid knowledge-based system which uses the blackboard architecture, and generates a systematic method of integrating the "stand-alone" design tools, together with an automatic method of ensuring that, if a change is made to the design, all the relevant design tools are re-run.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lowther, D.

In the period since 1980 we find an explosion into theological diversity and maturity, marked by serious wrestling with all the social problems facing Africans in contemporary African life. Since 1980 there is a proliferation of new Christological paradigms, and increased inter-religious tensions have brought new urgency to inter-faith dialogue, with a growing number of theological responses. An explosion in the numbers of African women theologians brings a new voice on women's roles. Economic and ecological crises bring increasing reflexion on justice, peace and the integrity of creation. The paradigmatic diversity is strongly linked with changes in the concrete social conditions in which the various theologians live. This discovery confirms the thesis that theology in Africa is always related to social context.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baum, Gregory</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397976f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644t090</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Christian sociology -- Africa</dc:subject><dc:subject>Theology -- Africa -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63sx39b"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of yeast cap binding proteins</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Goyer, Charles</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The prominent role played by the cap structure in ribosome binding is mediated by the cap binding protein complex (eIF-4F).

The results were compared with those for paper dried in a similar fashion by direct contact with hot air. It was found that the results depended on the type of pulp from which the sheet was made. For thermomechanical pulp sheets, superheated steam drying resulted in improved strength properties; burst index, tensile index and elastic modulus were 20-30% higher relative to the air dried sheets. The increase in strength was found to be due to an increase in bonded area, especially of the fine fraction, caused by the higher sheet temperatures occurring in the constant rate period of steam drying. As a result of the increased bonding but not due to any color change, brightness of the steam dried sheet decreased by 5 points. Steam drying of TMP sheets results in strength and optical properties more characteristic of paper made from CTMP. Superheated steam drying of kraft pulp sheets had a smaller and opposite effect, as strength properties decreased and optical properties increased relative to the properties of sheets dried in air. Unlike mechanical pulp, no increase in bonded area was observed because of the already high bonding potential of kraft fibres; a thermally induced drying stress relaxation is thought to be the cause of the decreased strength properties.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mujumdar, A.

Patriarchal practices that shaped the initial palace layout at vernacular domestic and state levels are outlined. Royal women were secluded and male slaves occupied public household domains, state strongholds. Later increases in eunuchs' and slave women's powers and spaces are also recorded. The demise of slave women's political realms and the rise of an autocratic and militaristic male state structure following the Fulani jihad of 1807 are then detailed. Lastly, the impact of British imperialism on the landscape of male and female slavery is presented. Because male slaves were placed publicly, they were the main receivers and negotiators of colonial change, and their spaces underwent the most forceful change. Throughout the analyses, landscapes are seen as politically created and communicative material structures. Examination of epistemological relations used in landscape analyses demonstrates important linkages between how field research is structured and relations of power.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kobayashi, Audrey</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zs35m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515p84k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kano (Nigeria) -- Court and courtiers -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kano State (Nigeria) -- Court and courtiers -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gidan Rumfa -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vj31d"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Representations and occupations : shepherds' choices in Sardinia</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ayora Díaz, Steffan Igor</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Telemula, a highland village of Sardinia, Italy, the concept of 'modernity' has been assigned a positive moral meaning which is used in opposition to the concept of 'tradition'.

Alternative representations of shepherds carry different moral connotations. Villagers who have to decide whether or not to become, or to continue to be shepherds, also wish to represent themselves positively. Thus, they manipulate the meanings which had been originally ascribed by national and supranational agencies, but that currently form part of the locals' world-views. In consequence, individuals participate in the multiplication of life-worlds and codes of meaning that they use in organising their own perceptions of life events and reflexive experience of self.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Salzman, Philip C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g4373.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vj31d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Shepherds -- Italy -- Sardinia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sardinia (Italy) -- Rural conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Rural -- Italy -- Sardinia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xt250"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Topographic mapping of the brain activity of gifted children</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Coffin, Lorraine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The study compared the brain electrical activity of two groups of gifted children between the ages of 9 and 13 years.

Chapter 1 analyses the relationship between surface temperature and vegetation indices, obtained from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer on board of NOAA-9 and -10 satellites, and fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and CO$ sb2$, estimated from aircraft. Linear relationships between CO$ sb2$ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or the Simple Ratio vegetation index (SR) are found on a daily basis, but a highly nonlinear relationship appears for the seasonal variation. Latent Heat fluxes showed the poorest correlations with surface parameters. A seasonal linear relationship appeared between sensible heat and NDVI. Local extreme flux values due to the intermittency of boundary layer dynamics largely contribute to lower the correlations; such variations are the reason for the difficulties in relating fluxes obtained from single overpasses and over short distances to fixed points at the surface. This problem is further examined in Chapter 2, in which conditional sampling of airborne flux estimates is used to characterize the turbulent structures that are carrying flux, and their link to the surface. The analysis confirms that few extreme events may carry a significant fraction of the flux. Missing or hitting one of these structures may translate into very large oscillations on the flux estimate that are often not directly coupled to surface characteristics. A much clearer surface 'signature' emerges when measurements are taken within the surface layer, since the reorganization of turbulent structures that takes place with increasing height will result in a merging of the signature that came from different sources at the surface. This helps to explain some of the poor correlations obtained in Chapter 1 and reinforces the need for a better understanding of the distributions of these tu</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schuepp, Peter H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m819h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v9454</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eddy flux</dc:subject><dc:subject>Terrestrial heat flow</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atmospheric carbon dioxide</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water vapor transport</dc:subject><dc:subject>Remote sensing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hd74b"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structure and properties of a myristoyl-transferase from luminescent bacteria</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ferri, Stefano Roberto Michele</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The acyltransferase subunit of the lux-specific fatty acid reductase complex was found to specifically divert myristic acid from fatty acid biosynthesis to the luminescence system. Determination and analysis of the enzyme's primary structure revealed structural similarities with eukaryotic acyl chain terminating enzymes, including the presence of the serine hydrolase consensus sequence G-$X sb1$-S-$X sb2$-G. Chemical modification and determination of kinetic properties of the transferase, as well as site-directed mutagenesis lead to the identification of Ser-79 and His-244 in the active site. Although this is reminiscent of the catalytic triad of serine proteases and lipases, preliminary results indicate the possible involvement of a second serine residue in a potentially unique mechanism. Luminescence was restored in dim mutants of Vibrio harveyi by the mobilization of fatty acid reductase genes from V. harveyi as well as P. phosphoreum. Functional hybrid fatty acid reductase complexes were thus constructed in vivo and were useful in demonstrating channelling among the subunits. This mobilization system was also employed to obtain large quantities of transferase, which lead to the production of several X-ray quality crystals. Determination of the structure and properties of the lux-specific transferase may have important consequences for our understanding of the molecular basis of the final stages of fatty acid biosynthesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Meighen, E.

La technique de la spectroscopie de modulation de polarisation en réflexion infrarouge (PM-IRRAS) fut efficacement utilisée pour cet objectif. Il fut observé que la cinétique d‟adsorption du BSA sur une surface de 316LVM est fortement dépendante sur le potentiel de surface. Lorsque le potentiel de surface augmente, les valeurs de plus en plus négatives, le taux d‟adsorption initiale de BSA ainsique sa concentration de surface saturée croissent également.

A technique of polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) was efficiently employed for this purpose.  The kinetics of BSA adsorption on the 316LVM surface was found to greatly depend on the surface potential. With an increase in surface potential towards more negative values, both the BSA initial adsorption rate and the saturated surface concentration of BSA also increase. Both effects were explained predominantly on the basis of replacement of well-ordered water molecules at the 316LVM/solution interface.  Equilibrium experiments showed that the adsorption of BSA on the 316LVM surface is a highly spontaneous process, characterized by a highly negative apparent Gibbs energy of adsorption. The process was described using the Langmuir isotherm. With an increase in surface potential towards negative values, the apparent Gibbs energy of BSA adsorption also increases, as well as the saturated surface (monolayer) concentration. This effect was also explained on the basis of replacement of well-ordered water molecules at the 316LVM/solution interface.  It was demonstrated that the adsorption of BSA on the 316LVM surface is a reversible process. The adsorbed BSA monolayer can be spontaneously desorbed at open circuit potential, but the kinetics of this process is slow. However, by cathodically polarizing the surface in the potential region of hydrogen evolution, the rate of the BSA desorption process can be significantly increased.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sasha Omanovic</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731548g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cc44c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gf61x"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Synthesis and characterization of folate-PEG-conjugated polysaccharide nanoparticles for potential use as a targeted DNA carrier</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Houng, Simone</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Le design d’un transporteur efficace pour le largage du matériel génétique ayant à la fois un bon potentiel de transfection ainsi que des bonnes propriétés physicochimiques et biologiques telles que la biocompatibilité, non-immunogénicité et non-toxicité, suscite beaucoup d’intérêt en recherche biomédicale.

In previous work, the PAW’s controller used fixed touchdown and liftoff angles to achieve a stable bounding gait, and these angles were predetermined through an extensive trial and error process.  In this work, an intelligent velocity controller is developed to allow the robot to autonomously find the touchdown and liftoff angles to bound at a desired velocity. This enables the robot to track desired velocities between 0.9 and 1.3 m/s, as shown in a Matlab-Adams co-simulation model of bounding. The controller also demonstrates tracking capabilities in the presence of minor terrain changes. To implement this controller on the physical platform, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is developed to estimate the forward velocity of the robot required as a controller input. The EKF combines the data from an Inertial Measurement Unit and an estimate of forward velocity found kinematically using measurements from motor encoders and leg potentiometers. The accuracy of the EKF estimate of the forward velocity is validated in simulation and using high speed camera experiments. Finally, the intelligent controller is implemented and tested on the physical platform demonstrating adequate velocity tracking for set points between 0.9 m/s and 1.3 m/s, as well as transitions between set points in this range.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Le « Platform for Ambulating Wheels » (PAW) est un robot quadrupède qui possède des roues au bout de ses quatre jambes.

Exposure was measured across 6 antipsychotic drug groups: clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, low-potency typical drugs and other typical drugs. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the risk of diabetes after exposure, adjusting for age at study entry, sex, obesity before drug initiation, schizophrenia and entry year. Results: Risk of diabetes associated with one more standard monthly dose was significantly higher for: clozapine (RR 1.14 (95% C.I.: 1.04, 1.24)); olanzapine (1.09 (1.04, 1.14)) and low potency typicals (1.08 (1.03, 1.13)).  Conclusions: Consistent with many prior studies, clozapine, olanzapine and low potency typical drugs pose a higher risk for diabetes than other antipsychotic drugs. This risk also increases with dosage.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Objectif:  Comparer les risques de developper le diabète de type 2 après l'initiation de différents antipsychotiques.Méthodes: L'étude inclut les adultes bénéficiares de l'aide sociale au Québec qui ont obtenu une ordonnance pour un antipsychotique entre 1993 et 2004.  L'exposition a été mesurée dans 6 groupes d'antipsychotiques: la clozapine, l'olanzapine, la quétiapine, la rispéridone, des médicaments typiques à faible teneur et d'autres médicaments typiques. Des modèles "Cox proportional hazard" ont été employés pour estimer le risque de diabète contrôlant pour l'âge lors de l’entrée à l'étude, le sexe, l'obésité avant l'initiation des médicaments, la schizophrénie et l'année de l'accès. Résultats: Le risque de diabète associé à un mois supplémentaire à dose standard était plus elévé pour les médicaments suivants: clozapine (RR 1.14 (95% C.I.: 1.04, 1.24)); olanzapine (1.09 (1.04, 1.14)) et les antipsychotiques typiques à faible teneur (1.08 (1.03, 1.13)). Conclusions: En accord avec plusieurs études antérieures la clozapine, l'olanzapine et les antipsychotiques à faible teneur présentent un risque pour le diabète plus élevé que les autres antipsychotiques. Le risque augmente aussi avec la dose.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eric A.
