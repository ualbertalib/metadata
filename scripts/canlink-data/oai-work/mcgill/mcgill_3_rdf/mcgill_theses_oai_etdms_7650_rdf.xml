These investigations show that field tests, as ordinarily conducted, are subject to large errors from different sources. One source of error is the variation of soil productivity due to differences in composition, fertility, and other factors.

This is particularly true of that section of the country extending from the Great Lakes to the Rocky Mountains, or the whole of the central plains region.Throughout this entire district the production of apples is restricted to that of a very few hardy varieties of Russian origin, and to crabs, because of the impossibility of growing standard varieties owing to their susceptibility to winter killing.

When Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence in 1535 he found that the Indians were already growing corn in cultivated patches around Hochelaga. With the white man came the cultivation of wheat, a plant unknown on the North American Continent, for the first crop ever grown ini Canada was raised there in the same year.
