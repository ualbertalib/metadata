Similar to traditional or manufacturing processes, knowledge  processes need to be managed and controlled in order to provide the expected results  for which they were designed. During the last decade, the principals of process  management have evolved, especially through work done in software engineering and  workflow management. Process monitoring is one of the major components for any  process management system. There have been efforts to design process control and  monitoring systems; however, no integrated system has yet been developed as a  "generic intelligent system shell". In this dissertation, an architecture  for an integrated process monitoring system (IPMS) is developed, whereby the  end-to-end activities of a process can be automatically measured and evaluated. In  order to achieve this goal, various components of the IPMS and the interrelationship  among these components are designed. Furthermore, a comprehensive study on the available  methodologies and techniques revealed that sparse data estimation (SDE) is the key  component of the IPMS which does not yet exist. Consequently, a series of algorithms  and methodologies are developed as the basis for the sparse data estimation of  knowledge based processes. Finally, a series of computer programs demonstrate the  feasibility and functionality of the proposed approach when applied to a sample  process. The sparse data estimation method is successful for not only knowledge  based processes, but also for any process, and indeed for any set of activities that  can be modeled as a network.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pn35x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jp142</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Industrial</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rt83z"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Immunemodulatory effects of hypertonic saline in hemorrhagic shock : in vivo alterations of neutrophil-endothelial dynamics and vascular permeability result in attenuated tissue injury</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pascual Lopez, José L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Multiple organ dysfunction is the most common cause of late  mortality in trauma patients. Despite adequate resuscitation, hemorrhagic shock may  progress to a state of profound systemic inflammation where the polymorphonuclear  neutrophil (PMN) plays a key role. Resuscitation with hypertonic saline (HTS) may  modulate the host inflammatory response in hemorrhagic shock. A murine hemorrhagic shock model evaluated by cremaster  intravital microscopy demonstrated significant in vivo attenuation of neutrophil  rolling and adhesion to endothelium (EC) immediately after resuscitation with HTS,  as compared to Ringer's lactate (RL). Concurrently, macromolecular leakage from the  same post capillary venules was 45% lower in HTS animals. To better simulate clinical conditions, the model was  transformed to recreate two-hit conditions by subjecting resuscitated animals to a  subsequent mimicked pulmonary infection. Attenuated neutrophil adhesion to  endothelium in HTS animals persisted 5 and 22 hours after resuscitation.  Additionally, compared to RL, HTS resuscitation reduced neutrophil lung  sequestration (by the myeloperoxidase assay) and neutrophil lung transmigration (by  histologic analysis) one day after resuscitation. HTS resuscitation also tended to  improve cremaster and lung histologic injury a day after resuscitation conferring a  50% survival advantage for that time interval. To determine if reductions in tissue injury were due to the  ability of HTS to functionally block neutrophil adhesion to endothelium, another  variation to the two-hit model was developed. Two additional groups were added to  evaluate if supplementation of standard fluid resuscitation with anti adhesion  monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD11b and anti-ICAM-1) would reproduce the effects of  HTS alone. Although early EC/PMN interactions and 24-hour lung PMN accumulation were  similarly attenuated by either HTS alone or RL with anti adhesion blockade, only HTS  alone definitely reduced early in vivo macromolecule leakage, and one day lung  histologic injury. Hemorrhagic shock resuscitation with hypertonic saline reduces  neutrophil activation and interactions with microvascular endothelium resulting in  diminished lung PMN sequestration persisting well beyond the initial resuscitation  phase. Yet the anti-adhesive effects of HTS are not essential for HTS-mediated  reductions in tissue injury and organ dysfunction. Hypertonic resuscitation may  prove to be an immunomodulatory therapy useful in critically ill trauma victims, the  precise mechanisms of which need further elucidation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613mz038.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rt83z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v3567"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Role of IL-12 and IL-18 in regulation of eosinophil function in allergic airway inflammation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nutku, Turkan Esra</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Tissue eosinophilia is a prominent feature of allergic  inflammatory diseases that may be in part mediated through the regulation of  eosinophil survival at inflammatory site. T helper 2 type cytokines, such as  interleukin (IL)-5, Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), are  the important mediators of allergic inflammation leading to prolonged survival of  eosinophils. Due to the proposed central role of eosinophils in asthma and other  allergic airway diseases, there is considerable interest, to determine the  mechanisms that regulate eosinophil functions and accumulation. IL-12 and IL-18  attract considerable attention for their immunomodulatory roles on T helper cell  subsets, and their potential to affect on eosinophil function. The general aim of this study was to determine the effect of  IL-12 and IL-18 on eosinophil functions. Results from this thesis demonstrate that  eosinophils express functional receptors for IL-12 and IL-18. Acting alone or in  synergy, IL-12 and IL-18 induced eosinophil apoptosis, in vitro. The apoptotic  effect of IL-12 was reversed by IL-5, suggesting that IL-5 and IL-12 have  counter-regulatory effects on eosinophil survival. Our regulation studies  demonstrated that Phorbol-Myristate-Acetate (PMA) induced optimal expression of  IL-18 and IL-12 receptors by eosinophils. IL-18 receptor expression by eosinophils  was markedly increased following stimulation with interferon (IFN)-gamma, Tumor  Necrosis Factor (TNF), or IL-12. Up-regulation of IL-18 receptor upon IL-12  stimulation was particularly important, which may explain IL-12 and IL-18 synergy on  eosinophil apoptosis. We also investigated IL-12 and IL-18 expression by  eosinophils. Eosinophils did not express IL-18. However, there was constitutive  IL-12 expression by eosinophils. Release of IL-12 was also confirmed in eosinophil  supernatants, which suggested an autocrine mechanism of IL-12 action on  eosinophils. Extending our understanding of the role of IL-12 and IL-18 in  allergic inflammation, we have defined a novel pathway by which IL-12 and/or IL-18  may actually regulate eosinophils functions, and exert an inhibitory effect on  eosinophil survival. Our findings provide critical new insights into mechanisms  regulating eosinophil survival. To gain an even more detailed understanding of  regulatory signals mediating eosinophil survival, we need to define the mechanisms  involved in IL-12 and IL-18 signalling. We have just begun to identify the molecules  involved, and these include IL-12 and IL-18 receptors. Activation via IL-12 and/or  IL-18 receptor-mediated mechanisms may provide a novel strategy for reducing the  numbers or inhibiting the function of these cells in allergic diseases or other  diseases characterized by increased numbers of, or mediators from,  eosinophils.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p2909930.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v3567</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gd45b"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La compénétration des ordres normatifs : étude des rapports entre les ordres normatifs religieux et étatiques en France et au Québec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Saris, Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Opting for an applied theory approach, this thesis addresses various means of "compenetration" between religious normative orders and normative orders of the Quebec and French States. Based on a constructivist vision of law and on the impact of post-modernism, the thesis draws out a typology of pluralisms used in legislation with the aim to understand religious normativity (institutionalized pluralism and integrated pluralism), and distinguishes between four types of religious normativity invoked before the civil law judge, that is: the religious normativity of the State; the formal non-State religious normativity; the informal, community-based non-State religious normativity; and the personal and ethical non-State religious normativity. After having noted the refusal of the principle of institutionalized pluralism in France and in Quebec, namely, the rejection of direct application, as such, of the religious normativity by the judge, and highlighting its exceptions resulting in particular from the mechanisms of private international law, this thesis studies the tools available to the civil law judge to take into consideration religious normativity. Here it concerns the facets of integrated pluralism which finds expression, in particular, through standards contained in the rules of civil law and in the fundamental right (civil liberty in France and subjective right in Quebec) of freedom of religion. The thesis points to the persuasive role of the civil law judge in the functioning of integrated pluralism and the elaboration of a common normativity by consensus. The thesis insists on the procedural techniques that can be implemented to accept or refuse the integration of "foreigness" of norms and the "otherness" of values in its legal order and notes that the articulation of religious and State normativity can give rise to schemes of eviction and balance. The thesis concludes by the response to the question as to whether it is the religious norm in isolation or that which is linked to the normative order which is thus received in France and Quebec. In this respect, the question is whether integrated pluralism is a subjective pluralism, which seeks to take into consideration only ethical religious normativity, or an objective one, which recognizes the normative impact of religious normative orders on their members.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537170p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gd45b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Religious pluralism -- France</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion and state -- Quebec</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religious pluralism -- Quebec</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion and state -- France</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78tc46z"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Elucidation of lifestyle predictors of gestational diabetes mellitus in Pakistani women</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Iqbal, Romaina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As women who experience Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) are  at considerably greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes in life, prevention of  GDM is particularly important. The objectives of this research were to identify  lifestyle predictors associated with GDM in a developing country and to validate a  physical activity questionnaire for assessing total energy expenditure in a  Pakistani population. A prospective cohort study of 750 South Asian women recruited  early in gestation was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan. Eligibility criteria included  South Asian origin and ≤ 18 weeks gestation. Data on physical activity, diet,  socio-demographic covariates, weight, height and body composition were obtained at  recruitment and women were followed to assess GDM status at ≥ 26 weeks of  gestation. Logistic regression analysis of data from 611 women to assess  the impact of age, body fat percentage, height, family history of diabetes, parity,  level of education, rate of weight gain during pregnancy, and daily energy  expenditure on the development of GDM was undertaken. The risk of GDM increased with  increasing maternal age (yr), OR 1.13 (CI 1.06-1.21), body fat (%), OR 1.07 (CI  1.03-1.13), and decreased with daily energy expenditure (100 kcal), OR 0.89 (CI  0.79-0.99). Replacing body fat (%) with pre-gravid BMI provided similar results.  Using a nested case (n=49) control (n=98) study design, conditional logistic  regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between total energy,  macronutrient and fiber intake and GDM. The risk of GDM decreased with increasing  amounts of protein as a percentage of total energy intake, OR 0.75 (CI  0.60-0.95). The Monitoring trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease  Optional Study of Physical Activity (MOSPA) questionnaire was assessed against a  Caltrac accelerometer (n=50). Subjects wore a caltrac accelerometer for 5  consecutive days. A correlation of 0.51 (P&lt;0.01) was found between MOSPA  questionnaire and Caltrac accelerometer values. Advanced maternal age and body fat (%) predicted increased risk  for GDM while physical activity was protective. Hence, prevention strategies should  target increasing physical activity, sufficient to alter body composition, in this  South Asian population.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827c15j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tc46z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Diabetes in pregnancy -- Susceptibility -- Pakistan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diabetes in pregnancy -- Pakistan</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257f63c"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enteritidis in liquid egg products using pulsed electric field</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Amiali, Malek</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) processing, a novel, non-thermal  food preservation method, has been shown to inactivate both spoilage and pathogenic  microorganisms, while minimizing changes in the physical and organoleptic qualities  of the food, such as those observed under conventional thermal processing. An  understanding of the inactivation mechanisms and kinetics of microorganisms exposed  to lethal or sub-lethal PEF treatments would allow industry and consumers to better  understand and evaluate the potential of PEF technology as an alternative or  complement to traditional methods of food preservation. This study consisted of  three sets of experiments which sought to determine: (i) the electrical conductivity  (EC) of various liquid food products (apple, orange and pineapple juices, egg white,  whole egg and egg yolk) at different temperatures (5--55°C); (ii) the  capacity of PEF (15 kV cm-1, 0°C) to inactivate Escherichia coli O157:H7 in  dialyzed liquid egg products; and (iii) the effect of PEF (20 or 30 kV cm-1) in  combination with temperature (10--40°C) on the inactivation of E. coli and  Salmonella Enteritidis in liquid egg yolk (EY), whole egg (WE), or egg white (EW).  The treatment chamber design was based in part on regression equations of EC vs.  temperature developed in the first set of experiments.

Specifically, whereas associatively-related words demonstrate strong and  robust priming effects when presented within the context of lexical-level tasks,  generation of significant SR priming appears to require execution of an explicitly  semantic task. This apparent levels-of-processing effect, if reflected in the  neural-level implementation, would suggest that the mechanisms underlying priming  may be localized to spatially and functionally distinct cerebral regions. In the  first part of the thesis, an artifactual decision task (ADT) is developed and  refined, which proved capable of producing strong immediate SR priming for  auditorily presented words. Insertion of unrelated items between prime and target  produced differential effects on priming, with AR targets exhibiting an interference  effect that slowly diminished as more unrelated items were inserted. The nature of  the underlying difference at the neural substrate level was subsequently examined in  a PET imaging study, in which subjects performed an auditory ADT using both AR and  SR words. Analysis of the cerebral blood flow patterns (CBF) using both simple  contrasts, as well as partial least squares (PLS) analysis, found priming-related  rCBF decreases in the left frontal regions, primarily within the inferior prefrontal  cortex, and left-sided priming-related increases, localized primarily to the  superior temporal gyrus, and the ventral temporal surface. Priming-related  modulations were reflected by SR words, but not AR words.

Most histone mRNAs are not polyadenylated but  instead carry in their 3'-utr a highly conserved stem-loop structure. In somatic  cells, the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) is expressed during S-phase of the cell  cycle and associates with the stem-loop of histone mRNAs promoting their processing  and translation and thereby coordinating their expression to DNA replication. As  histone mRNAs are abundant in immature oocytes which are in G2 of the cell cycle and  in ovulated or mature oocytes which are in M-phase, I examined the expression and  the regulation of histone mRNAs in immature and maturing mouse oocytes. First, I  described SLBP expression during oogenesis and pre-implantation embryonic  development. I showed that SLBP is present at low levels in the nucleus of the  immature oocyte and accumulates significantly during maturation of the oocyte. At  both stages, SLBP is the only stem-loop binding activity present. I showed that SLBP  meiotic accumulation correlates with the adenylation of SLBP mRNA and is mediated by  the presence of a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element in SLBP 3'-utr. Also, I  demonstrated that histones are synthesized in the immature and mature oocyte and  that the translation of a reporter mRNA bearing the histone 3'-utr increases  dramatically during oocyte maturation consistent with the accumulation of SLBP. I  specifically blocked SLBP accumulation using RNA interference and observed that both  translation of the reporter mRNA and endogenous histone synthesis are significantly  reduced. Moreover, SLBP-depleted eggs display a significant decrease in pronuclear  size and in the total amount of histones detectable on their chromatin.

The maternally  expressed gene Bicaudal-C (Bic-C) encodes a KH-domain RNA binding protein required  in the developing oocyte for anterior-posterior patterning and follicle cell  migration. The dominant heterozygous phenotype results in the development of embryos  with bicaudal and head defects. A two-hybrid screen using BIC-C as "bait"  identified the novel protein ANTIMEROS (ATMS) and the SH3-domain containing protein  MILE END (MILE). ATMS is highly conserved between humans and mice, its expression  is almost entirely female-specific, and is limited to certain developmental stages.  Mutant alleles for atms are able to dominantly enhance the phenotype of Bic-C  heterozygotes confirming the Bic-C-atms interaction. Here I show that NOS  mislocalization causes the trans-heterozygous phenotype, as introduction of a nos  mutation strongly suppresses the bicaudal phenotype. nos transcripts show a  hyper-polyandenylation in atms mutant ovaries, an indicator of translational  activation, suggesting that ATMS and BIC-C function as translational repressors of  nos through changes in its poly(A) tail length. MILE, contains two highly conserved SH3 domains at the  C-terminus. Experiments involving the analysis of mutant alleles and overexpression  mile transgenic lines show that MILE is a negative regulator of both Torso and Egfr  RTK signaling.

My research therefore sought to ascertain what factors affect the  quality of doctor-patient communication in government hospitals in Jamaica, why, and  how. A quantitative survey was done to gather the required data to  ascertain what patients and some health care professionals think of doctors'  communication and what factors affect this communication.

I concluded that, perhaps due to the effects of  cultural penetration, some Jamaicans have concerns regarding doctor-patient  communication in Jamaican government hospitals that are similar to North-American  expectations, but propose that, with proportionally far fewer doctors available and  different cultural norms, a different model of doctor-patient communication should  exist in Jamaica.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930bx64c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xs06k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Health Care Management</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah702q6845"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The palladium catalyzed multicomponent synthesis of Münchnones : novel one-pot metal catalyzed routes to heterocycles and peptide-based molecules</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dhawan, Rajiv</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to develop new routes to couple  commercially and/or readily available starting materials into biologically relevant  structures via one-pot transition metal catalyzed multicomponent coupling reactions.  More specifically, we showed that a palladium catalyst could couple imines, acid  chlorides and carbon monoxide to directly generate 1,3-oxazolium-5-oxides  (Munchnones). Chapter 2 of this thesis describes a new palladium catalyzed  multicomponent synthesis of beta-lactams. This reaction was developed based upon  previous work in this laboratory, which showed that imidazoline-carboxylates could  be generated from coupling two imines, an acid chloride and CO. Mechanistic studies  suggested that this product arose from a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an imine-HCl  molecule with Munchnone. Removal of this acid combined with adjusting reactant  ratios, and the utilization of ligands generated 3-amido substituted beta-lactams in  moderate to good yields. Chapter 3 discusses studies that further explain the origin of  the beta-lactam and imidazoline-carboxylate products obtained from catalysis. These  studies demonstrate that imidazoline-carboxylates are generated either directly  through a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of imine-HCl with Munchnone, or  indirectly from acid catalyzed rearrangement of an initially formed beta-lactam. In  addition, the potential intermediates in the catalytic cycle, including the  palladium bound carbonyl complex are completely characterized. Chapter 4 describes the first example of a metal-catalyzed  synthesis of Munchnones. Reaction optimization focused on modifying the catalyst  structure to {Pd(Cl)[eta2-CH(R1)NR 2COR3]}2 (formed by pre-treating Pd 2(dba)3 CHCl3  with imine (R1C(H) = NR2) and acid chloride (R3COCl)), increasing CO pressures and  employing bromide salts to stabilize the palladium catalyst. These modifications to  the reaction enabled the development of a catalytic Munchnone synthesis from imines,  acid chlorides, and CO. Chapter 5 describes the development of a highly modular one-step  palladium catalyzed synthesis of pyrroles. This reaction shows that pyrroles can be  thought of as being a coupling product of an imine, acid chloride and an alkyne,  formed via the in situ trapping of Munchnones with alkynes. In addition, further  improvements to the Munchnone synthesis through the utilization of sterically bulky  phosphine ligands (i.e. [P(o-Tol) 3]) will be discussed. As well as broadening the  scope of accessible Munchnones, this ligand also increased the rate of product  formation. Chapter 6 describes some preliminary studies on the mechanism of  Munchnone synthesis. Based upon kinetic data and catalyst resting state analyses,  the rate determining step was suggested to possibly be N-acyliminium salt oxidative  addition to Pd(0). In addition, crystal structures of {[P(  o-Tol)3]Pd(eta2-CH(Tol)N(PMB)COPh)} and its dimeric precursor  {Pd(eta2-CH(Tol)N(PMB)COPh)}2 were obtained.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m2193.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q6845</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Inorganic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apk02cb34x"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The robust design of robotic mechanical systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Al-Widyan, Khalid</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Task uncertainty and noise---generically referred to as  uncertainties in the thesis---in the design and operation of robotic mechanical  systems pose a major challenge to the designer. The aim of this thesis is to  contribute to the laying down of the foundations on which the design of robotic  mechanical systems, in the presence of uncertainties, is to be based. Uncertainties  are accounted for by means of robustness. To this end, a theoretical framework as  well as a general methodology for model-based robust design are proposed. Within  this framework, all quantities involved in a design task are classified into three  sets: the design variables (DV), which are to be assigned values as an outcome of  the design task; the design-environment parameters (DEP), over which the designer  has no control; and the performance functions (PF), representing the functional  relations among performance, DV and DEP. A distinction is made between globally  robust design and locally robust design, this thesis focusing on the latter. Locally  robust design is amenable to mathematical modelling of the performance by means of  smooth functions of the DV and DEP. Resorting to the mathematical model available  for the object under design, a design performance matrix, mapping the space of  relative variations in DEP---referred to as noise in the literature on robust  design---into that of relative variations in PF, is derived. Then, the locally  robust design problem is formulated as the minimization of a norm of the covariance  matrix of the variations in the PF upon variations in the DEP. Moreover, one  pertinent concept are introduced: design isotropy. Next, it is shown that an  optimally robust design can be secured by means of isotropy, whenever this is  achievable under the constraints of the problem at hand. As proven in the thesis,  designs obtained via isotropy lead to robustness even in the absence of a priori  knowledge of the statistical properties of the variations of In connection with robotic mechanical systems, the design task  is decomposed into three subtasks, namely, kinetostatic, elastostatic, and  elastodynamic, in this order. We show that parallel manipulators allow for isotropic  designs, but their serial counterparts do not. The motivation behind the research work reported here being the  design of robotic mechanical systems, the simulation of their dynamic response  becomes an essential component in their design. In order to validate the proposed  design, a robust algorithm for the simulation of conservative linear systems, which  model accurately the systems of interest in the presence of "small"  environment perturbations, is introduced. The robustness of the algorithm lies in  its immunity to roundoff and truncation errors, which could lead to either  instability or a dissipative response in the simulation results  otherwise.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182k59d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb34x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8336h245z"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Application of heat pipe technology in permanent mold casting of nonferrous alloys</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Elalem, Kaled</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The issue of mold cooling is one, which presents a foundry with  a dilemma. On the one hand; the use of air for cooling is safe and practical,  however, it is not very effective and high cost. On the other hand, water-cooling  can be very effective but it raises serious concerns about safety, especially with a  metal such as magnesium. An alternative option that is being developed at McGill  University uses heat pipe technology to carry out the cooling. The experimental program consisted of designing a permanent mold  to produce AZ91E magnesium alloy and A356 aluminum alloy castings with shrinkage  defects. Heat pipes were then used to reduce these defects. The heat pipes used in  this work are novel and are patent pending. They are referred to as McGill Heat  Pipes. Computer modeling was used extensively in designing the mold and  the heat pipes. Final designs for the mold and the heat pipes were chosen based on  the modeling results. Laboratory tests of the heat pipe were performed before  conducting the actual experimental plan. The laboratory testing results verified the  excellent performance of the heat pipes as anticipated by the model. An industrial mold made of H13 tool steel was constructed to  cast nonferrous alloys. The heat pipes were installed and initial testing and actual  industrial trials were conducted. This is the first time where a McGill heat pipe  was used in an industrial permanent mold casting process for nonferrous  alloys. The effects of cooling using heat pipes on AZ91E and A356 were  evaluated using computer modeling and experimental trials. Microstructural analyses  were conducted to measure the secondary dendrite arm spacing, SDAS, and the grain  size to evaluate the cooling effects on the castings. The modeling and the  experimental results agreed quite well. The metallurgical differences between AZ91E  and A356 were investigated using modeling and experimental results. Selected results  from modeling, laboratory and industrial trials are presented. The results show a  promising future for heat pipe technology in cooling permanent molds for the casting  of nonferrous alloys.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nk99h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h245z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qj177"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Thermodynamics and phase equilibria of the silicate-fluoride-H₂O systems : implications for fluorine-bearing granites</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dolejš, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The progressive enrichment in volatiles and light incompatible  elements observed during upper-crustal differentiation of granitic and rhyolitic  magmas leads to significant changes in melt physical-chemical properties and has  important implications for ore deposition and volcanic devolatization. Thermodynamic  calculations and experimental studies of melting equilibria in the Na  2O-K2O-Al2O3-SiO2-F 2O-1-H2O system are used to evaluate mineral stabilities, fluid  compositions, the extent of fluoride-silicate liquid-liquid immiscibility, fluorine  and water solubility limits and differentiation paths of natural fluorine-bearing  silicic magmas. The interaction of fluorine with rock-forming aluminosilicates  corresponds to progressive fluorination by the thermodynamic component F2O-1.  Formation of fluorine-bearing minerals first occurs in peralkaline and  silica-undersaturated systems that buffer fluorine concentrations at very low levels  (villiaumite, fluorite). The highest concentrations of fluorine are achieved in  peraluminous silica-oversaturated systems, saturated with fluorite or topaz.  Thermodynamic models of fluorosilicate melts indicate clustering of silicate  tetrahedra in the Na2O-SiO 2-F2O-1 system, whereas initial NaAl-F short-range order  evolves into partial O-F disorder in the albite-cryolite system. Experiments  performed at 520-1100°C and 0.1-100 MPa completely describe liquidus  relations and differentiation paths of fluorine-bearing felsic magmas. Coordination  differences and short-range order effects between [NaAl]-F, Na-F vs. Si-O lead to  the fluoride-silicate liquid immiscibility, which extends from the silica-cryolite  binary through the peralkaline albite-silica-cryolite ternary and closes in  multicomponent, topaz-bearing systems owing to the destabilizing effect of  increasing peraluminosity.

An RNA  stem-loop structure (SL1) in the 5' untranslated region, known as the dimerization  initiation site (DIS), is important for dimerization and packaging of HIV-1 genomic  RNA; however, the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. The major goal of  this PhD study was to further understand HIV-1 RNA dimerization, and to study the  role of the Gag protein in the dimerization and packaging processes. Despite the  known involvement of the DIS in RNA dimerization, DIS-mutated viruses still contain  significant levels of dimerized RNA, and electron microscopy studies suggest that  the RNA molecules are linked at the extreme 5' end. We show here that RNA sequences  on both sides of the DIS are also required for HIVA genome dimerization, suggesting  that multiple RNA elements are involved. We have also examined the contribution of  specific amino acids within Gag to the dimerization and packaging processes.  Previous work showed that partial deletion of the DIS impacted on viral replication  capacity, but could largely be corrected by compensatory point mutations within Gag.  To further elucidate the mechanism(s) of these compensatory mutations, we generated  DIS mutants lacking the entire SL1, or only the SL1 loop sequences, and combined  these deletions with various combinations of compensatory mutations. Analysis of  virion-derived RNA showed that the relevant mutant viruses contained increased  levels of spliced viral RNA compared to wild type, indicating that a defect in  genome packaging specificity was present. However, this defect was corrected by our  compensatory mutations, and a T121 substitution in p2 was shown to be solely  responsible for this activity. These results suggest that the p2 spacer peptide  plays a critical role in the specific packaging of viral genomic RNA.

Much research has implicated the anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC), mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex (MDLFC), and a  "frontocingulate" (i.e., MDLFC-ACC) circuit in sad affect and depression  as well as the mood response to antidepressant treatment, including 10-Hz repetitive  transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied over the MDLFC. While the empirical  support for a direct role of the MDLFC in affect is unclear, a wealth of research  supports the ACC as an interface between action and emotion (Paus, 2001). In a  series of experiments using behavioural, brain imaging and brain stimulation  techniques we investigated the involvement of the ACC and an MDLFC-ACC (i.e.,  frontocingulate) circuit in an "action and emotion" relevant behaviour,  namely, paralinguistic aspects of speech production. (e.g., speech pitch and  loudness). In Experiment 1, we examined the relationship between affect and  paralinguistic aspects of speech and in Experiment 2 we investigated the role of the  ACC in mediating this phenomenon. Next, applying our knowledge of the role of the  ACC in affect-relevant behaviour, we combined rTMS with a speech task (Experiment 3)  and with PET (Experiment 4) in order investigate further the possibility that  influencing brain activity in a frontocingulate circuit may contribute to the known  mood effects of rTMS applied over the MDLFC. Taken together, our results  demonstrated a role for the ACC in pitch variation during affective states and  suggested that changes in affect and pitch variation following 10-Hz rTMS applied  over the left MDLFC may involve changes in neural activity in a network of brain  regions widely implicated in affect, including a frontocingulate circuit.

Five studies investigated the influence of  attachment on how people navigate the interdependence dilemma focusing on the use of  communal and exchange norms (Clark &amp; Mills, 1979). In Study 1, compared to  secure and avoidantly attached individuals, anxiously attached individuals avoided  using exchange norms with a potential friend, presumably to signal interest in  closeness. In Study 2, when a potential friend used communal norms (compared to  exchange norms), anxious individuals felt more anxious and exhibited lower  appearance self-esteem, whereas avoidant individuals viewed their partner as more  negatively communal and liked their partner less. In Study 3, secure individuals  accepted help from a potential friend, and did not feel the need to reciprocate,  whereas avoidant individuals quickly reciprocated, presumably to clear their debt  and to establish boundaries. Anxious individuals again felt anxious upon receiving  help. Study 4 focused on emotion regulation and cognition. When a potential friend  used communal norms (suggested working as a team), anxious individuals performed  worse on a mental concentration task (ruminated) compared to secures. Moreover,  lexical decision analyses revealed that proximity accessibility was associated with  better performance for the less anxiously attached, and worse performance for the  more anxiously attached, suggesting that thoughts about closeness dampened anxiety  and rumination for the secures, but increased it for the anxious individuals.  Finally, in Study 5, which focused on attributions, anxious individuals tended to  monitor and appraise discrete events for their significance to relationship goals,  and were more likely to infer relationship progress from discrete communal events.

Most software quality characteristics cannot be measured before a  certain period of use of the software product. However, they can be predicted or  estimated based on other measurable quality attributes. Software quality estimation  models are built and used extensively for this purpose. Most such models are  constructed using statistical or machine learning techniques. However, in this  domain it is very hard to obtain data sets on which to train such models; often such  data sets are proprietary, and the publicly available data sets are too small, or  not representative. Hence, the accuracy of the models often deteriorates  significantly when they are used to classify new data. This thesis explores the use of genetic algorithms for the  problem of optimizing existing rule-based software quality estimation models. The  main contributions of this work are two evolutionary approaches to this optimization  problem. In the first approach, we assume the existence of several models, and we  use a genetic algorithm to combine them, and adapt them to a given data set. The  second approach optimizes a single model. The core concept of this thesis is to  consider existing models that have been constructed on one data set and adapt them  to new data. In real applications, this can be seen as adapting already existing  software quality estimation models that have been constructed on data extracted from  common domain knowledge to context-specific data. Our technique maintains the  white-box nature of the models which can be used as guidelines in future software  development processes.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p518b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53jx54b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655h14p"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Gold nanoparticles : tailored preparation and assembly in 2- and 3-dimensions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Corbierre, Muriel K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The synthesis, characterization, and assembly of  thiol-stabilized gold nanoparticles in 2- and 3-dimensions are the focus of this  thesis. Assemblies of gold nanoparticles in 2-dimensions were prepared  by the reduction of gold(I)-thiolate thin films on carbon and silicon surfaces.  These films were reduced by direct exposure to an electron beam. The electron  beam-induced growth of gold nanoparticles was observed in-situ in a transmission  electron microscope. Electron beam lithography of the gold(I)-thiolate films allowed  for the fabrication of sub-50 nm arrays of small gold nanoparticles (from 2 to 6 nm  in diameter). Variation in the electron dose allowed for a variation in nanoparticle  surface coverage. Novel polymer-stabilized gold nanoparticles with high grafting  densities were prepared for their 3D dispersion in polymer matrices. The resulting  polymer nanocomposites were characterized by transmission electron microscopy,  UV-visible spectroscopy, and small angle X-ray scattering. The homogeneous blending  of the nanoparticles in polymer matrices was a function of the polymeric ligand  molecular weight, as well as the polymeric ligand grafting density on the gold core.  The truncated octahedral shape of the gold core seems to favor the wetting of the  polymer ligand brush by the polymer matrix. This in turn seems to favor the  dispersion of the gold nanoparticles in the polymer matrices. Finally, small thiol-capped gold nanoparticles were prepared by  the chemical reduction of gold(I)-thiolate complexes in solution. The sizes of the  resulting nanoparticles were compared to those prepared by conventional  methods.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r847q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655h14p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Inorganic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fc08d"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Direct preparation of alpha-calcium sulfate hemihydrate from sulfuric acid</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ling, Yuanbing, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this work, the crystallization of alpha-calcium sulfate  hemihydrate in sulfuric acid solution and the correlation between its properties and  preparation conditions by reaction of sulfuric acid with lime (CaO) have been  thoroughly investigated. The research involved the study of conversion-dissolution  of calcium sulfate dihydrate in H2SO4 solution, the measurement of solubilities,  thermo-dynamic calculations and the preparation of alpha-CaSO4 ·0.5 H2O  via different methods of reactive mixing of H2SO4 and CaO. It was found that the  calcium sulfate solids can saturate the sulfuric acid solutions in only 5 minutes.  The solubility of calcium sulfate hemihydrate in 0--3.0M H 2SO4 solution at  100°C was experimentally determined and thermodynamic calculations with the  aid of FactSage and OLI have led to establishment of the phase diagram for the  CaSO4-H2SO 4-H2O system. An operating window has been determined in terms of H2SO4  concentration, temperature and time within which alpha-hemihydrate can be produced  by reaction of lime with H 2SO4. This window is defined as 0.6--1.1M H2SO 4  (steady-state concentrations), 98--105°C and 1 hour retention time.  Dihydrate was found to form as intermediate phase quickly converting to hemihydrate.  The kinetics of conversion depends on the acidity level. For the standard preparation procedure of adding lime into hot  sulfuric acid, alpha-hemihydrate grows in the c-axis direction much more rapidly  than in other directions ending in the form of fine needle crystals. Also,  independent of the shape of the seed particles, the resultant crystals of  hemihydrate are needle-shaped, which suggests a  "dissolution-recrystallization" mechanism. Upon prolonged equilibration in  their acid-preparation solution hemihydrate needle-shape crystals become fibrous and  eventually convert to anhydrite. It is believed that uptake of SO42- instead of Ca2+  is the rate-determining step in the hemihydrate crystallization process. The hot  SO42--rich environment rendered most of the additives (particularly organic) tried  ineffective. Trivalent cations such as Fe3+ and Al3+, are the only ones found to  modify the crystal morphology from needle-shape to small "grain" type  morphology. Slow addition of H2SO4 solution to slaked lime - reverse  procedure was found to favor the production of alpha-hemihydrate with column-shaped  as opposed to needle-shaped crystal morphology within otherwise the same operating  window, 0.6--1.1M H2SO4.

However,  many studies have shown 1,25(OH) 2D3 and its analogue EB1089 have broad potential as  anticancer agents due to their antiproliferative and pro-differentiating activities.  Here, we examined the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and EB1089 on proliferation and target  gene regulation of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines SCC4,  SCC9, SCC15 and SCC25 and mouse AT84 SCC cells. A range of sensitivities to  1,25(OH)2D3 and EB1089 was observed, from complete G0/G1 arrest of SCC25 cells to  only 50% inhibition of SCC9 cell growth. We have analyzed the molecular mechanisms  underlying the antiproliferative effects of EB1089 on SCC25 cells by screening over  10,000 genes on cDNA and oligonucleotide arrays. These studies have identified  ~200 novel target genes of 1,25(OH)2D3/EB1089, many of which are essential  for normal DNA repair, are markers of cellular differentiation, or are key cell  cycle regulators. One of these is the growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD45alpha)  gene. Induction of the GADD45alpha gene and its encoded protein in EB1089-treated  cells was confirmed by northern and western blotting, respectively. Moreover, while  expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was reduced in  EB1089-treated cells, coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed increased association  between GADD45alpha and PCNA in treated cells, consistent with the capacity of  GADD45alpha to stimulate DNA repair. Our data also show that amphiregulin, a member  of the epidermal growth factor family, is a 1,25(OH)2D3 target gene, and suggest  that its induction may contribute to the growth inhibitory effects of 1,25(OH) 2D3.  In addition, we show that 1,25(OH)2D 3 analogues induce expression of the  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1 in different cell types by inhibiting  expression of subunits of the SCFSKP2 ubiquitin liga These studies (1) suggest that differences in action of the  EB1089 and 1,25(OH)2D3 arise more from their relative sensitivities to metabolism  and than from differing effects on VDR function, (2) substantially expand the number  of known D3 target genes in cancer cells (3) enhance our understanding of the  molecular mechanism controlling the antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 analogs  in cancer (4) provide a number of marker genes that will be useful in assessing the  sensitivity of tumor samples to the antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D  3.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>White, John H.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gk359.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580n106</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4f16c340f"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Role of acylation stimulating protein in the regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity and fatty acid trapping</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Faraj, May</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Obesity and its comorbidities are an ever-expanding cost of  affluent societies. Energy homeostasis is mediated by a network of hormonal signals  that originates from many tissues, including white adipose tissue (WAT). Acylation  stimulating protein (ASP) is a lipogenic hormone secreted by WAT that stimulates  triglyceride (TG) storage (i.e. non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) trapping) by  increasing glucose uptake and NEFA esterification. ASP deficient mice are  characterized by reduced body weight and WAT mass and delayed postprandial TG and  NEFA clearance. The key enzyme in the regulation of TG clearance is lipoprotein  lipase (LPL). The overall objective of this thesis was to examine the mechanisms by  which ASP deficiency leads to delayed postprandial TG clearance and altered body  composition in KO mice and to regulate, in coordination with other hormones, energy  balance and metabolic profile in morbidly obese subjects following weight  loss. Novel findings in this thesis suggest that (1) in 3T3-L1  adipocytes, ASP increases hydrolysis, uptake and esterification of TG-rich  lipoproteins (in situ LPL activity) by increasing NEFA trapping within the  adipocytes thus decreasing NEFA inhibition of LPL activity, (2) In ex vivo study in  mice, ASP deficiency was found not to result in any intrinsic tissue differences in  glucose or NEFA oxidation or storage in WAT, skeletal muscle or liver, however, NEFA  trapping was enhanced in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of KO mice. Moreover, ASP  enhances in situ LPL activity, TG clearance and lipogenesis in WAT while in muscle  ASP induces the opposite effects to those in WAT and increases lipolysis and (3) In  in vivo study on morbidly obese subjects following gastric-bypass induced weight  loss, the changes in ASP and adiponectin were predictive of weight loss, improved  insulin sensitivity and apolipoprotein B concentration. In addition, the orexigenic  gastric hormone, ghrelin, remains below normal levels in all subjects following  surgery, which may favors maintenance of weight loss. In conclusion, these findings underscore the central role of WAT  and ASP pathway in the regulation of TG clearance and energy homeostasis and suggest  that, in vivo, an effective ASP pathway favors NEFA trapping in the physiological  depot, which would promote optimal insulin activity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cianflone, Katherine</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tc523.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c340f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qj19s"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Theoretical study of conductance, capacitance and transport properties of nanostructures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pomorski, Pawel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the past two decades, significant progress in constructing  physical systems of reduced dimensionality has been made. In these systems, quantum  effects are observed in the electric current response to an applied bias voltage.  Considerable theoretical effort has been made to understand conductance and  capacitance which characterize this response. In addition to a fundamental science  interest, there has been a significant technological need to build and understand  small scale devices in order to maintain the current rate of progress in increasing  computer performance. In this thesis, we theoretically investigated the conductance  and capacitance of mesoscopic and molecular scale systems. Our approach incorporated  Landauer-Buttiker transport theory. We developed a highly efficient method, based on the solution of  the time-dependent Schrodinger equation incorporating a magnetic field, to solve the  quantum scattering problem in mesoscopic nanostructures. We studied linear response  capacitance in a two plate mesoscopic capacitor with one plate a quantum conductor  in the ballistic scattering regime. By determining the scattering wavefunctions in  the quantum plate, we were able to obtain relevant densities of states and use them  to self-consistently calculate capacitance matrix coefficients for the system. We  find the capacitance to be highly dependent on the external magnetic field and the  number of probes attached to the quantum conductor. To study molecular scale systems, our approach was based on  Density Functional Theory within Local Density Approximation and non-equilibrium  Green's functions, implemented in the simulation package McDcal. For the work in  this thesis, we modified McDcal to run on parallel computer architectures. We  studied the current-voltage characteristics of silicon cage nanowires sandwiched  between aluminum electrodes. We successfully analyzed our results using the complex  band structure of the nanowire. Finally, we studied the capacitance properties of  carbon nanotube junctions. In junctions with tubes so far apart that their  wavefunctions do not overlap, we studied the variation in capacitance for different  relative tube positions and radii. We also studied junctions where the nanotubes are  in contact but in which there is no current due to a conductance gap. In this system  we find an enhancement in the value of capacitance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Suo, Hong</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r613r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qj19s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1n79h490w"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Coherent x-ray studies of non-equilibrium processes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fluerasu, Andrei</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>X-ray Intensity Fluctuation Spectroscopy (XIFS) is an ideal  technique to perform measurements on the dynamics of fluctuations in condensed  matter systems. Over the past few years, XIFS has been used in several studies of  dynamics in both hard condensed matter and soft condensed matter equilibrium  systems. Its extension to study the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems is currently  under way. In this thesis, we present the first applications of XIFS to study  dynamics during a first order phase transition with nonconserved order parameter  (model A). The order-disorder phase transition in the binary alloy Cu3Au has been  chosen as a case study for such a non-equilibrium process and has been studied using  XIFS. Our experiments have confirmed the theoretical predictions for the scaling  laws describing the evolution of the density-density correlation functions, which  are measured by the autocorrelation function of the scattered intensity. The  covariance of the scattered intensity was found to be proportional with scaling  functions with natural variables delta t = |t1 - t 2| and t¯ = t1+t22 , as  predicted by theory. However, some significant early-time deviations from this  scaling picture have been observed and are currently under  investigations. In order to study non-equilibrium processes in condensed matter  systems, a very precise and fast temperature control system is often required. In  order to trigger the particular process under study and to obtain meaningful  experimental data, the temperature has to change by hundreds of degrees in very  short times, while completely avoiding any over/under shooting. To achieve this, we  designed and implemented a computer-controlled temperature tracking system which  combines standard Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) feedback, thermal modeling  and finite difference thermal calculations (feedforward) and Kalman filtering of the  temperature readings in order to reduce the noise. The resulting  Kalman-Predictive-Proportional-Integral-Derivative (KPPID) algorithm allows us to  obtain accurate control, to minimize the response time and to avoid over/under  shooting, even in systems with inherent noisy temperature readings and time delays.  The KPPID temperature controller was successfully implemented at the Advanced Photon  Source at Argonne National Laboratories and was used to perform the coherent X-ray  diffraction experiments described in this thesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sutton, Mark</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537174s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h490w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wn380"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of the signaling pathways underlying netrin-1 receptor deleted in colorectal cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Xiaodong, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Netrins are a small family of secreted proteins that function as  chemotropic cues directing cell and axon migration during neural development. They  are bifunctional molecules attracting and repelling different classes of axons. DCC  (deleted in colorectal cancer) is a transmembrane receptor for netrin-1 implicated  in mediating both responses. The intracellular mechanisms mediating the response of  an axon to netrin-1 are currently unclear. Previous studies indicated that  extracellular guidance cues induce the neuronal growth cone to advance, retract, or  turn by regulating the actin cytoskeleton within the growth cone. The Rho family  GTPases, in particular, RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, are well-described regulators of actin  reorganization in non-neuronal cells, and there is now compelling evidence  implicating a role for them as signaling components within the neuronal growth  cone. In the first part of this thesis, we have demonstrated that the  Rho GTPases are required for embryonic spinal commissural axon outgrowth induced by  netrin-1. Using NIE-115 neuroblastoma cells we found that both Rac1 and Cdc42  activities are required for DCC-induced neurite outgrowth. In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts,  DCC was found to trigger actin reorganization through activation of Rac1. These  results implicate the small GTPases as important signaling components in the  molecular mechanisms underlying DCC. In the second part, we found that DCC interacts constitutively  with the adaptor protein Nck in commissural neurons. Moreover, dominant negative  Nck-1 inhibits the ability of DCC to induce neurite outgrowth in NIE-115 cells and  to activate Rac1 in fibroblasts in response to netrin-1. These studies provide  evidence for an important role of Nck-1 in a novel signaling pathway from an  extracellular guidance cue to changes in the actin-based cytoskeleton responsible  for axonal guidance. In the last part, we found that disruption of each of the PxxP  motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of DCC is not able to block the interaction of DCC  with Nck-1, suggesting that more than one PxxP motifs or non-PxxP sequences may  mediate the interaction of DCC with Nck-1. Taken together, the data in this thesis contribute to our  understanding of the intracellular mechanisms mediating the response of an axon to  netrin-1 during neural development.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lamarche-Vane, Nathalie</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sk09n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wn380</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
