H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Northern Conifer-Hardwood Forests of Central Canada occupy a small but important portion of Canada's surface area. The relatively little quantitative information available concerning this forest community is surprising in view of its interesting vegetational characteristics. In addition the greater part of the Canadian population has been concentrated in the area for two centuries. Settlement of the eastern areas began in the 1600's and in the western parts of the study region in the late 1700's. The land and climate in the extreme southern region of Ontario favoured agricultural settlements at the expense of the original forest. Logging has also taken its toll of a large proportion of forest in central and northern parts of the region. Today with the continued push northward of the populated areas in the St. Lawrence and Ottawa River valleys, new areas are being developed and the forest communities are being heavily utilized. It is essential that an understanding of the ecological processes of this mixed conifer-hardwood community and its successional stages be gained before it becomes too decimated and modified.

Redpath Hall possesses a relatively long reverberation time, decidedly beneficial for the appreciation of some musical performances, such as organ recitals, chamber music, choral performances, string quartet, etc., but at the same time, noticeably detrimental for other performances; those instruments that excell with a long reverberation time, tend to mask other instruments, resulting in a definite orchestral imbalance, particularly noticeable in remote seats; quick passages of solo instruments are blurred; the spoken word is not intelligible.

Prior to the first decade of 1900, there were only hypotheses which sought to suggest the intimate mechanism by which nervous excitation produces a functional change in an organ. Elliott, observing that the effect of stimulation of sympathetic nerves and of adrenaline was identical, proposed the hypothesis that stimulation of sympathetic nerves caused liberation of adrenaline and that it was the adrenaline which was responsible for the end effect of nervous stimulation. The question of whether nervous stimulation directly affected the organs involved was tested experimentally by Howell who indicated that stimulation of the vagus led to a liberation of potassium, this substance in turn causing the resulting phenomenon. Although Howell's assumption was not corroborated, he was the first to investigate experimentally the possible mechanism of the inhibitory function of a nerve. In the same year, Dixon cited evidence for the presence of a substance in heart tissue, "pro-inhibitin", which was converted to "inhibitin" on vagal stimulation. This substance, when combined with heart muscle, brought about cardiac arrest. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Naylor, A. F.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Hosein, E.

The term in its narrow sense refers only to the hypothesis that a certain material present in the axon would migrate in a peripheral direction, a good example of this concept is provided by the neurosecretion theory in which neurosecretory granules are believed to migrate distally along the axon. The broad meaning, as outlined in Weiss's concept implies proximodistal movement of the axon as a whole and therefore correspnds to a "continuous growth of the axon." According to Weiss and Hiscoe (1948), this theory is summarized as follow: "Growth, in the sense of production of new protoplasm, occurs solely at the base of the fiber in the nucleated part of the cell body. the column of axoplasm is maintained in constant proximodistal motion. Growth and centrifugal convection of axoplasm are not confined to the period of active elongation and enlarement, but continue in the mature fiber which has reached a stationary condition. The perpetual growth of the neurone presumably serves to replace kutabolized protoplasmic systems, especially proteins, which cannot be synthesized in the peripheral cytoplasm."

These labelled atoms or molecules allow undertaking experiments where ordinary chemical and instrumental measurements are not practical. They can be readily detected, traced or determined quantitatively, even at extremely low concentration (32). Radioactive phosphorus labelled fertilizers have made possible the determination of the quantity of phosphorus in the plant derived from applied fertilizer, hence the quantity derived from the soil can be calculated. Such information has indicated that the relative proportion of soil to fertilizer phosphorus absorbed by plants is related to the amounts of available phosphorus in soil. Hence, there exists the possibility of using fertilizers labelled with radioactive phosphorus to evaluate the available phosphorus levels of soils. This bas been done by many workers with a wide range of crops grown in various soils. It was found that the measured availability of a nutrient in the soil was inf1uenced by the various factors that affect absorption by plants. Therefore, the amount of a nutrient available in a soil depends not only upon the soil itself but also upon the specific condition under Which a given crop is grown. There is fairly general agreement that availability is a property of the soil-plant system and not of the soil alone.

A new definition of spatialization draws from Ingardenâs notion of the musical work; a new typology of spatial designs embraces music for different acoustic environments, movements of performers and audiences, various positions of musicians in space, etc. The study of spatialization includes a survey of the writings of many composers (e.g. Ives, Boulez, Stockhausen, Cage) and an examination of their compositions.

Une nouvelle dÃ©finition de la spatialisation tire son origine de la notion de lâoeuvre musicale dâIngarden; une nouvelle typologie des plans spatiaux prend en considÃ©ration des musiques pour diffÃ©rents environnements acoustiques, diverses positions des musiciens dans lâespace de mÃªme que le mouvement de ceux-ci et des auditeurs, etc. LâÃ©tude de la spatialisation inclut un survol des Ã©crits de plusieurs compositeurs (Ives, Stockhausen, Boulez et Cage, par exemple) de mÃªme quâun examen de leurs oeuvres. La derniÃ¨re partie de la thÃ¨se prÃ©sente trois approches compositionnelles de la spatialisation: la simultanÃ©itÃ© de strates sonores ,:hez Brant, le mouvement du son chez Xenakis et la musique du rituel et lâÃ©cologie sonore chez Schafer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alphonce, Bo</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418r75s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bg17g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music -- 20th century -- Analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music -- 20th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Space and time</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amw22v920j"><ual:graduationDate>2013</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dynamic resource allocation scheme design for quality of service control in networked real-time systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chen, Xi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Les systÃ¨mes temps-rÃ©el en rÃ©seau (NRSs) sont de plus en plus utilisÃ©s, et beaucoup d'entre eux fonctionnent dans un environnement ouvert aux charges variables.

Quality of service (QoS) of NRSs is closely related to the provision of the system resources for servingthe real-time tasks. To provide guarantees of QoS in NRSs, the system resources should be allocated to the real-time tasks in adaptation to the workload variations so that the desired system performance is obtained, referred to as QoS control.This thesis is concerned with the design of dynamic resource allocation schemes for QoS control in three typical NRSs. In the first part, we propose dynamic computing capacity planning schemes for processor utilization control in the distributed real-time systems, and for energy minimization with request response time guarantees in the server clusters. To handle the workload variations, we model the workload uncertainties as the parameters in the system models and use the system performance as online feedback to predict these parameters as precise as possible. Then the optimal computing capacities are provided to serve the real-time tasks in these systems online. Experimental/simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed schemes for QoS control in comparisons with the existing approaches. In the second part, we propose a dynamic network scheduling scheme for networked control systems (NCSs), typical NRSs with network bandwidth as a critical system resource. The proposed scheduling scheme can properly allocate the network bandwidth to the applications in NCSs so that the good real-time performance can be achieved.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Xue Liu</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d570108x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v920j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Applied Sciences - Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atd96k591t"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language/><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Codecs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Britton, Eliot</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis contains two volumes. The first is a written text that describes my compositional techniques in the context of an analysis of Codecs. The second volume is the score of this work. Volume one is divided into six sections: Introduction, harmony, rhythm and time, melodic materials, form, live electronics and future directions. Each section describes techniques and processes I developed throughout the compositional process. Codecs was inspired by the subversive proliferation musical materials though the use of audio codecs. I developed compositional tools based on encryption and compression in order to explore the audio codec metaphor. Volume two is the full score of Codecs, a work for large ensemble and live electronics. It is comprised of three sections and has a duration of approximately 14 minutes. The work is scored for flute (doubling on piccolo), oboe, clarinet in Bb (doubling on bass clarinet), bassoon, horn in F, trumpet, trombone, tuba, string quintet and percussion. Electronic drum pads and captured live sounds are used to control the live electronic elements.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j448r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k591t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Instrumental music -- Scores</dc:subject><dc:subject>Instrumental music -- Analysis, appreciation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zr944"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cachalote</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>GarcÃ­a de la Torre, Mauricio, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cachalote is a work for 17 musicians inspired by the study of social behavioral patterns in sperm whales. The distinctive series of clicks produced by these mammals, known as "codas," are their primary means of communication. These patterns manifest in Cachalote as a series of "sound objects", whose specific arrangement symbolizes communication, and underlines the musical discourse. The sound of field recordings provided further inspiration for the music's texture and orchestration. The composer's creation of an extra-musical narrative related to the lifecycle of sperm whales determines the appearance and ordering of the work's main gestures, and articulates the overall structure.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36v1937.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zr944</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Orchestral music -- Scores</dc:subject><dc:subject>Orchestral music -- Analysis, appreciation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vx48g"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The ghost in the machine</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Groven, Marielle, 1984-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Ghost in the Machine is a piece of music far large wind ensemble. This piece is concerned with the interrelationship between the perception of time passing in music and the level of perceived density of musical activity. Specifically, the piece is designed according to the notion that the higher the level of musical activity within smaller intervals of time, the higher the perceived level of density. The piece consists of a large-scale density envelope that spans the length of the entire piece, wherein the level of density increases gradually towards and decreases away from the climax point. The shape of this density envelope is reflected on smaller scales that operate at various levels of the music, all of which are discussed in detail in the analysis part of the thesis. These density envelopes are used as a means of structuring the listening process over the course of the piece.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bm891.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vx48g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Band music -- Scores</dc:subject><dc:subject>Band music -- Analysis, appreciation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rm754"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Foreign tyrants : Greco-Roman Jewish epideictic rhetoric in Mark 10:42-43a</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ricker, Aaron</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The bitter mention of foreign tyrants in Mark 10:42-43a has long been interpreted as an accurate description of "pagan" life that contrasted with life in ideal Christian community. More recently, it has been read as a piece of rhetoric aimed at imperial Rome. These explanations are too simple, since they do not take into account the fact that contrasting ideal authority with stereotyped foreign tyranny was an established habit within imperial Roman rhetorical culture itself. I argue that the passage is best understood as Jewish participation in this Greco-Roman tradition. This study traces the evolution of the stereotyped image of foreign tyranny in Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Greco-Roman Jewish rhetoric, and suggests that the rhetorical strategy of Mark 10:42-43a parallels the selective and strategic use of the image in the Greco-Roman Jewish work of Josephus, and represents a similar simultaneous resistance and accommodation in the face of Roman imperial culture.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dw81j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rm754</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rome in the Bible</dc:subject><dc:subject>Despotism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah702q9738"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Reconstructing Tamil masculinities : KÄvaá¹­i and Viratam among Sri Lankan men in MontrÃ©al</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gross, Victoria</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines masculinity in the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora through two ritual practices, kavat&amp;dotbelow;i and viratam. I argue that these practices are expressions of masculine identity and articulations of anxiety rooted in the refugee experience. Kavat&amp;dotbelow;i, a ritual piercing and ecstatic dance, and viratam, a rigorous fast, reconstruct masculinities fragmented by expatriation and the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. Through ritual performance, men fashion themselves as the selfless heroes of traditional Tamil literature without negating their fluency as modern Tamil-Canadians. By voicing rupture and enacting reprieve, the men who perform these rites incur individual catharsis. New non-Brahmin masculine identities that draw their authority from renunciation and asceticism as opposed to social privilege emerge in this diasporic context. Employing analyses of literature, political propaganda, and ethnography this thesis demonstrates the powerful relationship between ritual performance and masculine identity. In kavat&amp;dotbelow;i and viratam, the male body becomes the site of contested personal, political, and religious narratives.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tq40j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q9738</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tamil (Indic people) -- Religion</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tamil (Indic people) -- QuÃ©bec (Province) -- MontrÃ©al</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sri Lankans -- QuÃ©bec (Province) -- MontrÃ©al</dc:subject><dc:subject>Masculinity -- Religious aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apk02cf39x"><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterizing grade 8 students' microdevelopmental changes in understanding of conservation of matter, in the context of a discussion-based instructional unit</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Doucerain, Marina, 1982-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study used a skill theory framework (Fischer &amp; Bidell, 2006) and a microdevelopmental lens to characterize how six grade 8 students' conceptual understanding of conservation of matter changed in the context of a short discussion-based instructional unit. On average, students' conceptual understanding increased significantly, suggesting that a discussion-based approach might be effective in supporting students' learning. The general characteristics of focus students' microdevelopmental pathways were in accordance with those found in other microdevelopmental studies (e.g., Yan &amp; Fischer, 2002), but changes in complexity of misconceptions might be intricately linked to how students learned conservation of matter. The analysis of conversational dimensions suggested that doubting, among other factors, might play an important role in students' learning. This study argues for an integrated microdevelopmental approach that includes conversational dimensions and characterizes changes in the complexity of misconceptions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816q97d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cf39x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics -- Study and teaching (Secondary)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Forums (Discussion and debate)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Developmental psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Group work in education</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child development</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
