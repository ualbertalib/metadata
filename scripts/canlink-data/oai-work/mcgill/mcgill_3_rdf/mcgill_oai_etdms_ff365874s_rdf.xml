W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The reductive cleavage of spruce wood lignosulphonic acids by sodium in liquid ammonia was studied with the object of determining the chemical nature of the cleavage products. After isolating the lignin with only a little chemical change, it was sulphonated with aqueous sodium bisulphite at pH 5 and 100Â° to yield an insoluble Stage I (83%) and a soluble Stage I lignosulphonate. The insoluble Stage I lignosulphonic acid was converted to a soluble Stage II product by autohydrolysis under mild conditions. Methylation with diazomethane was used to show that this conversion did not involve the production of free phenolic groups in the lignosulphonic acid.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r6873.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365874s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
