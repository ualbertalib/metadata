R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although considerable progress has been made recently in our understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the flow of non-Newtonian fluids, much uncertainty still exists, particularly with reference to the hydrodynamic behavior of fibre suspensions. Considerable complexity is added to the treatment of these systems by the relatively large size of the flocs which are present under most conditions. Since the size of these flocs is governed by the dynamics of floc formation and destruction which proceed continuously in such systems, the flow behavior of fibre suspensions becomes an exceedingly complex function not only of the purely mechanical aspects of the system, but also of certain characteristic properties of the fibre which have not yet been thoroughly assessed. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gauvin, W.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mt551.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g382z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mechanical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
