The general approach consists in the use of statistical analysis and comparison of sixteen girls, who were interviewed, with fifteen girls who were not interviewed. The total sample of thirty-one girls is discussed in the relation to the “traditional” delinquent groups described in the relevant literature. The interviewees are discussed primarily by ease history method. The role of the School is presented with reference to individual adjustment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Younge, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qd401.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cf52g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
