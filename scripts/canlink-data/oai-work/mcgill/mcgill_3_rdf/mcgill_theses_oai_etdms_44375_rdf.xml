This custom-built system is  capable of surface stress measurements with a sensitivity of 5 x 10-5 N/m using  commercially-available atomic force microscopy cantilevers. A second system  combining cantilever-based sensing and ellipsometry was also designed and built,  capable of yielding simultaneous in situ surface stress and film thickness  measurements. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with molecular resolution was also  performed ex situ in order to characterize the structure of the resulting SAMs. The  complementary use of these tools has provided an all-around view of the  self-assembly process. These measurements were performed in order to gain insight into  the mechanisms involved in the self-assembly process and into the origins of the  associated surface stress. Moreover, these studies were used to characterize and  optimize the response of cantilever-based sensors based on functionalized SAM  technology in terms of reliability, sensitivity, and  reproducibility. The evolution of the surface stress induced during alkanethiol  SAM formation reveals features associated with coverage-dependent structural phase  transitions. These results show that both the kinetics of SAM formation and the  resulting SAM structure are strongly influenced by the surface structure of the  underlying gold substrate, by the impingement rate of the alkanethiol molecules onto  the gold surface, and by the cleanliness of the gold surface. In particular, it was  found that a minimum gold grain size is necessary in order for the SAM to achieve  the standing-up phase, for which large compressive surface stresses (~10  N/m) are measured. In addition, these results show that alkanethiol SAMs can become  kinetically trapped in metastable intermediate states (lying-down phase) for  formation on small-grained gold surfaces and/or at low alkanethiol vapor  concentrations. Theoretical modeling of the origins of the induced surface stress  reveals that inter-molecular Lennard-Jones interactions and electrostatic repulsion  between adsorbed species play minimal roles in the development of the surface  stress. Changes in the electronic structure of the underlying gold substrate are  more likely to account for the large compressive surface stresses observed during  alkanethiol SAM formation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741s287.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v357h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r362m"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Apoptosis induction by the BH3-only protein BIK localized at the endoplasmic reticulum</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Germain, Marc, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Tissue homeostasis is maintained through a balance between  controlled cell growth and apoptotic cell death. Deregulation of these processes is  linked to cancer, auto-immune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. In that  regard, apoptosis is critical to remove cells that are potentially harmful or  superfluous. The p53 tumour suppressor is a key regulator of this process. p53  induces apoptosis through the transcriptional activation of multiple proteins among  which are members of the BCL-2 family of proteins. This family of proteins lie at  the core of this process by controlling molecular events leading to the activation  of the executors of the death sentence, namely the caspase family of  proteases. I found that BIK, a member of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only class  of BCL-2 homologues, is upregulated by p53. Upon overexpression, BIK induces  classical mitochondria-dependent caspase activation. However, BIK is found almost  exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Specific targeting of BIK to the ER  and in vitro experiments indicated that BIK causes cytochrome c release from an ER  location. Since BH3-only proteins are normally expressed at low levels and as a  cohort, I subsequently investigated early events induced by BIK at the ER. BIK  induces ER Ca2+ release leading to mitochondrial fission and cristae remodelling  long before cytochrome c release. However, BIK and another p53-induced BH3-only  protein, Noxa, can potently cooperate to induce rapid cytochrome c release and  apoptosis in a mitochondrial fission-dependent manner. These functions of BIK are  closely linked to its ability to interact with BCL-2, present at high levels in the  ER of different cell types. I thus studied BIK-BCL-2 interactions at the ER using a  cross-linking approach. Interestingly, the induction of BIK in cells expressing  BCL-2 at a level that does not prevent apoptosis results in the displacement of  several BCL-2 cross-linked products by BIK. In summary, BIK is a p53-induced BH3-only protein that functions  at the ER to induce BCL-2-regulated apoptosis and can cooperate, through ER Ca 2+  signals, with apoptotic stimuli provided by other BH3-only proteins to induce rapid  apoptotic cell death.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547r80s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r362m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225b54w"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulation of the epigenome and its implications in cancer therapy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Milutinovic, Snezana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The regulation of the genome by the epigenetic modifications of  DNA methylation and histone modification is increasingly recognized as a vital  factor in the development, physiology and pathology of vertebrates. There is  mounting evidence suggesting that both aberrant DNA methylation and histone  modifications are common events in cancer. This has lead to the establishment of  both DNMTs and HDACs as important targets in cancer therapy. There are currently  several clinical trials that are testing inhibitors of both DNMTs and HDACs as  anticancer agents. This thesis attempts to understand the roles that DNMT1 and HDAC1  play in the regulation of gene expression and epigenomic inheritance. In the first  chapter, we examined the effects of DNMT1 inhibitors on gene expression and found  that DNMT1 can regulate gene expression independent of its DNA methyltransferase  activity. This novel role of DNMT1 has challenged a widely accepted theory that the  mechanism of DNMT1 inhibitors involves inhibition of the catalytic activity of  DNMT1, thus leading to demethylation and reexpression of tumor suppressors  previously silenced by methylation. In chapter 2, we further examined different  roles of DNMT1. We showed that different DNMT1 inhibitors inhibit different DNMT1  functions and produce different effects on gene expression. Our data suggests that  inhibition of DNMT1 enzymatic activity can produce serious long-term effects as a  result of massive non-selective demethylation of the genome. In contrast, reduction  of DNMT1 levels was shown to result in a rapid arrest of cell growth, limited  demethylation and induction of stress-response genes. We hypothesize that these  effects are a result of the activation of an epigenetic check point that has evolved  to protect the cell from undergoing replication in the absence of DNMT1. In chapter  3, we further explore the roles of DNMT1 in methylation independent regulation of  gene expression, which has been suggested to in</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322d784.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225b54w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053g51f"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Iron acquisition in Actinobacillus suis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bahrami, Fariborz</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Seven strains of Actinobacillus suis (ATCC 15557, B49, C84,  H89-1173, H91-0380, SO4 and VSB 3714) were investigated with respect to iron  acquisition from animal transferrins (Tfs) and haemoglobins (Hbs). Growth assays  with porcine, bovine and human Tfs and Hbs revealed that all seven strains could use  porcine (but not human or bovine) Tf and all three Hbs as iron sources. In solid  phase binding assays, membranes derived from all strains exhibited strong binding of  porcine Tf and each of the Hbs. Competition binding assays indicated that all three  Hbs were bound by the same receptor(s). Affinity procedures allowed the isolation  and identification of iron repressible Tf-binding (~100 kDa and ~63  kDa) and Hb-binding (~105 kDa) polypeptides from all strains. Nucleotide  sequence analyses revealed that A. suis strains SO4 and C84 possess genes that  encode homologues of the Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae Tf-binding proteins, TbpA  and TbpB, and Hb-binding protein, HgbA. In both strains, tbpB was located  immediately upstream of tbpA and was shown to be preceded by tonB, exbB and exbD  homologues; hgbA was shown to be preceded by a hugZ homologue. Putative promoter and  Fur box sequences were located upstream of tonB and hugZ and RT-PCR revealed that  the genes in each of these clusters (tonB-exbB-exbD-tbpB-tbpA; hugZ-hgbA) are  co-transcribed and iron-repressible. The molecular masses of the predicted mature  TbpA, TbpB and HgbA proteins were calculated to be 104.3, 63.4 and 105.0 kDa,  respectively, suggesting that the affinity-isolated, ~100 kDa and ~63 kDa Tf-binding polypeptides represent TbpA and TbpB, respectively, and  that the ~105 kDa Hb-binding polypeptide represents HgbA. TbpB of A. suis  was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant TbpB (rTbpB) was identified by  immunoblotting using swine sera raised against recombinant TbpB (A.  pleuropneumoniae).

By giving inheritance rights to daughters and  widows, and not exclusively to sons, this Act proposes a radically different  organization of the ideal patrilineal household, commonly referred to as "the  Hindu joint family". The Act initiates a transformation of Hindu women's status  through their rights to property, which implies the transformation of women's rights  and duties in India. Drawing on the analysis made during an extensive fieldwork  period in a rural community and case studies in Pune tribunals, this thesis shows  that women generally know that they have some rights to their father's and husband's  property. However, for various reasons, they do not see any advantage in claiming  their inheritance rights. Women often find it difficult to reconcile claiming rights  with their duties as daughters (or daughters-in-law) and the social restrictions  associated with widowhood. In addition, the complex relationships with the state  bureaucracy often prevent them from their right to access property. In that context,  before choosing a forum of justice, most women (and men) will first opt for conflict  avoidance. This socio-legal ethnography of women's succession rights, in  the state of Maharashtra, is an anthropological contribution to the study of the  dynamics of social cohesion in an environment where legal pluralism is itself in  transition.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tc45p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v355z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Widows -- India -- Maharashtra</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- India -- Maharashtra</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inheritance and succession -- India -- Maharashtra</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj430525k"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Social aftershocks : rent seeking, state failure, and state-civil society relations in Turkey</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Paker, Hande</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research emerged from the belief that merely economic  explanations of rent seeking were too narrow and an interdisciplinary approach was  needed to understand historical structural factors that contribute to  particularistic exchanges. Rent-seeking and particularistic ties are almost always  explained from a strictly neoclassical perspective which tend to be reductionist  approaches that fail to explain why some states will be rent-seeking while others  will not. Moreover, other frameworks that analyze state-civil society interaction do  so without taking into account particularistic state-civil society interaction.  Thus, there is a need to explain such particularistic ties in a comparative  institutional framework. My dissertation research was undertaken on two associations  in Turkey, namely the Turkish Red Crescent (Kizilay) and AKUT (a search and rescue  team), in order to understand the dynamics of the relationship between a  particularistic state and civil society associations. The TRC was chosen because it  was involved in particularistic exchanges and functioned as an institution of the  state, which meant that it partook in the state failure the state in Turkey faced in  the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in 1999. The Marmara earthquake was  devastating not only physically in terms of the damage it caused, but also socially  in terms of the extent of the failure of state institutions it exposed and the  extent of criticisms it unleashed. The immediate chaos that ensued in the aftermath  of the earthquake was marked by the "absence of the state". The failure of  the state provoked an unprecedented civil reaction and mobilization. AKUT, the  second case of the research, also became the focus of public attention, albeit for  completely the opposite reason. It was revered for the successful rescue work it  carried out in the earthquake while the TRC was severely criticized for its failure  to deliver services. My dissertation research has shown that in cases of state  failure, the state can only establish particularistic ties creating a multilevel  chain system of particularized exchanges and fails to deliver public goods and  services universally. Thus, the state co-opts a civil society organization into this  chain system, demonstrated both by the TRC and AKUT. Furthermore, in cases of state  failure, a civil society organization that has developed independently of the state  becomes over-missionized with filling the gap created by state failure (AKUT), with  public expectations and demands from AKUT far exceeding their self-defined goals and  capabilities. Thus, ineffectiveness of the state does not translate into  well-working civil society organizations. The absence of a capable state affects the  nature of civil society organizations adversely. This finding is a direct  contribution to the more general debate on the effectiveness of state institutions  and the voluntary sector. More importantly, my research effectively shows that much  of the dichotomous discussion of the state on the one hand, and civil society on the  other, needs to be discarded. Such dichotomous thinking does not capture the complex  interactions between the state and civil society organizations, as I have shown in  the case of Turkey.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pq82f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430525k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Disaster relief -- Turkey</dc:subject><dc:subject>Turkey -- Social conditions -- 1960-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Turkey -- Politics and government -- 1980-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corruption -- Turkey</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zb552"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development of an on-site ex-situ unsaturated-flow remediation process for trace metal contaminated soils</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Andrade, Marc-David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Innovative means and methods were tested to develop an  economical, pragmatic and environmentally sustainable soil remediation process for  heavy metal contaminated soils. An unsaturated-flow soil washing procedure was  devised to dissolve the soil-bound toxic heavy metals; the latter were extracted by  a chemical washing solution that percolated through the soil matrix. Subsequently,  the leached toxic heavy metals were selectively concentrated, by a chemical  precipitation process, into a solid waste. Thereby, a fraction of the spent  ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), within the washing and rinsing leachate, was  theoretically regenerated and recycle-ready. The unsaturated-flow washing procedure was perfected by applying  different treatments to a soil from a secure landfill. This soil was contaminated  with Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, S and Zn. The major contaminants were Fe, Pb,  Zn, S, Cu and Mn, making up 25, 1.9, 1.0, 0.4, 0.4 and 0.2%wt of the soil. The  extraction responses of the contaminants and those of Al, Ca, Mg and P were  established for citric acid (0.5 M) and different molarities of diammonium EDTA  ((NH4)2EDTA). The DOW Chemical Company supplied the (NH4)2EDTA (i.e. VERSENE), a  1.37M industrial cleaner, which roughly costs $1.85kg-1 in bulk. The affordability  of VERSENE was a pre-condition for hoping to satisfy the economical feasibility of  remediating trace metal contaminated soils. Ultimately, the developed unsaturated-flow washing procedure was  tested in a pilot-scale experiment, for its ability to remediate a soil from an  abandoned car battery recycling facility. The latter soil was severely contaminated  with Pb (3.9%wt). Drip irrigation was used to apply (NH4) 2EDTA and water-rinsing  solutions to the surface of soil heaps that rested atop an impermeable barrier,  which permitted the retrieval of the leachate. A cumulative EDTA input to the soil  of 10.6% wt extracted 49.4% of the total Pb content of the soil. Alternatively,  readily biodegradable citric acid barely extracted 2.2% of the total Pb content of  the soil, for a cumulative input of 18.1% weight of soil. Different treatments were  tested for their effectiveness in concentrating the leached toxic heavy metals into  a solid waste. The Pb was best precipitated with Na2S alone, as it provided the most  concentrated solid toxic waste. The environmental sustainability of remediating trace metal  contaminated soils was thoroughly examined, as per the amounts of chemical entrants  and toxic waste by-products, and per the post-treatment leaching of toxic levels of  the remaining and potentially toxic trace metals.

Although hippocampal sclerosis is the most common pattern of damage in TLE, there is  electrophysiological and neuropathological evidence in both humans and animal models  of this condition for the involvement of the parahippocampal region. In clinical practice, the investigation and treatment of  patients with epilepsy has been revolutionized by the advent of MRI, which has been  demonstrated to be a reliable and accurate indicator of pathologic findings  underlying epilepsy. Advances in image acquisition and processing techniques  combined with detailed descriptions of anatomy and cytoarchitectonic borders of  parahippocampal structures on histologic sections have created the basis for precise  determination of the boundaries of these cortical areas on MRI. This dissertation  presents a series of MRI studies aimed at assessing volume changes in vivo of the  parahippocampal region, and further elucidating its role in the pathogenesis of  TLE. To accomplish this we developed a standardized MRI protocol to  measure the volume of the parahippocampal region structures in vivo. In agreement  with previous neuropathological studies (Meencke and Veith, 1991), our results  showed that damage to the mesial temporal lobe involves not only the hippocampus and  the amygdala, but also the parahippocampal region structures in patients with  intractable TLE. Within the parahippocampal region, the entorhinal cortex was the  most affected structure. We observed that the atrophy was more severe in the  anterior portion of the mesial temporal lobe involving mostly the hippocampal head  and body as well as the EC. This pattern of atrophy, characterized by an  antero-posterior gradient of pathology, may be explained by a disruption of  entorhinal-hippocampal connections. To evaluate the clinical role of entorhinal cortex volumetry we  studied groups of TLE patients with hippocampal atrophy and those with normal  hippocampal volumes as well as patients with extra-temporal lobe  epilepsy. Entorhinal cortex volumetry could provide correct lateralization  of the seizure focus in 73% of TLE patients with hippocampal atrophy. Entorhinal  cortex atrophy seems to be specific to TLE, since we found no atrophy in other forms  of epilepsy, including frontal lobe and primary generalized epilepsy. We  subsequently demonstrated that entorhinal cortex atrophy ipsilateral to the seizure  focus can be the only MRI sign of mesial temporal damage in 64% of patients with  normal hippocampal volumes.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f6353.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407x77p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s069s"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Perennial springs in the Canadian High Arctic</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Andersen, Dale T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The search for extraterrestrial life begins with understanding  how life developed and evolved on our own planet. Earth's polar regions provide a  unique setting conducive to developing the methodologies and techniques that will be  needed to find new life forms either as living organisms or as some biological  signal in a sedimentary record. The highest latitude perennial spring system in a region of  thick, continuous permafrost resides in the Arctic archipelago of northern Canada.  At Expedition Fiord on Axel Heiberg Island there are two sets of springs that  provide useful analogs to liquid water habitats that may have existed on Mars. The  springs occur in a region with a mean annual air temperature of -15.5° C.  Spring flow rates and discharge temperatures are constant throughout the year.  Filamentous bacteria, biofilms and mineral precipitates occur in association with  the emergent, anoxic brine flowing from the springs. Preliminary data on the microbial composition of the spring  water has been obtained by applying the culture-independent approach. The majority  (76%) of the fifty-five environtaxa showed high sequence similarity to  Thiomicrospira species (sulfur-oxidizing organism). Other sequences show high  similarity to sulfate-reducing members of the delta (Desulfocapsa sp.) and epsilon  (Sulfurospirillum sp.) proteobacterium groups. A single sequence was found to have  99% sequence similarity to species of the genus Haloanaerobium a group of low G+C  Gram positive, anaerobic, halophiles (Rainey et al. 1995). A combined flow and thermal model of the Axel Heiberg springs  has demonstrated how such springs are able to persist throughout the year despite  temperatures that fall to below -50°C during the winter darkness. Dissolved  gases emanating from the springs provide evidence of the origin of the water for the  springs as well as placing constraints upon the residence time. The gas is composed  primarily of N2 with relative concentrations of Ar, Kr, and Xe almost identical to  air. No O2 is detectable and Ne is 60% of air values. We believe that ~50%  of this gas originates from the direct release of air by nearby alpine glaciers and  local ice sheets into groundwater that infiltrates sub-ice sedimentary  deposits.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451j031.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s069s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mars (Planet) -- Water</dc:subject><dc:subject>Springs -- Nunavut -- Axel Heiberg Island</dc:subject><dc:subject>Frozen ground -- Nunavut -- Axel Heiberg Island</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zb56b"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Assessment of concussion in athletes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Leclerc, Suzanne, 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. Concussion is an important public health problem.  The difficulty in recognizing mild concussions and the significant risk for repeat  injury make early detection critical to the management of the concussed athlete.  Since the 1990s, the use of neuropsychological tests has helped to measure cognitive  deficits from sports-related concussion more objectively. Given the cost and limited  availability of these tests, more user-friendly tools are needed. Objectives. (1) Develop and evaluate the capacity of a new  user-friendly neurocognitive tool called the McGill ACE to detect concussion in  college athletes. (2) Compare the sensitivity of the McGill ACE to a formal  neuropsychological test battery (NHL battery) for detection of concussion. (3)  Examine individual variations of post-concussion symptoms, in number and severity,  when concussed athletes are compared to their own baseline result. (4) Evaluate  whether the McGill ACE results differ according to gender. Design. Prospective study. Subjects. 313 athletes from the men's and women's varsity teams  at McGill University: 144 football players, 75 ice hockey players, 65 soccer  players, 19 basketball players, and 10 men's volleyball players. Interventions. On the pre-season exam, each athlete underwent  the McGill ACE evaluation for a baseline measurement. The football and men's ice  hockey players were also evaluated with the NHL test battery before contact began.  During the sports season, only the football and men's ice hockey players were  evaluated with both test batteries within 3 days of a concussion. Main results. The McGill ACE showed as significant sensitivity  as the formal neuropsychological battery (the NHL battery) in detecting cognitive  problems in a group of concussed college athletes. Post-concussion symptoms  significantly increased their total score in number and severity after a concussion,  and the appearance of some specific symptoms were significantly associated with a  new concussive injury. Finally, this study confirmed gender differences on a test  that may involve visual-spatial strategy. Conclusion. The McGill ACE is a valid neurocognitive test to  detect concussion and demonstrates the importance of evaluating PCS. This study  underscored the importance of comparing the results of neurocognitive testing to  each athlete's baseline result, and the even greater importance of such a comparison  when men and women are included in the same group.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d019f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zb56b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78tc49s"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Roles of c-Src and hDRR1 in glioma cell invasion</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Angers-Loustau, Alexandre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Malignant glioma is the major brain tumor in adults, and has a  poor prognosis. The failure to control invasive cell subpopulations may be the key  reason for local glioma recurrence after radical tumor resection, and may contribute  substantially to the failure of the other treatment modalities, such as radiation  therapy and chemotherapy. As a model for this invasion, we have implanted spheroids  from a human glioma cell line (U251) in three-dimensional collagen type I matrices  which these cells readily invade. First, we observed that the Src family kinase  specific pharmacological inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 significantly inhibited the  invasion of the cells in this assay, which was then confirmed by expression of two  inhibitors of Src family function, dominant inhibitory Src and CSK. Fluorescent  time-lapse microscopy on U251 cells stably expressing a YFP-actin construct shows  that PP2 caused the disappearance of peripheral membrane ruffles within minutes in  monolayer cultures, and induced the loss of actin bursting at the leading tip of the  invadopodium in three-dimensions. The inhibition of Src family activity is thus a  potential therapeutic approach to treating highly invasive malignant glioma. In the  second part, we analyze the role of a novel protein, hDRR1, which was cloned from a  functional screen of genes involved in glioma cell hyperinvasion. We show that hDRR1  localizes endogenously and when overexpressed to the actin cytoskeleton, via two  independent but homologous actin-localization domains. We also show that the  C-terminus of hDRR1 can bind to the light chain of MAP1A and MAP1B, and that hDRR1  overexpression in invading glioma cells results in a decrease in the percentage of  cells adopting a polarized morphology. These results suggest that hDRR1 represents a  novel actin-tubulin bridging protein that plays important roles in cytoskeletal  events.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n161f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tc49s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gd46m"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Singularity resolution and holography in string theory</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Astefanesei, Dumitru</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>String theory is to date the best candidate for the "theory  of everything" which would describe all four fundamental interactions,  including gravity, on the same footing. The general description of black holes and  other spacetimes with horizons remains a key aspect of quantum gravity that must be  addressed by a consistent theory, such as string theory. Also, the resolution of  singularities is a fundamental problem in a quantum theory of gravity. At the same  time, the recent revolution in observational cosmology creates a pressing need to  accommodate fundamental issues such as cosmic acceleration and cosmological horizons  within the framework of string theory. Therefore, the focus of this thesis is on new  aspects of gravitation from a point of view of string theory. In the first part of  this thesis, after an introduction in the subject, we deal with the resolution of  singularities in string theory. In particular, we describe one of the intrinsically  stringy mechanisms to resolve singularities, namely "Enhancon mechanism".  We generalize the basic enhancon solution by constructing solutions without  spherical symmetry. The second part of the thesis is devoted to investigating  different aspects of holography. The AdS/CFT correspondence is a concrete  realization of the holographic principle. Such correspondence is referred to as  duality in the sense that the supergravity (closed string) description of D-branes  and the field theory (open string) description are different formulations of the  same physics. This way, the infrared (IR) divergences of quantum gravity in bulk are  equivalent to ultraviolet (UV) divergences of dual field theory living on the  boundary. A novel method to renormalize the stress-energy of gravity and provide a  measure of gravitational mass was proposed. We used this method to study locally  asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes with nonzero NUT charge and charged black  holes configurations in de Sitter spacetime, respectively.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bp72f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gd46m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abn9997188"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Peer sexual harassment among adolescents : a developmental perspective</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lacasse, Anne S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main goal of this thesis was to enhance understanding of  potentially offensive sexual behaviors that occur among adolescent peers. Sexual  behaviors were divided into three categories: moderate---did not involve physical  touching; severe non-coercive---involved physical touching without the use of  coercion; and severe coercive---included physical touching that involved the use of  coercion. The first manuscript examined the incidence and tolerance of potentially  offensive sexual behaviors and results were comparable to those found in previous  studies on peer sexual harassment among adolescents. Boys tended to perpetrate  moderate behaviors to both boys and girls, whereas severe behaviors were perpetrated  by other-sex peers. Most importantly, experiencing a greater incidence of moderate  and severe sexual behaviors for girls, and severe sexual behaviors for boys, was  associated with having more other-sex friends. The second manuscript focused on  elements that influence the degree of upset over relatively ambiguous potentially  offensive sexual behaviors (i.e., moderate and severe non-coercive behaviors).  Targets with higher self-esteem tended to attribute more acceptable intents (e.g.,  thought I liked it) to the perpetrators of potentially offensive sexual behaviors.  Furthermore, targets attributed more acceptable intents to close friends than other  peers. However, targets were most upset when they attributed less acceptable intents  (e.g., wanted to have power over me) to the perpetrator, regardless of self-esteem  or relationship with the perpetrator. The final manuscript compared adolescent  victims and perpetrators of peer sexual coercion and a control group. Sexist  attitudes were highest in male perpetrators and in female victims. Furthermore,  victims of sexual coercion tended to report relatively high amounts of drug and  alcohol use, and both victims and perpetrators tended to be involved in more  non-sexual deviance than controls.

The three-dimensional structure of the  bacterial luciferase apo-enzyme determined by X-ray crystallography has revealed the  detailed landscape of the enzyme active site, however, the absence of a structure  with bound substrate has impeded the understanding of the enzyme mechanism by which  luciferase interacts with substrates and catalyzes their conversion into light  emission. This thesis describes three research projects that focus on the molecular  conformation of flavin in the active site of bacterial luciferase. Based on  available structure-activity data as guidance, the first project deduces the binding  conformation of the luciferase bound flavin by computer modeling. The second  research project investigates the binding microenvironment of flavin, and assigns  specific functions to the structural modules (amino acid residues), which coordinate  flavin in the proposed model. The third project verifies the validity of the  proposed model with mutational analysis of the binding site residues, and points out  the possibility of altering the visible emission color of bacterial bioluminescence  by redesigning luciferase. The last chapter concludes the thesis with the discussion  of the structural mechanism of luciferase catalysis, and the perspectives for the  engineering of luciferase variants that emit different light colors.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gd47w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w277d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q445k"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fate of the HIV-specific immune response starting in primary infection</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Alter, Galit</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two decades into the epidemic caused by the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and this virus has infected nearly 1% of the world's  population. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has transformed the  epidemic from a death sentence into a chronic infection. However restricted access,  complicated regimens, drug resistance, and long-term toxicities are all impediments  to life long therapy for all those infected. These factors stress the need for  vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies that may be used in conjunction with  antiretroviral drugs for the optimization of patient care. It is clear that cytotoxic T lymphocytes are potent suppressors  of viral replication throughout the clinical course of HIV infection. The research  presented in this thesis focuses on the characterization of immune responses at  different stages of HIV infection in order to gain a better understanding of the  pattern of changes that occur within the host response to virus on and off therapy  following infection. The HIV specific immune response broadens during the first two  months of infection, suggesting that while it is induced early during acute  infection, the antiviral response evolves to respond to the virus. HIV specific  immune responses can be preserved if HAART is initiated while the subject is in  early PI, and appears to depend on the preservation of HIV specific CD4+ T cell  help. Subjects remaining untreated in PI experience significant perturbations  (expansions and contractions) in responses to individual HIV peptides over a 1 year  period, which is characterized by an overall contraction in the breadth and  persistence in the magnitude of their antiviral effector activity. New strategies that map the specificity, breadth and magnitude  of the HIV specific immune response testing all HIV expressed gene products were  evaluated. The novel approach will strengthen conclusions derived from the types of  studies conducted for this thesis by detecting all reactivities present in subjects  being tested in an unbiased manner. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion in  response to epitopes previously unknown to be immunogenic are frequently detected  using this screening method in subjects in the chronic phase of infection. Use of  this technique demonstrates that HAART-naive HIV+ chronically infected subjects in  asymptomatic disease target Gag predominantly and possess variable breadths and  magnitudes of responses to HIV. Taken together, the data presented in this thesis have improved  our understanding of the pattern of the evolution of the immune response over time.  Data presented here have implications for HIV infected patient management, by  providing new information useful for deciding whether the immunological benefit of  initiating HAART early in infection outweighs toxicities associated with long term  treatment. Finally, new strategies for the detection of HIV specific immune  responses will further our ability to characterize the global HIV specific immune  responses at all stages of HIV disease.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bernard, Nicole F.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827c21p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q445k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aws859g152"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Joining Si₃N₄ to FA-129 iron aluminide</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brochu, Mathieu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Joints between dissimilar materials are characterized  particularly by compositional gradients and microstructural changes, which yield  large variations in chemical, physical and mechanical properties across the joint.  The joining of dissimilar materials is therefore more complex than the joining of  similar materials. In this project, the joining procedure, from the interaction  between the different components in a joint to the determination of the mechanical  properties was applied to the Si3N4/FA-129 system. This iron aluminide intermetallic  alloy (FA-129), was developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) to have high  temperature properties with good room temperature ductility. This intermetallic is  replacing high strength ferritic stainless steel (SS) in moderate strength  applications due to cost and property reasons. Joints between SS and Si3N4 are  already used industrially and this project was to evaluate the potential to replace  these Si3N 4/SS joints by those of Si3N4/FA-129. Broadly stated, the results obtained during this project are as  follows: (I) The E2 energy for Si3N4 ceramic was calculated to be 3.01 keV. (II) The  wetting of iron aluminide alloy by copper has been achieved and the spreading and  reaction kinetics are influenced by the presence of Cr as alloying element. (III)  The penetration and decohesion of the FA-129 microstructure is significantly reduced  by the utilization of a Cu alloy containing a high titanium concentration. (IV) An  active brazing alloy containing a high active element content can be fabricated by  an electroless deposition technique. (V) The melting behavior of the powder was  characterized and complete melting occurs in a multi-step process at different  temperatures, which are a function of the heating rate. (VI) The strength of joint  produced by brazing Si3N4 to itself using the composite powder reached 400 MPa.  (VII) Direct brazing of Si 3N4 to FA-129 was shown to be unsuccessful and therefore  a soft Cu interlayer was inserted to absorb residual stresses. The maximum joint  strength reached was 160 MPa. (VIII) Partial Transient Liquid Phase Bonding was  successfully applied to the Si3N4/FA-129 system using a nickel interlayer. The  conventional silicide and nitride layers were not observed as the silicide layer  dissolved into the nickel core at high temperature. The strength of the assembly was  measured and a strength of 80 MPa was obtained, independent of the joining  parameters.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>ew, Robin A.

Many aspects of these rivers are not  well known, particularly the processes of their creation and maintenance. The term  wandering describes gravel or cobble bedded rivers, transitional between braided and  meandering, with multiple channel sections around semi-permanent islands connected  by single channel sections. This dissertation investigates the controls on the  characteristics of wandering rivers within the Miramichi region of New Brunswick  through time and at three nested spatial scales. At the scale of rivers, three factors appear to be needed for  wandering to occur: (1) wide valleys, (2) channel energy between braiding and  meandering, and (3) avulsion triggers, frequent overbank flows caused by icejams in  the Miramichi. Principal component analysis showed that larger wandering rivers  displayed greater anabranching intensity than smaller rivers, perhaps related to  higher stage ice jams within larger rivers. At the scale of channels, the wandering pattern of the Renous  River was found to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, with channel creation  balanced by channel abandonment. The anabranch cycle model was developed to  illustrate the temporal dynamics of anabranch creation, maintenance and abandonment  within wandering rivers. Also at the channel scale, principal component analysis of  channel reaches within the Renous River displayed differences in grain size and  hydraulic efficiency between side-channels and main-channels. Energy and sediment  mobility within side-channels was related to their formation, maintenance and  abandonment. Energy and sediment mobility within main-channels was related to mega  bedforms called bedwaves. The apex of some bedwaves occurred at  diffluences. At the scale of channel elements, diffluences are stable where a  large bar is formed and accretes upstream, creating a large reservoir of sediment  upstream of anabranch channels to buffer their degradation. Where diffluences are  unstable, a large bar forms within one anabranch channel to partially block flow and  may cause its abandonment. The dissertation illustrates that within wandering  rivers, processes occurring at multiple spatial and temporal scales interact to  create and maintain the pattern.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lapointe, Michel</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wg466.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm177</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Braided rivers -- New Brunswick -- Miramichi River Region</dc:subject><dc:subject>Miramichi River Region (N.B.)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Meandering rivers -- New Brunswick -- Miramichi River Region</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2f75r8480"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Kitamori Kazō : theologian of the pain of god</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Toru, Asakawa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study introduces Kitamori's concept of "the Pain of  God" and provides an occasion to dialogue between a pioneering Japanese  theologian and theologians interested in the theologia crucis. By "the Pain of  God," Kitamori attempted to reorient the Christian account of God to the cross  of Jesus Christ. As this expression had in the beginning a personal character but  later became theological and critical, this study also follows the same line of  development. Part I explains how the notion of "the Pain of God"  was formulated in Kitamori's personal life. His search for the certainty of faith  culminated in a mystical encounter with the crucified Christ. Kitamori was convinced  that through the crucified Christ God embraced him who, being "outside" of  God, was therefore an enemy of God. This contradictory embrace was experienced by  Kitamori as "the Pain of God." Part I explores the ways in which Kitamori  tried to incorporate this insight into his own itinerary of faith and into his early  theological education. Part II shows how Kitamori elaborated a soteriological model  based on the "pain of God" through critical engagement with Reformed  thinkers, such as Calvin, Schleiermacher, and Barth. It traces his attempt to give  the concept of the pain of God an axiomatical place in the doctrines of creation,  justification and sanctification, and to explain the inner relation between the  immediate love of the creator, the mediate love of Christ and the victorious love of  the Spirit. Part III turns to Kitamori's engagement with church and culture  in Japan. Kitamori was convinced that all nations are invited to take part in the  history of deepening and actualizing the message of the Gospel in and through their  own culture. Regional contributions and limits must be taken in account according to  an adequate criterion. This criterion is, according to Kitamori, the pain of God.  His critique of the Non-church movement, and his analysis of leading Japanese  novelists, provide two windows into his approach. Part IV offers some critical evaluation. After examination of  both the favorable and unfavorable receptions of Kitamori's theology, it asks to  what extent Kitamori was influenced by Buddhism, by Nishida's philosophy and by  Hegel. It also places Kitamori's ideas over against some contemporary thinkers on  divine impassibility. Then it concludes with a brief recapitulation of his  theological contribution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Farrow, Douglas</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021f71t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75r8480</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Suffering of God</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kitamori, Kazō, 1916-</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n165j"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Chemical composition distribution of binary and multicomponent copolymers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Anantawaraskul, Siripon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Chemical composition distribution (CCD) of copolymers describes  the distribution of average comonomer content among copolymer chains. This  information is very important as CCD can significantly influence physical properties  of copolymers. The main goal of this study is to further our understanding of the  CCD of copolymers. The present understanding of CCD of multicomponent copolymers is  very limited and there are no analytical equations capable of describing this  distribution. In the present study, analytical expressions for describing the CCDs  of random multicomponent copolymers are developed using a statistical approach. The  results from this theoretical expression are validated with the results from  Stockmayer's distribution and Monte Carlo simulations for limiting  cases. In the case of semi-crystalline binary copolymers, temperature  rising elution fractionation (Tref) and crystallization analysis fractionation  (Crystat) can be used for the estimation of CCD. The effects of chain microstructure  and operating conditions on these techniques are investigated using a series of  ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers with well-defined microstructures. Both molecular  weight and comonomer content are shown to significantly affect the shape of Crystaf  profiles. Fortunately, comonomer content is the main determining factor for Crystaf  peak temperature, permitting the use reliable calibration curves for this technique.  A Crystaf model based on the average ethylene sequence distribution in the chains is  proposed and the results from this model show very good agreement with the present  and previously reported experimental data. The typical operating conditions used in Tref and Crystaf  analyses are found to lead to fractionation conditions that are far from the  thermodynamic equilibrium. Consequently, crystallization kinetics can strongly  influence the CCD estimated with Tref and Crystaf. Sample cocrystallization during  analysis is also considered as it may interfere with the fractionation processes of  both techniques. The similarity of chain crystallizabilities and fast cooling rates  are found to promote cocrystallization. Cocrystallization under a certain conditions  can be so strong that it can seriously affect the interpretation of the CCD measured  with Crystaf and Tref.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dealy, J.

Nevertheless, it was only about 1760--1770 that the  conditions allowing for the emergence of a myth of the unhappy writer were gathered.  This myth affirms the christlike vocation of the author and associates greatness to  unhappiness. This thesis seeks to understand this mythical phenomenon within a  historical perspective. The first part recounts the three principal families of  topoi associated, before 1770, to authorial unhappiness. These three series are  those of melancholy, poverty and persecution. In the chapters concerning these  topoi, the objective is to bring to light their specificity and also the  representations and the exempla that they call to mind. Moreover, the goal is to  identify the connections that are at work, in discourses, between melancholy and  genius on the one hand, poverty and truth on the other hand, and finally persecution  and merit. Even if one can't already consider that these various discursive  connections are sufficient to build a mysticism of the unhappy man of letters, they  still can be studied, in their context, for what they are: a pool of topoi where the  writers would soon draw some discursive materials, and from which this myth will get  its historical acceptability, its obviousness. The second part of the thesis is  devoted to the study of this obviousness. After Rousseau, some believe that  unhappiness is inseparable from genius, and that literary vocation is a curse  spelled on the poet. From then on, the object of study is not anymore to follow each  topos as if it was a separate thread, but instead, to see how all this acquires the  value of commonplace (lieu commun ) between 1770 and 1840, in addition to imposing  itself as an horizon of meaning.

Post-revolutionary Cuba has used  measures of the health of individuals as a metaphor for the health of the body  politic, effectively linking the efficacy of socialism and its governmental  apparatus to the health conditions of the population. The creation of a model of  health care that was informed by the revolutionaries' vision of a new social order,  which in turn would help to create an ' hombre nuevo' (new man and new woman),  effectively shaped a model of citizenship that was associated with a particular  notion of health, and in addition defined a system of socialist values and ideals.  Thirty months of ethnographic field research in the city of Havana focused  specifically on the Family Physician-and-Nurse Program---an innovative primary  health care program in which family physician-and-nurse teams live and work on the  city block or in the rural community they serve. Drawing on my ethnographic  findings, I explore two key themes. First, I examine how state policy, enacted  through the government's public health campaigns, has affected individual lives,  changing the relationship among citizens, government institutions, public  associations and the state. Secondly, I examine how the collapse of the Soviet bloc  (post-1989) and the strengthening of the US embargo is changing the relationship  between socialist health-policies and individual practices and how it has redefined  how state power becomes enacted through and upon individual bodies. In particular, I  examine how individual practices play an important role in the maintenance of Cuba's  population-health profile, as individual citizens give priority to their own health  care needs, both material (such as food, medicines and medical supplies) and  spiritual (including the re-emergence of religious</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lock, Margaret</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386j69s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j6143</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health behavior -- Cuba -- Havana</dc:subject><dc:subject>Primary health care -- Cuba -- Havana</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical policy -- Cuba -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405s983d"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Philosophical and mystical dimensions in the thought and writings of Mîr Findiriskî (ca. 970-10501560-1640) with special reference to his Qaṣîdah Ḥikmîyah (Philosophical ode)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Namazi, M.

He was a classmate  and close friend of Mir Damad (950/1543 1041/1631) and Shaykh-i Baha'i (953/1546  1030/1622). Beside the other major juridical, traditional, philosophical, and  mystical accomplishments of the School of Isfahan, the philosophical and mystical  contributions of Mir Findiriski are invaluable. Although he was not a fertile  writer, the uniqueness of his works has drawn remarkable attention. Many considered  him a great teacher of peripatetic philosophy. This thesis aims to display Mir  Findiriski's achievements in these fields and attempts to exhibit the originality in  his exceptional mystico-philosophical ode (qaṣidah  ḥikmiyyah ). In this ode Mir Findiriski summarized the principles of  ḥikmah. Considering his mystical and scientific writings, and various  narrative accounts of his spirituality and super-natural powers, his reputation as a  great philosopher and mystic of the Ṣafavid period appears to be well  deserved. This thesis evaluates various aspects of his life in some detail and a  number of ambiguities surrounding the corpus of his writings are resolved through a  complete list of his works. Finally, an overview of his doctrines on ontological as  well as epistemological problems in his work is presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ormsby, Eric</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v8381066.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405s983d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mīr Findariskī, Abū al-Qāsim ibn Mīrzā Buzurg, d. 1640?</dc:subject><dc:subject>Philosophy, Islamic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93gz99q"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A phenomenological exploration of the motivational factors underlying the career transitions of midlife career women</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Norton, Judith Ann, 1947-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research project explores the motivations of women's  voluntary career transitions at midlife.

This voluntary  transition was initiated for reasons other than an upward mobility within the same  occupation. The data were analysed and reported using the six step phenomenological  approach described by Moustakas (1994).

This thesis introduces the concept of  segregating municipal solid wastes (MSW) according to their major heavy metals and  their metal's adsorption compatibility. Each segregated portion can be disposed in a  different landfill compartment to minimize leaching of these heavy metals with the  greatest bioactive impact. The validity of the concept was evaluated by batch and  column retention mobility studies using copper (Cu) alone or with either lead (Pb)  or cadmium (Cd) in solutions bearing various pHs. This was supported by selective  sequential extraction (SSE) to determine the affinity to specific liner fractions.  The following summarizes the procedure used. Beforehand, a soil column test using sand with 5 and 10%  bentonite was conducted to develop an equation predicting liner permeability, k ,  under simulated field conditions. The column permeability test revealed that a liner  with 5% bentonite resulted in a k value which respected the North American criteria  of 10-5 m/s. In the batch experiments, solutions with Cu alone or with Cd or  Pb, adjusted to pH of 3.7, 5.5 or 7.5, were applied to sand liners with 0%, 5% or  10% bentonite, having CEC's of 2.0, 6.4, and 10.8 (cmol(+) kg-1 ), respectively.  Bentonite, pH and Pb significantly affected Cu adsorption. Cu was adsorbed by the  liners at pH &lt;6.5 whereas Cu precipitated at pH &gt;6.5. Cu retention was  higher in the presence of Cd than in that of Pb, at all combinations of CEC and pH.  Competition between metals was greater in liners with lower CEC and therefore fewer  adsorption sites. Limiting Pb in a landfill compartment can improve Cu adsorption at  pH's below the precipitating threshold. In the SSE procedure, the liner samples were centrifuged,  decanted from their solutions and each adsorption fraction analyzed for Cu content.  Results indicated that the carbonate fraction adsorbed more Cu, and that Pb  significantly increased the mobility of Cu due to competition for exchangeable  sites. In the final soil column test using a sand liner with 5%  bentonite, the leachate had an initial pH of 3.7. The leaching test confirmed the  compatibility of Cu with Cd. The leaching of Cu was greater in the presence of Pb.  Total metals in leachate was greater for the Cu-Cd solutions than for the Cu-Pb,  because of Cd's relatively high mobility. The sequential extraction results showed  again that the carbonate fraction dominated metal adsorption. Total heavy metal  leaching followed the order of Cu/Cd &gt; Cu/Pb &gt; Cu alone. Thus, disposing MSW in landfill compartments based on their  heavy metal compatibility can minimize migration of heavy metals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barrington, Suzelle</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hv832.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f167w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sanitary landfills -- Leaching</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sanitary landfills -- Linings</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heavy metals -- Environmental aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak3569508x"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Synergy between HGF and ErbB2neu promotes epithelial cell invasion</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khoury, Hanane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The ErbB-2/neu receptor tyrosine kinase is involved in normal  tissue development. However, this receptor has been implicated in the genesis of  human breast and renal carcinomas, where ErbB2 is amplified in 20--30% of human  breast cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. Using the non-transformed MDCK  epithelial cell model, I have established that a deregulated activated ErbB2/Neu  receptor (NeuNT) but not overexpression of the wild type (WT) receptor induces cell  dispersal and motility, accompanied by the breakdown of cell-cell junctions and  E-cadherin internalization, in addition to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.  This phenotype can be reversed following treatment of the cells with a  pharmacological inhibitor of MEK, indicating that MEK dependent pathways are  involved in the NeuNT-induced remodeling of cell-cell junctions. In  three-dimensional cultures of MDCK cells, NeuNT but not WT ErbB2 triggers a  morphogenic response that correlates with recruitment and increased phosphorylation  levels of the Shc adapter protein. This demonstrates that the deregulated ErbB2/NT  receptor induces a distinct biological response when compared to the wild type  receptor and induces the loss of epithelial architecture observed in  carcinomas. Invasive morphogenesis downstream from the Met/HGF receptor is  modulated through a sustained phosphorylation of the Gab1 docking protein and of  downstream kinase (Erk). In contrast, a transient phosphorylation of Gab1 and Erk  induced by EGF is not sufficient to promote a morphogenic response. In Chapter III,  I demonstrate that NeuNT but not the WT ErbB2 receptor display elevated and  sustained levels of Gab1 and Erk phosphorylation which correlates with their ability  to promote invasive morphogenesis. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation analyses  provide evidence for the recruitment of Gab1 to ErbB2/Neu in a Grb2-dependent and  Grb2-independent manner. To identify physiologically relevant factors that synergize with  ErbB2, I established that HGF, the Met receptor ligand, promotes the disruption and  invasion of NeuNT-induced epithelial structures in three dimensional matrix  cultures. Moreover HGF synergizes with NeuNT, enhancing the invasive potential of  NeuNT expressing cells ten fold through Matrigel. HGF treatment of NeuNT expressing  cells promotes a decrease in E-cadherin protein, and can be blocked or reversed by  treatment with the MEK inhibitor, UO126, establishing the involvement of  MEK-dependent pathways in this process. These results demonstrate that physiological  signals downstream from HGF/Met cooperate with deregulated ErbB2/Neu to enhance the  malignant phenotype promoting a more stable epithelial-mesenchymal transition and  enhanced cell invasion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Park, Morag</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cd652.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569508x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
