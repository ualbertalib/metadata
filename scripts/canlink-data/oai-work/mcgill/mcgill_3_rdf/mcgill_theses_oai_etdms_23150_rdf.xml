The nature of this relationship, however, has not yet been determined. This study examines the relationship between feature list production frequency and feature relevance, or informativeness. Also tested was the hypothesis, inherent in current concept theories, that different feature types bear different relationships to a given concept, and vary widely in their informativeness. An overall relationship between production frequency and relevance was found, but is attributable to significant correlations present for only a subset of the feature types under consideration. The findings contradict the predictions of two earlier studies; namely, that parts should be the most informative feature type, and that feature type informativeness should depend on the object category. These results are discussed with respect to both feature list studies, and general theories of concepts.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644s73t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956h13z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Concepts</dc:subject><dc:subject>Semantics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36tz75q"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Why scepticism is not reasonable</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kermode, Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis is argued that Wittgenstein's response, unlike either Moore's or Wright's, is the right answer to scepticism about the existence of an external world. Moore offers his brief 'proof' as an alternative to developed, theoretical responses, which fall prey to higher-order scepticism. As it fails to address the intuitions which give rise to scepticism, however, it seems merely dogmatic. Wright's more detailed argument invokes a principle to delineate factual from non-factual claims and thereby turns the sceptical argument on itself, but depends on our accepting this fundamental epistemological principle as a convention, which the sceptic need not. Wittgenstein declines to legitimate the sceptic by arguing with her, but presupposes that she has made a mistake. This mistake resides in a failure to acknowledge the level of agreement among speakers on which language depends, which includes taking it to be the case that there is an external world.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kh54c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz75q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Skepticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apv63g132b"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Boyle and Locke on primary and secondary qualities</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Huang, Bin, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis attempts to describe the similarities and the differences between Boyle's position and Locke's on the primary and secondary quality distinction. It is in the Corpuscular Hypothesis that Boyle draws the distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Locke not only accepts the Corpuscular Hypothesis but also presents some arguments to support it. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 respectively examine the differences in the positions of Boyle and Locke on primary and secondary qualities, in their lists of primary qualities, the terminologies they employ, and the scopes of their discussions. Little attention has previously been paid to these differences. Chapter 3 discusses the essence of the primary/secondary quality distinction. My point is that the distinction between primary and secondary qualities is really a distinction between two kinds of powers for both Boyle and Locke.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv38t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g132b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Boyle, Robert, 1627-1691</dc:subject><dc:subject>Locke, John, 1632-1704</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903111d"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of mental practice on the performance of male water polo players at different skill levels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Douka, Angeliki, 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of mental practice on the shooting accuracy performance of male water polo players at three skill levels. Thirty-six right handed athletes from the Quebec League, assigned by experienced coaches to novice, intermediate and elite groups according to their overall water polo playing ability, served as subjects. They were tested on shooting accuracy by the average score of ten shots in the beginning of the study, after a two-week mental practice treatment, and after a one-week break with no treatment. A 3 way ANOVA with repeated measures on the last factor was conducted on the shooting accuracy scores. Those who received the mental practice program had significantly higher post-treatment scores than their control group counterparts who had received a relaxation training program during the treatment period. As noted above, the experimental group improved significantly from Pre to Post1 test-time, and there was no change in performance between the two Post-tests. There was no significant difference in shooting performance between Intermediate and Elite skill groups but both of them scored significantly better than the Novice group.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st853.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903111d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Water polo -- Coaching</dc:subject><dc:subject>Athletic ability -- Testing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Visualization</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sports -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20st86c"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Finite-element modelling of the fluid-structure interaction between the ear canal and eardrum</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Day, Jennifer L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this work mathematical modelling methods are formulated in order to examine how sound pressures in the ear canal interact with displacements on the eardrum. Existing finite-element code is altered and new code developed to deal with the acoustics of the ear canal and the mathematics of the fluid-structure interaction problem. A finite-element model of the human ear canal and eardrum using simplified geometry is developed as an initial approach to the coupled problem. The preliminary finite-element model consists of a cylindrical tube attached to a circular plate, with appropriate material properties assigned to each part. The coupled ear canal/eardrum problem is analyzed at several frequencies. Output is discussed in view of results obtained for eigenvalue analyses of both ear canal and eardrum as separate problems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Funnell, W.

Currently, most finite element packages require user intervention to assure that the mesh density is appropriate for the device. This requires that the user be knowledgeable in finite-element analysis and magnetic device design. The approach introduced here uses a neural network which is trained to recognize significant geometric features and material properties from the description of a magnetic device. Based on its knowledge of meshing rules the neural network computes the mesh density required for an optimum mesh of the device. The neural network acquires this knowledge from examples of "ideal" meshes. The system requires no user intervention and can be used either independently or as a preprocessor to an adaptive mesh refinement system.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn009z97j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c390n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fm828"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La relation entre l'évolution du salaire réel et de l'emploi : Montréal, 1963-1982</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dagenais, Vincent</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this research, the short-period relationship between employment and real wages (i.e. average hourly wages divided by industrial product prices) has been analysed, using monthly data for total manufacturing and selected industries in Montreal, 1963 to 1982.

Phrenic inflow (Qphr) was controlled with a constant pressure source and the pressure (Pa) was decreased in steps to obtain the pressure-flow relation (P-Q). The vasculture was maximally vasodilated and contractions occurred spontaneously (n = 6) or were induced by twitches (n = 12) or tetanic trains (n = 7). The P-Q relations with contractions were compared to those with vasodilatation alone. With spontaneous contractions, the pressure intercept decreased from 47.35 $ pm$ 17.44 to 33.77 $ pm$ 16.82 mmHg (p $&lt;$ 0.05) and the slope remained unchanged so that at Pa = 100 mmHg, Qphr increased from 36.22 $ pm$ 34.85 to 43.91 $ pm$ 38.22 ml/min/100g (p $&lt;$ 0.05). Flow increased slightly with twitches but not with trains. We also elicited twitches, 12/min and 60/min trains in vascularly isolated gastrocnemius muscles (n = 6) and found no change in flow.

The selenide thus formed was further methylated at the selenium atom with methyl iodide in methanol in the presence of sodium tetraphenylborate. After several recrystallizations the selenonium analytes were characterized by AAS, FT-IR, $ sp1$H-NMR, $ sp{13}$C-NMR, FAB-MS and LAMMA spectroscopic techniques and used as standards for analytical methods development. The analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography with atomic absorption detection. The chromatography on a cynopropyl silica bonded phase was optimized for mobile phase composition by response surface analysis. The resulting surface response plots permitted a differentiation between the mechanisms of action of two mobile phase modifiers: triethylamine and trimethylsulfonium iodide. The improvement in chromatographic efficiency resulted in two to three fold decrease in the limit of detection. An extraction procedure with liquefied phenol was evaluated for the determination, by HPLC-AAS, of traces of selenonium cations in biological samples.

A field study was carried out to observe the effects of rates and methods of added urea and KCl on the forms and distribution of N and K in soils, and on yields and nutrient uptake of silage corn. Generally, the fixation of NH$ sb4 sp{+}$ was increased by added N but reduced by added K and vice versa. One exception was that added K increased NH$ sb4 sp{+}$ fixation when NH$ sb4$Cl was the N source. In comparison with NH$ sb4$Cl, urea resulted in greater K$ sp{+}$ fixation but less NH$ sb4 sp{+}$ fixation. Band placement of urea and KCl showed apparent accumulation of NH$ sb4$-N and NO$ sb3$-N, and exchangeable K$ sp{+}$ in the fertilizer bands, particularly early in the growing season. On the other hand, band placement resulted in lower levels of available N and K in soil between the bands in comparison with broadcast. Yields of silage corn and nutrient uptake values were increased by N and K fertilizers, except for one soil in the first year. Band placement of urea was superior in the case of frequent and light rainfall but inferior with dry surface soil conditions followed by a relatively large rainfall 3 or 4 days after application. In the latter condition, banding K resulted in less yields on one soil, and banding the two fertilizers together further reduced N utilization on another soil. Additions of K suppressed Ca and Mg uptake but did not influence N uptake, whereas K uptake was usually enhanced by added N.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193b15k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g629j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corn -- Yields</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corn -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corn -- Fertilizers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corn -- Soils</dc:subject><dc:subject>Potassium fertilizers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nitrogen fertilizers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gf163"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Studies on the maturation of the measles virus hemagglutinin protein</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Blain, Françoise, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) encoded by measles virus (MV) is a type II integral membrane protein that is expressed at the infected cell surface. The maturation of HA was studied in infected Vero cells. HA oligomerized into a disulfide-linked homodimer with a t$ sb{1/2}$ of 30 min. The rate of transport of HA to the medial Golgi complex was also examined using endoglycosidase-H and found to occur with a t$ sb{1/2}$ of 2 hr. Genes encoding two mutant HA proteins shortened at their C-terminal end by either 18 (HA$ Delta$18) or 223 (HA$ Delta$223) amino acids were constructed and studied in a transient expression system in COS cells. HA$ Delta$18 was able to assemble into homodimers while HA$ Delta$223 remained in a monomeric form in the absence of the reducing agent DTT. Hemadsorption assays revealed that neither of the mutants were functional even though HA$ Delta$18 was transported to the cell surface, as determined by chymotrypsin sensitivity. These studies showed that the C-terminal ectodomain of the HA protein is essential to its proper folding and assembly into homodimers, and for its transport to the cell surface. In addition, the last 18 amino acids were shown to be important to hemadsorption and might therefore be part of the MV HA functional domain.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n2040319.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gf163</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fc872"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Floral development and fruit set of tomato as influenced by mini-tunnels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Champagne, Linda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Field experiments were established during the 1988 and 1989 growing seasons, to determine the effect of mini-tunnel management systems on floral development and fruit set of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Two types of floral abnormalities reported to be caused by temperatures above 30$ sp circ$C were observed, namely: style exsertion and splitting of the antheridial cone. Clear vented and white non-vented mini-tunnels reduced the incidence of both these abnormalities compared to the controls in 1988. As a consequence these two types of mini-tunnels also had the greatest percentage fruit set and total marketable yield of the first three clusters. In 1989, none of the mini-tunnels tested significantly increased percentage fruit set or marketable yield. The cultivar Springset produced ripe fruits an average of 4 days before Hope#1 and 7 days before Celebrity in both 1988 and 1989.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623j001b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc872</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tomatoes -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tomatoes -- Frost protection</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vh81d"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pharmacological investigation on the composite nature of the electroretinogram</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guité, Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research project deals with the electroretinogram (ERG) and the role played by the oscillatory potentials (OPs) in its generation. Investigators are still debating over the cellular origin of these fast components but the current view is that the OPs are produced by structures different from those involved in the genesis of the b-wave (positive wave of the ERG). Another claim would be that the OPs should be considered the primary electrical events produced by the retina and their summation would yield the b-wave. A pharmacological approach was chosen to investigate the OP-b-wave relationship. 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (APB) and glycine were injected intravitreally in rabbits. Our results indicate that the b-wave and OPs demonstrate identical chemical sensitivity. These findings could support the claim that the b-wave results from the summation of the OPs.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z898q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vh81d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A05741s996"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Angular distributions and kinetic energies of fission products from the 238U(12C,f) reaction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Todd, Jamie R.

Evidence of incomplete momentum transfer led to a model treating fission products as being the result of two fission inducing processes: complete fusion resulting in compound nucleus formation, and an $ alpha$-transfer incomplete fusion process. The average angular anisotropies for each of the two processes were calculated to be, $ omega sb{ rm CF}$ = 2.57, and $ omega sb alpha$ = 1.71, respectively, which fit well to the experimental data. A new method was developed to estimate the total kinetic energy release of heavy-ion fission events leading to individual fission products from the above reaction. The average total $ langle$E$ sb{ rm k}{ rangle} approx 195$ MeV calculated using the new method is consistent with other experimental data, and with theories regarding heavy-ion induced fission.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784m92t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741s996</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Nuclear</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Nuclear</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv935417k"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Spatial sampling and vertical variability effects on microwave radiometer rainfall estimates</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Turner, Barry John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Three-dimensional radar data for three Florida storms are used with a radiative transfer model to simulate observations at 19 GHz by a nadir pointing, satellite bourne microwave radiometer. Estimates were made of spatial sampling errors due to both horizontal and vertical variability of the precipitation. Calibrated radar data were taken as realistic representations of rainfall fields. The optimal conversion between microwave brightness temperature and rainfall rate was highly sensitive to the spatial resolution of observations. Retrievals were made from the simulated microwave measurements using rainfall retrieval functions optimized for each resolution and for each storm case. There is potential for microwave radiometer measurements from the planned TRMM satellite to provide better 'snapshot' estimates than area-threshold VIS/IR methods. Variability of the vertical profile of precipitation did not seriously reduce accuracy. However, it is crucial that calibration of retrieval methods be done with ground truth of the same spatial resolution.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zv50v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935417k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Remote Sensing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vs100"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The language of loss : reading medieval mystical literature</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thomson, David (David Ker)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the unfortunate corollaries of poststructuralist theorizing about literary texts has been the equation of a skepticism concerning language with a skepticism concerning meaning. The menace of unrestrained relativism has tended to polarize the critical community into proponents of a 'logo-diffuse' onto-epistemology and proponents of a 'logo-centric' one, and critical practice has followed this lead. The critic who attempts to situate literature within the parameters of such a debate is likely to fail unless he or she appeals to a much more extensive discourse, one which antedates the provincial contours of the current discussion. Medieval mysticism is a significant entry in the lineage of influence which comprises the western tradition. This thesis looks at the apophatic or negative strategies of mystical texts in order to locate meaning in the interplay of negation and affirmation with which they are concerned.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67js329.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vs100</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mysticism and literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Literature, Medieval -- History and criticism -- Theory, etc</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mysticism -- History -- Middle Ages, 600-1500</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mw41h"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hydrogen diffusion in amorphous Ni60Zr40</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhao, Yi, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Electrochemical methods have been used to measure the solubility and diffusivity of hydrogen in amorphous $Ni sb{60}Zr sb{40}$ over a wide range of hydrogen concentrations.

Tin and tungsten mineralization forms distinctive orebodies hosted by granite and calc-silicate hornfeis, respectively. Three styles of cassiterite mineralization were recognized: vein style, breccia style, and subeconomic pegmatite style. Vein and pegmatite styles of mineralization are typically associated with extensive potassic alteration (biotite and K-feldspar) whereas the breccia style of mineralization is associated with sericitization (muscovite). Two styles of scheelite mineralization were recognized: vein style and veinlet style alteration. The first is hosted by calcareous rocks whereas the second is hosted by K-feldspathic alteration zones separating skarn from the leucogranite. Hydrothermal activity during and after formation of the breccia mainly involved circulation of aqueous and carbonic fluids that were largely immiscible owing to the lower pressure/temperature conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nc41x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732db08w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583xw18q"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>RP-HPLC separation and kinetics of the decomposition products of tryptophan amadori compound</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Forage, Nazhat George</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Amadori rearrangement product (ARP) of tryptophan with glucose was synthesized according to a published procedure, and its decomposition was studied at two different concentrations and at two temperatures, 110$ sp circ$C and 140$ sp circ$C over a period of 6 hrs.
