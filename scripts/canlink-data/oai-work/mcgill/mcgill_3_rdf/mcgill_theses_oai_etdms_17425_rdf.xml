Ischemic cardiomyopathy due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world today. Vasoactive factors are increasingly being recognized not only as contributors to atherosclerotic plaque formation, but also to cardiac function and remodeling following ischemic cardiac injury. Urotensin II (UII) is one such vasoactive factor. UII possesses a wide range of cardiovascular effects, from contraction of the rat aorta to complete cardiovascular collapse in cynomolgus monkeys. UII binds a seven transmembrane spanning G-protein coupled receptor termed UT. Expression of UII is significantly elevated in the hearts of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Recent reports have also shown increased plasma levels of the peptide in patients with CHF, and these levels correlated with the severity of the disease. This project was designed to investigate the role of UII and UT in both atherosclerosis and CHF. To this end, UII expression was evaluated both in a model of CHF in the rat, and in human atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries and aortae. Furthermore, the pathophysiological role of urotensin-I1 in CHF was investigated, with the use of a selective UII antagonist, SB-611812. Finally, genetically modified mice deficient in either ApoE, UT, or both genes, were evaluated to study the role of UII/UT signaling in a model of atherosclerosis. We found that UII and its receptor, UT, were both significantly elevated in a model of CHF induced by coronary artery ligation. UII antagonism significantly attenuated mortality, cardiac dysfunction, and hypertrophy. This was associated with a significant decrease in cardiac fibrosis. We next went on to demonstrate that UII and UT were significantly elevated in human atherosclerotic carotid arteries and aortae. Finally, we demonstrated that deletion of the UT gene in mice deficient for ApoE exacerbates atherosclerosis of the aorta. Furthermore, this was associated with significantly increased hyperlipidemia and organ hypertrophy as well as significantly reduced body mass, liver mass, and hepatic steatosis. In conclusion we were the first to demonstrate a pathophysiological role for UII in cardiovascular diseases which may lead to a breakthrough in the management of CHF and may also give more insight into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225f804.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386p31p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w832q"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Serotonin, bright light, and the regulation of human social interaction and mood</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Aan het Rot, Marije</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The three studies described in this Doctoral Thesis pertain to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the environmental factor light, and their role in the regulation of human mood as well as behavioural and perceptual aspects of daily social interaction. Participants were healthy at the time of the study but considered at risk for mood disorders in the future. In Study 1, the serotonin system was manipulated by administering tryptophan. This resulted in a decrease in quarrelsome behaviours, an increase in agreeable behaviours, and improved mood. Changes in perceptions of others were also seen. In Study 2, acute tryptophan depletion was used in conjunction with dim or bright light exposure during test days. A worsening of mood was seen under dim but not bright light conditions, which suggests that bright light was able to regulate mood by interacting with the brain serotonin system. In Study 3, this idea was explored further by investigating the links between light exposure levels and mood, as well as social behaviours and social perceptions, in everyday life. Higher levels of natural bright light exposure were associated with less quarrelsomeness, more agreeableness, and better mood. In conclusion, serotonin appears to mediate aspects of human social interaction that have been linked to a variety of mental and physical health issues. Bright light may regulate mood in part by altering the activity of the brain serotonin system. An increase in bright light exposure may have effects on mood and social interaction similar to a pharmacological manipulation of the brain serotonin system. The findings of the three studies presented here may have implications for the development of a nonpharmacological approach to the prevention of mental as well as physical disease. The various processes underlying factors that modulate social inclusion and acceptance deserve more attention in psychiatry and human neuroscience.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515s030.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w832q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av692t998v"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Remediation of a soil contaminated with polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yuan, Tao, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sites contaminated with polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pose serious health and safety risks to the surrounding environment due to their toxicity, persistence and accumulation in the environment. Because certain members of this class have been demonstrated to be both carcinogenic and mutagenic, PAHs are considered as environmental priority pollutants (US EPA). The studies in this thesis provide an efficient, economical and environmentally benign technique for the remediation of PAH contaminated soil/sediment by means of PAH mobilization with surfactant followed with a catalytic hydrogenation in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2). Catalytic hydrogenation of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, ancenaphthene, anthracene, phenanthrene, chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene over alumina supported palladium (5% Pd0/gammaAl2O3) commercial catalyst were investigated in either a batch reaction mode or a continuous reaction system in H2-scCO2 (~5% v/v). The hydrocarbon compounds were efficiently reduced to their corresponding fully saturated polycyclic hydrocarbon homologs with mild conditions of temperature (90Â°C) and pressure (60 psi H2 or 3000 psi H2-scCO2). The bacterial reverse mutation assay demonstrated that both the fully and partially hydrogenated products of chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene were devoid of mutagenic activity. A laboratory study was conducted on the surfactant-assisted mobilization of PAH compounds combined with reagent regeneration and detoxification steps to generate innocuous products. Five minutes of ultrasonication of field contaminated soil with a 3% (w/v) surfactant suspension mobilized appreciable quantities of all PAH compounds. Formulating the Brij 98 surfactant in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) mobilized the largest quantities of PAH compounds and the recovery of surfactant (&gt;90%) but soil residues exceeded permissible maxima for five- and six-ring analytes. Five successive washes were required to reduce the residual fraction to permissible levels. The mobilized PAH compounds were then detoxified at line by catalytic hydrogenation in a 5% H2-scCO2 (v/v) atmosphere. New palladium hydrogenation catalysts were fabricated in the laboratory with specific processes on various supports. The hydrogenation of phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene in a fixed bed micro reactor demonstrated that the catalyst that was fabricated from organosoluble precursor loaded on aluminum oxide (2.5% Pd0/gammaAl2O3) was four times more efficient than the commercial catalyst that was used for PAH hydrogenations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445ch92k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t998v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -- Environmental aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Surface active agents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soil remediation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Supercritical fluid extraction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8w32r904d"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Genetic selection by ivermectin on Onchocerca volvulus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Eng, Jeffrey K. L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Onchocerca volvulus is a parasitic filarial nematode responsible for human onchocerciasis, a disease commonly known as "River Blindness". Although there are no well documented cases of ivermectin resistance in O. volvulus, reports of suboptimal responses to ivermectin have appeared. The purpose of this thesis was to examine genetic polymorphisms in O. volvulus and to determine whether there was genetic evidence of ivermectin selection on O. volvulus genes. Analysis of 17 genes from O. volvulus was undertaken in two populations of worms, either from ivermectin-naive patients or from patients who had been repeatedly treated with ivermectin annually. In 14 of the genes no differences in genetic polymorphism were found (although polymorphisms were identified). However, chi square analysis (chi2=0.05) indicated significant differences in allele frequencies for a P-glycoprotein, a beta-tubulin and a putative dyf=8 gene. Analysis of the O. volvulusbeta-tubulin alleles identified three amino acid substitutions in the H3 region with ivermectin selection. Microtubules play a key structural role in the formation of neurons, and in ivermectin-resistant Haemonchus contortus, amphidial neurons show distorted microtubule bundles. Polymerization and depolymerization assays of the recombinant O. volvulus beta-tubulin alleles showed interesting differences between the polymerized tubulin using the two different alleles. It is speculated that similar differences could cause the disorganization of the microtubules identified in the amphidial neurons in ivermectin resistant H. contortus. In addition to the coding mutations, a 24 bp deletion in the adjacent intron to the H3 was detected. A PCR diagnostic assay was developed to genotype individual macro- and microfilariae. Further analyses were conducted to investigate the possibility of a direct relationship between ivermectin and beta-tubulin. Data obtained from equilibrium dialysis experiments indicated that BODIPY FL ivermectin bound to purified O. volvulus alpha- and beta-tubulins. More interesting, non-fluorescent ivermectin and taxol competed with the BODIPY FL ivermectin. The work presented in this thesis provides evidence of genetic selection by ivermectin on O. volvulus and suggests a putative binding site for ivermectin on tubulin. These data provide novel information on ivermectin selection in O. volvulus and on the possible involvement of tubulin in ivermectin resistance.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451n33c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r904d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Onchocerciasis -- Chemotherapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Onchocerca volvulus -- Effect of drugs on</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drug resistance</dc:subject><dc:subject>Onchocerca volvulus -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ivermectin</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agt54kr736"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulatory functions of proteasome component RPN11POH1 in Schistosoma mansoni and human cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nabhan, Joseph</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The 26S proteasome is the principal degradation structure of intracellular proteins in eukaryotes. The proteasome is composed of two 19S regulatory particles and a 20S catalytic core. The lid region of the 19S proteasome comprises at least 8 subunits that recognizes proteasomal substrates, including misfolded, truncated, or erroneously posttranslated proteins, as well as other tightly controlled and short-lived proteins. Such substrates are typically tagged with a small peptide called ubiquitin to facilitate their rapid and efficient recognition and translocation to the proteasome. The objective of this study was to characterize the Schistosoma mansoni and human homologues of proteasomal lid subunit POH1/RPN11. Earlier reports had suggested that overexpression of the fission yeast padl homologue can influence the activity of an AP1-like transcription factor. We showed that SmPOH, the Schistosoma mansoni homologue, stabilizes AP1 transcription factor c-Jun both in vitro and in cultured mammalian cells. We also demonstrated a dose-dependent SmPOH-induced stabilization of c-Jun in vitro. In contrast, SmPOH did not stabilize another well-known proteasomal substrate, p53, in vitro. Others later demonstrated that yeast POH1/RPN11 is a divalent cation-dependent metalloprotease deubiquitinase and outlined a conserved catalytic motif termed JAMM/MPN+ responsible for this activity. To better understand the structure-function relationship of POH1/RPN11 with regard to c-Jun stabilization, we showed that the Cys-120 residue of human POH1 (hPOH1), embedded in the JAMM/MPN+ motif, is required for the stabilizing effect on c-Jun. Furthermore, we established that hPOH1 influences c-Jun stability by altering its state of ubiquitination and intracellular localization. Parallel experiments were conducted to test the effect of hPOH1 on another proteasomal substrate, p27Kip, but no changes could be seen either in its stability or its localization. RNAi experiments targeting SmPOH transcripts in cultured schistosomula resulted in a lethal phenotype, thus illustrating the critical role of SmPOH expression in the parasite. Expression levels of SmPOH were reduced by ~ 90% following a 9-day incubation with siRNAs targeting the SmPOH sequence. We further performed a survey to examine the expression levels of multiple proteasome subunits in cercaria, schistosomula, and adult stages of Schistosoma mansoni. Our results suggest a pivotal role for the proteasome in the development of the parasite. A better understanding of the function of the proteasome in S. mansoni may lead to the identification of novel drug targets and newer approaches for chemotherapy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515s048.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kr736</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Schistosoma mansoni -- Development</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67jv772"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structural functional analysis of the human androgen receptor</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Elhaji, Youssef A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The androgen receptor (AR) mediates the various actions of androgens and is responsible for the male reproductive system and male phenotype. AR mutations result in variable degrees of androgen insensitivity in XY individuals, ranging from complete to mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). Most of the AR-mutations are located in the ligand-binding-domain (LBD) and result in a complete or near complete loss of ligand binding. As revealed by several AR-LBD crystal structures, most of these mutations are located far from the bound-ligand, therefore their severe ligand-binding abnormalities must reflect more widespread LBD structural aberrations rather than local distortions at the mutated residues. To better understand the structural/functional relationship of such mutations, I have characterized the abnormalities associated with alternate substitutions at two identical positions in the AR-LBD (R855H and R855C) and (P892A and P892L) identified in unrelated AIS patients. Results of these analyses have explained the mechanism by which the AR-R855H and AR-R855C resulted in significantly different AIS phenotypes. These studies also revealed that the AR-P892 residue is critical for the dynamic properties of the C-terminal helix (helix 12) of the LBD. Helix 12 dynamic properties are crucial for ligand-binding and for the transactivational properties of the receptor. To further analyse the properties of the AR-LBD within the context of multiple domains, I have developed a high-yield bacterial-expression method for the production of soluble AR fragment that contains the DNA-binding-domain, the hinge region and the LBD (AR-DBDLBD). This will allow for detailed analyses of the structural and functional properties of these domains and their intra-molecular communications in the presence and absence of DNA and/or ligand. This method is likely to be generally applicable to other nuclear receptors and may resolve the low solubility, instability, and toxicity problems associated with their overexpression. Furthermore, I have reached the final stages in generating a knockout mouse for a newly identified AR-coregulator, the Androgen Receptor N-terminal- Interacting Protein (ARNIP).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p4016.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jv772</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d362b"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Biosorption of lanthanum, europium and ytterbium by Sargassum polycystum biomass</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Diniz, Vivian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Biosorption of the lanthanides: La3+ (Lanthanum), EU 3+ (Europium) and Yb3+ (Ytterbium) from single and multi-component batch and column systems using Sargassum polycystum biomass was studied. Ground and dried biomass was used in batch experiments with particle size 0.5-2.0 mm, while natural size cut and wet was used for packing the column. The ion exchange mechanism was confirmed by the exchange of ions observed during the process. The metal binding increased with pH and the maximum metal uptake capacity for pH 3, 4 and 5 ranged approximately between (0.8--0.9) mmol.g-1 for La, (0.8--0.9) mmol.g -1 for Eu, and (0.7--0.9) mmol.g-1 for Yb. The metal affinity sequence established was Eu&gt;La&gt;Yb, and the maximum metal uptakes obtained from multi-metal mixture were 0.41, 0.29, and 0.28 mmol.g -1 for Eu, La, and Yb, respectively. The presence of the rounterion sulphate reduced La uptake due to the formation of complexes, while the presence of nitrate and chloride did not interfere with the lanthanum removal. The La uptake in such systems varied from 0.6 to 1.0 mmol g-1. Several eluting agents at different concentrations were tested to desorb the lanthanides and 95 to 100% desorption for all metals was obtained with 0.3 mol.L-1 HCl. La desorption with the other eluting agents was 70% with 2 mol.L-1 CaCl2, 83.7%, with 0.5 mol.L -1 EDTA and 88.4% with 0.023 mol.L-1 diglycolic acid. Desorption levels ranged between 85 and 95%, and decreased with increasing metal sorption affinity as follows, 94.0, 86.3 and 75.2% for Yb, La and Eu, respectively, when the eluting agent was 0.1N HCl. Batch and sorption column studies of La and Eu in the presence of protons in binary and ternary systems were performed. The equilibrium isotherms were determined for the binary systems, La/H and Eu/H, for a total normality of 3meq g-1, and resulted in separation factors of 2.7 and 4.7, respectively, demonstrating a higher selectivity of the biomass towards europium. Continuous-flow column experiments with single metals and protonated biomass were used to estimate the intra-particle mass transfer coefficient for La (6.0 10-4 min-1 and Eu (3.7 10-4 min-1). These values were then used in mathematical models predicting reasonably well the breakthrough curves obtained for La and Eu with an equivalent feed mixture. A series of consecutive sorption/desorption runs demonstrated that the metal could be recovered and the biomass reused in multiple cycles with no apparent loss in metal uptake capacity when 0.1N HCl was used for desorption.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jf86x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d362b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj1395752"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Assessment of the physical determinants and functional significance of lipid and protein partitioning into lipids rafts</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wang, Tian-Yun, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A variety of studies were conducted in model and biological membrane systems to examine the phenomenon of putative 'lipid raft' microdomains in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. The studies focused on understanding the physical properties of lipid rafts, and how these properties influence the partitioning of lipids and lipidated proteins into raft-like membrane domains; and finally, how lipid raft properties play a role in mediating T-cell signaling. The model membrane system employed in the majority of our studies utilized a fluorescence-quenching assay that could directly monitor the partitioning of various lipidated molecules into liquid-ordered, raft-like domains in membrane vesicles exhibiting liquid-ordered/liquid disordered phase coexistence. The use of this system allowed us to determine that lipids consisting of long, saturated lipid chains partitioned more favorably into lipid-raft like domains compared to that of lipids consisting of unsaturated lipid chains, and that the headgroup structure of sphingolipids can affect their ability to partition into liquid-ordered domains. Combining our model membrane studies with cellular studies, we were then able to show that peptide sequences containing saturated N-myristoyl/S-acyl lipid modifications similar to those found in proteins such as Src tyrosine kinases, and the Galpha subunit, preferentially partitioned into liquid-ordered raft-like domains; compared to that of peptide sequences consisting of S-acyl/S-farnesyl lipid modifications, similar to those found in the Ras family of proteins, which partitioned greatly with the liquid-disordered membrane phase. In our last study, we incorporated polyethyleneglycol (PEG) lipid conjugates into the plasma membrane of Jurkat T-cells as a novel means to study lipid raft involvement in T-cell signaling. Crosslinking of both fully saturated PEG lipid conjugates and fully unsaturated PEG lipid conjugates invoked early events in T-cell activation, leading us to believe that lipid rafts per se may not be specifically involved in mediating T-cell signaling events during crosslinking of endogenous outer plasma membrane proteins.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k883h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj1395752</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257j41z"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Entomological evaluation and insecticide resistance monitoring of malaria vectors in Tanzania</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kulkarni, Manisha A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are an effective tool to reduce the burden of malaria in Africa. To address questions concerning the sustained impact of ITN in the face of changing transmission intensity and spreading insecticide resistance a series of four entomological investigations was undertaken in Tanzania. First, a longitudinal survey of vector populations at different altitudes was conducted in the Hai District, Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania. Entomological parameters relevant to malaria transmission were measured. Vector densities and entomological inoculation rates decreased dramatically with increasing altitude. Seasonal variations in the host preference and resting behaviour of Anopheles arabiensismay influence malaria transmission and control. Second, the insecticide susceptibility status of vector populations from agricultural sites in the Kilimanjaro Region was evaluated. Malaria vectors from six sites were highly susceptible to diagnostic concentrations of pyrethroid insecticides and DDT in susceptibility tests. Permethrin tolerance in populations of An. arabiensis from an irrigated rice-growing area was not directly related to agricultural use of insecticides. Synergist bioassays indicated the contribution of a metabolic oxidase-based mechanism to the observed resistance while the knockdown resistance (kdr) mechanism was not detected. Close monitoring of resistance development in this area is needed. Third, the biological efficacy of ITN and the insecticide susceptibility status of mosquito populations from areas with long-term use of ITN were investigated. Data were compiled from national surveys and long-term ITN projects to examine trends in resistance development in Tanzania. Anopheles species were highly susceptible to ITN and diagnostic concentrations of pyrethroid insecticides, while 'nuisance-biting' Culex quinquefasciatus displayed low susceptibility to these compounds. Low efficacy of ITN against C. quinquefasciatus has implications for user acceptance of ITN. Finally, a novel method for kdr genotyping was developed and evaluated. Sequence specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) were used to identify kdr mutations in Anopheles gambiae s.l. in a high-throughput enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format. Evaluation of the method on field-collected specimens detected the leucine-phenylalanine kdr mutation in two individual An. arabiensis, raising implications for the geographic spread of kdr-based resistance. The novel SSOP-ELISA method is a useful tool for high-throughput screening allowing sensitive detection of insecticide resistance.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m764n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257j41z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Insecticide resistance -- Tanzania</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anopheles -- Control -- Tanzania</dc:subject><dc:subject>Culex quinquefasciatus -- Control -- Tanzania</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655m131"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Oxygen isotope systematics in carbonate-water systems : influence of temperature, solution chemistry, and kinetic isotope fractionation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kim, Sang-Tae, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The oxygen isotope fractionation between HCO3-/CO 32- and H2O was determined experimentally in order to elucidate the precipitation mechanisms of orthorhombic carbonate minerals in solutions. The oxygen isotope composition of BaCO3 (witherite), precipitated quantitatively from solutions of various pH and the relative contribution of carbonic acid species to DIC (total dissolved inorganic carbon) at each pH in these solutions were used to generate the following fractionations at 25Â°C: 1000lnaHCO -3-H2O =30.53+/-0.08 1000lna(CO 2-3-H2 O)=23.17+/-0.08 Based upon the above oxygen isotope fractionation and the oxygen isotope systematics of aragonite and witherite obtained from various precipitation experiments, it was discovered that CO32- rather than the more abundant HCO3- ions are preferentially incorporated into the growing carbonate crystal. Furthermore, it was proposed that the faster deprotonation kinetics of isotopically light HCO 3- ions and the preferential incorporation of light CO3 2- isotopologues could account for the kinetic isotope effects observed in these carbonate minerals. Aragonite was inorganically precipitated from Na-Ca-Mg-Cl-HCO3 solutions at 0, 5, 10, 25, and 40Â°C to determine the temperature dependence of the equilibrium oxygen isotope fractionation between this mineral and the parental solution. To establish a reliable relationship between temperature and oxygen isotope fractionation as well as discount potential experimental artifacts, three different precipitation protocols were employed but statistically identical results were obtained under the conditions investigated. In addition, the extent of kinetic isotope effects induced by variations of the precipitation rate, pH, and Mg2+ concentration of the parent solutions, were thoroughly tested to establish that equilibrium oxygen isotope fractionation occurs. In order to obtain accurate oxygen isotope compositions of the aragonite precipitates by the conventional phosphoric acid dissolution method, a statistically reliable acid fractionation factor for aragonite (and calcite) was also determined from pure natural aragonite (and calcite) specimens. From a large number (i.e., 29 and 60 individual analyses for aragonite and calcite, respectively) of replicate total oxygen isotope analyses and the isotopic composition of the acid-liberated CO2 between 25 to 75Â°C, the following two new equations are proposed: 1000lnaCO2(ACID )-Calcite=3.59( 103/T)-1.79 1000lnaCO2(ACID )-Aragonite=3.39( 103/T)-0.83 By combining the new acid fractionation factor of 1.01063 for aragonite at 25Â°C with the oxygen isotope data from the synthesis experiments determined in this study, a new relationship is reported for the temperature dependence of the aragonite-water oxygen isotope fractionation over the temperate range of 0-40Â°C: 1000lnaaragonite-water=17. 88+/-0.13(103/T) -31.14+/-0.46 This new experimental calibration of the aragonite-water fractionation yields a positive aragonite-calcite oxygen isotope fractionation over the temperature range investigated, in agreement with theoretical calculations. This result also provides a baseline to quantify vital or kinetic effects that are frequently observed in natural abiogenic or biogenic aragonite minerals.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z458r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655m131</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296x2866"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Occupational Health</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Development and validation of a novel surface emission sampler for in-situ characterization of sources of indoor air pollution in non-industrial microenvironments : Soheil Rastan</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rastan, Soheil</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Similar to passive exposure to cigarette smoke, building occupants, in homes and in offices, are passively exposed to volatile organic compounds that are being emitted form surfaces of interior finishes and furnishings. Identifying emissions from surfaces of interior finishes and furnishings requires in-situ sampling. Interior finishes and furnishings used in homes and offices are many and varied. Current available methods used for sampling surface emissions from interior finishes and furnishings require the use of environmental chambers in laboratory settings. The in-situ applications of these lab-based chambers are limited. A novel method for in-situ surface emission sampling is needed. This thesis presents the development and validation of a novel surface emission sampler, the Kappa. Emissions from an interior carpet sample were captured using three different samplers, an ASTM-based chamber, a Field and Laboratory Emission Cell (FLEC) and the novel Kappa. Results were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. Based on the results obtained, the Kappa and the FLEC were comparable in their relative responses with each other and against the ASTM chamber. The Kappa, however, sampled emissions in-situ, whereas the ASTM and the FLEC sampled emissions under laboratory settings. As an in-situ surface emission sampler, the Kappa was able to estimate the contribution of an interior finish such as a carpet to indoor air pollution in real indoor conditions. The Kappa could thus provide representative, appropriate and necessary field data that are required to justify implementation of site-specific remedial action. The latter would help reduce the burden of, and occupants' exposure to emissions from interior finishes and furnishings in non-industrial microenvironments.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hp13f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x2866</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Environmental Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30px44q"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Insights into the molecular physiology of the P2X receptor family</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Raouf, Ramin K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the source of metabolic energy for a majority of chemical reactions in the cell, is now considered as an ancient messenger molecule used in intercellular communications. The ionotropic effects of ATP are mediated by P2X receptors which constitute a novel family of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs). The seven vertebrate subunits, which form homomeric as well as heteromeric channel complexes, show little structural resemblance to other families of LGICs such as the Cys-loop family exemplified by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. P2X receptors have been shown to play important physiological roles in processes such as transmission of pain, vasoconstriction, and inflammatory processes involving release of cytokines. The potential importance of these receptors as therapeutic targets in a number of pathophysiological conditions has focused many efforts on the understanding of their molecular physiology and modulation in vivo. This thesis reports the rationale and the results of experiments carried out to advance our knowledge of the molecular physiology of P2X receptors in several fronts: First, development of more selective tools, based on structure-function data, for the knockdown of the receptor function in vivo (manuscripts #1 and #2); second, contributions made to our understanding of the phylogeny and structure-function relationship in this protein family through functional analysis of an invertebrate P2X subunit (manuscripts #3 and #4); and third, advancing our understanding of the modulation of the P2X function through second messenger signalling pathways which would aid the efforts in drug development aimed at this receptor family (manuscript #5).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xn29w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30px44q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8623j2659"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The calcium-sensing receptor in human disease : molecular genetics and structure-function analysis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pidasheva, Svetlana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Inherited disorders of calcium homeostasis, familial hypercalcemia (FHH) and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) are caused by inactivating mutations, and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) is caused by activating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR). This receptor belongs to group C of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, one of the largest groups of cell-surface receptors. The CASR is expressed abundantly in the parathyroid gland and in the cells lining the kidney tubule and senses small changes in circulating calcium concentration and once activated it inhibits parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and renal tubule calcium reabsorption. The CASR undergoes core (immature) N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Once appropriately folded, the core-glycosylated receptor transits through the Golgi apparatus, becomes fully (mature) glycosylated, and is expressed at the cell surface. The main focus of this Ph.D thesis work was a functional characterization of mutant CASRs. At present over 100 CASR mutations have been published. Our lab has created a database http://www.casrdb.mcgill.ca/, of these mutations which is regularly updated. The CASRdb helps to better understand and analyze the mutations with respect to clinical and biochemical profiles, and aids in receptor structure-function analyses in addition to providing an important communication link between researchers working on this receptor and related areas. We examined the DNAs from patients with calcium homeostasis disorders and identified mutations and polymorphisms in the coding region of the CASR gene in several of these individuals. Most of the mutations are novel and some are recurring. Two of the identified mutations (L11S and T14A) are in the signal peptide of the receptor (another mutant, L13P, was previously reported but not analyzed functionally). In the CASR, the N-terminal signal peptide of 19 amino acids likely plays a key role in directing the nascent polypeptide chain into the ER. We demonstrated that indeed the wild-type CASR, and mutant T14A, nascent polypeptides were targeted to the ER in vitro, and underwent core N-glycosylation. In contrast, the L11S and L13P mutants did not translocate into the ER and did not undergo glycosylation. This study is the first to examine the function of the CASR signal sequence and shows that naturally occurring mutations that disrupt the hydrophobic core of this region lead to impaired cotranslational processing causing parathyroid dysfunction. It is the first study to analyze the impairment of a GPCR's signal peptide region resulting in human disease. The CASR exists at the plasma membrane as a homodimer although it is unclear at which point in the biosynthetic pathway dimerization occurs. To address this issue, we have analyzed wild-type and mutant CASRs harboring R66H or R66C inactivating mutations (identified in FHH patients), which cause the receptor to be retained in the ER. Using a biochemical and biophysical analysis we demonstrated that the wild-type, R66H and R66C mutants were dimerized in the ER whereas another mutant, N583X, was not. Hence, constitutive CASR dimerization occurs in the ER and is likely to be necessary, but is not sufficient, for exit of the receptor from the ER and trafficking to the cell surface. FHH may present atypically as familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP). I have performed in vitro analyses of mutations L159P, E250K, V268delfsX273, T445A, and R886P identified in FIHP kindreds. In addition, we have identified two novel inactivating mutations (M74L and L521delfs.X555) in FHH patients. We have analyzed all mutants by transiently transfecting them in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and comparing them to the wild-type receptor. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the mutant receptors were, in general, as well expressed as the wild-type receptor. However, we observed that the 2 truncation mutants (V268delfsX273 and L521delfsX555) migrated at lower molecular weights. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy studies showed that both of these mutants, as well as some of the others, had impaired cell surface expression. Several mutants had impaired MAPK responses to increasing extracellular calcium concentrations relative to the wild-type receptor. On the other hand, T445A behaved like the wild-type receptor in all the assays, suggesting that this change represented a rare benign polymorphism. In addition, three common CASR polymorphisms (A986S, R990G and Q1011E) were identified in several individuals, and were expressed at similar levels to wild-type on western blot analysis. R886P was the least impaired mutant in all assays. E250K was responsive to some extent in the MAPK assay, but the rest of the mutants had clearly impaired function. Identification and functional analyses of naturally-occurring CASR mutations provides important clinical information to physicians and patients. In addition, assessment of functional deficiencies of particular mutants provides new insight into how the receptor works.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nm88f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623j2659</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117s58r"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Comparative genomics of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mostowy, Serge</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The study of microbial evolution has been recently accelerated by the advent of comparative genomics, an approach enabling investigation of organisms at the whole-genome level. Tools of comparative genomics, including the DNA microarray, have been applied in bacterial genomes towards studying heterogeneity in DNA content, and to monitor global gene expression. When focused upon the study of microbial pathogens, genome analysis has provided unprecedented insight into their evolution, virulence, and host adaptation. Contributing towards this, I herein explore the evolutionary change affecting genomes of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), a group of closely related bacterial organisms responsible for causing tuberculosis (TB) across a diverse range of mammals. Despite the introduction nearly a century ago of BCG, a family of live attenuated vaccines intentioned on preventing human TB, the uncertainty surrounding its usefulness is punctuated by the reality that TB continues to be responsible for claiming over 2 million lives per year. As pursued throughout this thesis, a precise understanding of the differences in genomic content among the MTC, and its impact on gene expression and biological function, promises to expose underlying mechanisms of TB pathogenesis, and suggest rational approaches towards the design of improved diagnostics and vaccines to prevent disease. With the availability of whole-genome sequence data and tools of comparative genomics, our publications have advanced the recognition that large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs) deleted from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB in humans, serve as accurate markers for molecular epidemiologic assessment and phylogenetic analysis. These LSPs have proven informative both for the types of genes that vary between strains, and for the molecular signatures that characterize different MTC members. Genomic analysis of atypical MTC has revealed their diversity and adaptability, illuminating previously unexpected directions of MTC evolution. As demonstrated from parallel analysis of BCG vaccines, a phylogenetic stratification of genotypes offers a predictive framework upon which to base future genetic and phenotypic studies of the MTC. Overall, the work presented in this thesis has provided unique insights and lessons having direct clinical relevance towards understanding TB pathogenesis and BCG vaccination.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c621v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117s58r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Bioinformatics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2227mt57k"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Implications of CD9 and its partners in prostate cancer progression</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zvieriev, Valerii</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Prostate cancer is still the most diagnosed cancer in man in the Western world and in this group, one of the leading causes of cancer death. CD9 protein is a member of the tetraspanin family, whose members are often down-regulated in advanced prostate cancers. The objective of our study is to decipher the role of the CD9 protein in prostate cancer progression. We have demonstrated that over-expression of exogenous CD9 in highly tumorigenic and metastatic PC-3M-LN4 cell line did not suppress its tumorigenic and metastatic properties in vivo while it even increased its invasive properties in vitro. These data contrast with our previous study, which demonstrated that over-expression of wild type CD9 has a deleterious effect on growth properties of human PC-3 prostate cancer cells in vitro. Since CD9 is still expressed in some human prostate cancers, we linked putative inactivation of CD9 in PC-3M-LN4 cells with presence or absence of certain CD9 partners. Using co-immunopreciptation, mass-spectrometry, Bacterial two-hybrid system and Ciphergen ProteinChip technology we identified six novel CD9 protein partners, namely MORTALIN, OVCA2, HES4, GALECTIN3, RAB5A, TM4SF9. These partners could affect CD9 function in prostate cancer cells. We also detected ASPP2 protein expression only in PC-3 cells. Pursuing the characterization of some of these partners, we showed that simultaneous over-expression of CD9 and OVCA2 in PC-3M-LN4 cells lead to mitotic catastrophe and eventually cause cell death. Furthermore, immunocolocalization studies demonstrated that CD9 and MORTALIN interaction depend on CD9 over-expression in an appropriate cell context, putatively explaining the differential effect of CD9 in PC-3 and PC-3M-LN4 prostate cancer cells. Overall, the data presented in this thesis demonstrated that the biological properties of CD9 protein are dependent on protein-protein interactions and cell type environment. The demonstrated interactions of CD9 with OVCA2 and MORTALIN highlighted the importance of CD9 as a potential tumor and/or metastasis suppressor gene.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n475d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mt57k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4q77fw34q"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>PAX2 optimizes nephron number during kidney development</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dziarmaga, Alison</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In normal human populations, nephron number varies widely from 300,000 to over one million nephrons per kidney. This dramatic range was once considered to have no clinical relevance, but recently it has been found that individuals at the lower end of the nephron number spectrum have increased risk of essential hypertension during adulthood. Final nephron number is determined during fetal kidney development and is irreversibly set by birth in humans. The mechanisms which set nephron number remain a mystery. Humans with the Renal-Coloboma Syndrome (RCS) are born with renal hypoplasia due to a paucity of nephrons. This hereditary disease is caused by mutations in the PAX2 gene, a transcription factor expressed in the kidney, brain and eye. During normal kidney development, PAX2 exerts multiple functions. However, it remains unclear which of these functions is crucial for optimal branching morphogenesis, leading to sufficient nephron formation. Based on our previous observations, we hypothesized that the anti-apoptotic function of PAX2 is critical for determining congenital nephron number. To test this hypothesis, we used the human PAX2 promoter to target a pro-apoptotic gene (Bax) to the ureteric bud and showed that this was sufficient to cause renal hypoplasia, mimicking RCS. We show that suboptimal fetal branching causes congenital nephron deficits in heterozygous Pax2 mutant mice, which subsequently compromises renal function at one year of age. Furthermore, the nephron deficit in Pax2 mutant mice was rescued by targeting an anti-apoptotic gene (BCL2) to the ureteric bud in fetal kidney. Finally, we discovered that PAX2 directly activates transcription of the NAIP gene, encoding an endogenous caspase inhibitor first identified in brain. We demonstrate Naip gene expression in developing mouse kidney and show that inhibition of Naip in collecting duct cells causes increased caspase-3/7 activity. These studies support our hypothesis that the anti-apoptotic function of PAX2 is critical for setting congenital nephron number and we have identified an anti-apoptotic protein, directly regulated by PAX2, which may serve to protect ureteric bud cells from programmed cell death.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591c78w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fw34q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892f71z"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of plant sterol supplementation and endurance training on cardiovascular disease risk parameters and cholesterol kinetics in previously sedentary hypercholesterolemic adults</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Varady, Kristina A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. A high ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, in addition to increased levels of small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, are important indicators of cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore, interventions that combine the lowering of total cholesterol and raising of HDL cholesterol concentrations that also increase LDL particle size, may be preventive against cardiovascular disease. Plant sterols decrease total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels by 10-15%, while exercise increases HDL cholesterol levels by 4-22%. In view of their complementary effects, combining plant sterols with exercise would appear to be an effective lifestyle therapy to decrease the risk of future cardiovascular disease. Objective. The aim of this study was to examine the independent and combined effects of plant sterols and exercise on blood lipid levels, and LDL particle size in previously sedentary, hypercholesterolemic adults. An additional objective of this trial was to assess the underlying mechanism by which this combination therapy modulates whole body cholesterol metabolism, to in turn improve lipid profiles. Methods. In an 8-week, parallel-arm trial, 84 subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 interventions: (1) plant sterols and exercise,(2) plant sterols alone, (3) exercise alone, or (4) control. Blood lipid concentrations were measured using enzymatic kits, and LDL particle size was assessed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cholesterol absorption and synthesis were determined using the single isotope single tracer technique and the deuterium incorporation approach, respectively. Results. Plant sterol supplementation decreased (P &lt; 0.01) total cholesterol concentrations by 8.2% when compared to baseline. Exercise increased (P &lt; 0.01) HDL cholesterol levels by 7.5% while decreasing (P &lt; 0.01) triglyceride concentrations by 13.3% when compared to baseline. Exercise reduced (P &lt; 0.05) post-treatment LDL peak particle size from 255 to 253 A, and decreased (P &lt; 0.05) the proportion of large LDL particles by 13.1%. Plant sterols had no effect on particle size distribution. Plant sterol supplementation decreased (P &lt; 0.01) intestinal cholesterol absorption by 18%, while exercise had no effect on cholesterol absorption. Non-significant increases in cholesterol synthesis rates of 63%, 59%, and 57%, were observed in the combination, exercise, and plant sterol groups, respectively, relative to control. Conclusion. These findings suggest that this combination therapy yields the most favourable alterations in lipid profiles when compared to each intervention alone. This combined intervention exerts its beneficial effects on lipid profiles by suppressing intestinal cholesterol absorption. Therefore, this lifestyle therapy may be an effective means of decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in hypercholesterolemic adults.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rp90d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892f71z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hypercholesteremia -- Treatment</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anticholesteremic agents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phytosterols</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exercise</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sterols -- Physiological effect</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kf38w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Focusing mutagenesis into the active site to improve hydrolase selectivity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Morley, Krista Louise</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Occasionally, researchers need to modify enzymes through amino acid substitutions to make them more efficient catalysts for organic synthesis. There is still debate over the best protein engineering strategy for improving enzyme enantioselectivity: rational design or directed evolution. Rational design experiments focus mutations close to the active site, while directed evolution experiments often find mutations far from the active site. In this thesis, a combination of the two strategies improved Pseudomonas fluorescens esterase (PFE) for production of a useful synthetic building block for organic synthesis. Random mutagenesis within the active site increased enantioselectivity more effectively (up to 5-fold reaching E = 61) than random mutagenesis of the entire protein (only 1.5-fold reaching E = 19). A general survey of previously published enzyme improvements showed that closer mutations were more effective than distant mutations for improving enantioselectivity. On this basis, we proposed that random mutagenesis focused in the active site may dramatically increase the success rate in future directed evolution experiments. The X-ray crystal structures of three improved PFE mutants showed that mutations directly in the active site can increase enantioselectivity without significantly altering the shape of the binding pocket. For rationalizing the improved enantioselectivity, a crystal structure of a transition state analogue-complex provided the conformation of the fast reacting enantiomer and computer modeling determined the conformation of the slow reacting enantiomer. When novel esterases are discovered from directed evolution experiments, they are screened with libraries of esters to identify their preferred substrates. A convenient method for the parallel synthesis of esters was developed by using solid-supported reagents to eliminate traditional purification. Acetyl xylan esterase (AxeA) was examined as a potential catalyst for the production of chitosan, a biopolymer with many commercial applications. Screening for chitin deacetylase activity showed that AxeA preferentially deacetylates chitosan oligosaccharides over alkali-treated chitin and crystalline chitin.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jq358.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kf38w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524js566"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regulation of prolactincytokine receptor signaling by the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2 : by Parham Minoo</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Minoo, Parham</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Prolactin (PRL) is a polypeptide hormone that regulates diverse biological processes such as those involved in mammary gland and reproductive organ development. These biological functions are mediated by interaction of PRL with its membrane-bound receptor, a member of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily. Ligand binding to the PRL receptor (PRLR) induces dimerization of the receptor and activation of Janus kinase-2 (Jak2). These events lead to PRLR tyrosine phosphorylation creating binding sites for cellular signaling molecules containing SH2 domains such as the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5). Jak2/Stat5 pathway has emerged as the main signaling pathway mediating many physiological effects of PRL such as the terminal differentiation of mammary epithelial cells and milk protein production. Work in this thesis was performed to understand the molecular mechanisms of PRL actions in target tissues by investigating the role of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatases containing SH2 domain, SHP-1 and SHP-2, in regulation of PRLR intracellular signaling events. These phosphatases participate in signaling as enzymes and/or adapter proteins. Both SHP-1 and SHP-2 contain specific tyrosine residues at their C-terminal parts that undergo phosphorylation in response to PRLR stimulation. The focus of this doctoral work was to investigate the adapter function of these proteins, which is mediated by their C-terminal tyrosine residues. These studies revealed that these tyrosine residues can function to recruit legitimate substrate(s) for the catalytic domain of SHP-2 including a highly phosphorylated p29 protein. Subsequent studies showed that p29 is growth factor receptor-binding protein-2 (Grb2), suggesting that Grb2 is phosphorylated in response to PRL and the level of phosphorylation is regulated by SHP-2. Grb2 phosphorylation by PRLR was further shown to be a new mechanism by which PRLR inhibits EGFR-induced signaling. In addition, our results indicate that the inhibitory effect of SHP-1 on cytokine-induced Jak/Stat pathway could occur independently of its catalytic activity. Based on our data, SHP-1 C-terminal tyrosine residues contribute to the inhibitory effect of SHP-1 by recruiting inhibitory complex Grb2/SOCS-1 and targeting SOCS-1 to Jak2. Together these findings highlight new mechanisms of PRL/cytokine receptor signaling by the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397c89x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js566</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajw827g50r"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cellular immunity among HIV exposed, uninfected individuals</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Makedonas, George</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two models of HIV infection have been studied extensively with the goal of identifying immune correlate(s) of protection against HIV: (1) the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaque monkeys and (2) individuals with repeated exposure to HIV who remain uninfected by the virus (EUs). Both paradigms suggest that T cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in controlling HIV replication. Evidence from the SIV/macaque system, however, predicts that HIV vaccines aimed at eliciting T cell responses will fail to induce sterilizing immunity against HIV. The aim of the work presented in this thesis was to correlate HIV-specific T cell immunity in EUs with protection from HIV infection. The study cohort was comprised of (a) men who have unprotected sexual intercourse with HIV-infected men (MSM), (b) intravenous drug users (IVDU) who share syringes with HIV-infected peers, and (c) heterosexual partners of HIV-infected subjects. EUs were shown to exhibit HIV-specific IFN-gamma secretion, IL-2 production, and T cell proliferation, whereas low-risk negative controls did not. Furthermore, HIV-specific IFN-gamma secretion and T cell proliferation were not observed among a population of EUs who seroconverted soon after the tested time point. HIV-specific IL-2 secretion and T cell proliferation were shown to be correlated in our cohort of EUs. These effector functions are considered hallmark properties of central memory T cells (TCM), the subset of memory T cells that has been shown to mediate sterilizing immunity in mouse models of viral infection. The presence of TCM in EUs implies the development of immunity against HIV that is either fully protective or partially so, by increasing the threshold for HIV infection. Since these HIV-specific effector functions were absent in EUs who eventually seroconverted, it can be inferred that EUs in our cohort develop HIV-specific T cell immunity that mediates protection from HIV infection. Thus, our contribution to the EU paradigm is that sterilizing immunity is an attainable goal of prospective HIV vaccines.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w8330.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827g50r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axs55mg66t"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pancreatic-specific insulin-like growth factor I gene deficiency on islet cell growth and protection</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lu, Yarong, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The role of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in pancreatic islet cell growth and development has been debated in recent years. The dogma that IGF-I stimulates pancreatic islet growth has been challenged by combinational targeting of IGF or IGF-IR genes, as well as beta-cell-specific IGF-IR gene deficiency. In order to assess the physiological role of locally produced IGF-I, we have developed pancreatic-specific IGF-I gene deficiency (PID) by crossing Pdx1-Cre and IGF-I/loxP mice. PID mice were normal except for decreased blood glucose level and a 2.3-fold enlarged islet cell mass. When challenged with low doses of streptozotocin, control mice developed hyperglycemia after 6 days that was maintained at high levels for at least 2 months. In contrast, PID mice only exhibited marginal hyperglycemia after 12 days, maintained throughout the experiment. Furthermore, streptozotocin-induced beta-cell apoptosis (TUNEL assay) was significantly prevented in PID mice. PID mice also exhibited a delayed onset of type 2 diabetes induced by a high-fat diet, accompanied by super enlarged pancreatic islets and preserved sensitivity to insulin. As the phenotype is unlikely a direct consequence of IGF-I deficiency, we used oligonucleotide DNA microarray to explore possible activation of pro-islet genes in PID mice, which revealed upregulation of multiple new members of the Reg family genes (Reg2, 3alpha and 3beta) in the pancreas. The results were subsequently confirmed by Northern blot and/or realtime PCR, which exhibited 2 to 8 fold increases in the level of their mRNAs. Moreover, these Reg family genes were also activated following streptozotocin-induced beta-cell damage and diabetes. Our results reveal a possible mechanism of islet growth and protection in PID mice, thus serving a potential strategy in combating diabetes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z176b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mg66t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aff365876b"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Aspects of insulin-like growth factor physiology in cancer</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Levitt, Randy J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway consists of two ligands (IGF-I and IGF-II), two receptors (IGF-IR and IGF-IIR) and six IGF binding proteins (IGFBP-I through -6). There is considerable evidence from both laboratory and population studies that IGF physiology is relevant to neoplastic growth. For example, it has been shown that IGF-I and/or IGF-II act as mitogens and anti-apoptotic agents for both normal and malignant cells by binding to the IGF-IR and activating downstream signalling pathways. Consistent with this data, IGF-IR inhibition by a variety of strategies inhibits cancer cell proliferation and/or induces apoptosis both in vitro and in animal models of neoplasia. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between serum IGF-I levels and risk of subsequent cancer. Classically, the IGFBPs were considered to be growth inhibitors, as they had a well-defined role in sequestering the mitogens IGF-I and IGF-II, therefore preventing binding and subsequent activation of mitogenic and anti-apoptotic pathways downstream of the IGF-IR. However, increasing evidence indicates that under certain conditions, IGFBPs can act as growth stimulators, and both IGF-dependent and -independent mechanisms have been proposed. Although the roles of the IGFs, IGF-IR and IGFBPs in cancer have been studied extensively, this thesis describes several new links between IGF physiology and neoplasia. In the first section, we demonstrate that IGF-I can attenuate growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by a class of drugs called COX-2 inhibitors in BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells. This effect could be attributed to opposite influences of IGF-IR signalling and COX-2 inhibitors on activation of Akt, with IGF-IR signalling increasing activity and COX-2 inhibitors decreasing activity. In the second section, we demonstrate that in 184htert cells, an immortal but untransformed breast epithelial cell line, COX-2 inhibitors can induce IGFBP-3 expression. We go on to show that IGFBP-3 can inhibit growth of this cell line in an IGF-dependent manner, and speculate that this action of COX-2 inhibitors may be relevant to data linking use of this class of drugs to decreased breast cancer risk. In the third section, we demonstrate that the expression of IGFBP-2 in U251 glioma cells is inhibited by the induction of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Furthermore, IGFBP-2 does not effect the growth of this cell line, indicating that published associations between tumor IGFBP-2 expression and grade of glioma may be a result of IGFBP-2 acting as a marker for loss of function of PTEN. In the fourth and final section, we demonstrate that in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, over-expression of IGFBP-2 can enhance growth, indicating that the effect of IGFBP-2 on growth of neoplastic cells is tissue specific. Furthermore, antisense strategies targeting IGFBP-2 mRNA (antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA) can inhibit growth of IGFBP-2-expressing breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results extend the existing body of evidence demonstrating that IGF physiology contributes to neoplastic growth, and suggest that strategies to inhibit IGF-IR signalling and/or IGFBP-2 expression may have therapeutic value for some types of cancers.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rj04b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365876b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b591c795"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>In-vivo analysis of cortical thickness using magnetic resonance images</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lerch, Jason</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation describes a series of investigations designed to establish in-vivo analysis of cortical thickness using magnetic resonance images (MRI) as a viable technique in human brain imaging. Chapters 1 and 2 provide an introduction and overview of the relevant background. Chapters 3-6 take the form of manuscripts either published or submitted and describe (i) the validation of the methodology, (ii) its application in pathophysiology research, (iii) its application in clinical diagnosis and (iv) methodology and research application of the concept of "correlated" changes in cortical thickness. The final chapter summarizes the findings and considers the future development of this methodology. The main contributions of this thesis, chapters 3-6, are summarized as follows: Chapter 3. The highest precision in a population simulation was reached at a sensitivity of 0.93 with 100% specificity. Smoothing cortical thickness maps along the surface was established as clearly necessary, ideally in the 20-35mm blurring kernel size range. Different multiple comparisons correction techniques provided varying sensitivity to both false positives and false negatives, with Random Field Theory providing the best guarantee against false positives, False Discovery Rate the best optimization of true positives over false positives and false negatives. A power analysis found that, given two groups of 25 subjects each, a 0.6mm (15%) change in cortical thickness can be found. Chapter 4. The pattern of cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease found was in line with predictions based on the known advance of histopathology in the disease. The amount of thinning was quantified, reaching a maximum of 1.25mm in the parahippocampal gyrus. Correlations of cortical thickness with disease progression and Mini Mental State Exam scores showed increasing atrophy in the parahippocampal gyrus, lateral temporal and frontal lobes. Chapter 5. Given mean thickness measures over the parahippocampal gyrus and one of six other structures, cortical thickness was found to be capable of perfectly reproducing the initial clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's Disease. Maps showing the diagnostic accuracy of every single vertex were provided. Different discriminant techniques were compared and found to be roughly comparable in performance. Chapter 6. Maps of anatomical correlations across the cerebral cortex were computed in a normal brain development population. The correlation map of Brodmann Area 44, the chosen seed region, bore striking resemblance to diffusion tensor fibre maps of the same area. This relationship tightened with age, showing a developmental pattern of cross-cortical correlations. It also changed with IQ, the high IQ sample having strong correlations with the anterior cingulate and lateral parietal lobes, something absent in the low IQ group. Lastly, a map of correlation strength of each vertex was shown, which featured the association cortices as the most correlated areas. The findings shown in this thesis establish fully automated cortical thickness analysis from in-vivo MRI as a precise technique capable of providing quantitative measures of cortical morphology in both clinical and neurologically normal populations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w0326623.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591c795</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kk84h"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Knowledge selection, mapping and transfer in artificial neural networks</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thivierge, Jean-Philippe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Knowledge-based Cascade-correlation is a neural network algorithm that combines inductive learning and knowledge transfer (Shultz &amp; Rivest, 2001). In the present thesis, this algorithm is tested on several real-world and artificial problems, and extended in several ways. The first extension consists in the incorporation of the Knowledge-based Artificial Neural Network (KBANN; Shavlik, 1994) technique for generating rule-based (RBCC) networks. The second extension consists of the adaptation of the Optimal Brain Damage (OBD; LeCun, Denker, &amp; Solla, 1990) pruning technique to remove superfluous connection weights. Finally, the third extension consists in a new objective function based on information theory for controlling the distribution of knowledge attributed to subnetworks. A simulation of lexical ambiguity resolution is proposed. In this study, the use of RBCC networks is motivated from a cognitive and neurophysiological perspective.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v6396.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kk84h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Knowledge representation (Information theory)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neural networks (Computer science)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wp04n"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The identification of substrates of the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase in cytokine signaling and hematopoiesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Simoncic, Paul D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) is a widely expressed enzyme found at significantly higher levels in immune cells. To determine the signaling pathways and specific cell types affected by the loss of TC-PTP, TC-PTP gene-targeted animals were generated in our laboratory. TC-PTP -/- null mice have severe defects in hematopoiesis, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, and die by five weeks of age. These data indicate that TC-PTP plays an important role in hematopoiesis and immune cell activation. However, the identification of any substrates that could explain the role of TC-PTP these processes was lacking. Therefore, studies leading to the identification of physiological substrates of TC-PTP were undertaken. Work in this thesis demonstrates that TC-PTP targets two members of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (JAKs), JAK1 and JAK3. Both these JAK family members bound to TC-PTP in in vivo substrate trapping experiments, and hyperphosphorylation of JAK1 was demonstrated in TC-PTP-/- macrophages after treatment with interferon (IFN)-gamma. TC-PTP -/- null mice also have increased numbers of macrophages in the spleen. Studies demonstrated that TC-PTP targets the receptor for the colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), the primary growth factor that controls the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of macrophages. TC-PTP-/- macrophages have prolonged activation of Erk after CSF-1 stimulation. The number of CSF-1 dependent colony forming cells (CFU-Cs) is increased in TC-PTP-/- null mice, and TC-PTP-/- null hematopoietic progenitor cells produce more committed mononuclear phagocytic precursors in vitro . These data indicate that the loss of TC-PTP results in increased CSF-1 signaling and increased macrophage differentiation. Therefore, two novel classes of substrates for TC-PTP have been identified---members of the JAK family (JAK1 and JAK3) and the CSF-1R. Both substrates play important roles in hematopoiesis and immune cell activation, and their identification provides insight into the mechanism of TC-PTP function in vivo.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cp533.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wp04n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
