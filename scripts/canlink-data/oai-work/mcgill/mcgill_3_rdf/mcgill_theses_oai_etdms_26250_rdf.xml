However, few efforts have investigated how changes in brain connectivity may engender nicotine-induced cognitive modulation. Recent studies have also examined the effects of drug cues in addicts; however, little has been established about the influence of perceived drug availability on these responses and the resulting changes in brain connectivity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the effects of nicotine on brain connectivity during a verbal and visual working memory (WM) task. We have shown that nicotine modulates connectivity in a cortico-striatal-thalamic loop during the verbal WM task in which nicotine also improved behavioural performance. In a second inquiry using a cue reactivity paradigm and fMRI, we showed that smoking cue-dependent functional connectivity was significantly greater in subjects that were in a state of expectation to smoke.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nt80d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bf20b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qc512"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Robotic model of the human standing posture</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ayoub, Omar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Human standing posture depends on sensory inputs from vision, from touch and from the vestibular system. Humans use these inputs to determine position in the environment and to compensate for external forces resulting in constant swaying. This thesis investigated the creation of a four-degree-of-freedom robotic model of human upright stance using only hip actuation. In this model, the ankles are free so that there is no reaction torque from the ground and balance is provided by torques at the hip joint, resulting in an underactuated system. The mathematical model of the system was first derived using the Euler-Lagrange formulation. Using this model, simulations on the system were performed with different inputs to control the actuators. The robot was then designed and built. This was followed by tests done on the robot to examine its utility as a robotic model of human stance. From these tests, a new design with possible improvements was then proposed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wc927.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qc512</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Robotics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83kz587"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Towards defining a valid assessment criterion of pronunciation proficiency in non-native English speaking graduate students</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Isaacs, Talia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This exploratory, mixed-design study investigates whether intelligibility is "enough," that is, a suitable goal and an adequate assessment criterion, for evaluating proficiency in the pronunciation of non-native English speaking graduate students in the academic domain. The study also seeks to identify those pronunciation features which are most crucial for intelligible speech. Speech samples of 19 non-native English speaking graduate students in the Faculty of Education at McGill University were elicited using the Test of Spoken English (TSE), a standardized test of spoken proficiency which is often used by institutions of higher learning to screen international teaching assistants (ITAs). Results of a fined-grained phonological analysis of the speech samples coupled with intelligibility ratings of 18 undergraduate science students suggest that intelligibility, though an adequate assessment criterion, is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for graduate students to instruct undergraduate courses as teaching assistants, and that there is a threshold level (i.e., minimum acceptable level) of intelligibility that needs to be identified more precisely. While insights about the features of pronunciation that are most critical for intelligibility are inconclusive, it is clear that intelligibility can be compromised for different reasons and is often the result of a combination of "problem areas" that interact together. The study has some important implications for ITA training and assessment, for the design of graduate student pronunciation courses, and for future intelligibility research. It also presents a first step in validating theoretical intelligibility models which lack empirical backing (e.g., Morley, 1994).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579s46k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83kz587</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Pronunciation by foreign speakers -- Evaluation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q423j"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A detailed analysis of ringed seal remains (Phoca hispida) from three seasonally different Thule sites at Hazard Inlet, Somerset Island (Nunavut)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Iorio, Christine J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents an exploratory approach using detailed zooarchaeological analysis to evaluate the nature of ringed seal ( Phoca hispida) remains from three seasonally different Thule sites in the Hazard Inlet area of Somerset Island, Nunavut. Most Thule research focuses on winter occupation and presents Thule as a whaling society. Little attention has been given on the nature of sealing during Thule occupation and research on seasonal differences of seal remains from Thule sites remains scarce. This thesis is thus one of the first to focus on ringed seal remains from seasonally different Thule sites through an analysis of over 30,000 bone specimens. The goal of this thesis is to determine if the seal assemblages are a product of differential butchering and transport, taphonomic processes, or if external factors are also playing a role in shaping the faunal record. The analysis considers variability within each site as well as between the sites. Overall, a moderate to strong correlation was found between bone density and the seal bone elements identified while a negative correlation existed with the elements and FUI (food utility indices). This led to the conclusion that taphonomy was the leading agent shaping the seal remains at Hazard Inlet. However, enough variation existed within each site to consider the role of outside factors, such as the presence of dogs, food preferences, food storage and season of occupation in shaping the seal remains at Hazard Inlet.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30ps97x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q423j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sealing -- Nunavut -- Somerset Island -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thule culture -- Nunavut -- Somerset Island -- Hunting</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ringed seal -- Nunavut -- Somerset Island</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw6634396g"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Breadth and depth of English vocabulary knowledge : which really matters in the academic reading performance of Chinese university students?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Huang, Hsing-Fei, 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explored the relationship between vocabulary size (i.e., breadth of knowledge), depth of vocabulary knowledge, and reading comprehension of Chinese-speaking ESL (English as a second language) university students in Canada. Both aspects of vocabulary knowledge, breadth and depth, continue to play roles in vocabulary research. Few studies, however, have focused on which aspect plays the predominant role in L2 reading. Using three language tests---the GRE (Graduate Record Examinations) for reading comprehension, Nation's (1990) Vocabulary Levels Test, and Read's (1998) Word Associates Test---and verbal reports, the general purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension, and the specific focus was to find out which aspect of vocabulary knowledge, breadth or depth, has greater impact on determining reading comprehension performance. The results demonstrate that (1) test scores on vocabulary size, depth of vocabulary knowledge, and reading comprehension are positively correlated, (2) vocabulary size is a stronger predictor of reading comprehension than depth of vocabulary knowledge, and (3) breadth and depth of vocabulary knowledge are closely interrelated and mutually facilitative. The findings suggest the importance of vocabulary size in reading comprehension for the population tested.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k120.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634396g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Chinese speakers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0c483j65x"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cultural identities of people of &amp;quot;mixed&amp;quot; backgrounds : racial, ethnic and national meanings in negotiation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Iqbal, Sahira</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This qualitative study aims to describe and understand the cultural identities of people of "mixed" backgrounds whose mother comes from one racial, ethnic or national background and whose father comes from another background. In-depth, individual interviews were conducted with nine people of "mixed" backgrounds in order to understand the meanings that particular racial, ethnic or national labels have for them and how those meanings are constructed. My analysis is shaped by the works of Hall (1996, 2003), Taylor (1989, 1992) and Bourdieu (1986, 1990) among others. The participants claimed multiple labels in ambivalent ways. They spoke about what they know or do not know about the culture, connections to people and places, languages and customs, physical features and values. They take on various positionings depending on the discourses that are available and the meanings that they negotiate in their daily encounters. I conclude with the implications the findings may have for policymakers, identity politics and educators and with future research directions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bf21m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483j65x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Racially mixed people</dc:subject><dc:subject>Identity (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ethnicity</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6d56zw81s"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The evolution of the rule of law : the origins and function of legal theory</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ibrahim, Bilal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis examines the origins and function of legal theory ( usul al-fiqh) within the context of the development of early Islamic law.

In 2000, the UK government produced a study that determined there were 400 British cases of "forced marriages" reported to UK police in a two year period. In response to these findings, the UK government launched an educational prevention campaign, in which they defined forced marriage as "a marriage conducted without the valid consent of both parties". I argue that, while the aim of the UK government's campaign is to promote the right of choice in marriage, they do not critically examine legal, religious, political and economic issues that may limit the ability of some British South Asian Muslim women to exercise that right. This study examines these issues to develop a better understanding of the link between culture, religion and forced marriage in certain British South Asian Muslim families.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v573r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462575p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>South Asians -- Great Britain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Muslims -- Great Britain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in Islam</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marriage (Islamic law)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fp27c"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation into the narrative approaches by pre-school children using artistic/visual measures to represent their &amp;quot;worlds&amp;quot;</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Horlik, Christine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines the importance of the artistic process for young children and how this process can aid in their visual, verbal, mental, and emotional development at a critical time of growth.

In the thesis, craft is interlinked with an issue of time, more precisely, with the need for slowing down in order to live and work at a variety of speeds or rhythms. The impact of this on our understanding of learning, in the formal education system and beyond, is central. The thesis draws on a variety of sources from contemporary education and economic theories to craft philosophies of the past and issues relating to the current international Slow movements which urge us to enjoy the sensual, visual and tactile pleasures of life.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b5918834.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vr23v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Handicraft -- Study and teaching</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9w032335k"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of East Asian Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Graphic design in Republican Shanghai : a preliminary study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ho, Daniel Sze-Hin, 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a preliminary investigation into graphic design in 1920s and 1930s Shanghai.

As a vehicle and institute of the state, the Academy created a canon of imagery, which was known throughout Europe. This enabled Louis XIV's image to be reversed by the creators of the satirical images. The makers of the reverse image appropriated the institutionalized styles and genres of royal portraiture to create innovative satirical images of the monarch using the very canon Louis XIV sanctioned. In its analysis of a small body of satirical imagery, the thesis draws on various theories about the body of the king proposed by Jean-Marie Apostolides, Ernst Kantorowicz and Louis Marin. A comparison of satirical images with official images of the king demonstrates the successful strategies of satirical imagery and the collective need for these kinds images in the seventeenth century.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rk62m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zr08h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Louis XIV, King of France, 1638-1715 -- Portraits</dc:subject><dc:subject>Louis XIV, King of France, 1638-1715 -- Caricatures and cartoons</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agb19f616w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Art, identité et Expo 67 : l'expression du nationalisme dans les oeuvres des artistes québécois du Pavillon de la Jeunesse à l'Exposition universelle de Montréal</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hellman, Michel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis will examine the relationship between art, nationalism and identity as it appears in the context of the 1967 Montreal Universal Exposition.

When justice is addressed in bioethics the focus is primarily on the fair distribution of resources, that is, distributive justice. In this thesis, I argue that a distributive conception of justice is unable to adequately address many of the relevant issues of justice within bioethics. These issues are better understood and addressed using a social conception of justice. Social justice is concerned with ensuring that the norms and rules of social structures are fair and equitable. I argue that social and distributive justice are not only compatible, but also complementary. As a result, both conceptions of justice need to be applied to bioethical issues if we are to achieve a truly just outcome. As a case study, I apply this analysis to the controversial issue of the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical research trial.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kq72f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945r10w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social justice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Justice (Philosophy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bioethics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vb59f"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Elevated waist to hip ratio and cardiovascular disease risk, assessed by the apoBapoA1 ratio, in Asian Indian immigrants</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Smith, Jessica, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Traditional indicators of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk may not be appropriate for Asian Indians. We designed a cross-sectional study of body fat distribution, apoB/apoA1 ratio and adipokines of Northern Indians compared to Caucasians to determine if there is a different relationship between these parameters. Indian (men: n = 54; women n = 28) and Caucasian (men: n= 32; women, n = 51) subjects were recruited who were between the ages of 20 and 60 years. Subjects were excluded if they had a history of CVD or were taking lipid lowering medications. Body fat percentage (BF%) was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Indian subjects had a substantially higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) ratio than Caucasian subjects (men: 0.93 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.01, p &lt; 0.001; women: 0.88 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.76 +/- 0.01, p &lt; 0.0001). Interestingly, while WHR correlated strongly with BF% in Caucasians (men: r = 0.63 p = 0.0002; women: r = 0.74, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively) there was no correlation in Indians (men: r = 0.22, ns; women: r = 0.23, ns). The regression lines for WHR vs. BF% of Indians compared to Caucasians was significantly different (men p = 0.02, women p = 0.002). A similar pattern of correlation was seen with WHR and BMI. In addition, Indian men and women had a higher apoB/A1 ratio than Caucasians: the most powerful lipoprotein measure of CVD risk (men: 0.84+/-0.04 vs. 0.66+/-0.04, p=0.001; women: 0.70+/-0.04 vs. 0.56+/-0.03, p = 0.003, respectively).

Hypothetically, these alterations in body composition, apoB/apoA1 and adipokines could be due to alterations in adipocyte number.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g779c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vb59f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>East Indian Canadians</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body composition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body mass index -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cardiovascular system -- Diseases -- Risk factors</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655g96z"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of astroglial HO-1 in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Song, Linyang, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The mechanisms responsible for the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and pathological iron deposition in the substania nigra pars compacta of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) remain incompletely understood. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and ferrous iron, is up-regulated in affected PD astroglia and may contribute to aberrant mitochondrial iron sequestration in these cells. To determine whether glial HO-1 hyperexpression is inimical to nearby neuronal constituents, we co-cultured dopaminergic PC12 cells atop monolayers of human (h) HO-1 transfected, sham-transfected or non-transfected primary rat astroglia. We observed that PC12 cells grown atop hHO-1 transfected astrocytes, but not the astroglia themselves, were significantly more vulnerable to dopamine (1muM) + H2O2 (1muM)-induced death (measured by nuclear ethidium monoazide bromide staining and anti-TH immunofluorescence microscopy) relative to control preparations. In the experimental group, PC12 cell death was significantly attenuated by the administration of the HO inhibitor, SnMP (1.5muM), the antioxidant, ascorbate (200muM), or the iron chelators, deferoxamine (400muM) and phenanthroline (100muM). Exposure to conditioned media derived from HO-1 transfected astrocytes also augmented PC12 cell killing in response to dopamine (1muM) + H2O2 (1muM) relative to control media. In PD patients, over-expression of HO-1 in nigral astroglia and attendant iron liberation may facilitate the bioactivation of dopamine to neurotoxic free radical intermediates and predispose nearby neuronal constituents to oxidative damage.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x176g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655g96z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30ps986"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Managing the issue of mercury exposure in Nunavut</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Solomon, Patricia-Ann</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study sought to characterize the risk to human health from dietary mercury (Hg) exposure in two Inuit communities, Repulse Bay and lgloolik.

Estimated average daily Hg exposures for women of child-bearing age were 21.3 mug in Repulse Bay, and 6.0 mug in lgloolik; the general population exposures were 43.1 mug in Repulse Bay and 23.2 mug in lgloolik. Average hair concentrations were 2.1 mg/kg and 2.8 mg/kg in Repulse Bay, 2.1 mg/kg and 6.2 mg/kg in lgloolik for women of child-bearing age and the general population respectively. No participants had concentrations above the "at risk" concentration of 30 mg/kg. Significant correlations were observed between hair Hg concentration and traditional food intake. These results do not necessitate direct intervention, but validate continued monitoring of Hg exposure in Nunavut.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rw93b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30ps986</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mercury in the body</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health risk assessment -- Nunavut</dc:subject><dc:subject>Methylmercury -- Bioaccumulation -- Nunavut</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inuit -- Health and hygiene -- Nunavut</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g301h"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Groups elementary equivalent to a free 2-nilpotent group of arbitrary finite rank</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sohrabi, Mahmood</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis we discuss the characterization of groups elementary equivalent to a free 2-nilpotent group G of arbitrary finite rank. We find a characterization and verify it using two different lines of argument. The first one goes through using a construction very similar to the famous Mal'cev correspondence. This strategy is very much in the same spirit as the work of O. V. Belegradek on unitriangular groups. The second method, we call the method of bilinear mappings, is due to Alexei Miasnikov. A bilinear map fG is associated to the nilpotent group G. Then a commutative associative ring P(fG) is recovered via the bilinear mapping fG. This ring is the maximal ring relative to which fG remains bilinear. Under some reasonable conditions the ring P( fG) is absolutely interpretable in G. Then we use this construction to give a second proof for the characterization.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w37637050.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g301h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gs93w"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Expression of the formin Daam 1 in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus affects spine morphology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Salomon, Steven</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Formins, also known as formin homology (FH) proteins, are involved in a wide range of actin-mediated processes. The Diaphanous-related formin Daam1 (Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis) interacts with the PDZ domain protein Dishevelled, and is required to establish planar cell polarity in Xenopus. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, I characterized a PDZ-mediated interaction between the C-terminus of Daam1 and the PDZ domains 456 of GRIP1. In dissociated rat hippocampal cultures, Daam1 expression was seen throughout the soma and dendrites in a punctate pattern. Furthermore, co-staining with a synaptic marker suggests that Daam1 could be associated with post-synaptic specializations. Dendritic spines are enriched with actin filaments, and based on the subcellular localization of Daam1 and the evidence that formins are involved in regulating actin polymerization, I hypothesized that Daam1 might play a role in dendritic spine morphology. In order to investigate the functional roles for Daam1, viral vectors were developed using the Semliki-Forest defective viral vector to over-express the full-length Daam1 protein and a Daam1 lacking the PDZ-binding motif. The over-expression of the full-length Daam1 in organotypic hippocampal slices showed a punctate distribution throughout the dendritic shaft, with the occasional appearance in spines, resulting in an overall increase in dendritic spine length. This suggests that formins, such as Daam1, could potentially regulate spine morphology.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085k285.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gs93w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Carrier Proteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nerve Tissue Proteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nerve tissue proteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carrier proteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pyramidal Cells</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cellular signal transduction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dendritic Spines</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418n470"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Role of the Rho GTPases in the signaling mechanisms regulated by the axon guidance cue Netrin-1 receptors deleted in colorectar cancer and Unc5H1</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Saint-Cyr Proulx, Étienne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Chemotropic cues guide the migrating axons of neurons in the developing nervous system. Netrins are bifunctional guidance cues, attracting or repelling different classes of axons. The attraction to netrins is mediated by DCC whereas repulsion is achieved through Unc5H receptors. In this thesis, we demonstrate that Rho GTPases are required for embryonic spinal commissural axon outgrowth induced by Netrin-1. Using N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, we have found that Rac1 and Cdc42 activities are required for DCC-induced neurite outgrowth. In fibroblasts, DCC was found to trigger actin reorganization through activation of Rac1. Moreover, we show that Unc5H1 triggers actin reorganization through activation of RhoA in fibroblasts. Using N1E-115 cells we found that Unc5H1 induces neurite outgrowth in a Rac1- and Cdc42-dependent manner. The studies presented in this thesis demonstrate that Rho GTPases are major signaling components of Netrin-1 receptors DCC and Unc5H1.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z9030159.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418n470</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wj71p"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Snapshot based concurrency control protocols for XML</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sardar, Zeeshan Mohammad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Currently, only few XML data management systems support concurrent access to an XML document, and if they do, they typically apply variations of locking to handle XML's nested structure. However, advanced query processing techniques use a wide range of indexes and allow for arbitrary navigation through the XML documents, making lock acquisition complex and potentially leading to high blocking rates. In this thesis, we suggest two concurrency control protocols that avoid any read locks by providing transactions a committed snapshot of the data. OptiX enhances traditional optimistic concurrency control to work on XML while SnaX offers snapshot isolation as provided by relational database systems like Oracle and Post-greSQL. We evaluate the performance of these two protocols on XML documents of different structure and on the XMark benchmark. For that purpose, we propose suitable update operations to serve as an extension to XMark which currently supports only queries.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh02r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wj71p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g3032"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A visual servoing system for an amphibious legged robot</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sattar, Junaed</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We present a visual servoing system for an amphibious legged robot. That is, a monocular-vision based servoing mechanism that enables the robot to track and follow a target both underwater and on the ground. We used three different tracking algorithms to track and localize the target in the image, with color being the tracked feature. Tracking is performed based on the object's color, color distribution and color distribution with a probabilistic kernel. Output from the tracker is channeled to a proportional-integral-derivative controller, which generates steering commands for the robot controller. The robot controller in turn takes the steering commands and generates motor commands for the six legs of the robot. A large class of significant applications can be addressed by allowing such a robot to follow a diver or some other moving target. The system has been evaluated in the open water and under natural lighting conditions, and has successfully performed tracking and following of a wide variety of target objects.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k287m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g3032</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Robotics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sg56p"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification and analysis of new mutations that suppress the slow defecation phenotype of clk-1(qm30) mutants</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rodrigues, Tania, 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mutations in the clk-1 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans result in an average slowing down and deregulation of a variety of developmental and physiological processes. In addition, clk-1 mutants are defective in responding to temperature changes. For example, wild-type worms adjust their defecation cycle length after a temperature shift whereas the defecation cycle length of clk-1 mutants is unaffected by such a shift. To understand the basis of the clk-1 phenotype, a number of genetic screens have been carried out to isolate feature-specific suppressor mutations. dsc-3(qm179) and dsc-4(qm182) were isolated in this manner. It has previously been found that dsc-3(qm179) and dsc-4(qm182) strongly suppress the slow defecation phenotype of clk-1 mutants at 20°C, as well as after a temperature shift to 25°C. Molecular analysis of dsc-4, which encodes the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, suggests that dsc genes affect lipid metabolism. We carried out a genetic screen for additional mutations that can suppress the slow defecation of clk-1 mutants after a temperature shift to 25°C and isolated two new suppressor mutations. Complementation tests as well as linkage analysis and mapping indicates that dsc-6(qm192) and dsc-7(qm193) define new dsc genes. We analyzed the phenotype of the new suppressor strains and have found that, like dsc-4(qm182), dsc-6(qm192) and dsc-7(qm193) can suppress a variety of clk-1 phenotypes. Based on additional phenotypic analyses of the new suppressor strains, including the determination of their sensitivity to exogenous cholesterol, we believe that, like dsc-4, dsc-6 and dsc-7 encode activities that affect lipid metabolism in worms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73pw358.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sg56p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lipids -- Metabolism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afn106z39w"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of Momordica charantia and cinnamon extracts on glucose uptake and adiponectin secretion in 3T3-L1 adipose cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Roffey, Ben</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To examine the effects of Momordica charantia (MC) and cinnamon on glucose uptake and adiponectin secretion (AS) fat cells, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with a water extract of cinnamon (CE) and three concentrations of MC water and ethanol extracts. The treatment combination of 0.2 mg/ml MC water extract and 0.5 nM insulin was associated with an increased glucose uptake into the cells (61%) and increased AS from the cells (75%). Without insulin, 0.2 mg/ml of CE increased glucose uptake (100%) and completely inhibited AS from the cells. Sub-optimal concentrations of insulin did not further enhance the CE activity and, in combination with 50 nM insulin, a dose-dependent decrease in glucose uptake was observed. The present results indicate that preferentially water-soluble component(s) in MC enhance the glucose uptake action of sub-optimal concentrations of insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This effect is accompanied by and may be a result of increased AS. CE increases glucose uptake in these adipocytes but inhibits AS.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kj90x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn106z39w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Non-insulin-dependent diabetes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cinnamon</dc:subject><dc:subject>Momordica charantia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hypoglycemic agents</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
