The method proposed is based on a lattice re-scoring paradigm implemented to integrate articulatory based features into automatic speech recognition systems. Time delay neural networks are trained as feature detectors to generate feature streams over which hidden Markov models (HMMs) are defined. These articulatory based HMMs are combined with HMMs defined over spectral energy based Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) acoustic features through a sequential lattice re-scoring procedure. The optimum phone strings are found by maximizing the log-linear combination of acoustic and language models likelihoods during recognition. The associated log-linear weights are estimated using a discriminative model combination approach. All the experiments are performed using the DARPA TIMIT speech database and the results are presented in terms of phone accuracies.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526g841.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zj09n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hidden Markov models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Automatic speech recognition</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2j62s8515"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of Gemini surfactant on the formation kinetic behavior of methane hydrate</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mishal, Yeshai</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Gas hydrates are a topic of great interest and intense investigation. Traditionally, these compounds have been seen as a nuisance to the oil and gas industry, which can plug pipelines and cause hours of costly downtime. More recently, gas hydrates have been viewed as a possible energy source due to the vast amount of methane trapped in the form of gas hydrate. Many researchers have also proposed the possibility of transporting natural gas in the form of gas hydrate may be safer and more economical than using liquid or compressed natural gas. Gas hydrate may also offer the possibility of reducing greenhouse gas emissions via the sequestration of carbon dioxide. Surfactants have been found to act as both promoters and inhibitors of hydrate formation. In the present study, the formation rate, solubility and mass transfer conductance of methane in the presence of Gemini surfactant, a new class of surfactants, was studied with varying concentration of Gemini surfactant. The experiments to determine the formation rates of methane hydrate were conducted at 4째C and 6500 kPa. While the experiments to determine solubility and mass conductance were carried out at 4째C and 3800 kPa. The resulting values were used to determine experimental accuracy and reproducibility by comparing the values obtained with literature values and by analyzing the distribution of the data obtained. Solubility measurements were extremely close to literature values with only a 1.4% difference. The distribution of solubility values and formation rates did not deviate significantly between replicates indicating a high degree of reproducibility; however, a lot of variability was observed in mass transfer conductance. This may be attributed to the fact that mass transfer was not determined experimentally by regressing a coefficient to fit a curve, which may be less accurate than other experimentally determined parameters. In the second part of the study, the formation rate, solubility and mass transfer conductance of methane were determined using aqueous Gemini surfactant solutions. The experiments to determine the formation rates of methane hydrate were conducted at 4째C and 6500 kPa. While the experiments to determine solubility and mass transfer conductance were carried out at 4째C and 3800 kPa. The resulting values were used to determine the effect of Gemini surfactant on the properties of interest by comparing the values obtained with aqueous Gemini surfactant with the values previously obtained for pure water. The results obtained showed that solubility increased with increasing concentrations of Gemini surfactant with solubility increasing by up to 18% for higher concentration of Gemini surfactant. The mass transfer conductance was also found to increase by up to 49%; however other than the existence of an increase, no conclusive relationship could be determined between the concentration of Gemini surfactant and mass transfer conductance. Finally, the formation rate of gas hydrates was found to decrease slightly, relative to water, at low concentrations, increased linearly at subsequently higher concentrations and ultimately plateau at a maximum. This trend was in agreement with similar experiments found in literature and the increase in formation rate may be attributed to the increase in both solubility and mass transfer conductance when using aqueous Gemini surfactant.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rj032.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s8515</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Methane</dc:subject><dc:subject>Surface active agents -- Industrial applications</dc:subject><dc:subject>Natural gas -- Hydrates</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2f75rc60w"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation of tunnel-soil-pile interaction in cohesive soils</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mattar, Joe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Underground tunnels are considered to be a vital infrastructure component in most cities around the world. Careful planning is always necessary to ensure minimum impact on nearby surface and subsurface structures. This thesis describes the experimental and numerical investigations carried out at McGill University to examine the effect of existing pile foundation on the stresses developing in a newly constructed tunnel supported by a flexible lining system. A small scale testing facility was designed and built to simulate the process of tunnel excavation and lining installation in the close vicinity of pre-installed piles. Lining stresses were measured for different separation distances between the tunnel and the existing piles. Significant decrease in circumferential stresses was observed when the lining was installed at a distance that ranges between one to three times the tunnel diameter from the piles. Two-dimensional finite element analyses were also conducted to investigate the different aspects of the pile-soil-lining interaction including lining deformation, axial forces and bending moments. The measured lining stresses agreed with those obtained using finite element analysis. The results presented in this study provided an insight into understanding an important aspect of this soil-structure interaction problem.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408170j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75rc60w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tunnel lining</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tunnels -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Piling (Civil engineering)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soil mechanics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afx719q73k"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>RF power amplifiers and MEMS varactors</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mahdavi, Sareh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is concerned with the design and implementation of radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers and micro-electromechanical systems---namely MEMS varactors. This is driven by the many wireless communication systems which are constantly moving towards increased integration, better signal quality, and longer battery life. The power amplifier consumes most of the power in a receiver/transmitter system (transceiver), and its output signal is directly transmitted by the antenna without further modification. Thus, optimizing the PA for low power consumption, increased linearity, and compact integration is highly desirable. Micro-electromechanical systems enable new levels of performance in radio-frequency integrated circuits, which are not readily available via conventional IC technologies. They are good candidates to replace lossy, low Q-factor off-chip components, which have traditionally been used to implement matching networks or output resonator tanks in class AB, class F, or class E power amplifiers. The MEMS technologies also make possible the use of new architectures, with the possibility of flexible re-configurability and tunability for multi-band and/or multi-standard applications. The major effort of this thesis is focused on the design and fabrication of an RF frequency class AB power amplifier in the SiGe BiCMOS 5HP technology, with the capability of being tuned with external MEMS varactors. The latter necessitated the exploration of wide-tuning range MEMS variable capacitors, with prototypes designed and fabricated in the Metal-MUMPS process. An attempt is made to integrate the power amplifier chip and the MEMS die in the same package to provide active tuning of the power amplifier matching network, in order to keep the efficiency of the PA constant for different input power levels and load conditions. Detailed simulation and measurement results for all circuits and MEMS devices are reported and discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kr672.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719q73k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Power amplifiers -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amplifiers, Radio frequency -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microelectromechanical systems -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vg08s"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of boron on microstructure and mechanical properties of low carbon microalloyed steels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lu, Yu, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Low carbon bainitic steels microalloyed with Nb, Ti and V are widely used for the pipeline, construction and automobile industries because of their excellent combination of strength, toughness and weldability. Boron as another major alloying element has been also frequently used in this type of steels since the 1970s. The purpose of adding boron is to improve the hardenability of the steel by promoting bainite formation. It has been realized that Boron can only be effective as a strengthening element when it is prevented from forming BN and/or Fe23(C, B) 6 precipitates. Therefore, Boron is always added together with other alloying elements which are stronger Nitride or Carbide formers, such as Ti and Nb. However, the formation of complex bainitic structures and the interaction with precipitates at industrial coiling temperature are not adequately understood. In this study, the effect of boron on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a low carbon Nb-B steel was studied by a hot compression test (50% reduction at 850째C) followed by quenching samples into a salt bath. The microstructures of the tested samples were examined through optical microscopy and SEM; and the mechanical properties of these samples were investigated by micro-hardness and shear punch tests. The results indicate that during thermo-mechanical controlled rolling (TCR), the final properties of the products not only depend on the applied deformation but also depend on the coiling temperature where phase transformation takes place. According to the investigation, two strengthening mechanisms are responsible for the strength of the steel at the coiling temperature: phase transformation and precipitation. Under optical microscopy, the microstructures of all specimens appear to be bainite in a temperature range from 350째C to 600째C without distinct differences. However, the SEM micrographs revealed that the microstructures at 550째C are very different from the microstructures transformed at the other holding temperatures. Two strength peaks were observed at 350째C and 550째C in the temperature range studied. It is believed that the NbC precipitates are the main contributor to the peak strength observed at 550째C because the kinetics of NbC is quite rapid at this temperature. The strength peak at 350째C is mainly due to the harder bainitic phase, which formed at relatively lower temperature.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526g859.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vg08s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bainitic steel -- Microstructure</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bainitic steel -- Mechanical properties</dc:subject><dc:subject>Boron steel</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microalloying</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445ch880"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Controlling hour-long power of wind farms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Pei, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In attempting to control the power output of a wind farm, it is first necessary to smooth the power fluctuations due to wind turbulence. This is accomplished by spatial smoothing, whereby the high frequency power components of a single wind turbine generator (WTG) is reduced by a factor of N-1/2, where N is the number of WTGs in the farm. For this reason the first part of the thesis is concerned with developing a model of smoothing in a wind farm and justifying it mathematically. After spatial smoothing, the wind farm output still contains low frequency fluctuations. The second part of the thesis makes use of a combination of: (i) pitch angle control of the turbine blades, (ii) power electronic control of the generators, (iii) spatial filtering and (iv) negative feedback control to remove the low frequency fluctuations. The wind farm output then has the quality to be sold as regulated power which fetches a better economic return than when sold as energy. This, of course, presumes that 1-hour ahead prediction of wind velocity at 1-hour long low variance is available. The thesis also considers the case when the conditions for regulated power are not predicted. In this situation, the wind farm may opt to use the tracking mode which tracks the slowly time varying non-turbulent wind power. The thesis examines the possibility of diverting some of the wind farm power to implement dynamic performance enhancement strategies, for system damping for example. The controllability of the wind farm is demonstrated by simulations of a wind farm made up of 24 wind turbine-generators (WTGs) using 1-hour long wind velocity data.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k35697888.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445ch880</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wind power plants</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602459n"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of supply function equilibria in electricity markets</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lee, Kelvin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Deregulation is a growing trend and the electricity industry has not escaped its reaches. With worldwide experiences spanning only thirty years, there is substantial interest in analyzing current and future market designs so that market power cannot be used to increase the price of electricity significantly. This thesis analyzes market power in electricity markets through the notion of Nash equilibrium (NE) and, more specifically, through Supply Function Equilibrium (SFE). We will examine how SFE can be modified to incorporate capacity constraints on generators and generating companies (gencos) controlling more than one generator for a Poolco electricity market with marginal pricing. A genco's supply function is assumed to be of the form gi=l-aibi . Gaming is done either with ai or bi only, while keeping the other parameter at true cost. Gaming with both variables cannot be analyzed since the problem would have too many degrees of freedom. For each possible generator output level (minimum output, maximum output, or in between), analytical methods are employed to determine all candidate Nash equilibria. Then, simulations are performed over the range of possible genco offers to determine whether these candidates meet the complete set of Nash equilibrium criteria, specifically whether any genco can or cannot improve its profit by gaming. For various inelastic demand levels, study cases indicate that there are either no Nash equilibria or only one. In the multi-unit genco case, the price of electricity is found to be higher than in the case where each genco owns only one generator, illustrating the effect of market concentration on the price. Whether capacity constraints are considered or not, the price of electricity appears to be higher if gencos are allowed to game with bi instead of ai. The inclusion of capacity constraints on generators and the consideration of the multi-unit genco case will allow for better genco modeling in a Poolco market with marginal pricing. In turn, this will lead to more accurate analysis of the effects of current and possible rules and regulations on the price of electricity.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kt986.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602459n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electric power distribution -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric power -- Economic aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric utilities -- Management -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw66347196"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Anodized alumina as a template for nanostructure processing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kassangana, Alain Gabriel Mbengu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A novel way of producing nanostructures in the past decade has been through the use of an anodized alumina template. This template has dense, self-ordered nanometric pores that grow in the oxide as the aluminum is being anodized. This technique is a fairly new method of processing nanostructures, and much study and research is presently being done to understand the formation mechanisms of the highly ordered pores. Ultra-pure aluminum foil and pure aluminium single crystal plates were anodized to create porous anodized alumina, and using it as a template to electro-deposit Nickel nanostructures. The effects different anodizing parameters have on oxide creation were studied, and the results obtained from studying the effects of substrate purity and texture of the anodized aluminum substrate on the morphology of the alumina template, through the use of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Nickel nanowires were prepared by DC electrodeposition inside the porous alumina template with a gold-palladium coating serving a conductive base. The nanowires have a diameter of 65 nm, and their length depends on the deposition time. The nanowires can uphold a position perpendicular to the substrate by partially dissolving the alumina template. They also have a tendency to gather together once the template is partially removed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gp65n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w66347196</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Metals -- Anodic oxidation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nanowires</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nanostructured materials</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aluminum oxide</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451n30j"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fluid structure interaction modeling of pulsatile blood flow in serial pulmonary artery stenoses</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hong, Say Yenh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Motivated by the physiological phenomena of collapse and flow limitation for a serial pulmonary artery stenosis, we investigated the three-dimensional influence of spatial configuration on the wall motion and hemodynamic. Our numerical study focused on the effect of two geometrical parameters: the relative distance and the angular orientation between the two stenoses. The collapse of a compliant arterial stenosis may cause flow choking, which would limit the flow reserve to major vital vascular beds such as the lungs, potentially leading to a lethal ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Flow through a stenotic vessel is known to produce flow separation downstream of the throat. The eccentricity of a stenosis leads to asymmetric flow where the high velocity jets impinge on the sidewall, thereby inducing significant dissipation. The additional viscous dissipation causes a higher pressure drop for a flow through a stenotic vessel, than in a straight compliant vessel. It is likely that some particular morphology would have a higher vulnerability to the fluid induced instability of buckling (divergence), under physiological pulsatile flow. It was found that fluid pressure distribution have substantial implication for the downstream wall motion, under conditions of strong coupling between nonlinear vessel geometries, and their corresponding asymmetric flow. The three-dimensional fluid structure interaction problem is solved numerically by a finite element method based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation, a natural approach to deal with the moving interface between the flow and vessel. The findings of this investigation reveal that the closeness between stenoses is a substantial indication of wall collapse at the downstream end. Moreover, the results suggest a close link between the initial angular orientation of the distal stenosis (i.e. the constriction direction) and the subsequent wall motion at the downstream end. For cases showing evidence of preferential direction of wall motion, it was found that the constricted side underwent greater cumulative displacement than the straight side, suggestive of significant wall collapse.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wr47k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451n30j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arteries -- Stenosis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pulmonary artery -- Diseases</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fluid-structure interaction -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw3763b520"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>St[r]ategic offers in an oligopolistic electricity market under pay-as-bid pricing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ganjbakhsh, Omid</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Marginal pricing is the traditional pricing method in pool based electricity markets, however pay-as-bid is an alternative that has been the focus of recent studies.

Marginal pricing market equilibria has also been examined under oligopolistic markets, however, the same attention has not been given to oligopolies based on pay-as-bid pricing.

The present project concentrates on possible methods that would allow the plasma spraying of CNT-based nano-composite coatings. Various methods for producing metal-CNT composite powders for thermal plasma spraying are studied in this project. The first method discussed is based on CNT dispersion followed by an agglomeration procedure using a polymer binder. The second and more promising technique gets around the problems associated with handling, separating, and transporting the nanotubes to the substrate through a direct synthesis of the CNT on the particles to be sprayed. In the present context, this synthesis is made on pretreated stainless steel SS304 powders by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). A parametric study is made for the various steps of the thermal CVD process by varying parameters such as the etching time in the pre-treatment sequence, while the reaction temperature, the annealing temperature, the growth phase duration and the acetylene injection time are varied for the CVD sequence. The composite powders are analyzed using high resolution electron microscopy images (FEGSEM), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, and BET surface area analyses. This study provided the parametric optimization of the thermal CVD procedure with respect to CNT production. The composite powders generated show a dense, fully covered, and uniform CNT forest with a purity of CNT to amorphous carbon of 86% based on the micro-Raman spectra obtained.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mt53g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558h798</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plasma spraying</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nanotubes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metal spraying</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbon</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494c941"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation into a new binder for hydraulic backfill</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fadaei Kermani, Mehrdad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Over the last three decades, mine backfilling has progressively integrated into underground mining operations. The high stresses associated with mining at depth in the Canadian Shield, also requires innovative approaches to mine backfilling to withstand the loading both during and after mining operations. Not only new or modified minefill systems are required, but also new techniques are needed to increase the speed of the mining cycle for optimizing the mining operation. Three major purposes of mine backfill are known as (1) providing safe working condition, (2) maximizing ore recovery and (3) improving underground stability. Therefore, mine backfill has contributed greatly to the economics and environmental aspects of mining industry. In order to improve the mechanical behaviour of fill, cementitious materials are used. These cementitious materials are expensive. As a result the consumption of these cementitious materials has to be optimized and minimized in a way that the required strength is met. The objective of this research is to investigate a new type of backfill, which is known as gelfill. Gelfill binders usually consist of alkali activators such as sodium silicate and the other cementitious materials. Sodium silicate has been used in waste treatment and activation of artificial pozzolans such as blast furnace slag and fly ash. The work presented in this thesis is to evaluate the use of sodium silicate in gelfill. Consequently, the influence of mixing time, mixing sequence and curing time are studied on gelfill and silica sand hydraulic backfill. Various tests including unconfined and confined compressive strength were conducted in order to investigate the mechanical behaviour of samples. By conducting mercury intrusion porosimetery (MIP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microstructure and mineralogical properties of specimens were studied. The result of this thesis demonstrates that gelfill compared with silica sand hydraulic backfill has better mechanical properties.

It has been proposed that by exploiting interference strategies within this critical step of infection the ability to create 'non-infective' biomaterials may be developed. This thesis demonstrates the effectivity of North American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) derived proanthocyanidins in preventing the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to biomaterial surfaces. Specifically, using a model of catheter associated urinary tract infection, significant reductions in initial adhesion of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis to PVC and PTFE were observed. With the application of colloidal theory, a mechanism of steric interference was determined as responsible for these effects. The evidence presented implicates PAC as a molecule of interest for the development of novel biomaterials with increased resistance to bacteria colonization.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r474w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p400x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biomedical materials</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bacterial Adhesion</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bacteria -- Adhesion</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biocompatible Materials</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proanthocyanidins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anthocyanidins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vaccinium macrocarpon</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cranberries</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21tk108"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Comparative numerical study of the intra-vessel flow characteristics between a flat and a cylindrical configuration in a stented wall region</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Drapeau, Guy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mechanical stresses and flow dynamics alteration in a stented artery region are known to stimulate intimal thickening and increase the risk of restenosis, the closure of a revascularized artery. Particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) is an optical flow visualization technique that can be used to characterize the local flow dynamics around different stent structures. However, the usual cylindrical stent geometries present visualization difficulties when using an optical measurement technique such as the PIV technique. Using a flat configuration of a stent model presents advantages over the usual cylindrical model. A planar stent model makes data acquisition easier in planes cutting through the model due to its flat geometry that is compatible with the PIV planar flow investigation technique. Furthermore, with the planar stent configuration model velocity measurements and their associated flow features can be done without inducing refraction of the laser light sheet occurring with the cylindrical model's curvature. The refraction of light should be avoided since measurement errors and reflections are the resulting effects of this laser light plane deviation when passing through the curvature of a cylindrical stent model. The spatial and temporal distribution of the Wall Shear Stress (WSS), which is believed to be of primary importance in the development of restenosis should be comparable between the flat and the cylindrical stent configuration models. The velocity and shear strain rate distributions will be compared between the flat and cylindrical stent configurations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in order to analyse the feasibility of using a flat instead of a cylindrical version of the stent model for PIV experiments. It will be shown that for a physiological pulsatile flow the flat model yields results in shear strain rate spatial and temporal distribution that is comparable to the cylindrical model. A more PIV compatible, efficient and less refractive error prone validated flat model would be advantageous when several stent designs influence on the local hemodynamics around the strut geometries have to be studied quantitatively and optimized.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kf31z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tk108</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Simulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hemorheology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hemodynamics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coronary Restenosis -- prevention &amp; control</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prosthesis Design</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apr76f7259"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Comparative study of aerial platforms for Mars exploration</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dhanji, Nasreen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The primary objective of this thesis is to develop a framework to compare the performance of fixed-wing aircraft, airships, and the rotary-wing aircraft in the Martian environment and through that framework, determine which of these platforms is best suited to conduct a series of scientific investigations on Mars. Three Mars mission scenarios provide the context within which the performance of the platforms is evaluated. The mission scenarios are used to derive the performance requirements including the range and flight path to be covered, the altitude at which the platforms fly, and the scientific investigations to be performed along with the associated scientific instrumentation to be carried as payload. Existing platform designs are used for the purpose of this comparative study and are modified depending on specific mission requirements. A set of weighted performance metrics, including the gross takeoff mass, power required, manoeuvrability, and complexity, serves as a common basis for comparing the performance of the three aerial platforms. The results of this comparative study indicate that the airship is best suited for all mission scenarios considered due to its simplicity and high degree of manoeuvrability. However, it is important to note that a series of subjective design choices with respect to platform speed and available power were made that significantly impact the overall performance of the platforms. Altering these design choices as well as the mission requirements could result in a different platform being best suited for each Mars mission. For instance, increasing the cruising velocity of the fixed-wing aircraft may allow its dimensions to be scaled down thereby reducing the complexity and making it a more competitive platform for long-range missions. In addition, for short-range missions that do not require a high degree of manoeuvrability but where the gross takeoff mass and complexity are more important factors, the rotary-wing aircraft becomes the best option.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881q69w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f7259</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mars (Planet) -- Exploration -- Equipment and supplies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Airplanes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Airships</dc:subject><dc:subject>Helicopters</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bn056"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Modeling and cycle-to-cycle control of the angioplasty balloon forming process</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chen, Yan, 1982-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The development of a new angioplasty balloon is a time consuming process. This thesis aims at reducing the amount of time and materials spent on the experimental stage of the development of new angioplasty balloons. This can be achieved by building a nonlinear neural network model of the balloon forming process and implementing an off-line cycle-to-cycle controller. The controller can learn from the previous experiments and provide better input parameters for improving the quality of the next balloons formed in the process. It is shown in the experimental test results that the neural network model can provide accurate estimates of the process outputs.

However, a conventional adaptive postfilter is based on empirical assumptions of masking phenomena, which sometimes makes it hard to balance between noise reduction and speech distortion. This thesis introduces a novel perceptual postfiltering system for low bit rate speech coders. The proposed postfilter works at the decoder, as is the case for the conventional adaptive postfilter. Specific human auditory properties are considered in the postfilter design to improve speech quality. A Gaussian Mixture Model based Minimum Mean Squared Error estimation of the perceptual postfilter is performed with the received information at the decoder. Perceptual postfiltering is then applied to the reconstructed speech to improve speech quality. Test results show that the proposed system gives better perceptual speech quality over conventional adaptive postfiltering.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732dd63c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jf833</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Speech processing systems -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coding theory</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xw66n"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of surfactants in kraft pulping of different wood species</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chen, Dezhi, 1982-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A unique penetration instrument has been developed to evaluate the role of surfactants in kraft pulping process. This instrument can screen surfactants which can improve the wood impregnation more effectively and much faster than pilot-plant experiment. The role of surfactants in wood penetration has been explored. Surfactants can improve wood impregnation by dispersing the extractives in the wood structure and optimizing the interfacial properties between wood surface and kraft liquor. The addition of two blends of anionic and nonionic surfactants into kraft pulping process results in a significant reduction of the screen rejects and an increase of screened yield at the same delignification rate. Six wood species were tested in this study including both non-resinous and resinous wood species. Both sapwood and heartwood of these species were tested. Surfactants were found to have no improvement on sapwood, but a significant improvement on heartwood. The critical micelle concentrations (CMC) of surfactants in kraft liquor were determined. The best dosages of surfactants based on CMC were also determined in this study.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pk92f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xw66n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sulfate pulping process</dc:subject><dc:subject>Surface active agents -- Industrial applications</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f485f"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Welding and weld repair of nanostructured and amorphous materials</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cadney, Sean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In recent years, nanostructured and amorphous metals have become more prominent in scientific research. Their unique characteristics and their vastly superior mechanical properties have lead to emerging technical applications however the use of these materials is only in its infancy. To further growth the industrial applications for these advanced materials, joining processes capable of maintaining the unique aspects of the microstructure are required. Joining of two beveled plates has been accomplished by use of the Cold Spray process. This process uses a converging diverging nozzle to accelerate micron sized powder towards a substrate. The strength of the resulting joint has been compared to freeforms made of powder of the same composition. No significant difference was observed in the mechanical properties between the freeforms and the weldments and examination of the fracture surface showed that the strength of the interface is higher than the strength of the freeform itself. A weld repair experiment has also been performed where the ElectroSpark Deposition process (ESD) has successfully been used to transfer amorphous material from an electrode to an amorphous substrate without crystallizing either material. This result is of crucial importance as it signifies that these extremely expensive and heat sensitive materials can be repaired when in-service wear causes damage. This process, due to its inherently fast cooling rate, has also successfully been used to transform a crystalline AlCoCe alloy into an amorphous deposit atop both amorphous and crystalline substrates.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zx886.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f485f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nanostructured materials</dc:subject><dc:subject>Welding</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metallic glasses</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metals -- Weldability</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wv143"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of surface processing variables on hydrogen embrittlement of steel fasteners</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brahimi, Salim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Incremental step load testing was used in accordance with ASTM F1940 to rank a number coating processes used in the fastener industry for their propensity to cause internal hydrogen embrittlement. The results showed that coating permeability has a first order effect, while the quantity of hydrogen introduced by the process has a second order effect. Pure zinc electroplating processes, alkaline and acid, were found to be the most embrittling, owing to the low permeability of zinc. The least embrittling processes were zinc-nickel, alkaline and acid, owing to the high permeability of Zn-Ni coatings. Non-electrolytic processes, namely phosphating, mechanical galvanising, DacrometRTM and Magni 555RTM were found to be non-embrittling. Hot dip galvanising was found to be highly embrittling, evidently due to trapped hydrogen being released by the thermal shock of up-quenching upon immersion in molten zinc. The full effect of up-quenching on the metallurgical and mechanical properties of high strength steel requires further investigation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dz94f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wv143</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Metal coating</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel -- Hydrogen embrittlement</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fasteners -- Testing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79408171t"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nickel-based 3D electrocatalyst layers for production of hydrogen by water electrolysis in an acidic medium</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bou-Saleh, Ziad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis discusses results on the development of three-dimensional (3D) Ni-based electrocatalytic layers for hydrogen production by water electrolysis in an acidic medium. This is of relevance to the development of polymer-electrolyte-membrane (PEM) hydrogen generators, which are promising hydrogen production systems suitable for both residential and industrial applications. It was demonstrated that patterning of a glassy carbon electrode substrate with a 3D polyaniline (PANI) matrix is a convenient way of increasing the electrocatalytically active surface area of electrodeposited Ni, and hence its apparent electrocatalytic activity. The optimized PANI/Ni electrocatalyst layer showed a significantly higher activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) then a commercially available Ni-plate surface (control surface). It was also demonstrated that it is possible to produce a Ni-based HER electrocatalyst layer by synthesizing Ni nanoparticles and supporting them on Vulcan carbon. This electrocatalyst also offered a significantly higher electrocatalytic activity in the HER then the control surface, but lower then the optimized PANI/Ni electrocatalyst. The electrocatalytic activity of the optimized PANI/Ni layer was also compared to the activity of a 3D catalyst produced by electro-coating a porous reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) substrate with Ni. This electrocatalyst showed the highest HER electrocatalytic activity among the investigated layers when tested under potentiodynamic polarization conditions. However, under the potentiostatic conditions, the optimized PANI/Ni layer showed the highest electrocatalytic activity. The mechanisms and kinetics of the HER on the produced electrocatalysts was also investigated, as well as the electrocatalyst layers' surface morphology and crystalline structure.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z173h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79408171t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Polyelectrolytes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electrocatalysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Conducting polymers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydrogen</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nickel catalysts</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sh270"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Time-slotted scheduling for agile all-photonics networks : performance and complexity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bilbeisi, Hana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Schedulers in optical switches are still electronic, the performance of these units has a significant impact on the performance of the network and could form a bottleneck in high speed networks, such as AAPN.

The design of several low-cost, high-performance BBSs, based on the ASE of two SOAs and EDF, are presented. Two different configuration types that were designed in this thesis are found to be effective BBSs. These sources are implemented in a TD-OCT system and therefore imaging performance is discussed as well. Secondly, two different WSSs based on mode-locked SFRLs with applications in SS-OCT are presented. From our experimental results with BBSs, we conclude that: (1) S/C-band output produced by the ASE emitted from two cascaded SOAs can be effectively extended with L-band output produced from the ASE of EDF; (2) An even broader output is achievable by: coupling the C-band and L-band outputs from a C-band SOA and EDF respectively and then amplifying the coupled output through an S-band SOA; (3) OCT imaging systems employing a light source with an S+C+L band output, with a center wavelength of approximately 1520 nm, can achieve high penetration depths in biological tissue. From our experimental results with SFRLs, we conclude that: (1) Our two SFRL configurations generate picosecond pulses with reasonably narrow linewidths: 0.2--0.5 nm, and a sweeping range of about 50 nm; (2) These SFRLs can function as laser swept sources by setting the driving frequency of the RF generator to a periodic ramping function.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881q70n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107272q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Optical coherence tomography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296x284n"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Natural and mixed convection in a horizontal cylindrical annulus with and without fins on inner cylinder</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Begum, Latifa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Determination of the heat transfer coefficients for natural and mixed convection in horizontal annuli is important for designing double pipe heat exchangers and for energy storage systems. In part one and two of this study, the 2D numerical solution of the laminar natural convection of water in six internally finned horizontal annuli has been obtained. The fins are attached to the external surface of the inner cylinder. Only the symmetrical half of the horizontal annulus with three equally spaced longitudinal divergent solid and porous fins are considered. The parameters of the problem are Rayleigh number, fin height, permeability and porosity of the porous fin, etc. The above parameters are suitably varied to ascertain their effects on fluid flow and heat transfer. The results show that traditional solid fins provide much higher heat transfer rates compared to the porous fins. Part three of this work deals with mixed convective heat transfer (laminar natural and forced convections) of water in a vented annulus. The forced flow conditions are imposed by providing an inlet at the top and an outlet at the bottom. For various parameters of the problem, the average and local Nusselt numbers along the inner cylinder are calculated for water for both aiding and opposing flows. The fourth part of this study deals with numerical modeling of natural convection of nanofluids in a horizontal cylindrical annulus. Simulations are carried out for Cu-water nanofluids. The results, in general, show that nanoparticles systematically decrease the natural convective heat transfer coefficient on the inner cylinder. Practical and useful correlations are provided for calculating average heat transfer rates from the inner cylinder in the form of average equivalent thermal conductivity and average Nusselt number for all of the four cases discussed above. These correlations are new and will be helpful in designing heat exchangers.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr172183n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x284n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Heat exchangers -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Energy storage</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heat -- Convection</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50h092f"><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A simple moving boundary technique and its application to supersonic inlet starting</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Baig, Saood Saeed</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, a simple moving boundary technique has been suggested, implemented and verified. The technique may be considered as a generalization of the well-known "ghost" cell approach for boundary condition implementation. According to the proposed idea, the moving body does not appear on the computational grid and is allowed to move over the grid. The impermeable wall boundary condition is enforced by assigning proper gasdynamic values at the grid nodes located inside the moving body close to its boundaries (ghost nodes). The reflection principle taking into account the velocity of the boundaries assigns values at the ghost nodes. The new method does not impose any particular restrictions on the geometry, deformation and law of motion of the moving body. The developed technique is rather general and can be used with virtually any finite-volume or finite-difference scheme, since the modifications of the schemes themselves are not required. In the present study the proposed technique has been incorporated into a one-dimensional non-adaptive Euler code and a two-dimensional locally adaptive unstructured Euler code. It is shown that the new approach is conservative with the order of approximation near the moving boundaries. To reduce the conservation error, it is beneficial to use the method in conjunction with local grid adaptation. The technique is verified for a number of one and two dimensional test cases with analytical solutions. It is applied to the problem of supersonic inlet starting via variable geometry approach. At first, a classical starting technique of changing exit area by a moving wedge is numerically simulated. Then, the feasibility of some novel ideas such as a collapsing frontal body and "tractor-rocket" are explored.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t295f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50h092f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aerodynamics, Supersonic -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rockets (Aeronautics) -- Ramjet engines -- Air intakes -- Design and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jet engines -- Air intakes -- Design and construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
