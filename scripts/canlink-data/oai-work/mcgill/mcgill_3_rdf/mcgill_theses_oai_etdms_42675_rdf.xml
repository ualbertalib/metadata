Genetic influence from central populations may prevent adaptation to ecological barriers by swamping peripheral populations with suboptimal genes. If this is the case, then isolation may enable local adaptation and further range expansion. Barriers such as rivers provide ideal tests of the influence of gene flow and may explain differences in range sizes. This study investigates northern range limitations and phylogeography of the Northern Two-lined ( Eurycea bislineata) and Northern Dusky (Desmognathus fuscus ) stream salamanders. Phylogeographic patterns of populations throughout Quebec and Labrador were investigated by sequencing portions of cytochrome b and 12S rRNA mitochondrial DNA genes. Interpopulation divergence was low for both species, however, unique genetic haplotypes and morphological variation on the north shore of the St. Lawrence indicate that the river is acting as a barrier to gene flow.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g9163.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mh25s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Phylogeography -- Newfoundland and Labrador -- Labrador</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phylogeography -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Northern dusky salamander -- Home range -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Northern dusky salamander -- Home range -- Newfoundland and Labrador -- Labrador</dc:subject><dc:subject>Northern two-lined salamander -- Home range -- Newfoundland and Labrador -- Labrador</dc:subject><dc:subject>Northern two-lined salamander -- Home range -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78th383"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Planning, localization, and mapping for a mobile robot in a camera network</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Meger, David Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Networks of cameras such as building security systems can be a source of localization information for a mobile robot assuming a map of camera locations as well as calibration information for each camera is available.

A 6DOF EKF is used for mapping and is validated experimentally over a 50 m hallway environment. Motion planning strategies are considered both in front of a single camera to maximize calibration accuracy and globally between cameras in order to facilitate accurate measurements. For global motion planning, an adaptive exploration strategy based on heuristic search allows compromise between distance traveled and final map uncertainty which provides the system a level of autonomy which could not be obtained with previous techniques.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w652c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78th383</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Television in security systems</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer vision</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electronic surveillance</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mobile robots</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6m311t664"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Thin film transistors from II-IV semiconductors on polymer substrates</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacNab, Finlay</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A chemical bath deposition technique has been used in the fabrication of thin film transistors (TFT), which have been deposited on a 200mum polymer substrate.

Obstetric complications, particularly fetal hypoxia, seem to be a risk factor for SCZ. The hippocampus is highly sensitive to ischemic episodes, and there is substantial evidence for hippocampal malfunction in SCZ. Thus, utilizing a rat model of global anoxia (15 min and 21 min) during Cesarean-section birth (C-section), hippocampal proliferation was examined in the dentate gyrus and CAI region at postnatal day 21 and day 60. Incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used as a marker of cell proliferation. Rats were sacrificed 2 hours after BrdU injection to quantify cell proliferation, or 4 weeks after BrdU injection to quantify survival of newly proliferating cells and to identify if these cells express a neuronal phenotype. Only rats that had undergone 15 minutes of hypoxia during C-section birth compared to C-sectioned controls, showed a significant increase in cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus on postnatal day 21. Thus perinatal hypoxia can have lasting effects on the hippocampus that depend on the duration of the hypoxic insult.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g917c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784q66t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593v0654"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Classical and quantum strategies for bit commitment schemes in the two-prover model</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Simard, Jean-Raymond</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We show that the long-standing assumption of "no-communication" between the provers of the two-prover model is not sufficiently precise to guarantee the security of a bit commitment scheme against malicious adversaries.

Instead we propose a stronger notion of separation between the two provers which takes into account correlated computations. To emphasize the risk that entanglement still represents for the security of a commitment scheme despite the stronger notion of separation, we present two variations of the sBGKW scheme that can be cheated by quantum provers with probability (almost) one. A complete proof of security against quantum adversaries is then given for the sBGKW scheme. By reduction we also obtain the security of the original BGKW scheme against quantum provers.

We studied brain grey matter (GM) density of patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and vulvar vestibulitis (VVS), chronic pain syndromes thought to involve central changes in pain modulatory systems. Specifically, we hypothesized that in comparison to matched controls, patients will have multiple regions of altered GM density and GM volume. We analyzed the T1-weighted anatomical brain images of patients and healthy, matched controls. FM and VVS patients demonstrated significant differences in the GM density of several pain- and disease-related cortical and subcortical structures.

The purpose of this review is to motivate the need for good theory to understand and predict molecular electronics behaviour. At present the most promising theoretical formalism for dealing with this problem is a combination of density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF-DFT). This formalism is especially attractive because it is an ab-initio technique, meaning that it is completely from first principles and does not require any empirical parameters. An implementation of this formalism has been developed by the research group of Hong Guo and is presented and explained here. A few other implementations which are similar but differ in some ways are also discussed briefly to highlight their various advantages and disadvantages. One of the difficulties of ab-initio calculations is that they can be extremely costly in terms of the computing time and memory that they require. For this reason, in addition to using appropriate approximations, sophisticated numerical analysis tech niques need to be used. One of the bottlenecks in the NEGF-DFT method is solving the Poisson equation on a large real space grid. For studying systems incorporating a gate voltage it is required to be able to solve this problem with nonperiodic boundary conditions. In order to do this a technique called multigrid is used. This thesis examines the multigrid technique and develops an efficient implementation for the purpose of use in the NEGF-DFT formalism. For large systems, where it is necessary to use especially large real space grids, it is desirable to run simulations on parallel computing clusters to handle the memory requirements and make the code run faster. For this reason a parallel implementation of multigrid is developed and tested for performance. The multigrid tool is incorporated into the NEGF-DFT formalism and tested to ensure that it is properly implemented. A few calculations are made on a benzenedithiol system with gold leads to show the effect of an applied gate voltage.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x5459.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90f044m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Density functionals</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multigrid methods (Numerical analysis)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Molecular electronics -- Mathematical models</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722hf11k"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Impaired response of protein synthesis and turnover to insulin in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus : by Sandra M. Pereira</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pereira, Sandra M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although insulin resistance of glucose and fat metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is firmly established, that of protein remains controversial for methodological reasons. A hyperinsulinemic (40MU/m2·min) euglycemic (5.5 mmol/L) isoaminoacidemic (postabsorptive concentrations) clamp was combined with [3-3H]glucose and [1-13C]leucine kinetics to concurrently assess protein and glucose metabolism in 10 hyperglycemic men with T2DM and 11 men without (all BMI=29+/-kg/m2), matched also for age, body composition, and waist circumference. In response to hyperinsulinemia, protein turnover and synthesis were stimulated in controls, but not in T2DM. Both insulin-stimulated total and non-oxidative glucose disposal were diminished in T2DM vs. controls. There was a robust positive correlation between the change in synthesis and glucose disposal. Hence, there is an additive effect of T2DM, beyond that of having excess fat, on insulin resistance of whole body protein turnover and synthesis. Furthermore, protein sensitivity to insulin parallels that of glucose, establishing this as an important concern in T2DM management.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859k82j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hf11k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Insulin resistance</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proteins -- Synthesis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Non-insulin-dependent diabetes -- Chemotherapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r748m"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effects of whiplash-associated disorders on the kinematic and the electromyographic responses of individuals submitted to anterior surface translations in the sitting position</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Patenaude, Isabelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this Master's project was to characterize the postural control patterns of individuals with chronic whiplash-associated disorders and to compare these patterns with those of healthy individuals. The postural reactions in response to low-intensity translations of the sitting position were assessed by way of kinematic and electromyographic analyses. We found that whiplash individuals display an earlier onset of their head displacement and a pattern of trunk displacement characterized by greater flexion at the upper levels of the spine, compared to the lower levels. Moreover, whiplash individuals present a tendency for a late recruitment of their neck flexors and for a greater use of a pattern of neck extensor muscle inhibition. These results suggest that individuals with whiplash-associated disorders may compensate their altered neck functional ability by modifying their relative movements along the spine and by adopting altered motor strategies to compensate for their painful muscles.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50tw71r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r748m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Whiplash injuries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Posture disorders</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053m56n"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Novel nucleoside analogs with supramolecular and biological applications</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Palmer, Alison Lesley</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nanostructures, molecular assemblies at the nanometer scale, are currently influencing diagnostics, imaging, and therapeutics. Many nanostructures are built using supramolecular chemistry principles, where hydrogen bonding between simple building blocks causes the formation of specific morphologies. Here we hypothesize that a six stranded DNA nanotube can be generated by tethering triaminopyrimidine and cyanuric acid building blocks as bases on the natural DNA backbone. We also hypothesize that cyanuric acid, a secondary oxidation product of guanine, will form complex architectures with adenine, its natural hydrogen bond complement. To test these hypotheses, we used multi-step synthetic strategies to generate DNA strands of cyanuric acid and triaminopyrimidine. The synthesis of the cyanuric acid DNA strand is complete and preliminary self-assembly studies with adenine DNA strands have been performed. The synthesis of the triaminopyrimidine DNA strand is ongoing. This thesis provides the groundwork for incorporating supramolecular building blocks into DNA to generate complex DNA architectures.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sf862.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053m56n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nanostructures</dc:subject><dc:subject>Supramolecular chemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nucleosides -- Derivatives</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82kc632"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of the human organellar sodiumproton exchanger isoforms NHE8 and NHE9</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jones, Ewen St. Clair</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sodium/proton exchangers (NHEs) are secondary active transporters that catalyze the electroneutral exchange of Na+ and H+ down their respective concentration gradients using the inward electrochemical Na+ gradient established by the plasma membrane Na+ /K+-ATPase. NHEs play a fundamental role in maintaining the intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis and cell volume which are required for stable protein activity, and ultimately cell survival. To date, nine NHE isoforms (NHE 1-9) have been identified, and are expressed in a tissue/cell specific manner, which indicates a degree of specialization in their respective cellular functions. NHE1 through 5 are plasmalemmal-type exchangers, whereas NHE6 and 7 accumulate predominantly in organellar compartments. Substantially less information is known about NHE8 and NHE9. Initial reports have shown that both NHE8 and NHE9 mRNA are ubiquitously expressed, and that NHE8 protein can be detected in the proximal tubules of kidney nephrons (Goyal et al., 2003; de Silva et al., 2003). To gain further insight into the subcellular distribution and function of these latter isoforms, full length cDNAs of NHE8 and NHE9 were cloned, epitope tagged and transfected into cultured cell lines. Examination of their subcellular localization by confocal microscopy showed that NHE8 and NHE9 are targeted to lysosomes and endosomes respectively. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that NHE9 can form homodimeric complexes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies and confocal microscopy also indicated that NHE9 may form heterocomplexes with NHE8. In order to further characterize NHE9 under native conditions, a native polyclonal antibody was raised against a distinct region of its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35td40s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82kc632</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zg280"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Factors affecting the impact of invasive mussels on native freshwater mussels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Jokela, Anneli</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Biological invasions are among the leading causes of species diversity loss; however, the impacts of invasion are context-dependent and can vary with the local environment. The mechanisms governing variation in impact and their relationship to specific abiotic and biotic factors remain largely unexplored. Recent local declines in native unionid mussels have been attributed to the invasion of North American lakes and rivers by the Eurasian zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha), as a result of intense fouling of unionid shells by zebra mussels. My research investigated the role of abiotic and biotic factors in mediating the impact of zebra mussels on native mussels. I examined the impact of zebra mussels on unionids in a habitat thought to be suboptimal for zebra mussels and compared this to the impact observed in other invaded habitats. A predictive model relating fouling intensity to local environmental variables (calcium concentration, sediment particle size) was developed, and a predator-exclusion experiment was conducted to investigate the role of predation in mediating fouling intensity. Overall, I found that two abiotic factors of the local environment were significant predictors of fouling intensity and that relationships used to predict the impact of zebra mussels could be extended to a broader range of habitats.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547w66s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zg280</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zebra mussel -- Saint Lawrence River</dc:subject><dc:subject>Unionidae -- Effect of exotic animals on -- Saint Lawrence River</dc:subject><dc:subject>Unionidae -- Effect of exotic animals on -- Richelieu River (N.Y. and Vt.-Québec)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zebra mussel -- Richelieu River (N.Y. and Vt.-Québec)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qh436"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Quantum accuracy threshold for distance-5 codes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khalid, Omar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A quantum computer can only solve classically intractable problems like factoring large integers if it can perform quantum computations scalably. The minimum accuracy required among the components of a quantum computer to perform scalable computation is called the quantum accuracy threshold, epsilon 0. We explore the accuracy threshold for Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes of distance 5. Our accuracy thresholds are based on the threshold theorem proven by Aliferis et al. [3]. Their threshold theorem is applicable to concatenated codes and can be used to derive a rigorous lower bound on the threshold. In this thesis we consider degenerate codes with parameters [[17,1,5]] and [[19,1,5]], and a non-degenerate [[21,1,5]] code. For each code we design a set of logical operations sufficient to perform universal computation. We estimate the thresholds using simulation tools for an independent stochastic error model. Our simulations incorporate randomized sampling techniques to estimate the number of ways our largest logical operation can fail. A lower bound of epsilon0 ≥ 3.624 x 10-5 is derived for the [[17,1,5]] code.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89db67k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qh436</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj2366551"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Computational simulations of fiber reinforced hyperelastic materials</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kaden, Jason</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Incompressible hyperelastic materials are used extensively in construction and manufacturing and are often reinforced with fibers aligned in a single direction.

The formulae were then applied to the reinforcement of a rubber automobile bushing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dh67s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj2366551</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj3860c116"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A quantitative fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of receptor-protein interactions on vesicles</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Gousseva, Veronika</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a living cell, signals are usually transmitted from outside to the intracellular machinery through receptors on the cell membrane. Once bound to their ligand (e.g. a hormone or another protein), receptors become activated and trigger chemical reactions inside the cell. To stop the response, receptors are often removed from the cell membrane (internalization). A protein called arrestin binds to the receptor and targets it to a vesicle, which detaches from the membrane and fuses with other vesicles to form an endosome, a sphere-like structure containing many receptors. After internalization, arrestin must dissociate from the receptor before the latter returns to the membrane or is degraded. By using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching data and a reaction-diffusion model, we estimate the in vivo affinity of arrestin for bradykinin type 2 receptor. We use the Hough transform to automate fluorescence quantification and a Bayesian approach to fit the model to the data.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vg72t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j3860c116</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4f16c672b"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A search for the rare decay of a charged B meson into a charged K meson, a neutrino and an anti-neutrino</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Harnois-Déraps, Joachim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The document describes a search for the rare decay B¯ → K¯vv̄ in a data set of about 230 millions of BB̄ pairs recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II B Factory, via the process e⁺e⁻ → ϒ(4S) → BB̄. The method used selects events in which the B+ meson is fully reconstructed, and looks for a K¯ in the rest of the event. This is accomplished by applying kinematical and topological restrictions that select B¯ → K¯vv̄ events with the largest possible efficiency, while rejecting a maximum amount of background events. The number of background events is estimated from data and from simulated events, while the value of the selection efficiency relies solely on the simulation of B¯ → K¯vv̄ decays in the BABAR detector. These two numbers are required in order to set an upper limit on the branching ratio. We analyze a subset of the data sample and provide an interpretation of the result.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53k230r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c672b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>B mesons -- Decay</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kaons</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antineutrinos</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neutrinos</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bg939"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Dopamine and monetary reward : two positron emission tomography studies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hakyemez, Hélène</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Striatal dopamine is well known to be involved in reward.

In a first time we scan 10 healthy male subjects 3 times in different conditions: unpredictable monetary reward, novel visual and audio stimuli, and sensorimotor control. In a second time, we compared different amounts of work load to get monetary reward. Unpredictable passive reward as well as novelty failed to release significantly DA in comparison to the sensorimotor control task. Conditions of increasing effort to obtain the reward failed to release DA in comparison to the condition of passive receipt of reward. Limitations of the PET technique, as well as the paradigm's ones are presented.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hh536.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bg939</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tt42g"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Doubly censored prevalent cohort survival data</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Guo, Hui, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>When survival data are collected as part of a prevalent cohort study, the recruited cases have already experienced their initiating event.

We derive the likelihood function and propose two methods to estimate the survival function incorporating the possible uncertainty. We verify the methods by the means of simulation.

Adiponectin is an early marker of DM risk. Dietary fat quality has been proposed to be involved in the development of insulin resistance. Plasma fatty acids are a marker of recent dietary exposure. The objectives of this research were to determine whether differences in adiponectin exist in daughters of GDM pregnancies, and to describe how dietary fatty acids impact adiponectin concentrations. Fasting adiponectin and plasma fatty acids were examined for 180 adolescent daughters born to mothers with and without GDM. No differences were observed in adiponectin between study groups, however; a significant difference was detected upon comparison of daughters from mothers who were presently diabetic with those from healthy mothers. The association between fatty acids and adiponectin varied by visceral adiposity. Adiponectin was inversely associated with monounsaturated and omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in the high waist group. Further knowledge on the interactions between fatty acids, desaturase activity and adiponectin would be helpful in planning early interventions for individuals at risk for diabetes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x340s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999b925</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Non-insulin-dependent diabetes -- Risk factors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fatty acids</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diabetes in pregnancy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fat cells</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apn89db68v"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Automated analysis of multi-site MRI data for the NIHPD</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fu, Luke</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a large multi-center study where many groups collaborate to produce data, the conditions under which the data are collected can vary significantly. In the case of the NIH funded MRI study of normal brain development (NIHPD), 6 centers across the US collect MRI scans of the developing child brain. In all, four different models of scanners from 2 manufacturers are used. The subject of this thesis is to quantify differences in acquired data that are due to scanner differences and thus enable improved biological study. The aim of this study is to analyze the scanner-induced differences across sites using a specialized phantom recommended by the American College of Radiology (ACR). Together with the 7 tests listed by the ACR MRI accreditation manual, phantom data from each site can be analyzed for parameters that are characteristic of image quality. The measurements are done automatically using programs written at the MNI, that use MINC tools and the MNI autoreg package to compute the necessary parameters. The results demonstrate that, in general, all data obtained complied with the 7 tests of the ACR MRI manual. Statistically significant variations over time and between sites were found in the data. However, the magnitude of the variations is of the order of 1%-2% indicating stable data acquisitions and comparability of data between sites.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z2316.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89db68v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623h79m"><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Assessing a Loggerhead shrike captive-release program using reproductive success and telemetry</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fraser, Sarah Jane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The eastern race of the Loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus ssp. migrans) is a grassland bird federally listed as endangered. There are approximately 30 pairs remaining in the Canadian wild today. Captive breeding and release programs have been developed in Canada to help alleviate the decline. However, little is known about the fate of the released birds and the factors influencing their reproductive success. To help in the understanding of the movement, behaviour and survival of the shrikes post-release, we tested whether radio telemetry was an effective technique to follow these birds. Despite limited behavioural effects in captivity, a tail-mount was not suitable for released Loggerhead shrikes due to unreliable retention times. The second portion of this study addressed the factors influencing reproductive success in captivity, including breeding behaviour and individual characteristics. Distance between individual pairs in their cages, female nesting activity and male origin were the best predictors of success. Recommendations for managers are made.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n2741.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623h79m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Loggerhead shrike -- Radio tracking -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Loggerhead shrike -- Reintroduction -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Captive wild birds -- Breeding -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Loggerhead shrike -- Québec (Province) -- Reproduction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930c2501"><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Experimental and theoretical investigation of the coherent x-ray propagation and diffraction</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Feng, Zhenxing, 1982-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Coherent X-ray diffraction and X-ray Intensity Fluctuation Spectroscopy (XIFS) are ideal methods and techniques to perform measurements on the dynamics of fluctuations in condensed matter materials.

Using the zone plate, experiments were carried out to measure the properties of the focused beam. We applied a formalism to calculate the effect of optics on coherence. We tested our results by doing measurement at Advanced Photon Source. We measured the focal properties of the zone plate, speckle sizes and contrast, obtained by using coherent X-ray diffraction from an disordered Fe3Al crystals.

Nevertheless, some metabolic by-products excreted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae tend to reduce the ethanol yield. Of such, glycerol is the major one, accounting for about 5-10% relative to the amount of ethanol produced. Glycerol plays an important role in maintaining the redox balance within the cells by oxidizing the cytosolic NADH under anaerobic conditions. It is also believed that it acts as an osmoprotectant and would be favourably produced in high osmotic pressure conditions. In order to mitigate the production of glycerol, various aeration strategies were investigated in a single-stage continuous fermentation system. Oxygen dissolved in the fermentation medium put the yeast in aerobiosis, acted as an oxidizing agent and hence minimised the specific glycerol production by 36% as compared to a completely anaerobic fermentation. This has hardly been reproduced in a more industrially relevant system using a multi-stage continuous fermentation process. Indeed, oscillations in the concentrations of the various metabolites over time made difficult the assessment of significant changes. Nevertheless, these findings open the door to further investigations in order to understand the effect of oxygen in continuous fermentations using very high gravity feeds, such as in the fuel ethanol industry.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gs42n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tr15d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Alcohol as fuel</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Biotechnology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
