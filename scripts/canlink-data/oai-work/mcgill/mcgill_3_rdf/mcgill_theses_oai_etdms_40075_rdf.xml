In the present investigation, chronic stroke patients were chosen at least one year after stroke and received either Mirror Therapy (Altschuler et al., 1999) or Constraint-Induced (CI) Movement Therapy (Taub et al., 1993). Motor improvements were examined in parallel with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electromyography (EMG). TMS was combined with EMG to record recruitment curves and silent periods induced by direct stimulation of the motor cortex before and after treatment. The data revealed that motor ability gained with CI Therapy was particularly impressive, and that neurophysiological patterns of recovery may differ with respect to pathology. Data obtained in two patients with capsular lesions acquired in adulthood suggest the involvement of ipsilateral pathways in recovery mechanisms. By contrast, data from a patient with perinatal lesions in the thalamus and the red nucleus area suggest involvement of contralateral pathways in recovery mechanisms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leonard, Gabriel</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b7879.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hh394</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kj15w"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mild cognitive impairment and the neuroanatomical changes associated with progression to dementia of the Alzheimer's type</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Churchill, Eric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Using longitudinal MRI volumetry we examined the relationship between the degree of cerebral atrophy and cognitive function in Mild Cognitively Impaired (MCI) subjects during the progression to Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT).

At follow-up, 10 of the MCI subjects had progressed to dementia (Progressors) while 10 had remained stable (Non-Progressors). We found that the Progressors had a significant increase in medial temporal atrophy between Time 1 and Time 2, while the Non-Progressors remained stable.

Lupus anticoagulants (LA), a subset of aPL, exhibit anticoagulant properties in vitro, but are strikingly procoagulant in vivo. We have previously demonstrated that some aPL bind specifically to apoptotic, but not viable, thymocytes in the presence of beta2-glycoprotein 1. Here, we demonstrate that prothrombin binds selectively to the surface of apoptotic Jurkat cells, and supports the binding of LA-positive murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and patient-derived IgG to apoptotic cells. Despite similar LA activity and reactivity with apoptotic cells, the mAb differed in affinity and specificity. One mAb was highly reactive with prothrombin alone, while the other required anionic phospholipid for elevated binding. These results demonstrate that aPL recognize multiple epitopes on apoptotic cells, suggesting that apoptotic antigens contribute to the induction and/or perpetuation of aPL.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rauch, Joyce</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193b73g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tb23q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A44558f99b"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Distributed simulation of personal communication service networks</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cismasu, Codrut Octavian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Parallel and distributed simulation is recognized as a viable method for the modeling of complex dynamic systems. The main benefits of using a parallel versus a sequential technique in solving these problems are decreasing execution time and distributing the memory used in the simulation over a number of processors. Parallel simulation techniques have successfully been applied to the modeling of cellular communication services. They focus on defining efficient models for simulation, on the study of protocols or on the performance analysis of resource allocation algorithms. In this thesis, we continue the research in this domain by defining a model focusing on simulation accuracy. We will also test the limits on the size of the application model that can be simulated. Two channel allocation techniques are implemented. The first is based on fixed channel allocation and the second on a technique known as channel segregation. The latter technique requires that interference data be computed. For this purpose, we describe a brute force interference calculation algorithm.

As a comparison other 'metal control reagents', ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and polyphosphate were also tested. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to probe the silica sol-mineral interaction mechanism. Micro flotation was performed on single mineral samples over a pH range 7 to 11. It was found that silica sol depressed all Cu minerals, Cu and Pb activated pyrite and Pb activated sphalerite but did not depress Cu activated sphalerite. XPS analysis revealed that silica sol adsorbed on all Cu minerals and Cu and Pb activated pyrite. Silica sol partially removed Pb from Pb activated sphalerite and had no apparent interaction with Cu activated sphalerite. The depressant action, therefore, appeared to be primarily adsorption of silica sol to form hydrophilic sites. In the batch tests, generally, silica sol, polyphosphate and EDTA increased the rate of flotation in the Cu stage and in the Zn stage. This is attributed to removal of hydrophilic metal hydroxy species, i.e., surface 'cleaning'. Polyphosphate, and to a lesser extent EDTA, improved selectivity in the Zn stage for Les Mines Selbaie and Mine Louvicourt and arguably for Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting. This selectivity was not identified in the trials at Brunswick Mine directly on Zn stage flotation feed. The varying effect of polyphosphate on selectivity is attributed to the level of 'excess Cu' used in Zn activation: the higher the excess, the greater the effect of polyphosphate. In conclusion, silica sol has some metal ion control capability but seems less attractive in this role than say polyphosphate.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, J.

Specifically, a wireless revolution is establishing renewed standards and design requirements, such as higher operation frequencies and higher levels of integration. The improved performance of traditional technologies, such as CMOS, which used to be geared towards digital circuits running at lower frequencies, makes them now suitable for Radio-Frequency applications. The challenge is not only to design RF systems, but also to establish design methodologies for their building-blocks. This thesis is concerned with one of those building blocks, namely the low noise amplifier, when implemented using modern submicron CMOS technologies. The design of this circuit, as well as that of many of the RF building blocks, requires accurate integrated inductor modeling tools. The challenge of modeling inductors implemented in silicon technologies lies in the complex electro-magnetic behavior of these devices. A powerful modeling engine, McGill Inductor Modeler (MIND), was implemented for this purpose, and proven to be accurate and precise. The contribution of this work is twofold: First, proving that performant high-frequency CMOS RF LNA's could be achieved. Second, creating a powerful and versatile inductor modeling tool.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>El-Gamal, Mourad</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cs23p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602263t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s423r"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Modifying LPC parameter dynamics to improve speech coder efficiency</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pereira, Wesley</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Reducing the transmission bandwidth and achieving higher speech quality are primary concerns in developing new speech coding algorithms. The goal of this thesis is to improve the perceptual speech quality of algorithms that employ linear predictive coding (LPC). Most LPC-based speech coders extract parameters representing an all-pole filter. This LPC analysis is performed on each block or frame of speech. To smooth out the evolution of the LPC tracks, each block is divided into subframes for which the LPC parameters are interpolated. This improves the perceptual quality without additional transmission bit rate. A method of modifying the interpolation endpoints to improve the spectral match over all the subframes is introduced. The spectral distortion and weighted Euclidean LSF (Line Spectral Frequencies) distance are used as objective measures of the performance of this warping method. The algorithm has been integrated in a floating point C-version of the Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR) speech coder and these results are presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z718v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s423r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v4776"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ultrasonic monitoring of die-casting process using clad buffer rod sensor</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Moisan, Jean-Francois</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In-line monitoring of die-casting of aluminum (A356, A357, 86S), magnesium (AZ91) and a metal matrix composite (Gra-NiRTM 6S:3G) will be monitored using the reflection coefficient obtained by using an ultrasonic technique, the pulse/echo.

As a qualitative descriptive study, this research involved 24 secondary school administrators. Data collection techniques included postal surveys to gather initial descriptive data, followed by telephone interviews that allowed for more in-depth discussion of issues faced by the principals and their administrative team. The findings provide strong evidence of the complexity of the nature of secondary school principals, work and the importance of working collaboratively with their administrative colleagues.

To avoid a loss of meaning, rampant instrumentality, and ultimately a loss of freedom, Taylor suggests that we must arrive at a new understanding of the self. To this end Taylor positions himself between contemporary liberals and communitarians, arriving at what he deems holistic individualism or an "ethic of authenticity". He holds that, in order for this notion of authenticity to be realized, we must be in contact with the constitutive goods which underpin western society. After prolonged consideration Taylor arrives at the conclusion that the only publicly available constitutive good in the modern age is religion. Although he is at times hesitant to admit it, Taylor contends that religion is an invaluable source for the self and the only good able to meet the challenges of modernity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boutin, Maurice</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qn84f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bd51c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Taylor, Charles, 1931- Sources of the self</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self (Philosophy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion -- Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20sv549"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Anxiety and social stress related to adolescent gambling behavior</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ste-Marie, Chantal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examined the relationship between anxiety, social stress, and gambling behavior among 1,044 high school students from grades 7 to 11.

It encompasses foundational Buddhist teachings, sacred Buddhist medicine, and the esoteric healing pathways found in tantra and yoga, which together constitute a detailed and technical guide to healing. The mind is central to all aspects of Tibetan Buddhism. The ability to focus the mind through meditation during life enables the practitioner to prepare for death by experiencing the subtle aspects of the body and mind through the chakras. Both Tibetan spiritual teachers and doctors practise healing and help practitioners learn to focus their minds in preparation for death.

Since this time, no historian has examined the role that the timing of the planned Jewish round-up played in the degree of success of the rescue. Would a National Socialist round-up of the Danish Jews have been successful if it occurred in 1941 for example? As long as the Danish government was in power, no anti-Jewish measures were implemented in Denmark. Within a month of the Danish government's resignation, National Socialist plans to eliminate Danish Jewry were being drafted. This thesis examines the major events in Denmark that led to the resignation of the Danish government in August 1943, and the failed plan to round-up and deport the Danish Jews. The most important conclusion of this thesis is that to a significant degree, the Danish people were successful in their rescue of Danish Jews because of the timing of the anti-Jewish measures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hoffmann, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322g140.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80hx26v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Denmark -- History -- 1900-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945)</dc:subject><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- Jews -- Rescue -- Denmark</dc:subject><dc:subject>Righteous Gentiles in the Holocaust -- Denmark</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajw827d46r"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Genetic states : collective identity and genetic nationalism in Iceland and Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lloyd, Stephanie, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Population genetics studies, coupling genealogical and genetic information, are being launched in many places around the world.

In this thesis I will be examining how new genetic information has been drawn into claims of national identity and how genetic technologies have been used to create imagined genetically homogenous communities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Young, Allan</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c935j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827d46r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human population genetics -- Iceland</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Iceland</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human population genetics -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2j62s657d"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation of two types of question prompts in a language proficiency interview test and their effects on elicited discourse</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Colby, Christian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present research investigates the use of different question prompts and the discourse they generate in the SLE:OI, an ACTFL-variant second language oral proficiency interview test. One hundred and fifty-two question prompts used to elicit the test task of 'supporting an opinion,' were transcribed from 27 SLE:OI tests administered between July and November, 2000. From this, 30 categories of question prompts were identified by 6 SLE:OI raters acting as judges. Independently, the researcher and the judges determined task difficulty/complexity to be the predominant feature differentiating the categories. Using the 30 categories as a basis, the Question Prompt Complexity Questionnaire was produced and administered to the 6 judges. Analysis of the questionnaire data indicated a clear consensus for 3 categories into 'easy' and 'difficult' groups. Subsequently, candidate responses to 11 question prompts from the easy group, and 10 from the difficult group were transcribed, and discourse analyses were carried out to ascertain response levels of L2 fluency (by type-token ratio; frequency of silent and filled pauses, repetitions, and self-repairs), accuracy (by verb morphology and lexical use), and complexity (by clause subordination). The results demonstrated that those candidates tested with 'easy' and 'difficult' question prompts showed strong, significant differences in two aspects of their response fluency, but no significant differences in the accuracy or complexity of their responses. Based on these findings, several recommendations and implications for rater training were cited.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turner, Carolyn</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1393822.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s657d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Examinations, questions, etc</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap5547t297"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pomme, suivi de, Le double divinisant chez Gary</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cinq-Mars, Chloe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The first part of this Master's thesis is a story presented as an inner monologue where three periods of the narrator's life (the winter when she was nine years old, a recent trip to Ireland and her return to Montreal) interlace as three parallel miscarried lives. At times through entire episodes, at times through the echo of sentences once spoken or heard, Pamela's past lives contaminate the story of her forced return to Montreal to attend her father's funeral. They intermingle in a duplicate narrative, a fabled dialogue between times. In the second part, we intend to analyse the theme of the double in two of Romain Gary's novels: Au-dela de cette limite votre ticket n'est plus valable and Gros-Calin. The study demonstrates that the subject uses doubling to engender his self so that he can avoid the determinism that condemns him to a non-existence. Gary's hero refuses any god other than the one within himself: an infinite and immortal double from whom he has become seperated against his will at birth. He reinstates his unlimited potential as a creator by returning to a time before this world, a time not determined by external forces. He then undertakes to give life to his divine double by projecting him on others. The hero hopes that he will thus be endlessly reborn. The embodied ideal double, however, soon turns into the original which the hero imitates, becoming a double himself.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Larose, Jean</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Rivard, Yvon</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67js99p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547t297</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Doubles in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gary, Romain -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tw94s"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Poor, unskilled and unemployed : perceptions of the English underclass, 1889-1914</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brydon, Thomas Robert Craig</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>From the families of dockside London to the cautious cabinets of the Edwardian 'new liberals,' the search was on, after 1889, for a class of men Charles Booth characterized as so low in moral character as to require elimination from society-at-large. Responding as best they could, the poorest third of England's workers attempted desperately, yet usually failed, to avoid the stigma of the 'loafer' as they weathered economic downturn, increased policing, the fallout of deskilling, and the hatred and hysteria of a society, particularly in the wake of the Boer War, that refused them the status even of 'men'. In laws and literature, England's reforming and governing classes found their answers in Idealism, a philosophical movement taking progressive, moderate and labour leaders under its fold, and encouraging an understanding of poverty, and responses to it, on the basis of character alone. Piecemeal programmes and partial remedies for a host of principally urban, predominantly working-class social problems were the result, and they point---in a period of ostensibly 'progressive' housing and unemployment reform---to a disturbing, quasi-authoritarian policy demanding nothing less than social apartheid.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lewis, Brian</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b291d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tw94s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social conflict -- Great Britain -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poor -- Great Britain -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social conflict -- Great Britain -- History -- 19th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poor -- Great Britain -- History -- 19th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p096899z"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Semiotique du plaisir dans les Fleurs du mal</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cabello-Chauveau, Inti Jean-Christophe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is dedicated to a in depth study of the notion of pleasure such as it appears in Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal. Focusing upon a very restraint core of poems, the analysis unfurls according to the methodic tools provided by Michael Riffaterre, literary theorician and critic, in his Semiotics of poetry. Basing myself on a shrewd selection of texts, number of which were almost completely left out by baudelairean studies, my goal was to highlight the semiotical span owned by the different illustrations of pleasure in our poet's work. Weaving significant threads, first between signs and then between the text and its intertextuality, I achieved a detailed and global canvas of pleasure's descriptive system as it underlies Les Fleurs du Mal. The analysis defines pleasure's expression as a dichotomic construction. First opposing itself to reality, then to illusion and then to danger and others, it eventually builds itself against the notion of grief through bipolarization, caught into an insolvable cycle overhung by its evanescence. Interpretation allows us to draw interesting perspectives concerning the poet's epistemological choices.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lane-Mercier, Gillian</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hr50q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096899z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Baudelaire, Charles, 1821-1867.

Among many changes, it appears that there is a shift from a "family dominated" society to a more "individualistic" society where the concept of family loses its importance, family ties weakens, and elders lose their essential roles within the family because the continuity between generations in respect to family traditions and values is stopped. Ethnic-elders have different expectations from their family members based on their ethnic-identity, family values, and the extent of their acculturation. These value differences might also influence the accessibility and provision of psycho-social services. Therefore, the purpose of the present cross-cultural study was to understand and compare different ethnic-elders' expectations from their family members and from psychosocial service providers based on their concept of perception of family values. An instrument was designed for this study implementing a 4 point-scale and vignettes. Data were collected from seniors from South Asian (Sri-Lanka), Korean, Hungarian and Jewish communities and from a group of Social Worker (N = 94). Significant differences were found between group values: overall the Social Worker group was the most individualistic/non-traditional with the Jewish group next; the South Asians and Koreans were the most family-oriented/traditional; and these attitudes were the most different from those of the Social Workers. These particularities have important implications for the delivery of social services.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duder, Sydney</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Lithwick, Maxine</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gq12h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79408000n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Older immigrants -- Canada -- Family relationships -- Cross-cultural studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Family -- Cross-cultural studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8w32r738t"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The harmful effects of discrimination : a meta-analysis of research</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fent, Randa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is designed to examine the effects of discrimination on its target. It aims to investigate the psychological, physical, perceptual and behavioral responses that individuals exhibit when faced with racist, sexist and heterosexist as well as other types of discriminatory acts. Through meta-analytic procedures, findings from existing studies investigating the impact of discrimination on the target were gathered and their average effect sizes calculated. A total of 50 empirical studies were identified, from which 84 effect sizes were derived. Using homogeneity analysis techniques, the studies' effect sizes were compared and analyzed. The results show significant heterogeneity in the overall mean effect size (0.38) of discrimination. Subsequent moderator variable investigations indicated that among discrimination acts, sexism had the highest mean effect size (0.64), while among the responses to discrimination, the perceptual factor showed the highest mean effect size (0.65). Additional moderator variables' investigations resulted in significant differences between Canadian and American settings in terms of discrimination acts and responses.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duder, Sydney</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vj568.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r738t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sexism -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Discrimination -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h139v"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The relationship between social support and quality of life of adults with intellectual handicaps</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mainberger, Eliaze</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to explore the potential link between quality of life and social support networks, among clients with mild to borderline intellectual handicaps.

This thesis explores the issue of maintenance of these coalitions by examining the factors that have facilitated or inhibited the maintenance of the Hemispheric Social Alliance as an example. This thesis is based on a qualitative case study; data includes some content analysis but mostly consists of direct interviews. The main finding is that factors such as resources, internal relationships, external conditions and management all affect the maintenance of an international social movement coalition. The thesis argues for increased links between social work and social movement coalitions, and offers insights for social work policy, research and practice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wehbi, Samantha</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pv474.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397998g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social movements -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coalitions -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hemispheric Social Alliance</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580p315"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Financing the intangible : software as collateral in the North-American context</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hatjikiriakos, Kyriakoula</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the era of information technology, intellectual property assets are gaining important value and are becoming increasingly attractive in the sphere of commercial transactions. The case of software as collateral in the context of a financing transaction brings to the surface the various issues which a lender must face when engaging in an intellectual property-based secured transaction. In the execution of such a transaction, the North-American intellectual property and secured financing legal regimes, currently in place, fail to procure the clear, certain and predictable results desired by lenders. Whether at the initial stage of creation of a security interest on the software or in the final steps of its enforcement, these regimes do not reflect the commercial realities and necessities of the software industry, thereby increasing both challenges and risks for the lender. The problems which the lender must face in the process of a software financing transaction will be examined through three Chapters. The first Chapter will focus on the creation and scope of a security interest on software, the second will examine its perfection and the third will address priority disputes involving competing interests in the software, as well as the enforcement of a security interest on software, both in the context of the debtor's default and in the event of its bankruptcy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Swan, John</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g6822.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580p315</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economics, Finance</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
