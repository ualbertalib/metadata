Strong  leadership is demanded to overcome these challenging times. While management  literature offers the transactional-transformational leadership model, the higher  education literature argues that applying a managerial leadership model to the  academic context ignores the principles of academe. This study examines the  relevance of such a model within the academic context. More specifically, the study  focuses on transactional-transformational leadership styles and the extent to which  chairs' self and faculty members' perceptions of chairs' leadership converge. The  study also examines the perceptions of the influence of leadership style on  departmental outcomes, extra effort, effectiveness, and satisfaction. This study  found that chairs and faculty perceive transformational leadership best  characterizes effective leadership. A significant overall group difference was  found, suggesting that chairs view themselves to be more of a transformational  leader than faculty perceives them to be. Also, chairs and faculty perceived  transformational leadership to best predict the departmental outcomes, however there  was a divergence between groups as to which transformational factors are predictors  of the three outcomes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Saroyan, Alenoush</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq309.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j3332812</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Educational leadership</dc:subject><dc:subject>Universities and colleges -- Administration</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A736665131"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Constructing a moral education theory of punishment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Artenosi, Daniel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis reconstructs John Rawl's Original Position in order  to show that within a liberal democratic culture, the institution of punishment  ought to conform to the Moral Education Theory of Punishment, put forth by Jean  Hampton. According to Hampton, punishment should facilitate a medium where the state  educates the criminal on the moral implications of her wrongdoing. I argue that  citizens would select the Moral Education Theory of Punishment in the Original  Position, since it offers the best opportunity to redress two calamities related to  the criminal's wrongdoing---namely, that it threatens the moral status of the  victim, and that it results from the wrongdoer's deficient moral sensibility. Upon  consideration, the representatives in the Original Position recognize that  redressing either of the two calamities necessitates redressing the other; thus,  both objectives reinforce one another. Consequently, the representatives would  unanimously select the principles of punishment manifest in the Moral Education  Theory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lu, Catherine</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311p95r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/736665131</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hampton, Jean -- Views on punishment</dc:subject><dc:subject>Punishment</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rawls, John, 1921-2002 -- Views on punishment</dc:subject><dc:subject>Justice (Philosophy)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz806036t"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Design and behavioural control of a dynamic quadruped with active wheels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Steeves, Charles F., 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To capitalize on the efficiency and simplicity of wheeled  robots, as well as the adaptability and maneuverability of legged robots, many  hybrid leg-wheel designs have been developed. To date, none of these platforms have  possessed the ability to execute dynamic maneuvers and thus have major shortcomings  in their speed, efficiency and obstacle negotiating capabilities. A hybrid leg-wheel  quadruped capable of such dynamic behaviour is introduced. Using an accurate model  of this platform, a variety of dynamic behaviours and examples of their utility were  successfully simulated. Passive leg compliance and the placement of wheels at the  foot of the legs proved invaluable in achieving such high energy maneuvers on this  power autonomous platform. A full systems design of a testbed capable of executing  the presented dynamic behaviour was completed. From both a mechanical and control  stand-point, it is a simple and robust robot. This prototype will prove the  feasibility of such behavioural feats for autonomously powered platforms,  demonstrate their wide utility and pave the way for their realization on ruggedized  platforms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Buehler, Martin</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tv718.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806036t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A47429975s"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hierarchical pose estimation from range data for space applications</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Simard, Louis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An emerging application for computer vision systems is satellite  servicing, involving pose estimation and tracking. Trackers are available but they  often require initialization, considerably reducing autonomy. This thesis presents a  new hierarchical pose estimation technique based on view-based analysis. The method  can handle very sparse range data, is computationally efficient, is robust to noise,  and can handle virtually any type of range data. It partitions the problem into two  halves, one dealing with estimation of the translation and the other with the  orientation. This greatly reduces the complexity of the overall problem without  compromising the accuracy of the solution. The resulting algorithm is able to  determine pose to within a prescribed accuracy, and from any vantage point within  the sensor field of view, at minimal computational complexity for large variations  in image noise. Results showing the performance of the system on a prototype space  vision system are presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferrie, Frank P.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537183r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429975s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g335b"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Time-based principles applied to mining</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Yaxu, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In order to develop a philosophy and set of methods which would  allow mines to be operated more effectively, a study was initiated to determine how  time-based methods used in manufacturing could be adapted to mining.

In addition, continuous programs such as Total  Quality Management and Total Preventive Maintenance were studied. This study showed  that time based principles, cellular mining, and total preventive maintenance had  the most promise for adoption in mining. Simulations of three different mining  methods under different scenarios and cost analyses were done to demonstrate the  viability of these methods. The conclusions were the following. (1) Time based  principles lead to greater profitability, and thus, should be used to drive mine  planning and production. (2) Cellular mining leads to more efficient mining  production.

The mixing tank receives Strathcona slurry,  Strathcona filter cakes, dry Raglan powder and water as its inputs. Our objective is  to control the Raglan to Strathcona ratio, the mixing tank level and the pulp  density of the output mixed slurry to their respective set points so that the  effects of all model uncertainties could be reduced. Static optimization is first  carried out to investigate the solution set of the existing process. Then  linearization and analysis of the existing system at its equilibrium point are  performed. Hereinafter, besides the existing Repulper tank process, a new  Three-Phase alternative process is suggested so that all uncertainties can be  handled properly. Different controllers are then designed to determine if they are  able to perform satisfactorily while undertaking all the uncertainties. Nonlinear  controllers of "Input-Output linearization" and switching control, which  is a variant of sliding control, are used. Robust switching control is found to have  the robust capability with guaranteed robust performance and stability for system  that has linear parametric bounded uncertainties and has a diagonal or triangular g  matrix, the matrix that maps from the state equations' inputs to the state  equations' differentials. Linear MIMO controllers of state feedback pole placement  and H2 optimal control are used. Comparison of performance and robustness is made  among different nonlinear and linear controllers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boulet, B.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq202.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vv00w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f4626099"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Activated silica sol as a flocculant in treatment of mine effluents</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Demers, Isabelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Lime neutralization of acidic drainage is the most common  process to produce an environmentally acceptable effluent. The process involves  neutralization, precipitation of metal hydroxides, flocculation, settling and  storage of the sludge. The sludge is not entirely stable over the long term due to  the natural pH decline in the storage area that can re-solubilize metals. The use of  activated silica sol could be an alternative to flocculants in the lime  neutralization process. The nature of the metal hydroxide---silica bond could make  the sludge more stable on short and long term. It was observed that similar settling characteristics can be  obtained with the standard flocculant and a low dosage of activated silica sol.  Using activated silica sol, the settling rate is dependent on the concentration of  magnesium and iron in the mine effluent. There was an improvement in sludge stability when using a high  dosage of activated silica sol. Two mechanisms have a role in the increased  stability: the adsorption bond and the buffering capacity of activated silica sol.  The tests suggested that a dosage of 0.1 gSiO2/gFe optimizes the settling  characteristics and the sludge stability.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, Jim</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784m37r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f4626099</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Environmental</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sd34s"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Gene expression analysis of the proteinase inhibitor gene PiA of potato (Solanum tuberosum) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Tieling, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this study the gene expression pattern of a novel proteinase  inhibitor II (PI-II) gene, PiA, in potato (Solanum tuberosum ), was analyzed using  RT-PCR.

PiA mRNA was  more abundant in the tuber vascular ring and perimedullary zone areas than in other  tuber tissues of DC.

Utilizing a nested relational model and an improved procedural  abstraction facility, ADTs are declared as computations encapsulating states with  their accessor/modifier methods. Objects of an ADT can be instantiated via a single  join. As computation calls are embedded into updates and virtual domain  actualization, objects are manipulated and accessed solely through the methods  exported by the ADT. The vertical domain algebra empowers Aldat with the capability  to combine values along a domain using system defined operators. A mechanism has now  been installed to run user defined computations as well. This, coupled with ADTs,  opens up the opportunity for Aldat to handle applications such as GIS which require  at once the capacity of a traditional DBMS and the computational power of a modern  programming language.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Merrett, T.

Data are sparse concerning the influence of a mouthguard on  breathing during exercise. We compared VE and VO2 during submaximal and maximal  exercise on a skating treadmill (TM) while wearing an intra-oral dental mouthguard.  Female varsity hockey players (n = 12) performed two skating tests on a TM with and  without a mouthguard (WIPSS Jaw-Joint Protecto(TM)). The players wore the mouthguard  during hockey practices prior to collection of ventilation data on the treadmill.  Also, the players completed a questionnaire that examined their perceptions of the  mouthguard in terms of ventilation, comfort and performance. A 10-point rating scale  was used for this evaluation. Two performance tests on the skating treadmill  examined the effect of the mouthguard on submaximal and maximal aerobic exercise.  The subjects skated for 4 min at 2 submaximal velocities (14 and 16  km·h-1 ) separated by 5 min of passive recovery. A VO2 max test followed  the submaximal tests and commenced at 18 km·h-1 with the velocity  increasing by 1 km·h-1 every minute until volitional fatigue. VE, VO2,  VCO 2 and RER were analyzed using a Sensor Medics 2900 metabolic cart. Two-way (2  conditions x 3 velocities) repeated measures ANOVAs were used to examine differences  in VE, VO2 and HR. Ventilation was unchanged when skating at the two submaximal  velocities. VO2 max was 48.8 ml·kg-1·min-1 using the  intra-oral mouthguard and was 52.4 ml·kg-1·min -1 without a  mouthguard. VE max was 108.5 L·min -1 using the intra-oral mouthguard and  was 114.1 L·min -1 without a mouthguard. The results showed that VE max  and VO2 max were lower using the mouthguard compared to the no mouthguard  condition.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Montgomery, David L.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354f88g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bv22z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Skating -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hockey -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Helmets -- Testing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pulmonary gas exchange</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4f16c3463"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structure function analysis of glutamate gated chloride channels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Starc, Tanja</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCl) belong to then  icotinic ligand-gated ion channel family and are thus assumed to be heteropentamers.  Each subunit contains a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane  domains (TM1--TM4), and an extracellular C terminal. Caenorhabditis elegans  expresses various GluCl channels formed by alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha4 and beta  subunits. The best understood GluCl channel is expressed in pharyngeal muscle cells  where it mediates response to the M3 motor neuron. alpha2 forms this channel,  probably in association with beta. The alpha2 mutant lacks M3 neurotransmission  which can be rescued by pharynx-specific alpha2 expression. My results show that  alpha1 and alpha3 subunits cannot substitute for alpha2. Formation of chimeric  constructs of alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3 pinpoints the M1--M3 transmembrane region of  alpha2 as the minimal rescuing domain. This region may therefore be important for  localization or, in association with another subunit, in the formation of the active  channel.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dent, Joseph</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763747h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c3463</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Caenorhabditis elegans</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ivermectin</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chloride channels</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agm80hv94k"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular control of renal branching morphogenesis by retinoic acid</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sheu, Carey</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Individuals born with low renal reserves are predisposed to  progressive renal disease and primary hypertension as adults. Experimental evidence  for vitamin A (retinol) control of nephrogenesis have led some to propose that  maternal vitamin A status during pregnancy is responsible for most of the inborn  variation in nephron number in the general population. The extent of collecting duct  (CD) arborization during development is a primary determinant of nephron endowment.  In the present study, the hypothesis of direct retinoic acid (RA) effects on CD  branching morphogenesis was tested using murine inner medullary collecting duct  (mIMCD-3) cells. Data presented show that mIMCD-3 cells express retinoic acid  receptors (RARs) which mediate up to 30-fold induction of reporter activity from  RARE-luciferase in transient transfection. In deep collagen culture, the  RAR-selective agonist TTNPB and physiological levels of all-trans RA dramatically  increase the number and length of branching tubules formed compared to control.  Although retinoid regulation of EGF-R is well established in other cell lines,  quantitative PCR and [125-I] EGF binding analysis of retinoid-treated cells provide  no evidence of RA regulation of EGF-R transcripts or numbers at the cell surface.  However, the cancellation of RA effects by the EGF-R inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478  suggests participation of active EGF-R in downstream signaling pathways; the  possibility of receptor cross-talk by RA transactivation of EGF-R is raised. mIMCD-3  is a retinoid-responsive cell line whose branching program is strongly induced by  RA. Identification of retinoid targets may have both fundamental and applied  relevance, offering potential insight to in vivo processes, and as basic technology  supporting tubular engineering and potential artificial renal replacement  therapy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goodyer, Paul R.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333282b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80hv94k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967433v"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>High pressure treatment for enhancing safety and quality of raw milk cheese</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shao, Yanwen, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The application of high pressure (HP) processing on raw milk  cheese was investigated in order to assure safety and improve quality. Fresh raw  milk cheese inoculated with contaminant, spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms  (Escherichia coli K-12, E. coli O157:117 and Listeria monocytogenes), as well as  natural micro-flora, were subjected to UP treatment at selected pressures (200--400  MPa) for various holding times (0 to 100 min), or number of pulses. HP destruction  of microorganisms followed the dual effect destruction behavior involving a step  change in the population due to a pressure pulse (pulse effect, PE) and a first  order rate log-linear kinetics during the pressure hold. The pressure dependency of  kinetic parameters followed the pressure destruction time (PDT) and Arrhenius type  models. The results suggest that high pressure treatment as a powerful  tool for microbial control do not result in major change in raw milk cheese quality  properties (color and texture). It would thus be an effective method of inactivation  of spoilage bacteria and pathogens for ensuring safety and keeping the quality of  raw milk cheese.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ramaswamy, H.

Functional MRI was used to assess the effect of nicotine on brain  activation during a verbal and visual working memory task. In a group of 10 smokers,  nicotine improved performance in the verbal task compared to placebo; increased  activation in the ventrolateral pre-frontal cortex and lentiform nucleus, as well as  decreased activation in the hippocampus and medial frontal cortex. In the visual  task, there were no differences in performance, no additional areas were recruited,  and there was no suppression of activity in the hippocampus. The results suggest that this pattern of changes may have  contributed to the improvements in performance in the verbal task. It is likely that  nicotine affects working memory through cholinergic activation and dopaminergic  modulation of the corticostriatal pathway.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dagher, Alain</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429977b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20st21j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wn533"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Murine oocyte loss occurs during fetal development</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>McClellan, Kelly Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recently, the timing of oocyte loss during murine development  has been brought into question as authors using mouse vasa homologue (MVH) as a germ  cell marker did not observe a loss of oocytes during fetal life. Instead the major  loss was observed in the days following birth, after chromosome pairing has  occurred. In this study the controversy was addressed by establishing a  new and reliable method to quantify murine oocytes in meiotic prophase, as well as  to determine the gestation age and meiotic prophase stage of oocyte loss. Earlier  limitations were overcome through the use of Germ Cell Nuclear Antigen-1 (GCNA-1)  antibody as a germ cell specific marker, and the novel addition of a cytospin  centrifugation step to the method. Progress through meiotic prophase was examined in  chromosome spread preparations where meiotic stages were assessed using an antiserum  against synaptonemal complex (SC) proteins. Quantification was accomplished by  counting the number of GCNA-1 immunoreactive cells in chromosome spread preparations  and estimated in histological sections using the ratio estimation model.

The symmetric matrix, being defined at an  energy scale appropriate to a right-handed neutrino in a See-saw scheme of mass  suppression, is subject to evolution under Supersymmetric Renormalisation Group  Equations, in order to interpret the matrix at experimental energies. By way of  motivation we discuss the status of neutrino mass in the Standard Model and justify  the context of the analysis by examining the mechanisms and evidence for  oscillations. We then review the See-saw mechanism and also the process of  renormalisation and its implications for bridging disparate energy scales. We  present the relevant Renormalization Group Equations and demonstrate the  parameterisation of pertinent Renormalization Group effects. Finally, we review  previous work analysing this symmetry before updating some of these results and  extending the analysis to its global behaviour in the space of both solar and  atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lam, C.

Quantitative techniques provide estimated measures of model  parameters that more accurately describe the MT process.

The storm caused over 40 million dollars of damages, several deaths and  injuries across the United States and Canada. The unseasonal synoptic settings  resulted in the formation of low-level moisture pooling and the buildup of  convective available potential energy. The upper-level jet streak eventually  furnished the trigger for the outbreak of precursor deep convection leading to the  development of this derecho. The results illustrated the feasibility of simulating the  derecho using a mesoscale model with the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental  Prediction) reanalysis. Convection was not initiated properly using as initial  conditions the CMC (Canadian Meteorological Centre) analysis which displays less  low-level moisture and potential instability, as well as downward motion over the  area of convective outbreak. Similarities between the modelled profile and the  environment conducive to wet microburst are discussed. Sensitivity experiments were  performed to explore the effects of shallow convection, deep convective  parameterization, and a different surface scheme on the simulation of the  derecho.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yau, M.

The current  immunohistochemical/confocal studies show a non-uniform distribution of three  connexin isoforms (Cx 40, Cx 43 and Cx 45) within these cellular regions of the rat  AV node with a marked transition from Cx 43 to Cx 40 at the compact node region.
