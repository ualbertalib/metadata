In this thesis, I undertake an examination of eligibility criteria at three stages in the genesis and dissemination of medical knowledge: clinical trial protocol, interpretation by investigators, and reporting of study results. In the first chapter, ethical issues in subject selection are reviewed and the main study questions are presented. In the second chapter, the results of an examination of eligibility criteria in two sets of clinical trials, one sponsored by the NSABP, the other sponsored by POG, covering a twenty-year time span are presented. The POG trials had far fewer eligibility criteria than the NSABP studies, suggesting that large numbers of criteria may not be necessary for high quality research. In the third chapter, the impact of subjective eligibility criteria on enrollment and investigator uncertainty is explored. Subjective criteria were associated with more variable enrollment decisions and greater uncertainty. Such criteria represent a threat to the validity, conduct and interpretation of trials and, therefore, should only be included when carefully justified. The fourth chapter examines the accuracy of the reporting of eligibility criteria in sets of corresponding study protocol, methods paper, journal article, and Clinical Alert. Important information is lost at each step in the dissemination of study results. Unnecessary criteria ought to be dropped at a trial's inception; all other criteria must be reported faithfully. The fifth chapter attempts to provide a comprehensive philosophical account of just selection procedures for clinical research using the political philosophy of Michael Walzer. The sixth, and last, chapter, discusses explanatory and pragmatic approaches to clinical trial design, overlapping scientific and ethical concerns related to eligibility criteria, and questions for further study.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Freedman, Benjamin</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Fuks, Abraham</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th203.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892c601</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Health Care Management</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education, Administration</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988m835"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Pharmacokinetic modeling of pollutant fluxes by limnoplankton</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wen, Yuan Hua</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis was to construct general models to predict pollutant fluxes in limnoplankton by incorporating characteristics of the organism and the structures of the chemical. A two-compartmental pharmacokinetic model was used to quantify the pollutant uptake, depuration and intercompartmental exchanges. The model pollutants were phosphorus and 22 organic chemicals. The rate constants of phosphorus uptake, excretion and intercompartmental changes by algae and cladocerans decreased with cell volume or body size raised to a power close to $-$0.25, except the intercompartmental exchanges for cladocerans which showed more negative slopes. In contrast, uptake, excretion and internal exchange rates per individual increased with cell size or body weight to a power similar to 0.75 with a similar exception for the cladoceran intercompartmental exchanges, which had slopes $&lt;$0.75. Bioconcentration factors, rate constants and flux rates of uptake and intercompartmental exchange from metabolic pool to structural pool of 22 $ sp{14}$C-labelled organic toxicants by Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Daphnia magna were positively correlated with the octanol/water partition coefficient, molecular weight, parachor, connectivity index, boiling point and melting point, and negatively with aqueous solubility. However, those of elimination and internal transfer from structural pool to metabolic pool showed opposite changes. Comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters between Daphnia and Chlorella demonstrated that, although all kinetic parameters displayed similar patterns, the relative magnitudes of each corresponding parameters were significantly different between two species.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Peters, Robert Henry</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wm047.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988m835</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Organic compounds -- Environmental aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pharmacokinetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Toxicity testing -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freshwater algae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zooplankton</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795947t"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Intelligent autonomous inductively coupled plasma instrumental operation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Webb, Douglas P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The development of a framework for the automated analysis of inductively couple plasma atomic emission spectroscopy is present.

This thesis focusses on the neuroanatomical features of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors in the central nervous system, the neuromodulatory role of IL-2 on hippocampal acetylcholine release, and possible intracellular signalling mechanisms following IL-2 receptor activation in the brain. Using immunoautoradiography, IL-2-like immunoreactivities were observed in a selected pattern in the central nervous system, with particularly high densities seen in the hippocampal formation and the hypothalamus of the rodent brain. The cellular localisation of the immunostaining using immunohistochemical approaches reveals that this staining was seen most evidently on cell perikarya especially in areas of high labelling density. The distribution of IL-2 receptor binding sites using both in vitro receptor autoradiography and immunoautoradiography (anti-TAC antibody against the IL-2 receptor a chain) shows that IL-2 receptors are selectively distributed in the rodent brain, with the highest densities observed in the hippocampal formation and the hypothalamus, in accordance with the localisation of IL-2 peptide immunostaining. The postulated neuromodulatory role of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors in the hippocampus was investigated next focusing on cholinergic parameters (acetylcholine release) on the basis of previous results from our laboratory (Araujo et al., 1989). The neuromodulatory effects of IL-2 on acetylcholine (ACh) release was investigated using in vitro rat brain slices superfusion. IL-2 exerted potent effects on hippocampal ACh release, acting as a potentiating agent at low (pM) concentrations, while inhibiting release at higher (low nM) concentrations. An inhibitory effect (10 nM IL-2) on ACh release was also observed in the frontal cortex, but not in the parietal cortex or the striatum. This action was not shared by other interleukins such as IL-6. Both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of IL-2 in hippocampal ACh release were blocked by an anti-IL-2 receptor antibody (TAC), suggesting the requirement of a genuine IL-2 receptor for both effects. The potentiating, in contrast to the inhibitory effect, was insensitive to tetrodotoxin, suggesting a direct action (or in close proximity) of IL-2 on cholinergic terminals to stimulate hippocampal ACh release. The inhibitory effect of IL-2 on ACh release was abolished by both bicuculline and phaclofen, suggesting the involvement of GABA acting on both GABA$ sb{ rm A}$ and GABA$ sb{ rm B}$ receptors present in the rat hippocampal formation. The signalling mechanisms of the IL-2 receptor in the rat brain was studied next in vitro by measuring the effects of IL-2 on cytidine-diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) turnover in rat brain slices. IL-2 potently inhibited basal CDP-DAG turnover in the frontal cortex and hypothalamus, but not in the hippocampus or striatum. However, IL-2 inhibited carbachol-stimulated CDP-DAG turnover in the hippocampus. This decrease was in parallel to an increase in choline production, suggesting a role for phospholipase D in brain IL-2 receptor signalling.

Clean conversion of the bidentate monoester ((Co$ sb2$(bpmp)($ mu$-PP)(OH) (OH$ sb2$)) (ClO$ sb4) sb2$) to the tridentate inorganic phosphate ((Co$ sb2$(bpmp)($ mu, mu sp2$-Pi) (OH)) (ClO$ sb4$)), together with the crystal structure of an analog of phenylphosphonate, (Co$ sb2$(bpmp)($ mu$-PPO3)(OH)(OH$ sb2$)) (ClO$ sb4) sb2$ provide detailed mechanistic insight into the hydrolysis reaction. The structure of (Co$ sb2$(bpmp)($ mu$-DPPO2)($ mu$-O$ sb2$)) (ClO$ sb4) sb2$ contains a diphenylphosphinate and a peroxide bridged between two cobalt(III) centers. Interestingly one of the oxygen atoms of the peroxide is only about 2.8 A away from the phosphorus of the coordinated phosphinate. When the bridging phosphinate is replaced with methyl phenylphosphonate (Co$ sb2$(bpmp)($ mu$-MPPO3)($ mu$-O$ sb2$)) (ClO$ sb4) sb2$, the ester bond is cleaved in aqueous DMSO (2:1 DMSO-d6/D$ sb2$O). The pseudo-first order rate constant for the cleavage of the methyl phenylphosphonate monoester bond in the complex is 5.3 x 10$ sp{-7}$ s$ sp{-1}$ at pH 7 (t$ sb{1/2}$ = 15 days) at 20$ sp circ$C. The estimated rate of base catalysed hydrolysis of the phosphonate is 1.4 $ times$ 10$ sp{-11}$M$ sp{-1}$s$ sp{-1}$ so that ca. 10$ sp{11}$ fold rate enhancement is observed. The reactivity of dinuclear cobalt(III) complexes for cleaving phosphate diester in (Co$ sb2$(N3)$ sb2( mu$-OH)$ sb2( mu$-PO$ sb4$R$ sb2$)) can be significantly increased by decreasing the O-Co-O bond angle in the intermediate or transition state which forms a four membered ring. This can be achieved by increasing the N-Co-N ligands side bond angle opposite the O-Co-O angle. In (Co$ sb2$( (9) aneN3)$ sb2( mu$-OH)$ sb2( mu$-MPNPP)), the nitrogens are connected by two carbons whereas in (Co$ sb2$(tame)$ sb2( mu$-OH)$ sb2( mu$-MPNPP)), where tame is 1,1,1-tri(aminomethyl)ethane, the nitrogens are connected by three carbons. This results in a 10 fold increase in the reactivity for tame complex over (9) aneN3 complex. There are three principal modes of activation that metal ions can provide for hydrolyzing phosphate esters. They are Lewis acid activation, nucleophiie activation and leaving group activation. All three modes of activation have been investigated in a three-metal system if the activation is additive. In the system that has a binding site on the leaving group for a third metal ion, double Lewis acid activation, double nucleophile activation and leaving group activation provides an unprecedented 10$ sp{17}$ fold rate enhancement for hydrolyzing a phosphate diester than in the corresponding third metal free system.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cs18t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hk92g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d1725"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Gender and community in the social constitution of the internet</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shade, Leslie Regan, 1957-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis has a three-fold goal: (1) it aims to contribute to studies which analyze the gender dimension in social shaping studies of technology; (2) in its emphasis on the Internet and the new information infrastructure it is a complement to the literature in communication studies on the gendering of communication technologies; and (3) it adds to emergent theories of virtual communities by positing how gendered practices and gender-related activities have influenced the emergence of social policy mores in the evolving information infrastructure. In emphasizing the social factors that shape technological change the thesis departs from dominant approaches towards technology that typically study the "affects" or "impact" of technology on society. This thesis similarly responds to the gender-perspective gap that exists in sociotechnical studies, and enlarges the scope of gender studies through its consideration of emergent information and communication technologies, notably the Internet. How the social mores of virtual communities have been influenced and affected by and through a consideration of gender and gendered practices on the Internet forms a core component of the thesis, based upon case studies. As this thesis argues, new information and communication technologies must be considered in relation to other communication technologies, as well as in relation to the social context in which they are designed, developed and used, including the often unarticulated social assumptions of various groups, and the unanticipated consequences of the new information infrastructure. In this sense, social scientists are now at a key turning point in their explorations of new information and communication technologies. This thesis should be of significance to communication scholars interested in the history and theory of gender and communication technologies; social historians of technology, and feminist scholars, with an interest in a gendered perspective on new communication technologies; and public policy officials interested in how different groups of individuals will interact with, influence, and be affected by new communication and information technologies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Crowley, David</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sm214.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d1725</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women in communication</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in technology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer networks -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Internet -- Social aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn00b056p"><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Making sense of tense : tense, time reference, and linking theory</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shaer, Benjamin M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines the forms and meanings of tensed and non-tensed clauses in English, and proposes an analysis of them that is 'Reichenbachian' in spirit and syntactic in orientation. The study considers tensed verb forms in simple sentences, focussing on 'present', 'future', and 'perfect' forms and their interaction with adverbials of temporal location; and those in complement, relative, and temporal clause constructions. It also considers three types of non-tensed verb forms--infinitives, gerunds, and 'bare infinitives'--in verb complements. The study demonstrates that the interpretation of tensed and non-tensed forms can be described in terms of Reichenbach's (1947) temporal schemata, which express relations between 'S' ('speech time'), 'R' ('reference time'), and 'E' ('situation time'). However, its central claim is that the tensed forms themselves are 'temporally underspecified', encoding relations between 'S' and 'R', and leaving the relation between 'R' and 'E' and the location and duration of both of these intervals to be determined by lexical properties of the verb and its arguments, temporal adverbials, and context. Non-tensed verbs forms have a similar syntactic representation, differing primarily in not fully encoding a relation between 'S' and 'R'. This claim is cashed out in terms of two devices: a feature system that expresses tenses as particular values of the feature matrix (Anterior, Posterior); and a device of 'tense linking', based on Higginbotham's (e.g. 1983) proposal for binding theory, which associates verbs with temporal adverbials or tensed Infl, and one (tensed or non-tensed) Infl with a higher one.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gillon, Brendan</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tb17k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b056p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Tense</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Tense</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab8515q118"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Etude des procédures de mise en œuvre des droits fondamentaux au travail : perspectives d'évolution du rôle de l'OIT dans le contexte de la mondialisation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tenailleau, Marie Amelie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the context of economic globalisation, the unequal distribution of wealth among nations often leads to infringe fundamental workers' rights, so that it has become a major concern for politicians, scholars, jurists and NGOs. Therefore the question is how the social market can be regulated today. The ILO is the first international organisation that has dealt with workers' rights, especially fundamental rights, its goal being to protect workers universally. If its legitimacy had been unquestioned for years, it is shattered by external economic factors today: state's loss of power in regulating social relations, the emergence of new political counterbalances on the international scene---unknown by international public law---and self-governance by social labels or codes of conducts. The author will attempt, by a critical appraisal, to demonstrate that the ILO has its own constitutional and logistical means to implement fundamental workers' rights efficiently and independently: union freedom and collective negotiation, prohibition of hard labour, prohibition of child labour, prohibition of discrimination. According to the author, the ILO is undergoing an institutional transition. The latter is adapting to the new economic context. In Geneva centralised procedures are still very centralised but they are in the same time counterweighted by local actions or soft procedures. These more flexible and discrete procedures are the keystone of the ILO system of supervision to implement fundamental rights. Finally it is relevant to have a look at regional organisations which deal with those fundamental rights, as they have a special role in implementing the ILO fundamental rights.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sheppard, Colleen</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246t779.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q118</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Labor laws and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>International Labour Organisation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av118rg25p"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Fine mapping of the nuclear restorer locus for cytoplasmic male sterility in Brassica napus</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stollar, Rachel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis will discuss the 'Polima' cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system (pol) in Brassica napus (Canola) and detailed genetic mapping of the region surrounding restorer gene ( Rfp) for that system This fine mapping of the Rfp region will facilitate efforts to clone the gene that will eventually lead to its characterization. Knowledge of the structure of Rfp will provide insight in the molecular mechanisms governing mitochondrial gene statement as well as pollen production and may lead to the development of alternative methods of pollination control. In addition, it is possible that nuclear restorer genes for other CMS systems in other crops may be similar to that of the 'Polima' system. Map based cloning requires the identification of DNA markers tightly linked to Rfp. Two PCR based markers which are located on either side of Rfp were developed. These markers allowed facile screening of a large population. RFLP markers used in this study are based on the synteny between B. napus and the well known crucifer A. thaliana.

The detonation sensitivity was quantified by measuring the run-up distance required for a deflagration to transit to a detonation wave (DDT) in a rough tube. Fuel rich pentane-oxygen mixtures at subatmospheric initial pressures were studied. Subsequent to the injection of the mixture into the heated detonation tube, the mixture underwent cool flame oxidation after a well controlled delay time, as it was determined by the temperature of the tube. Typical delays ranged from 0.7 to 2 seconds (depending on temperature) and were reproducible to within one hundred milliseconds. This permitted to spark-ignite the mixture in the detonation tube at various stages of its cool flame process. The results show that increasing mixture temperature from room temperature to values below the cool flame region (below 250°C) resulted in an increase in run-up distance. However, as the mixture begins to undergo cool flame oxidization a significant reduction in the run-up distance was obtained (as large as 50%). The sensitization effect was found to occur only at the initial stage of the cool flame oxidation reaction. If the mixture is ignited at times long after the onset of cool flame, the mixture was found to be desensitized and the run-up distance increased. The sensitizing effect of the cool flame partial oxidation may be attributed to the presence of peroxides and free radicals associated with the initial cool flame process.

However, existing speed-reduction mechanisms are usually a major sink of energy and information in mechanical transmissions. Energy and positioning information are lost through: (a) friction between sliding components; (b) compliance; and (c) backlash. A novel transmission for speed reduction, Speed-o-Cam, is currently under research at McGill University's Centre for Intelligent Machines (CIM). The transmission is based on the layout of pure-rolling indexing cam mechanisms, and hence, eliminates backlash and friction. Besides zero backlash and low friction losses, Speed-o-Cam also offers the possibility of high stiffness, another essential attribute for high-accuracy applications. This thesis focuses on the aspects of both model development and mechanical-parameter identification of a spherical prototype of Speed-o-Cam. Our main interest lies in identifying the mechanism stiffness. In order to conduct experiments on the prototype, a testbed was designed and fabricated. A mathematical model of the testbed is first formulated. Based on this model and the results of experiments, the parameters of the Speed-o-Cam prototype are identified. In the process, the stiffness and damping parameters of the couplings of the testbed are also identified. Power efficiency is an important indicator of speed reducing mechanisms. For the Speed-o-Cam prototype, this indicator is also estimated experimentally.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angeles, Jorge</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nz948.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vm76w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn301306t"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Finite-element modelling of the mechanics of the coupling between the incus and stapes in the middle ear</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Siah, Tiong Heng</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The middle ear is a small air-filled cavity which contains a chain of three small bones or ossicles: the malleus, the incus and the stapes. There is a tiny bony bridge (pedicle) between the long process of the incus and the lenticular process, but little or nothing is known about the effect of the pedicle on the movements of the ossicles. The motivation of the work presented here is to improve our understanding of the mechanical behaviour at the pedicle and the incudostapedial joint, in particular the relative contributions of the two structures to sound transmission through the middle ear. A three-dimensional finite-element model of the pedicle and the incudostapedial joint was created, where the dimensions are based on examination of histological sections of a cat middle ear. Careful attention has been paid to the mesh generation of the model, especially for the regions of interest, such as the pedicle, that are very small relative to the overall structure. The issue of the compromise between the mesh resolution and the computational time will be discussed as well. Ranges of plausible values for the stiffnesses of the joint, joint capsule and pedicle were tested and the resulting displacements were examined for various loading conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Funnell, W.

The biofiltration of styrene vapors confirmed the role of nutrient addition for maintaining highest elimination capacity level (EC = 0.368 mol m-3 .h -1 +/- 0.051, n = 9). Without a nitrogen source, however, the EC level was 0.255 mol m-3 .h-1 +/- 0.039 (n = 6). The biofiltration of toluene vapors showed a maximum elimination capacity of 2.01 mol.m-3.h-1 and the ability of the biofilter to respond at inlet load changes (0 mol.m-3.h-1 to 4.08 mol.m -3.h-1) applied over a short period (4 days). In both experiments, the dioxygen uptake rate (O2UR) and the carbon dioxide production rate (CPR), followed using an on-line respirometer, showed to be function of the pollutant organic load and, in the biofiltration of styrene vapors, depended on the presence of a N-source. Growth yields parameters calculated from O2UR and CPR data were similar to the predicted yields from the stoichiometric equation of the bioxidation of styrene or toluene.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010r92r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nw37j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj1393776"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>3D tracking of non-rigid articulated objects</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Djambazian, Haig</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Articulated objects can be found in many living beings. Tracking is essential if we want to interpret the behavior of such objects. This thesis describes a framework for learning the relationship between the state and the appearance of the object. It will also show how to use this representation to track the state of the articulated object. The learning phase of the method results in populations of models that describe the appearance of small regions of the object for small regions of the state space. To efficiently train off-line, it is necessary to model the appearance of the object as function of the state. The local models use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on windowed regions of the projected object. Manifolds in PCA subspace represent the appearance of the small local regions as they undergo deformations. The tracking algorithm recursively matches the link appearances while searching in the state space of the articulated object. To match the object appearance to the model, a coarse search finds the models that are active. The error of the projected object image is then minimized (at the new unknown state) in model subspace by fine-tuning the state. Algorithm performance is evaluated on real and synthetic data of a 4 d.o.f. finger following arbitrary 3-D paths. The results show that the local PCA models capture the deformations successfully even after discarding some of the bases. These deformations account for key features that are essential to the matching process. Also, the way in which the appearance data is partitioned allows for a fast and efficient caching strategy, thus allowing the algorithm to meet real-time constraints. Finally the merging of predictions and observations makes the algorithm very robust to outliers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferrie, Frank P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cj364.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj1393776</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526f06f"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Oxygen-alkali delignification of mechanically pretreated wood</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chia, John Teng San, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Oxygen-alkaline pulping is a sulphur-free chemical pulping process, which has a potential to replace the kraft process as an environmentally more viable alternative. However, there are some drawbacks to the process, which have so far prevented it from commercialization. The penetration of oxygen into the structure of wood chips and rather severe degradation of carbohydrates are the main problems that result in high reject contents and low pulp strengths. In this study, wood chips, after presoaking in a 0.2% solution of alkali, were mechanically treated in a compression screw feeder with the aim to facilitate the penetration of oxygen. Mechanically pretreated wood chips produced oxygen alkali pulps with screened yields that were almost 13% higher than those without mechanical treatment. At the same time, the total yields of both pulps were comparable. To improve the strength of the oxygen-alkaline pulps, the pH of the pulping liquor was kept constant between 7 and 8 throughout the pulping process. This resulted in a pulp that has a viscosity 3 times greater than that of the control oxygen-alkaline cook, thus indicating an improvement in strength properties.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Berk, Dimitrios</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Kubes, George</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mx242.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s7526f06f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agriculture, Wood Technology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f4627222"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Automatic generation of training data for brain tissue classification from MRI</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cocosco, Cristian A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A fully automatic procedure for brain tissue classification from 3D magnetic resonance head images (MRI) is described. The procedure uses feature space proximity measures, and does not make any assumptions about the tissue intensity data distributions. As opposed to existing methods for automatic tissue classification, which are often sensitive to anatomical variability and pathology, the proposed procedure is robust against morphological deviations from the model. A novel method for automatic generation of classifier training samples, using a minimum spanning tree graph-theoretic approach, is proposed in this thesis. Starting from a set of samples generated from prior tissue probability maps (the "model") in a standard, brain-based coordinate system ("stereotaxic space"), the method reduces the fraction of incorrectly labelled samples in this set from 25% down to 2%. The corrected set of samples is then used by a supervised classifier for classifying the entire 3D image. Validation experiments were performed on both real and simulated MRI data; the kappa similarity measure increased from 0.90 to 0.95.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Evans, Alan C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m579v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f4627222</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687k10w"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Design and implementation of high-speed transmitters and receivers for optical interconnects in CMOS technology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chuah, Alan E.

With the advent of mass schooling, there came to be a distinction between formal and informal education, with formal schooling representing the superiority of abstract, decontextualized, and rule-based learning over the informal, or the concrete, situated, and supposedly unstructured learning from everyday life. Research and theory in anthropology, sociocultural psychology and progressive educational philosophy have challenged this distinction, explicitly demonstrating the dialectical relationship between the formal and informal modes of all activity, regardless of setting. Inseparable from this conception of cognition is the notion that all knowledge is transmitted via culturally and sociohistorically framed and interrelated valuations of norms, beliefs, social conduct and the application of knowledge across spheres. Progressive educational theorists argue that the creative process is the best means to tap the identity and skill-shaping potential of the informal mode. This proposition is actively and concretely investigated in this thesis through the writing, by this researcher, of a one-act play, Nineveh . As postulated by the theory, through the creative process the author's sense of identity and ability to creatively apply knowledge was affected positively. From this combined theoretical and practical examination of the informal mode of learning and teaching, a need for pluralistic educational praxis is forwarded. Engagement with the creative process is suggested as a means to help students feel more confident to learn from and enrich their lived experiences in their cultural environment, and thereby actively contribute to their interconnected sense of identity and mastery over multiple forms of applied knowledge.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wood, Elizabeth</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784n476.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m580m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experiential learning</dc:subject><dc:subject>Identity (Psychology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zq30c"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Islamic doctrine of ribā prohibition : a modular hermeneutical examination</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Subhani, Azeemuddin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Islamic prohibition of riba is unequivocal but textually not explicit. The traditional and liberal theological, juridical and philosophical hermeneutical effort has addressed it comprehensively but not conclusively. This inconclusiveness is due to the absence of the identification of the distinctive characteristic of riba, resulting from the use of limited scope pre-defined juridical and economic paradigms employing a contextual exoteric approach, excluding the broader esoteric content. This promotes an internal hermeneutical imbalance between the variables of meaning, application, rationale, underlying cause and consequence of riba, preventing the full convergence and congruence of these narrowly defined paradigms with the broadly implied paradigm in the Qur'an and the Sunna, and obstructing the promulgation of the prohibition. The resolution of this hermeneutical gridlock, predicated upon the discovery of the distinctive rationale and the derivation of the underlying cause of riba prohibition, has a direct bearing on the expansion of scope and unreserved acceptance of the prohibition.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hallaq, Wael B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m1169.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq30c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Interest (Islamic law)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avx021g99q"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of East Asian Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mapping Tokyo : cartography and modernity in Japan in the early Meiji period</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thouny, Christophe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Studies of the Early Meiji Period have until now been mainly articulated around the issue of continuity and discontinuity between the Edo and Meiji eras. Thus Tokyo has become the central locus of production of multiple discourses on Japanese modernity, urbanity and culture. This work adopts a discontinuist approach by considering each era as two entirely distinct, although related, historical assemblages. For this, I focus my study on the conditions of production of Tokyo as a modern urban space. The entry into modernity is the crossing of a threshold. As Edo is marked by the order of the general equivalent and the law of the sumptury, Tokyo is produced in abstract space. We shift from an essentially heterogeneous space to a homogeneous, fragmented and hierarchized space. Following Henri Lefebvre, I try to analyze the production of modern abstract space as it is associated with a new mode of control of social space through administrative policies, cartography and urbanism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Looser, Thoma</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827d45g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021g99q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tokyo (Japan) -- History -- 1868-1912</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asf268691s"><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Information communications technologies in education : a Faustian bargain?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thomas, Charalambos Bob</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is currently a glaring absence of critical discourse surrounding the integration of information communications technologies in schools.

Intelligence, and social perspective coordination, the ability to negotiate the self's and other's points of view in social situations, were offered as moderators of the effect of stress on competence. Competence was defined as developmentally-appropriate functioning in academic, behavioural, and social domains, and stress was operationalized as a combination of negative life events and demographic stressors. Better intellectual functioning and perspective coordination abilities were commensurate with elevated levels of academic performance and positive classroom behaviours. Additionally, intelligence served a protective function in the relationship between stress and fighting behaviour. In the context of high stress, students with high levels of intelligence were involved in significantly fewer physical fights than their less intelligent peers. These results highlight the potential for adaptation in First Nations youths, and suggest a direction for future research that accentuates adaptation instead of pathology.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burack, Jake</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57ns675.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945s609</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Resilience (Personality trait) in adolescence -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indians of North America -- Québec (Province) -- Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43nz95j"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The technical vocabulary of al-Kindi in the Letter on the first philosophy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Filonenko, Kostyantyn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present work deals with establishing of the exact meaning of the technical terms used by al-Kindi in the longest of his extant philosophical treatises, The Letter on the First Philosophy.

Much attention has been paid to the original significance of the terms that are al-Kindī's translation of Aristotle's philosophical vocabulary. In some instances, when the difference between the Aristotelian usage and that of al-Kindī appeared to be crucial (as for example, in case of the terms ή κοvιή άίσθησις (the common sense), and al-ḥiss al-kullī (the universal sense), both usages have been given in a detailed exposition.
