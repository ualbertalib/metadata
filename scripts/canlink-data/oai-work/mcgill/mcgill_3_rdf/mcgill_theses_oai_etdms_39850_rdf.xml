For stage I and II breast cancer, the standard treatment is partial mastectomy followed by radiation treatment. The risk of local recurrence ranges from 6 to 9%. A controversy exists as to whether there is an increased risk of local recurrence as a result of excessive delay between surgery and radiation treatment. A natural experiment associated with a prolonged waiting time in our institution provided an opportunity to evaluate the impact of waiting times for radiation treatment of breast cancer on the risk of local recurrence. Methods. Between January 1988 and December 1989, 486 patients with stage I or II breast cancer from McGill hospitals were treated with radiotherapy. Their charts were reviewed, and information with regard to prognostic factors, such as age, tumor size, histological grade, number of positive lymph nodes, and margins of resection, was abstracted. The interval between the date of surgery and the date of initial radiation treatment, and events, such as local recurrence, metastases and death, were noted. Results. At five years, the local recurrence rate was 8%, the metastatic rate 13%, and the disease-free survival rate 89%. In the univariate analysis, the risk of local recurrence was associated with younger age, higher histological grade, and time to radiation treatment. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, higher histological grade and time to radiation treatment were significant. Using recursive partitioning, the risk of local recurrence was almost five times higher for patients who waited in excess of 79 days for radiation treatment. Conclusion. Delay in radiation treatment is associated with an increased risk of local recurrence of breast cancer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Battista, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tx04t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p661t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hh52p"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Behaviour change and HIV infection in Montreal injection drug users</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brogly, Susan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objective. To investigate the independent association of changes in sexual and drug injection risk behaviour on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) seroconversion among Montreal injection drug users (IDUs). Design. Subjects were selected from the St. Luc cohort, a prospective study that has recruited IDUs since September 1988. Eligible subjects must have enrolled in the cohort after December 31, 1991 and completed at least two follow-up visits. HIV serostatus testing was performed at baseline and semi-annually. Questionnaires on injection and sexual risk behaviour were administered at each visit. Cox regression with time-dependent covariates was used in the analysis. Results. The risk of HIV infection appears to be dependent upon the consistency of risk behaviour practiced. Chronic IDUs, who made no attempt to change risk behaviour, were at high risk of HIV infection. Episodic IDUs, who attempted to practice low risk behaviour but experienced frequent relapse to high risk behaviour, were also at considerable risk of HIV infection. Episodic IDUs demonstrated a higher risk of HIV infection than chronic IDUs for certain behaviours. Stable IDUs, who had managed to maintain low risk behaviour, were at minimal risk of HIV infection. Conclusion. Despite widespread reported behaviour change among Montreal IDUs, a substantial amount of high risk sexual and injection behaviour continues. Programs should be developed to address IDUs in each stage of change: IDUs who have no desire to change their behaviours, IDUs who require assistance maintaining behaviour changes and IDUs who have adopted low risk practises and are approaching long term maintenance of behaviour change.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Franco, Eduardo</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440v62c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hh52p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m127t"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Base cation immobilization in the stem of some hardwoods of southern Québec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Boucher, Patricia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this study was to investigate K, Ca, and Mg immobilization in the stem of species typical of the hardwood forest of southern Quebec. The species examined included American basswood, sugar maple, and white ash from a rich site, and American beech, red oak, and red maple from a poor site. Firstly, rates of immobilization were evaluated over a time span of 40 years. Higher rates of immobilization in the wood only were generally observed on the rich site. Sugar maple immobilized Ca at an elevated rate during 1978--1997, in comparison to the other species on site. In the case of Ca for white ash, and Ca and Mg for red oak, a low wood element concentration and a high rate of growth was associated with a low rate of immobilization. Mean annual immobilization rates on a whole stem basis were also determined for the life of the tree. These results suggest that American basswood and red oak immobilize significant amounts of Mg and Ca in their bark, respectively. In a second study, concentrations of K, Ca, and Mg across the radial section of the stem (heartwood, transitional, sapwood, and bark) were determined. In a majority of cases, the bark was highest in concentration of base cations. Whereas, for the woody portion of the stem, concentrations were generally highest in the heartwood.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cote, Benoit</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jt08f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m127t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hardwoods -- Québec (Province) -- Nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Forest soils -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Morgan Arboretum</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nutrient cycles -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avx021h11s"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of substitutional elements on dynamic strain aging in steel</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cunningham, Sandra, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Distinct serrations had been observed on the stress-strain curves of various steels tested previously at high temperatures (950--1100°C) at McGill University. An explanation proposed for this behavior was that dynamic strain aging (DSA), caused by the presence of substitutional elements, was taking place. To investigate the possibility that the jerky flow was caused by an interaction between dislocations and substitutional elements, the conditions of temperature and strain rate under which serrated yielding had previously been observed were explored. In addition, some of the same material was utilized in the testing. Much of the previous work on DSA in steel has focused on the effect of interstitials, namely, carbon and nitrogen, rather than that of substitutional elements. These studies have been conducted in the blue brittle region (i.e. 100--400°C), where the diffusivity of the interstitial elements is sufficiently rapid for them to keep up with the moving dislocations. However, for substitutional elements to obtain enough mobility to induce DSA, the temperature range must be significantly higher. The effect of substitutional elements on DSA in steel was examined in torsion and, although numerous tests were formulated and carried out in an attempt to gather evidence for this phenomenon, no firm data for the occurrence of DSA were obtained. Further experiments and analysis will be required to gain a better understanding of the behavior of DSA at elevated temperatures, particularly for the case where dynamic recrystallization is taking place. A testing method might then be devised that could make the effect of DSA more evident.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jonas, J.

The size and number of inclusions are counted via the electric sensing zone (ESZ) or Coulter Counter principle applied to molten metal. Thus far, it has been impossible to discriminate these inclusions one from the other using this technique. Particle discrimination can be accomplished by analyzing the in-coming signals. The McGill LiMCA unit has been upgraded with Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technology. Therefore, ESZ voltage signals generated by the LiMCA probe are digitized and then treated using DSP. The start slope, end slope, maximum voltage height, time to reach the maximum voltage, total signal duration time, start time and end time of each pulse are calculated via. DSP technology for each voltage pulse. These seven parameters can be used to discriminate and characterize one signal from the next. Once the LiMCA signals have been digitized and reduced they are analyzed to verify if certain signals have distinguishable characteristics. Particles discrimination was carried out in water modelling tests. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guthrie, R. I.

ACS has the ability to solve a set of equations. Also, it is able to answer user queries and reveal the reasoning process used in obtaining a solution. With respect to inconsistencies, the system is able to verify the data provided by the user. In the case of inconsistencies, the user is notified as to the appropriate course of action to be taken. The system has the ability to permit the user to investigate other design possibilities and find alternate design paths.

It begins by setting this definition in the context of his time, which was an era of rapid change, and in the context of the criticisms leveled at al-Shat&amp;dotbelow;ibi by those who accused him of introducing innovations into the law. His analysis of bid`a was written in response to this situation and it was also an exercise in reformulating the concept on the basis of a strict legal methodology. Our investigation therefore includes a survey of the fundamental features of bid`a, defined by al-Shat&amp;dotbelow;ibi as having two aspects: al-bid`a al-h&amp;dotbelow;aqiqiyya (real bid`a) and al-bid`a al-id&amp;dotbelow;afiyya (relative bid`a). This taxonomy will in turn be considered in the light of his division of the Shari`a into `ibadat (religious matters) and ` adiyyat (mundane matters). Furthermore, it also analyzes al-Shat&amp;dotbelow;ibi's distinction between the basic character of mas&amp;dotbelow;lah&amp;dotbelow;a mursala and istih&amp;dotbelow;san on the one hand, and bid`a on the other. Having concluded that the latter is essentially prohibited, he was concerned to validate the first two, which he realized were vital sources of the law. The investigation will also investigate al-Shat&amp;dotbelow;ibi's rejection of the possibility that bid`a could be divided into good and bad, and his objection to assigning the five legal values to this concept.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hallaq, Wael B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xb472.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s667n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islamic law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shāṭibī, Ibrāhīm ibn Mūsá, d. 1388</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0c483m065"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Northern periphery : long-term Inuit-European and -Euroamerican intersocietal interaction in the central Canadian Arctic</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Johnson, Donald S.

This geographical area encompasses the traditional ranges of the contiguous Copper, Netsilik and Iglulik Inuit societies. Specifically, the study analyzes and discusses changes in intra- and intergroup material trade networks and social relations resulting from indirect and direct contact with the developing capitalist world-system. Through the application of world-system theory and methodology, it is shown that indirect contact in the form of the acquisition of material trade items was a gradual, though constant, process that had a considerable impact on the cultural development of these societies. Both indirect and direct contact were greatly accelerated during the 19th century, increasing the rate of cultural change, and, by the early 20th century, ultimately culminating in the articulation of the Copper, Netsilik and Iglulik Inuit societies within the modern capitalist world-system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Savelle, James M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wh90z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483m065</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Inuit -- Nunavut -- Cultural assimilation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inuit -- Nunavut -- Antiquities</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inuit -- Nunavut -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gv522"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>"A field of Golgotha" and the "Loosing out of Satan" : Protestantism and the intertextuality in Shakespeare's 1-3 Henry VI and John Foxe's Acts &amp; Monuments</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Leitch, Rory</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Challenging the currently orthodox "New Historicist" conception of Shakespeare's English history plays as a kind of "radically secular" historiography, this thesis attempts to show how Shakespeare's first chronicle play, 1--3HenryVI, was informed by and expressive of Protestant providential historiography. By comparing the texts of the plays with Foxe's Acts and Monuments, the central text of Elizabethan Protestant historiography, the author attempts to show how Foxe's influential history functioned both as an important source for Shakespeare's view of the past in 1--3HenryVI and as a vital intertext in terms of which the play would have been construed as history by Shakespeare's audience. At the heart of this source/intertext dynamic is the figure of Antichrist, a powerful historiographical symbol in Foxe which is adumbrated in Shakespeare's dramaturgy, giving the plays' representation of the violence of the Wars of the Roses era an ineluctably providential character. Having traced the Foxeian intertext in Shakespeare's play, the author concludes by suggesting that, again contrary to the secularizing bent of much recent "New Historicist" criticism, it is precisely because 1--3HenryVI spoke the language of Protestant providential history that Shakespeare's play was significantly "political" in its original late-Elizabethan historical moment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lieblein, Leanore</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nw52n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gv522</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616.

Given its array of cultures and languages, its geographical vastness, and its proximity to the United States, Canada's identity crisis has become a fixture in the discourse of Canadian nationalism. Recently, a private organization, The Charles R. Bronfman Foundation, funded the production of the Heritage Minutes series. These dramatized historical moments were designed to impart upon Canadians a common set of historical images and meanings upon which Canadians could construct a sense of national identity. This thesis examines the ways in which the nation has been historically defined within the context of Canada through the Heritage Minutes . By means of discourse analysis, this thesis will elaborate on the dominant and recessive thematic patterns utilized by the CRB, to demonstrate that the Heritage Minutes construct a meta-narrative of Canadian nationalism and identity through six recurring themes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Robinson, Gertrude</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wm179.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xt68s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada -- In mass media</dc:subject><dc:subject>National characteristics, Canadian</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rk057"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Student perceptions of gender equity in high school coeducational and single-sex physical education classes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Armeni, Virginia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to enrich our understanding of gender equity issues in coeducational and single-sex physical education classes. Student and teacher perceptions were examined through interviews, written descriptions of critical incidents, field observations and document analysis. The participants included 65 students in coeducational grade eight classes, 84 students in single-sex grade nine classes, and the physical education teacher from a suburban high school. Through inductive analysis and constant comparison, themes emerged regarding the teacher's equity strategies, advantages and disadvantages of coeducational and single-sex classes, and students' roles in perpetuating and rejecting gender stereotypes. Aware of gender issues, the teacher generally maintained an equitable atmosphere, but he also played a role in perpetuating gender stereotypes. Students identified peer interaction, increased competition, and challenge as positive aspects of coeducational classes. Girls often favored the atmosphere of girls' classes, and high ability boys preferred the competition in boys' classes. Classes were seen as based on a male norm, and boys often dominated. Student beliefs and behaviors indicated that they both rejected and perpetuated gender stereotypes. Ability levels appeared to play an important role in student perceptions. This research illustrates the need for a continued emphasis on gender sensitive physical education programs to enhance both girls' and boys' experiences.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Downey, Margaret</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n5190.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rk057</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Coeducation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex discrimination -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physical education and training -- Study and teaching (Secondary) -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43p010m"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The rebirth of the shophouse in the modern age with a special reference to Montreal</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Xu, Ti, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines a typical Montreal housing type---the multiplex, a time-tested model to accommodate commercial activities.

Chapter 2 reviews the history of shophouses in Montreal from 1642, when the city was founded, through to the Industrial Age. Chapter 3 begins with a general discussion of the multiplex dwelling---its basic forms, types, and architectural character. The second section of this chapter introduces the case studies. These trace the interior transformations of four multiplexes, all of which were built in the first decade of this century. In Chapter 4 and 5, the spatial changes identified and collected in all four cases are closely examined. All existing changes have been photographed. These changes are associated with the specific needs of each shop; the four cases were tested, and proved the building's adaptable nature to different degrees. All changes are further regrouped and analyzed according to four important elements---bearing members, non-bearing members, service, and circulation.

Moreover, by comparing the assessment of a h&amp;dotbelow;adith transmitter found in Tahdhib al-Tahdhib to that of other works---such as Kitab al-Jarh&amp;dotbelow; wa al-Ta`dil by Ibn Abi H&amp;dotbelow;atim al-Razi and Mizan al-I'tidal by al-Dhahabi---we hope to appraise the position of Ibn H&amp;dotbelow;ajar al-`Asqalani within h&amp;dotbelow;adith criticism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ormsby, Eric L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xk45v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483m07f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ibn Ḥajar al-ʻAsqalānī, Aḥmad ibn ʻAlī, 1372-1449.

H. Hasjim Asj'ari in 1926, in the development of Indonesian nationalism, elaborating in particular on its activities under the New Order (1980s and 1990s) after it implemented the Pancasila as the sole foundation for all political parties, social and mass organizations. As the largest Muslim traditionalist organization in Indonesia, the NU was originally founded to protect and promote the interests of Muslim traditionalists, who loyally followed the school of Ahlu al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah. The doctrines of the latter school are shown here to have largely influenced the organization's dealings both culturally, religiously and politically. In order to fully understand the NUs view of Indonesian nationalism, this thesis examines the three phases of Indonesian nationalism, beginning with the rise of this organization, its involvement in the formation of the Indonesian state and its ideology, and the period after the country stipulated the sole foundation of Pancasila. It is from these three phases of Indonesian nationalism that this thesis shows the significance role played by the NU during the 1980s and 1990s. The NUs example in accepting the Pancasila as its sole basis served as an inspiration to other social and mass organizations in the country and represented one of its major contributions to the nation's welfare.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rw40k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cj48x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Indonesia -- Politics and government -- 1966-1998</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam and politics -- Indonesia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Indonesia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79408010w"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Construction of a targeting vector for the analysis of the neuroendocrine function of chromogranin A</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Feldstein, Richard, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Parathyroid hormone and Chromogranin A (CgA), are the two major secreted products of the parathyroid gland. CgA is the major member of the granin family of acidic glycoproteins which are expressed in all endocrine and neural cells. Granins are thought to play a role in secretory granule formation and targeting of peptide hormones and neurotransmitters to granules of the secretory pathway. The CgA gene is a single copy gene, that has been characterized in human, bovine, mouse and rat where it was found to be composed of eight exons with conserved exon-intron boundaries. It has been found that several of the peptides encoded within the CgA molecule inhibit hormone and neurotransmitter release in either an autocrine or paracrine fashion. The biosynthesis of CgA is regulated by many different factors, including steroid hormones and a number of intracellular messenger systems, such as intracellular calcium, Protein Kinase A (PKA) and Protein Kinase C (PKC). Although a number of studies have been conducted on CgA, the precise role that it plays in neuroendocrine function remains unclear. Therefore, to gain insight into the important functions of CgA, this project involved isolation of the CgA gene through screening of a mouse strain genomic DNA library. Restriction fragments of the phage DNA were subcloned into a plasmid vector, sequenced and were confirmed to contain seven of the eight exons of the mouse CgA gene including, eight kilobases of the 5' flanking region. Through the sequence information obtained, a targeting vector was constructed containing approximately nine kilobases of genomic DNA. This vector in turn, will be used for the functional disruption of the CgA gene in mice through the technique of homologous recombination.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendy, Geoff N.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429c179.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79408010w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7h149r55m"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of astroglial iron in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Frankel, Dov</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The excessive deposition of redox-active iron has been amply documented in the basal ganglia of subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). Yet, much remains to be learned regarding the cellular and subcellular distribution of this metal and the precise role(s) it plays in the pathogenesis of PD. Cysteamine (CSH) induces the appearance of peroxidase-positive cytoplasmic granules in cultured neonatal rat astroglia which are identical to glial inclusions that progressively accumulate in the aging subcortical brain. These inclusions are derived from degenerate mitochondria which sequester iron and other transition metals before undergoing fusion with lysosomes in an autophagic process. Dr. Schipper has previously demonstrated that iron-mediated peroxidase activity in these cells is capable of oxidizing dopamine and other catechols to potentially neurotoxic semiquinone radicals (Schipper et al., 1991). In the present study, we co-cultured PC12 cells, a catecholamine-secreting cell line, atop confluent monolayers of either CSH pre-treated (iron-enriched) or control neonatal rat astroglia. We observed that the PC12 cells grown on the surface of iron enriched (senescent-like) astroglia were far more susceptible to dopamine/H2O 2-related killing than PC12 cells cultured atop control glial substrata. Augmented killing of PC12 cells in the former paradigm was inhibited by the antioxidants, ascorbate, melatonin or resveratrol implicating a free radical mechanism of action. The aging-associated accumulation of iron in mitochondria of subcortical astroglia may facilitate the oxidation of dopamine to neurotoxic free radical intermediates and thereby predispose the senescent nervous system to PD and other neurodegenerative afflictions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schipper, Hyman M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n0587.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149r55m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82k914q"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Canada and the nuclear arms race : a case study in unilateral self-restraint</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sisto, Joseph M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to determine why Canada, a state that pioneered nuclear technology, and that faced, throughout the Cold War, the Soviet threat to its national security, consistently rejected any opportunity to convert its latent nuclear capability into an indigenous nuclear weapons program. The answer to this research question must address a number of explicit contradictions in Canadian foreign policy. While Canada has, on the one hand, rejected the bomb, it has, on the other hand, pursued defence and industrial policies based upon intimate involvement with nuclear weapons. Moreover, Canada espouses, on the one hand, a clearly realpolitik view of international relations, while, on the other hand, committing to forging for itself a role as an international peace broker. It becomes, therefore, unclear which theory of international relations could adequately explain this dualism in Canadian policy formulation. This thesis argues that power and self-interest are not separable from Canada's decision to reject the bomb, and that by modifying certain precepts of realist theory, we may substantiate the hypotheses that two disincentives to proliferation are at the root of Canada's policies: first, Canada's political and geographical proximity to the United States and thus a credible U.S. nuclear umbrella; and second, prestige, where Canada interpreted both the rejection of its nuclear option and its internationalist policies as a sign of independence vis-a-vis the United States.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Paul, T.

An attempt has been made to search for the inherent order in the seemingly "unplanned" squatter settlements. Spatial order, an expression of the socio-cultural milieu of the residents, needs multi-disciplinary analysis. The research methodology selected encompasses the principles of spatial (morphological) analysis and the field work techniques of ethnography. Data has been collected empirically from the field. Since the proposed research uses a case-study research design, analysis and interpretation is qualitative rather than quantitative. The study has been conducted in a trial and error, sequential process. Various models and methods have been used in this search for spatial order. The process tested the hypothesis at different levels---geometric, functional and social, and finally documented the residents' viewpoints. This was deemed essential as the residents are the actual generators of this built environment. The first two levels could not verify the hypothesis on their own accord but when overlaid by the third component, all three added-up to indicate the existence of order in squatter settlements.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Vikram</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mh379.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62fb253</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Space (Architecture)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Squatter settlements -- India -- New Delhi</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vj63p"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Sound towers : evoking the musical dimension of Gaudí</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hollett, Philip</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Antoni Gaudi was the architect of the Sagrada Familia from 1883 to 1926. Over this period of time he prepared the overall design and supervised the construction of the Nativity facade. One of Gaudi's main design objectives was to include tubular bells in the tall slender towers. It has been said that through his sound studies for these bells, Gaudi developed his musical sentiments most fully. Through the sound of bells, accompanied by song, he imagined a festive environment around the temple. These considerations might be seen as reflecting the overall spirit of the time, as Catalonia was in effect experiencing a cultural rebirth known as the Renaixenca . Originating with the call of the poets, this time of exuberant growth for Catalonia was one that was built upon the rebirth of language. As a result, language through poetry continued to be celebrated throughout the century, particularly through annual poetic contests called the Jocs Florals. This paper studies the facade of the Nativity as a expression of this culturally exuberant time by exploring how the Jocs Florals, and poetry in general, may have played a role in shaping its form and sound. The study also acknowledges the fact that Gaudi's inspiration for his design was derived from symbolism associated with the Catholic liturgy. The result is architecture that might be described as a union of religious and cultural symbolism, yet ultimately its festive expression is a poetic one. As such, the Sagrada Familia might be described as a celebration that is a call to gathering.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55md75c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vj63p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Jocs Florals de Barcelona</dc:subject><dc:subject>Church architecture -- Spain -- Barcelona</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gaudí, Antoni, 1852-1926 -- Themes, motives</dc:subject><dc:subject>Templo Expiatorio de la Sagrada Familia (Barcelona, Spain)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music in art</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahx11xg76h"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Bridging the gaps in services for families of children with attention-deficithyperactivity disorder : examining the effectiveness of parent management training groups in a rural community</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ross, Constance M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Differing opinions among the disciplines involved in the diagnosis and treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have left parents navigating in a maze of divergent languages, explanations, and treatment recommendations.

Eight children were interviewed and the results indicated that the program is well received by the children but the F.A.N. Club needs to be more systemic in its approach to include more school and parental involvement. In addition, further focus is needed on the role of bystanders to bullying. The F.A.N.

Leonardo's search is ultimately one of understanding the underlying causes that animate the universe and through analogy, his work and his world hold together. Central to my investigation of the continuity of Leonardo's analogical mode of thinking and making, are questions pertaining to the body, architecture and representation.

There are many problems that have been solved from the information theoretic perspective; yet remain open from the coding point of view. In particular, it is known what the optimum achievable performance of a certain system is, yet no practical coding scheme that achieves the optimal performance is known. This thesis is concerned with two such source coding problems: the Slepian-Wolf problem and the Wyner-Ziv problem. This thesis also investigates the related source coding problems of data compression and noise robust data compression. A unified framework, based on the parallel concatenation of trellis structured codes (turbo codes) is applied and shown to perform well in all cases. This represents a break with traditional source coding techniques in that the code is fixed-length to fixed-length. As such, it is a probabilistic coding technique. An explicit joint design of the parallel concatenated codes, based on conditions rooted in information theory, is presented. The codes thus designed are intimately related to Latin squares and are therefore named Latin Square Based Codes. As opposed to the vast majority of the existing literature on turbo codes, these codes perform data compression and are designed jointly. Furthermore, they are non-binary, non-linear, non-systematic and non-symmetric. In all the above cases, near Shannon limit performance is observed. For data compression as applied to binary memoryless sources, the scheme achieves reliable communication at a rate only 7.5% above the entropy of the source. A similar result is shown for the Slepian-Wolf problem. Noise robust compression is shown to be as close as 1.11 dB from capacity for AWGN channels while coding for the Wyner-Ziv problem is as close as 1.1 dB from the rate-distortion function.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bajcsy, Jan</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c942z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qr52j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jq679"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Third generation mobile communications : capacity of a time-division duplex code-division multiple access cellular system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Parent, Marc-Antoine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis describes the work done in evaluating the capacity of a multi-service third generation (3G) wireless communication system based on the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UNITS). More specifically, the study presented in these pages examines the Time Division Duplex (TDD) paradigm supported by the 3G Partnership Project (3GPP). The goal is to establish the probability that a new connection attempt be successful as a function of the instantaneous load on the network. The sought capacity is evaluated with the help of an analytical model and a simulation tool. Both tools used a so-called system-level approach. The model and the simulator were developed based on 3GPP's standard and available data from link-level simulations. Some of the significant results presented are: (1) A maximum of around 7 to 9 orthogonal codes can be used per timeslot. (2) A UMTS TDD CDMA system should be used in pico- and micro-cellular environments in order to support efficient data transmissions. (3) The multicode interference is often wrongfully neglected in capacity studies. (4) Capacity is downlink interference-limited, even with a modest MUD efficiency.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sampath, Venkatesh</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x098k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jq679</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
