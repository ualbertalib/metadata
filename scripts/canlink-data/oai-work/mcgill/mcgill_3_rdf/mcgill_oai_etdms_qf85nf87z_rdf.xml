H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is an increasing interest among Plant Pathologists to explore, more fully, the nature of parasitism. This interest lies in obtaining a clear understanding of the host-parasite relationship. The emphasis is placed on the physiological mechanisms involved which enables the plant pathogenic organisms to effect entry into the host body and to assimilate the available nutrients, to tolerate or overcome the resistance of the host and to induce disease in the host by their metabolic products or toxins. The host-parasite relationship of the common scab disease of potatoes, caused by Streptomyces scabies (Thaxt.) Waksman and Henrici, presents many features of parasitism which would be interesting to explore as far as the physiological mechanisms are concerned.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Coulson, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xd39s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nf87z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plant Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
