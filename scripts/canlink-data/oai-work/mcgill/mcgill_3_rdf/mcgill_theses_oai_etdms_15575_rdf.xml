It is undertaken with a view to learn of the factors that might have some bearing on why these particular men have become dependent on an institution of this nature. In addition, the writer will survey other existing services available in Canada for the homeless and consider how these services meet the needs of these men. As described in this study, a "homeless man" will denote one who is not attached to a family group in the community in which he is residing, even though members of his family might be living in the same area. Seldom is he willing or able to sustain regular employment, with the result that he has either a marginal income or a complete lack of funds.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Younge, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xd22m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514np85s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qg70w"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The impact of the St. Lawrence Seaway on the port of Montreal</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Slack, Brian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>1959, the year of the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, marked the end of an era for the port of Montreal. For the first time in the history of navigation on the St. Lawrence River large ocean vessels gained access to the Great Lakes, and the port of Montreal was no longer the head of ocean navigation for large ocean ships. This study analyses the impact of these recent changes on the port of Montreal, and examines the new role of the port in changed patterns of navigation on the St. Lawrence River.

The stationary contact results are consistent with earlier work and are used as preliminary data for the moving contact case. All stationary contacts were superconducting at low currents when the members themselves were superconducting. Two types of contacts were found; one whose abrupt resistance transition is accompanied by hysteresis, and the other whose transition is gradual. The difference may be connected with the properties of the contact surface. Moving contacts between superconducting lead brushes and a rotating lead cylinder exhibited resistance whose magnitude was 10^-3 of the normal conduction resistance. The speed of rotation, current and temperature were varied. Consideration of effects which could cause the resistance led to the conclusion that the contact resistance is small because only a thin layer of oxide becomes normal as a result of mechanical deformation of the contact surfaces.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Farnell, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36v204j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602449d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electrical Engineering</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930c178h"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Inflammation and repair in rabbits fed atherogenic diets</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Silver, Malcolm.

In spite of many descriptions, and many personal views as to the origin of cancer in the following centuries, little came but mere speculation.

The elucidation of the mechanism and significance of ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone) induced depletion of ascorbic acid is still a major problem in adrenocortical physiology. Ascorbic acid occurs in two forms, one being the oxidation product of the ether. Both forms are biologically active. They are water soluble, insoluble in organic solvents, and unstable when exposed to oxygen, light, alkalies and certain metals. The most prominent chemical property of ascorbic acid is its ready oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid, which is catalyzed by small concentrations of metal ions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quastel, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687m73c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qw34v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akw52jc42q"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A preliminary study of parasitism in grasshoppers in southwestern Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sharma, Ravindra.

The methylene carbon atom of the glycine molecule also contributes significantly to the one carbon pool. Thus, although structurally the simplest amino acid, the metabolism of glycine presents a complex picture.

Sometimes the French Revolution is used to demarcate the beginning of a fourth period, that of recent history. Whatever the merits or demerit of this classification may be, it is convenient for us to use it, because it coincides nicely with a division which we wish to make in the history of thought. The end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of modern times saw the emergence of a force, the concept of which has played an important role in the theology of the last forty years or so.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McLelland, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494c827.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z444d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Divinity</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj430814p"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The role of aviation in the domestic freight transportation system of the United States</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rickards, Anthony.

An analysis of the air freight industry made in the context of the total domestic freight transportation system, such as the analysis contained in this thesis, has, to my best belief, not been undertaken before. In order to achieve the first of the two objectives of the thesis - that of indicating the present position of the air freight industry - all United states domestic surface media of transportation are examined, so that their major characteristics may be understood.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Armstrong, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xj377.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430814p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55zc21q"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics and Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>China’s national interest: a comparison of nationalist and communist views</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Richardson, Ann.

The definition of the 'National Interest varies among Western theorists. Generally speaking, the 'National Interest’ may be termed the driving force of international politics, the essential framework for the definition of state objectives and the conduct of policy. A leading theorist, Hans J. Morgenthau, explains that the controversy which surrounds the concept of the 'National Interest' has its; roots in the two different schools of thought, “utopianism” and "realism”.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brecher, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dw88g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55zc21q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics and Political Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43p169h"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Synthesis and reactions of 4, 4-dialkylated steroids</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Richardson, Keith.

By analogy with the cholesteryl series one might expect that solvolysis of 4, 4-dimethylcholesteryl 3 B-esters would yield the corresponding 3 A, 5-cyclo steroids of similar configuration at C6. The existence of such a compound, however, still awaits positive confirmation. Because of our interest in 4-alkylated steroids and especially on account of recent investigations on the solvolysis of 4, 4-dimethylcholesteryl tosylate, it was considered essential to synthesize the 3 A,5-cyclo-4, 4- dimethylcholestan-6 B-ol in an unambiguous fashion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Just, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r9677148.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43p169h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hk09t"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of electron interactions on cyclotron resonance</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Richardson, John. R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of the work is to determine the effects of electron interactions on the power absorbed by a dense electron gas under the conditions of cyclotron resonance. This is accomplished by computing the transverse, complex conductivities within self-consistent field theory. A relaxation time is used to express the effects of scattering on the conductivities. The validity of this assumption is discussed fully. The power absorption is calculated for the propagation of microwaves along the direction of the uniform magnetic field in a finite sample of the gas. The result is round to be much more dependent on the shape of the body than in the weak field case as calculated by Dresselhaus, Kip and Kittel. The resulting magnetic-plasma resonance is investigated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wallace, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999b195.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hk09t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f4799"><ual:graduationDate>1963</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of the male genitalia of the crickets belonging to the subfamily Gryllinae (Orthoptera: Ensifera: Grylloidea) and its relationship to taxonomy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Randell, Robert.

The description of new species of field crickets has for the past thirty years been based at least in part on the structure of the male genitalia and most of the new species have had at least the epiphallic portion of their genitalia figured. This practice, unfortunately, has not included the type species of the various genera and furthermore has not been universally applied to the genera in the subfamily. The logical beginning for a revision would thus be a survey of the genitalia of the type species of the various genera.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kevan, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w327n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f4799</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Entomology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
