The clincial method which he has applied in this fie1d is analyzed and tentatively accepted as a new approach to child study. The central hypothesis of the author is that child thought is qualitatively different from that of the adult: he calls this thought "ego-centric". The author postulates that ego-centric thought is incommunicable because it is not socialized and that it evolves in accordance with the growing need into the logical thought of the adult. This ego-centrism results in transductive reasoning, intellectual and moral realism and pre-causality. These doctrines are found to be biased by the conditions of the experiment, the choice of subjects and the emphasis on the social factor at the expense of physical experience.
