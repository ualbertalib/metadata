Those metrics which are relatively successful in  meeting this challenge require two-dimensional look-up tables and algorithm tuning,  and are quite challenging to implement. The simpler explicit metrics only work well  on so-called far nodes, which are characterized by all-pole frequency  responses. In this thesis, we first review an existing delay metric for  wires and then try to extend it to arbitrary tree networks. Thorough tests  demonstrate it to be accurate and efficient for wires only. We then present an  explicit delay metric for dealing with near nodes in RC interconnect, which is based  on the first three moments of the impulse response. An accurate model for the delay  to the internal node of a two-pole one-zero RC circuit serves as the core of the new  metric. Since no simplifying assumption is made in the model, it returns excellent  accuracy at the internal node in any two-node RC circuit, no matter how close the  internal node is to the source. The delay at near nodes in arbitrary RC trees is  then computed by order reduction to a two-pole system using the first three moments  of the impulse response. A significant further improvement in accuracy is achieved  by correcting for the skewness of the impulse response. In parallel, a simple  explicit metric is introduced for predicting the delay to far nodes, where order  reduction is not needed. This is based on the first moment of the node of interest  and the second moment of the slowest node. Furthermore a simple criterion is derived  for distinguishing near nodes from far nodes. Tests on RC models of wires and trees  demonstrate that the combination of these two metrics is accurate within 2% for far  nodes and within 5% for near nodes with delays which are as much as an order of  magnitude smaller than that of the slowest node.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jk95w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q694d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9w032362g"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of concrete strength on the response of ductile shear walls</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liu, Hui, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A ductile shear wall must be capable of undergoing significant  plastic deformations, while absorbing significant energy without brittle failures  when subjected to a major earthquake. In general, the sectional ductility is  improved with increasing amounts of compressive reinforcement, increasing the  concrete compressive strength and the ultimate concrete strain. This research  program evaluated the reversed cyclic loading responses of two reinforced concrete  ductile flexural shear walls that were designed in accordance with the Canadian  Standards Association Standard A23.3-04. The two shear walls were designed with an  identical amount and detailing of longitudinal and confining reinforcement but with  different concrete strengths (35 MPa and 70 MPa, respectively). The purpose was to  investigate the influence of concrete strength on the reversed cyclic loading  behaviour, including the overall response, shear capacity, deflection, displacement  ductility, and cumulative energy dissipation. The experimental results indicated that with the higher concrete  strength, the ductility, strength and energy absorption of the shear wall were  slightly increased.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vr490.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032362g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zb66k"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Joint synchronization and channel estimation for burst mode OFDM</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Freda, Martino</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  (OFDM) is known to be highly sensitive to synchronization errors at the receiver.  Inaccurate synchronization can increase channel estimation errors which further  degrade OFDM performance. While effective independent synchronization techniques  exist, performance gains can be expected by jointly estimating all synchronization  errors and channel parameters. The research presented in this thesis aims to improve the  performance of synchronization and channel estimation in burst mode OFDM systems by  employing the non-linear recursive least squares algorithm (NL-RLS) to perform joint  synchronization and channel estimation. This thesis presents two joint  synchronization and channel estimation algorithms. The joint  carrier-frequency-offset and channel estimation and compensation algorithm (CFOCE-C)  is first presented and possible applications are discussed. The Cramer Rao Lower  Bound (CRLB) is derived to evaluate the efficiency of the estimator by measurement  of its variance. Simulation is used to evaluate the advantage of the time domain  approach used by the CFOCE-C in a typical burst mode system and a 2 dB gain in  system performance is observed over an alternative joint frequency domain approach.  The sensitivity of the CFOCE-C algorithm to sampling frequency offset (SFO)  motivates the development of a second technique: the joint carrier-frequency-offset,  sampling-frequency-offset, and channel estimation and compensation algorithm  (CFOSFOCE-C). The variance of this estimator is also compared to the CRLB. A gain of  1.5 dB is observed in comparison to a joint estimation algorithm that uses a  frequency domain approach.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sw458.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zb66k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62f877f"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Use of fibres and headed bars in dapped end beams</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fu, Zhongchun, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The behaviour of dapped ends with high-performance concrete and  headed bars, together with the effects of fibres added to the concrete was  investigated. Two full-scale dapped end beams with four dapped ends were constructed  in this experimental programme. One half of each beam was cast without fibres while  the other half was constructed with concrete containing either steel fibres or  polypropylene fibres. The beams had a design concrete compressive strength of 60  MPa. Strut-and-tie models were used to predict the capacity of the dapped end beams.  Headed bars were used as the horizontal tension ties, and closed stirrups provided  the vertical tension ties. From the comparisons between the testing results and the  strut-and-tie model predictions, and the comparisons of the behaviour between the  end regions with and without fibres, it was concluded that: the strut-and-tie models  can be used as practical tools to predict the capacities of members with disturbed  regions; the presence of fibres significantly increased the shear capacity and  improved the ductility and crack control; the headed bars provided excellent  anchorage and confinement of the nodal zones.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x068.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f877f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apr76f406g"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Étudiants-maîtres et diversité : quelles expériences, attitudes et croyances?</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vallée, Jean-Sébastien</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents the results of a descriptive and  exploratory study conducted with eight student-teachers preparing to teach English  as a second language at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. The purpose of this  study was to explore the attitudes, experience and beliefs of the student-teachers  towards diversity (sexual, ethnic, linguistic, economic, religious, etc.). The  notion of intercultural education as promoted by the Quebec Ministry of Education  and elaborated by Fernand Ouellet (2002) was used as a theoretical  framework. Analysis of the qualitative data shows a misunderstanding of the  term intercultural education by the student-teachers, but a positive attitude  towards diversity. However, the participants of this study, when presented with  situations dealing with discrimination, do not know how to solve the problems. They  do not always fight homophobic discrimination, fearing complaints from parents or  the school principal, although they act to counter racist or sexist forms of  discrimination. Student-teachers tend to believe that a school teacher should not  express opinions in the classroom or participate in debates. Finally,  student-teachers expressed a number of criticisms towards the teaching program at  MGill University.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sg900.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f406g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Student teachers -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Attitudes</dc:subject><dc:subject>McGill University.

Results supported the  first hypothesis of no competence satisfaction differences between the groups under  mastery and performance climates. The second hypothesis that the introduction of  performance climate would increase risk taking and this would affect achievement  accomplishments and competence satisfaction was also supported. Nonetheless,  performance climate had a different effect on each ability group with regard to  achievement accomplishments. Specifically, performance climate undermined  achievement accomplishments for individuals with physical disabilities and  encouraged achievement accomplishments for peers without disabilities. Hence,  individuals with physical disabilities did not satisfy their need of competence in  the same manner as peers without disabilities in the performance climate. For those  with physical disabilities performance appears to be crucial, whereas for peers  without disabilities risk taking is essential.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558d862.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50ts23g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physical education for people with disabilities</dc:subject><dc:subject>Risk-taking (Psychology) in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physical education for children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Performance in children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903050w"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Chinese EFL teachers' perceptions of implementation of communicative language teaching at tertiary level</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Ping, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Communicative language teaching (CLT) has been extensively  discussed and researched, especially in an English as a second language (ESL)  context. Some literature has also explored the adaptation of CLT in English as a  foreign language (EFL) environments, such as in Asian countries like China. No  research, however, has been conducted with consideration given to a specific group  of teachers who teach non-English major students at the tertiary level in China. The  present study was designed to investigate Chinese university teachers' perception of  the implementation of CLT in non-English major programs in China. This study first differentiates ESL and EFL environments, and  then distinguishes the characteristics of CLT and of the traditional Chinese  teaching methodology. Second, this study examines how the implementation of CLT is  perceived by the university teachers of non-English major programs and whether there  exist some constraints that impede the implementation of CLT at the tertiary level  in China. The results show that the adaptation of CLT to the Chinese  context is welcomed by university teachers of non-English major programs. However,  in the implementation of CLT in the teaching of non-English major students, there  are difficulties arising from four directions, namely, the educational system, the  EFL context, the cultural tradition, and the students. The results suggest that only  by overcoming the difficulties from those four sources and by creating more  favorable conditions for the implementation of CLT can teachers of non-English major  programs in China implement CLT in their daily teaching practice.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278t598.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903050w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- China</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Chinese speakers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fc163"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Les voix de Vivier : langage harmonique, langage mélodique et langage imaginaire dans les dernières oeuvres de Claude Vivier</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Levesque, Patrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The five last vocal works of Claude Vivier: Lonely Child,  Bouchara, Prologue pour un Marco Polo, Wo bist Du Licht! and Trois airs pour un  opera imaginaire have in common different stylistic characteristics.

Here, I analyze, challenge, and ultimately move  beyond purely functional theories of personhood, which are necessarily exclusive in  their reduction of the human person to a mere demonstration of capacity (for  rationality, self-consciousness, suffering, or otherwise) that is inversely  proportional to neuropathology. Bringing to the fore important contributions from  both secular philosophical thought and the Abrahamic faith traditions, I argue that  functional perspectives neglect the psychosocial, spiritual, and biographical  dimensions of personhood, which must be described in reference to both historical  and concurrent life experiences. Accounting for these features requires the  promotion of social environments that are ideal for the maintenance or preservation  of this sense of "person" and calls for the treatment of patients with  dementia based on personhood and inherent dignity. My thesis, as an analysis of this debate in the  interdisciplinary field of bioethics, brings together philosophy, medicine, law, and  the Abrahamic faith traditions to establish guidelines toward a more integrative  definition of personhood in the context of the evolving and interactive experiences  of degenerative dementia.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr171x755.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h005t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Self</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dementia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atb09j621h"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Conducting gesture recognition, analysis and performance system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kolesnik, Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A number of conducting gesture analysis and performance systems  have been developed over the years.

Regulation of  the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors occurs through the exchange of  corepressor and coactivator complexes in a ligand-dependent manner. However, this  may not be the case for orphan nuclear receptors, including RORalpha. Instead,  RORalpha orphan nuclear receptor activity is modulated by Ca 2+/calmodulin-dependent  protein kinase IV (CAMKIV), through a yet undetermined mechanism, and RORalpha  itself regulates the expression of genes involved in the calcium signaling pathway.  In this study, we report that RORalpha transcriptional activity is modulated by  CaMKIV through direct phosphorylation of CIR, a novel nuclear receptor corepressor,  thereby influencing its interactions with RORalpha. CIR exhibits ligand-oblivious  and nuclear receptor AF-2 specific functional properties, similar to those of  previously characterized RORalpha corepressor Hr. In contrast, the corepressors CIR  and Hr display differential mechanisms of repression, comprising of HDAC-dependent  and independent pathways, respectively. Furthermore, the calcium-dependent  regulation of RORalpha transcriptional activity occuring through modulation of CIR  does not extend to Hr, illustrating corepressor specificity. Thus, the molecular  mechanisms governing active repression of RORalpha transcriptional activity involve  distinct repression and signal transduction pathways, representing a dual mode of  nuclear receptor regulation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d028d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440t005</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494904f"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Jongler avec les sens pour contenir l'absurde : modèles interprétatifs de parents d'enfant autiste d'origine haïtienne</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sigouin, Catherine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Autism, in the manner of any chronic infantile disease,  profoundly disturbs family life, generating a search for meaning.

These  so-called Heinrich Events (HEs) occurred with a typical period between 5 kyr and 10  kyr. During each HE, a significant amount of ice was discharged from the Laurentide  ice sheet into the North Atlantic. This input of freshwater through the melting of  icebergs is thought to have strongly reduced the strength of the Atlantic  thermohaline circulation. One theory for HEs is that they are due to an internal  oscillation of the ice sheet under constant forcing. This implies that past  multi-millennial scale climate variations in the North Atlantic region may have been  driven by variations in the Laurentide ice sheet and were not externally forced by  climate change or sea level variations. A second theory for HEs requires some  variable external forcing on an unstable ice sheet to produce a discharge  event. Using the 3-D ice sheet model of Marshall and Clarke (1997a,b),  which includes ice sheet dynamics and thermodynamics, the possibility of internal  oscillations within an ice sheet is verified and an analysis of the mechanisms  associated with these oscillations is performed. The bed topography and strain  heating are found to be critical for the formation and development of fast moving  ice streams, which lead to large iceberg calving. In addition, the calving  parameterization is found to be an important factor in the ability of the model to  periodically discharge large amounts of ice.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jp26v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn106z736</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Oceanography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36tz158"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La souris B7.2 transgénique: un modèle pour l'étude de l'homéostasie des lymphocytes B</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Paradis, Josée</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The B7.2 molecule, which is mainly expressed on  antigen-presenting cells, is well known to provide a costimulatory signal for the  initiation of antigen-specific T cell responses through its interaction with CD28  expressed on T cells. B7.2 also binds to CTLA-4 which, in contrast to CD28, is a  negative regulator of T cell activation. Normally, tightly regulated expression of  B7.2 ensures the transient availability of this costimulatory signal. Because  blockade of the CD28 pathway was able to inhibit the activation of self-reactive T  cells in several experimental models, it has been postulated that deregulated  expression of B7.2 on antigen-presenting cells may break self-tolerance and induce  systemic autoimmune diseases. From our study, we conclude that there are two mechanisms by  which B7.2/CD28 interaction leads to the depletion of B cells. One involves the  induction of a developmental arrest that can occur even in the presence of a  restricted TcR repertoire. The other involves an active process, which occurs only  in the presence of a polyclonal TcR repertoire. Thus, B7.2/CD28 interaction, in  addition to its critical role as a mediator of T cell proliferation in response to  foreign antigens, has a functional role in the regulation of B cell homeostasis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x093.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz158</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182k70d"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Peak effect, hall effect and vortex phases in FexNi₁-xZr₂ superconducting glasses</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lefebvre, Josianne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The mixed state of type II superconductors is an ideal medium  for the study of correlated systems since the density of vortices which penetrate  the sample, as well as the driving force, can be tuned such as to measure their  effects on correlations.

Here, we investigate the functions of three  such proteins---p73, p63 and XIAP---in cultured neonatal sympathetic neurons. p73  and p63 are members of the p53 family that exist in both full-length (TA) and  truncated (DeltaN) isoforms. First, we ask whether DeltaNp73 mediates sympathetic  neuron survival in p53-dependent and/or -independent fashions. Overexpression of  DeltaNp73 in sympathetic neurons withdrawn from NGF prevents upregulation of the p53  targets p21waf1 and Apaf-1, induction of the BH3-only protein BimEL, and cleavage of  the effector caspase-3. DeltaNp73 also promotes survival in p53-independent manner  by acting upstream of p53 to decrease JNK phosphorylation. Second, we ask whether  p63 functions as a pro-apoptotic molecule in a manner similar to that of p53. TAp63  levels markedly increase in sympathetic neurons withdrawn from NGF. Similar to p53,  TAp63 overexpression in neurons maintained in NGF upregulates p21waf1 and Apaf-1  levels, induces caspase-3 cleavage, and does not induce BimEL levels and JNK  phosphorylation. Third, we examine the role of the caspase inhibitor XIAP and ask  whether XIAP is a substrate of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. XIAP rescues NGF  withdrawal- and LY294002-induced apoptosis and promotes sympathetic neuron survival  cooperatively with Ras. In addition, Akt associates with XIAP and phosphorylates  XIAP at serine 87.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150j79s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w66344278</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahq37vp17v"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Inflation and quintessence in brane cosmology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hoover, Douglas A.

The development of vessel segmentation algorithms for PD  images is of general interest since this type of acquisition is widespread and is  entirely non-invasive. Whereas vessels are signaled by black blood contrast in such  images, extracting them is a challenge because other anatomical structures also  yield similar contrasts at their boundaries. In this thesis we present a novel multi-scale geometric flow for  segmenting vasculature from PD images which can also be applied to the easier cases  of MR angiography data or Gadolinium enhanced MRI. The key idea is to first apply  Frangi's vesselness measure [Frangi et al. (1998)] to find putative centerlines of  tubular structures along with their estimated radii. This multi-scale measure is  then distributed to create a vector field which is orthogonal to vessel boundaries  so that the flux maximizing flow algorithm of Vasilevskiy and Siddiqi (2002) can be  applied to recover them. We carry out a qualitative validation of the approach on  PD, MR angiography and Gadolinium enhanced MRI volumes and suggest a new way to  visualize the segmentations in 2D with masked projections. We also validate the  approach quantitatively on a data set consisting of PD, phase contrast (PC)  angiography and time of flight (TOF) angiography volumes, all obtained for the same  subject. A significant finding is that over 80% of the vasculature recovered in the  angiographic data sets is also recovered from the PD volume. Furthermore, over 25%  of the vasculature recovered from the PD volume is not detectable in the TOF  angiographic data. Thus, the technique can be used not only to improve upon results  obtained from angiographic data but also as an alternative when such data is not  available.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r6205.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b184s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b6652"><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Biomechanics of the foot and ankle during ice hockey skating</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dewan, Curt</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study describes the biomechanics of the foot and ankle  during the transitional and steady state skating strides using kinematic, kinetic,  and myoelectric measures.

Three acceleration strides and a constant velocity stride were  examined on ice. An electrogoniometer at the ankle was used to measure angular  displacement and velocity values. Myoelectric activation patterns were measured at  the vastus medialis, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and medial gastrocnemius of  the right lower limb. Kinetic pressure profiles were measured using piezo resistive  fabric sensors providing accurate pressure measurement within the narrow confines of  the skate boot-to-foot/ankle interface. Sixteen flexible piezo-resistive sensors  (1.2 cm x 1.8 cm x 0.2 cm thick) were taped to discrete anatomical surfaces of the  plantar, dorsal, medial and lateral surface of the foot, as well as to the posterior  aspect of heel and leg.

Infected mice manifested few such behaviours. Although both acquired the task, there  were substantial differences between infected and uninfected mice in their patterns  of task acquisition and execution. Although infected mice eventually reached  comparable levels of competency, higher cognitive behaviours which suggest  familiarity with the location of the platform, such as straight-line swimming,  appeared earlier among uninfected mice. Other orientation behaviours, such as  paddling and floating, occurred at higher levels among uninfected mice. These  behavioural differences are discussed in terms of their adaptive significance to the  survival of the host and the transmission of the parasite.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s1616741.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cd741</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Heligmosomatidae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice -- Behavior</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice -- Parasites</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn3011941"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Exploring the use of e-government services in social service settings</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Avigdor, Allan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>E-government services are rapidly becoming a permanent part of  the governing process the world over.
