The objective of the present study was to establish a methodology for identifying DNA markers which are associated with QTL in chickens using an alternative approach to the traditional linkage analysis. A systematic screening approach was designed to search a chicken liver cDNA library for clones which revealed polymorphisms associated with traits. In the first stage of the experiment, a total of 92 cDNA clones were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. About 33% and 22% of the clones revealed DNA polymorphisms at MspI and TaqI restriction sites, respectively. Subsequently, DNA polymorphisms which responded to selection were identified by comparing RFLP frequencies in divergently selected strains of chickens. About 60% of the RFLPs responded to selection for egg production traits and/or Marek's disease (MD) resistance. Trait associations of these RFLPs were then studied by selectively genotyping individuals at the extremes of trait distributions, followed by an analysis of individuals in the entire population and statistical evaluation. Finally, RFLP regions of DNA markers were characterized and PCR assays for rapid RFLP screening were developed. DNA markers in two genes were identified and characterized by this methodology. One was a marker in the chicken mitochondrial genome which arose from a nucleotide substitution (T to C) in the NADH subunit IV gene. Statistical analysis for typing random individual samples from the strains showed that this DNA polymorphism was associated with mature body weight and egg specific gravity which is a strong indicator for egg shell thickness. Other analyzed markers were located in the chicken mitochondrial phospho-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M). Using the cDNA of this gene as a probe, southern blotting revealed a highly polymorphic band pattern.

A home-built vacuum magnetic force microscope (MFM) was debugged. The electronic noise in the system was reduced to below the thermal cantilever noise and the microscope now operates at its theoretical maximum (thermally limited) sensitivity. Then, a new technique, magnetic dissipation imaging, was developed. It allows the imaging of variations of 10-17 W in dissipation with sub-100 nm resolution. A normal MFM image and a magnetic dissipation image can be acquired simultaneously on the same area of a sample. A theory was developed which correlates the dissipation with micromagnetic structures in domain walls. We consider the energy dissipation through coherent generation of phonons via magnetostriction induced by domain wall width oscillations. A quantitative agreement of theory with experiments for a 110 nm thick Co/Ni multi-layer and a 4 nm thick Co film samples was obtained. This theory predicts two new phenomena: a minimum drive force needed to cause wall width oscillations and wall width resonances. With the above mentioned microscope, magnetic domain structure, micromagnetic domain wall structure and the associated dissipation have been studied on several samples, including a 30 nm thick Ni80Fe20 patterned into 20 mum squares and a CoPtCr recording medium. The dissipation results show strong correlations with magnetic domain structure. In the Ni80 Fe20 sample, the dissipation signal shows pronounced maxima correlated with the domain wall positions. We suggest magnetoelastic losses and eddy current losses due to wall jumps are the origins of the dissipation. With an in-situ magnetizing stage, we also studied magnetization reversal processes and dissipation hysteresis in the Ni80Fe20 sample. Besides the nucleation and growth of reverse domains, the formation of a 360ยบ wall was observed. The CoPtCr sample shows different dissipation properties with both larger and smaller than average dissipation value observed in the transition regions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Grutter, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956h65q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cv732</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526f02b"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular genetics of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Janicic, Natasa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The concentration of extracellular ionized calcium (Ca2+ o) is the primary physiological regulator of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. The parathyroid gland has a special ability to sense extracellular the calcium concentration and the mechanism whereby this is achieved became clearer when a parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) was cloned and characterized. Inactivating mutations in the CASR gene have been identified as a cause of familial hypocalcemia hypercalcemia (FHH) and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT). The goal of this thesis was genetic analysis of several families affected with FHH and NSHPT. Initially, we studied two families from Nova Scotia expressing both FHH and NSHPT. In order to localize the mutant gene haplotype analysis was first carried out using genetic markers for chromosome region 3q11.2-24. The CASR gene sequence was screened for mutations by sequence analysis implemented on either cloned genomic DNA or direct sequencing of PCR product. By PCR amplification of CASR gene exons it was found that FHH individuals were heterozygous and NSHPT individuals were homozygous for an abnormally large exon 7 due to an insertion of an Alu-repetitive element at codon 876. Later, we studied a third family from the same region and found the same type of mutation. However, one individual from that family had one allele of an even larger size providing evidence for de novo expansion of an exonic Alu insertion mutation. This is the first report of an Alu sequence insertion in the CASR gene and one of the rare examples of this type of mutation being present in the protein coding region. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), human CASR gene was mapped to chromosome 3q13.3-21. By somatic cell hybrid analysis, the gene was localized to human chromosome 3 and rat chromosome 11. By interspecific backcross analysis, the Casr gene segregated with D16Mit4 on mouse chromosome 16. These findings extend our knowledge of the synteny conservation of human chromosome 3, rat chromosome 11 and mouse chromosome 16. The structural and functional consequences of the Alu insertion in exon 7 of the CASR gene were investigated. Stop signals are introduced in all reading frames within the Alu sequence, leading to a predicted shortened mutant protein. The effect of Alu insertion on transcription/translation was studied by protein truncation test (PTT). The Alu sequence was less efficiently transcribed due to stalling of the polymerase at the poly(T) tract. In vitro translation of the Alu transcript resulted in three truncated protein products whose sizes are consistent with the presence of predicted stop codons in all three reading frames. Western blot analysis was used to compare the expression of the mutant and the wild type receptor cDNA transiently transfected in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. The Alu mutant receptor had a molecular mass ~30kD smaller and showed decreased cell surface expression compared to the wild-type receptor. Interestingly, a CASR with a C-terminal truncation at residue 877 exhibited increased cell surface expression. This thesis contributes to a better understanding of molecular genetics of the CASR gene. Furthermore, structure-function studies of an Alu insertion mutation in the CASR protein coding region provides a novel insight into the effect of this mutation on the gene-expression processes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendy, G.

This was studied in rat hippocampal formation using the specific inhibitors of phosphatases I and 2A, calyculin A (Cal A) and okadaic acid (OKA). The first set of experiments demonstrated that treatment with OKA or Cal A reduced tissue ACh content, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, choline uptake and [3H] ACh synthesis in rat hippocampal formation, but spontaneous ACh release was not affected. Thus, it is clear that phosphatase activity plays a role in presynaptic central cholinergic nerve terminal function, particularly in the regulation of ACh synthesis. The mechanisms that regulate ACh transport activity and vesicle mobilization are not fully understood. Thus, the objective of the second study was to examine whether Cal A or OKA alter the subcellular distribution of ACh and explore the relationship between transmitter release and stores. Cal A and OKA depleted the occluded ACh of the P3 fraction but not the ACh contained in the cytoplasmic (S 3) fraction. Cal A and OKA reduced ACh of a monodispersed fraction (D) of synaptic vesicles, but other nerve terminal bound pools (E-F and G-H) were not so affected. K+-evoked ACh release was decreased in the presence of Cal A and OKA. This loss of ACh from synaptic vesicle fractions appeared not to result from a reduced ability to take up ACh: when tissue synthesized [3H] ACh from [3H] choline, the ratio of [3H] ACh in the S3 to P3 fractions was not much changed by Cal A or OKA, and the specific activity of ACh of the D fraction was not reduced disproportionately to that of cytosolic ACh. Therefore, Cal A and OKA appear to produce selective depletion of tissue ACh in a sub-population of synaptic vesicles, suggesting that phosphatases play a role in ACh compartmentation. The third series of experiments investigated the effects of Cal A and OKA on the cytosolic., ionically-bound, and membranous forms of ChAT. Enzyme activity, measured by radioenzymatic assay and enzyme amount quantitated by ELISA in each of these subfractions, showed parallel changes. The findings reported in this thesis strongly implicate the serine/threonine phosphatases I and 2A in the modulation of cholinergic nerve terminal function, particularly on ACh synthesis. Thus, the phosphatase inhibitors are useful tools to add to the repertoire of neurochemical and pharmacological approaches used to investigate cholinergic mechanisms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gauthier, Serge</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Collier, Brian</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rg234.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386m15w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053h83x"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Primer tRNALys3 incorporation, genomic placement and initiation of reverse transcription in human immunodeficiency virus Type 1</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Huang, Yue, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>My project involves investigating the mechanisms used to selectively package primer tRNALys3 during HIV-1 assembly, place it onto the primer binding site(PBS) on the viral RNA genome, and allow this tRNA to initiate reverse transcription. My basic experimental approach has been to transfect COS7 cells with wild type or mutant HVI-1 proviral DNA and determine the effect of these mutations upon the above processes. I have shown that in the mature virion, there are approximately 8 molecules of tRNALys3, and 12 molecules tRNALys1,2, and that the viral tRNALys3/tRNALys1,2 ratio reflects the cytoplasmic ratio. For example, when COS-7 cells are transfected with a plasmid containing both HIV-1 proviral DNA and a human tRNALys3 gene, the tRNALys3 content per virion (i.e., per 2 molecules genomic RNA) increases from 8 to 17 molecules, with a corresponding decrease in tRNALys1,2, to 3 molecules/virion. Prl60gag-pol is required for tRNALys3 packaging, and the RT sequences within this molecule probably contain a binding site for this tRNA. In this work, I have also provided evidence that nucleocapsid(NCp7) sequences within Pr55gag contribute to this binding site. This work indicates that a Prl60gag-pol/Pr55gag complex may be responsible for binding tRNALys3 and carrying it into the virion. We next showed that the genomic placement of tRNALys3 onto the PBS occurs independently of precursor proteolysis, but is inhibited by mutations in the basic amino acid sequences flanking the first Cys-His box in NCp7, mutations which do not inhibit packaging of either tRNA Lys3 or Pr160gag-pol into Pr55gag particles. This indicates a role for one or both of protein precursors in the placement. A U5 stem/A-rich loop structure just upstream of the PBS has been implicated in causing the short initiation complexes seen in the mature virion, and causing reverse transcription to move from a low to a high processivity. In agreement with this, we found that the deletion of the A-rich loop immediately upstream of the PBS, while not affecting tRNALys3 placement, resulted in the synthesis of longer elongation products using low RT processivity, with a corresponding decrease in the presence of unextended and 2 base extended tRNALys3 Four A's in the A-rich loop have been implicated in interacting with the USUU sequence in the anticodon loop of tRNALys3 .

F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Since the early 1990s, it has been all but impossible to ignore the media hype prompted by the sudden advent and appeal of the computer-mediated communications context. However, as alarmist tales of alleged online dangers have moved to the fore, legislators in some jurisdictions have called for new regulatory measures to limit its communicative potential. This dissertation undertakes a socio-historical analysis of this phenomenon. Influenced by the historical perspective of Ithiel de Sola Pool (1983), its initial goal is to illuminate how the introduction of print, common carrier and broadcast-based communications technologies has prompted key social actors to advocate, or create, particular regulatory regimes and practices. This will show how certain political, economic and moral interests and agendas have shaped the uses and development of previous communications technologies. Following this analysis, an examination of the rhetoric underlying contemporary efforts to regulate the online medium is presented. This will bring focus to how new communications technologies are defying traditional, territorially-bound models of regulation and control. Thereafter, a case study of the communicative roles and relationships that have informed present-day regulatory initiatives is undertaken. Guided by theoretical and methodological insights culled from the sociological literature on moral panics, it uses relevant print and online media sources to expose specific meaning-making practices that triggered the outbreak of an international panic over the alleged pervasiveness of online pornography in mid-1995. This will highlight the extent to which the mainstream media---via representations of the interests and agendas of actors and groups from a range of societal sectors---have influenced new communications policy debates. In addition, it will demonstrate how the online medium's unique communicative potential has empowered some of its users to reinterpret and counter the agend</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Robinson, Gertrude J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t8076.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cc611</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Telematics -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Telematics -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Communication -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g912d"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structural and functional analysis of genes involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Di Flumeri, Celestino</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The heme biosynthetic pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae comprises eight enzymatic steps. The HEM6 gene encodes uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, a cytoplasmic enzyme catalyzing the fifth step of heme biosynthesis. HEM6 was cloned by complementation of a heme auxotrophic yeast strain containing a hem6 mutant allele. An open reading frame of 1086 nucleotides encoding a protein of 362 amino acids was obtained by sequence analysis. Expression of HEM6 was found to be induced two-fold by lactate, a non-fermentable carbon source, but not regulated by heme. Site-directed mutagenesis of a conserved cysteine residue implicated in catalysis demonstrated that cysteine 52 of the yeast enzyme is not essential for enzymatic activity. The enzyme catalyzing the sixth step in the heme biosynthetic pathway, coproporphyrinogen oxidase, is encoded by the HEM13 gene. Transcription of HEM13 is regulated by the product of the pathway, heme. In the presence of heme, transcription of the ROX1 gene is induced, and the ROX1 protein represses HEM13 transcription. ROX1 is a member of the High Mobility Group (HMG) family of DNA-binding proteins. In order to define the mechanism of repression of HEM13 by ROX1 we synthesized ROX1 protein and derivatives either in vitro or in Escherichia coli as fusions to the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) protein. All ROX1 derivatives containing intact HMG domains were capable of specific binding to DNA sequences from the HEM13 promoter region. In contrast, ROX1 proteins which contained deletions within the HMG domain were no longer capable of binding to DNA. In addition, ROX1 was capable of oligomerization, and the amino-terminal 100 amino acids of ROX1 which constitutes the HMG domain was required for oligomerization as well as for DNA-binding. The HEM13 promoter contains five possible operator consensus sequences postulated to be binding sites for ROX1. We showed that ROX1 binds to all five sites with differential affinity and that this binding occurs primarily via minor groove contacts. In vivo repression was examined by deletion of the five operator sites, either individually or in combination. Three of the operator sites were shown to act in an additive manner in bringing about repression of HEM13 and a fourth site appeared to be active only when all other operator sites were intact. A random PCR-based selection procedure used to select ROX1 binding sites predicted the optimal ROX1 binding site to consist of the consensus sequence (A/T)TT(T/G)TT. Finally, a preliminary analysis of the ROX1 protein suggested that the region of ROX1 responsible for repression is located within the carboxy-terminus of the protein. This region of ROX1 may be required for interaction with the general repressor complex SSN6/TUP1. Chromosomal disruption of either of these two genes resulted in derepression of HEM13 expression in a ROX1 wild type strain. Therefore, repression of HEM13 is brought about by multiple regulatory factors interacting at various cis-acting elements within the HEM13 non-coding sequences.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Acheson, Nicholas H.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Keng, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rj90t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g912d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nj902"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Variational inequalities with the analytic center cutting plane method</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Denault, M. (Michel)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis concerns the solution of variational inequalities (VIs) with analytic center cutting plane methods (ACCPMs). A convex feasibility problem reformulation of the variational inequality is used; this reformulation applies to VIs defined with pseudo-monotone, single-valued mappings or with maximal monotone, multi-valued mappings. Two cutting plane methods are presented: the first is based on linear cuts while the second uses quadratic cuts. The first method, ACCPM-VI (linear cuts), requires mapping evaluations but no Jacobian evaluations; in fact, no differentiability assumption is needed. The cuts are placed at approximate analytic centers that are tracked with infeasible primal-dual Newton steps. Linear equality constraints may be present in the definition of the VI's set of reference, and are treated explicitly. The set of reference is assumed to be polyhedral, or is convex and iteratively approximated by polyhedra. Alongside of the sequence of analytic centers, another sequence of points is generated, based on convex combinations of the analytic centers. This latter sequence is observed to converge to a solution much faster than the former sequence. The second method, ACCPM-VI (quadratic cuts), has cuts based on both mapping evaluations and Jacobian evaluations. The use of such a richer information set allows cuts that guide more accurately the sequence of analytic centers towards a solution. Mappings are assumed to be strongly monotone. However, Jacobian approximations, relying only on mapping evaluations, are observed to work very well in practice, so that differentiability of the mappings may not be required. There are two versions of the ACCPM-VI (quadratic cuts), that differ in the way a new analytic center is reached after the introduction of a cut. One version uses a curvilinear search followed by dual Newton centering steps. The search entails a full eigenvector-eigenvalue decomposition of a dense matrix of the order of the number of variables. The other version uses two line searches, primal-dual Newton steps, but no eigenvector-eigenvalue decomposition. The algorithms described in this thesis were implemented in the M ATLAB environment. Numerical tests were performed on a variety of problems, some new and some traditional applications of variational inequalities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goffin, J.-L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v7204.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nj902</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Variational inequalities (Mathematics)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axs55md58q"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Interactive realism : a study in the metaphors, models, and poetics of Cyberspace</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Downes, Daniel M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis explores the materiality of communication environment in Cyberspace illustrating both the problem of disembodied rationalism and the benefits of emphasizing the phenomenological sense of presence in virtual spaces. Interactive realism is offered as an approach to explain how our sense of embodied existence is supported and threatened in a technologically mediated situation. Language and other artifacts are tools with which we build social reality. In particular, metaphors are the rink between language and other, non-linguistic skills that shape our sense of self and reality. The metaphors of the computer as an electronic brain and of the networked computer as an electronic frontier serve as unconscious, cognitive models that guide our interactions with the world. Objects also work as models to embody ways of thinking about the world. It will be argued that social construction involves a sedimentation of language and a naturalization of the constructed environment. I argue that perception, as the bodily foundation of experience, involves a somatagnosis or body-knowledge, and that this knowledge is influenced by the particular devices we use to represent images of the world. The affective communities of Cyberspace are rule-governed communicative assemblies. Cyber-communities provide examples of the ways the body threatens and supports group formation and maintenance on the Internet . Cyberspace highlights the process of construction and sedimentation through which we construct the social world. In the construction of symbolic embodiments Cyberspace presents the paradox of places that encourage emplacement and disembodiment. Disembodied spaces are utopian in nature. Such Digkopian places abstract us from the world. Heterotopian spaces illustrate playful experiments. Such materializations of metaphors and ideas dramatize the ways we model the world and build it.

It is well documented that certain variants are closely related to milk production, milk composition and physico-chemical properties of milk such as heat stability and coagulation properties during cheesemaking. So far, all the genetic variants have been characterized by various electrophoretic methods. Therefore, only variants involving differences in net charges could be identified. Silent variants are the results of amino acid substitutions or deletions which do not accompany charge differences and hence remain undetected by conventional electrophoretic methods. The objective of the present project is to develop proper methodology to identify and characterize silent variants of milk proteins based on hydrophobic properties of amino acids. Individual caseins were isolated from 635 milk samples by anion-exchange chromatography and their electrophoretic phenotype was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under alkaline and acidic conditions. Trypsin hydrolysis of alphas1-casein, beta-casein and kappa-casein followed by reversed-phase HPLC was performed to identify possible mutations causing changes in hydrophobicities of amino acids. Among 627 alphas1-casein BB, 415 kappa-casein AA, 158 beta-casein A1A1 and 128 beta-casein A2A 2 according to electrophoresis, it was possible to find 25, 11, 16 and 7 samples respectively as potential silent variants. Further analysis of the aberrant peptides from alphas1-casein BB, kappa-casein AA and beta-casein A2A2 by mass spectrometry did not confirm the existence of silent variants; whereas analysis of aberrant peptide from beta-casein A1A1 revealed a mutation resulting in an increase of 16 Da.

All facets of Reconstructionist liturgy are molded to reflect and convey the movement's Jewish ideology. As such, much insight is gained by analyzing the full texts of the Reconstructionist prayerbooks, including translations, editors' notes, interpretive versions, supplementary readings, commentary, rubrics and layout. The first Reconstructionist liturgies (1941--1963) were edited primarily by the movement's founder, Mordecai M. Kaplan, and were fashioned to mirror his understanding of modern belief, moral sense and aesthetic taste. Kaplan believed that only a text edited with these values in mind would succeed in returning American Jews to synagogue life. Sixty percent of Kaplan's Sabbath Prayer Book was devoted to supplementary readings, which strove to foster a positive view of the world and to motivate the quest for personal and collective salvation. For Kaplan, ethical living and a sense of the world's essential goodness constituted the essence of religious faith and life, and he believed that this was not sufficiently articulated in traditional prayer. The inauguration of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in 1968 led to the transference of movement leadership from Kaplan's followers to a younger generation born after World War Two. This generational shift necessitated and facilitated the creation of the new Reconstructionist prayerbook series, Kol Haneshamah (1989--). While Reconstructionist liturgy continues to forward a fundamentally Kaplanian theology, it is less committed than was Kaplan to the position that all creedal formulations whose literal truth is rejected be excised from the text. Kol Haneshamah testifies to the movement's current openness to mystic paths of spiritual awakening and communing with the divine, and to its greater interest in cultivating and exploring the affective realm of human consciousness. Inclusivity, ecological responsibility, lay empowerment, and the creation of non-sexist terminology for addressing God and humanity have become primary Reconstructionist concerns. An examination of Reform, Conservative and Jewish Renewal liturgy indicates that, while many of the developments evident in contemporary Reconstructionist liturgy are mirrored in other branches of American non-Orthodox Judaism, Reconstructionist prayer remains a unique rite.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levy, B.

The exact electrophysiologic mechanism of TdP is under intense investigation. To study the mechanisms and characteristics of TdP requires an animal model in which the arrhythmia occurs at a high incidence, predictably, reproducibly and resembles the characteristics of the clinical arrhythmia. We have developed such a model in the isolated rabbit heart (chapter II). This model is based on our earlier work showing that in isolated ventricular preparations from the rabbit heart, class III drugs, such as d-sotalol induce a greater increase in action potential duration in Purkinje fibers than in ventricular muscle, resulting in generation of early afterdepolarization-dependent triggered activity in Purkinje fibers and their subsequent propagation to muscle as extra beats (chapter 1). Studies in the whole heart suggested that the initiating beats of d-sotalol induced TdP have a subendocardial origin whereas later beats could be generated by reentry in muscle with disparate monophasic action potential durations (chapter II). The evidence presented in these studies was inconclusive because of the limited number of recording sites. To further clarify the relative contributions of impulse formation in the conducting system and reentry in muscle, we performed epicardial mapping using a sock electrode array to fit the rabbit heart. In addition plunge wires were used to record unipolar electrograms from the endocardial surface. The epicardial and endocardial electrograms were used to measure activation times as well as activation recovery intervals, a measure of local repolarization intervals. Using this technique in our TdP model, we were able to show that the generation of singlet beats and the first beats of couplets, triplets and TdP are due to the same mechanism---ie, a focal mechanism, arising in the ventricular specialized conducting system in a context of incr</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sagyniok, B.

Infant mortality rates among the Dani are above two hundred and fifty deaths per thousand live births and birth rates are low. To these patterns of infant survival and growth the Dani consistently ascribe complex meaning. Drawing from anthropological research conducted in 1994--1995 in the Baliem valley, this dissertation demonstrates that indigenous meanings about the infant body and assessments of infant health link the infant to political relations within polygynous families, to antagonistic gender relations, and to affiliations with powerful ancestor spirits. Gender relations play a prominent role in explanations about infants. When an infant dies, parents explain the death in ways that reflect the lower social status of women in relation to men. A study of sex ratios during the first year of life and biased use of health services by gender of the infant suggest that the Dani may generate and validate cultural patterns of gender inequality during the earliest months of life. Infants also play an important role in national politics. In Indonesia's attempts to assimilate indigenous peoples into the country's economic development agenda, the infant appears in health promotions as a member of a contrived ideal family. These national cultural models, grounded in a concern with population control, translate into an applied health agenda for infants that has little impact on the mortality rates of the very young in Dani society. The infant, though mute, is a powerful figure at the center of many social and political relations. The richness of meaning attributed to infants in the Baliem valley suggests that further research is needed to correct lacunae in anthropological theory about one of life's key social figures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lock, Margaret</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w152k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73px75f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dani (New Guinea people) -- Social life and customs</dc:subject><dc:subject>Infant health services -- Indonesia -- Papua</dc:subject><dc:subject>Infants -- Mortality -- Indonesia -- Papua</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35tb169"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the complexity of vertex and facet enumeration for convex polytopes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bremner, David D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Every convex polytope is both the intersection of a finite set of halfspaces and the convex hull of a finite vertex set. Transforming from the halfspaces (vertices, respectively) to the vertices (halfspaces, respectively) is called vertex enumeration (facet enumeration, respectively). It is an open problem whether there is an algorithm for these two problems polynomial in the input and the output size. For each of the known methods, this thesis develops a characterization of what constitutes an easy or difficult input. Example families of polytopes are presented that show that none of the known methods will yield a polynomial algorithm. On the other hand, a family of polytopes difficult for one class of algorithms can (sometimes) be easily solvable for another class of algorithms; the characterizations given here can be used to guide a choice of algorithms. Similarly, although the general problems of vertex and facet enumeration are equivalent by the duality of convex polytopes, for fixed polytope family and algorithm, one of these directions can be much easier than the other. This thesis presents a new class of algorithms that use the easy direction as an oracle to solve the seemingly difficult direction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Avis, D.

Three studies examining functional categories in the grammatical development of bilingual and second language children were conducted in order to address these questions. Study 1 investigates potential interference between the developing grammars of three French-English bilingual children. Naturalistic production data were collected from the children at six month intervals between approximately 2;0 and 3;0 years of age. The data were examined for the children's acquisition of INFL and these results were compared with extant findings for monolingual French and English speaking children. The results indicate that these bilingual children showed no evidence of transfer, acceleration. or delay in acquisition and support the hypothesis that their grammars are acquired autonomously and like those of monolinguals. The principle focus of Study 2 is an investigation of the continuity debate on functional category acquisition through an analysis of bilingual language development. In this study, the acquisition of INFL and DET by two French-English bilingual children was examined. These children were at an earlier stage of syntactic development than those in Study 1. Naturalistic production data were collected at two month intervals from the children, between approximately 2;0 to 3;0 years of age. The analyses indicate that INFL appeared at different times in the children's languages; whereas, DET appeared at the same time. The results are discussed with respect to the maturation and continuity views on the acquisition of functional categories. Because of the between-language discrepancy in the emergence of INFL, it is argued that these findings support a continuity perspective. It is also argued that bilingual first language acquisition provides unique evidence bearing on the continuity debate. The principal focus of Study 3 is also the continuity debate on functional category acquisition, but in contrast to Study 2, the children in this study were second language learners. In this study, the acquisition of features within INFL, agreement and tense, were examined separately to determine if they are acquired in sequence. Fifteen English-speaking learners of French and five monolingual francophone grade-mates. participated in the study. A structured oral interview was given annually to each of the children from grade one to grade three, and the transcripts were analysed for the use of tense and agreement. The results revealed that items encoding agreement emerged before items encoding tense in the second language learners' speech, suggesting that these features emerge in sequence in their grammars. The findings are interpreted with respect to three prevailing views on continuity in the acquisition of functional phrase structure in second language acquisition. It is argued that a weak continuity position is best supported by the data.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Genesee, Fred</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f302g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78td89z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bilingualism in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language acquisition</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x313m"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Vertical twin-roll caster : metal-mould heat transfer, solidification and product characterization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Parreiras Tavares, Roberto</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Near-net-shape casting technology is an important research area in the iron and steel industry today. Various processes for near-net-shape casting of steel are currently being developed around the world. of these processes, twin-roll casting represents a major area of concentration. The main issues concerning design and operation of twin-roll casters are the metal-mould heat transfer, the metal delivery system and their possible effects in the homogeneity of solid shell formation and characteristics of the strips. In the present work, interfacial heat fluxes between the roll and the solidifying metal have been evaluated in a pilot twin-roll caster used in the production of strips of low-carbon steel. This evaluation was based on an inverse heat transfer analysis and on readings of thermocouples inserted at different positions of the roll sleeve. The variation of the roll-melt interfacial heat fluxes with time exhibited two different patterns, with single and double peaks, depending on the casting conditions. These interfacial heat fluxes were not uniform across the roll width. This result was consistent with predictions of a fluid flow, heat transfer and solidification model. Computational fluid dynamics has been used to study different metal delivery systems for twin-roll casting. The in-house METFLO code has been adapted to simulate three-dimensional turbulent fluid flow, heat transfer and solidification in this type of process. The enthalpy-porosity technique was used to couple fluid flow and solidification phenomena. Different configurations for metal delivery systems have been studied. This study has been applied to a pilot caster with a roll radius of 0.30 m, producing steel strips with thicknesses ranging from 4 to 7 mm, at relatively low casting speeds in the range of 4 to 12 m/min. The numerical predictions indicated that an extended nozzle, covering the full width of the caster and with horizontal inlets in the direction of the rolls surfaces, seems to be the best alternative for delivering liquid steel into twin-roll casters. The solidification structures of strips produced in the pilot caster have also been studied. Their characteristics were analysed in terms of fluid flow and heat transfer inside the caster.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guthrie, Roderick I.

For many years, especially through studies of the correlation between methylation and gene silencing, researchers have tried to decipher this genomic subtext. Probably, a better way to achieve an understanding of DNA methylation is by first elucidating what regulates the apparatus responsible for its establishment. The DNA MeTase is the enzyme responsible for the catalysis of the DNA methylation reaction. It was therefore the objective of this thesis to define some of the factors that regulate the expression of this enzyme. Preceding work had described a promoter for the gene encoding the DNA MeTase. Recent data has prompted some to put in doubt the validity of this promoter. In the first part of this thesis I present a report which describes a selection between two possible promoters for the DNA MeTase gene effected by methylation in P19 cells. This data not only revalidates the previous description of the promoter, but adds a new level of possible control. In the second part, I elucidated the elements within the minimal region of the aforementioned promoter which are necessary for activity. The results illustrate that most of the sequence plays a role in the promoter function, and pRb is found to be able to modulate the activity in a novel cooperation between AP1 and Sp1 which is absolutely necessary for the promoter to fulfil its purpose. The third part of the thesis is based on an effort to investigate the generality of oncogenic control of DNA MeTase expression. The promoter was previously demonstrated to be responsive to the Ras/AP1 pathway leading to oncogenesis. Therefore, another oncogene, the SV40 large T antigen, known to act through a separate pathway from Ras and AP1, was transfected into BALB/c 3T3 cells in order to see how the expression of the DNA MeTase would be affected during this transformation. It was found that T antigen, through its actions on pRb, can induce DNA MeTase expression by stabilising its mRNA. These studies establish that the DNA MeTase is a nodal point of control by oncogenes and tumour suppressors which may need this enzyme in order to execute their effects on the cell.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Szyd, Moshe</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rw203.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qt79s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qn76r"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Truncation in second language acquisition</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Prรฉvost, Philippe, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, I argue that early child second language (L2) grammars allow truncation, on a par with proposals by Rizzi (1993/1994) and Haegeman (1995) for first language (L1) acquisition. This account (the Truncation Hypothesis) holds that Rizzi's (1994) Root Principle, according to which root declaratives are CPs, is initially underspecified in L2 systems (for processing reasons). This means that the root of main declaratives will not systematically be CP. Instead, different types of roots should be projected, such as CP, IP or VP, with VP underlying root infinitives. If one further assumes that functional categories are present in early grammars, the possibility of truncation can thus account for optionality of verb-movement and finiteness in early SLA, and more generally for why such categories seem to be optionally projected initially (Vainikka &amp; Young-Scholten, 1994; 1996; Eubank, 1992; 1993/1994; 1996). Predictions based on the Truncation Hypothesis were tested against longitudinal spontaneous production data from child and adult L2 learners. There were two child and two adult learners of L2 French (whose L1s were English and Arabic) and two child two adult learners of L2 German (native speakers of Romance pro-drop languages). The findings suggest that the distribution of finite and nonfinite verbs is structurally determined in L2 child grammar, i.e. tenseless verbs only appear when VP is the root, while finite verbs are found when functional categories are projected. This in turn means that children project truncated structures in early L2 acquisition. I argue that no other theory of the nature of early L2 grammars is able to account for the full range of properties of the child L2 data. The adult data are less conclusive concerning the possibility of truncation in adult L2 grammars. In particular, the learners seem to use infinitival markers as substitutes for finite inflections, which means that nonfinite verbs are found in contexts which are not predicted by the Truncation Hypothesis. The difference between the child and adult learners is attributed to problems that adults may have in mapping the syntactic and morphological systems (Lardiere, 1996), and not to a discrepancy in syntactic knowledge.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>White, Lydia</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zg28f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qn76r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children -- Language</dc:subject><dc:subject>Second language acquisition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Syntax</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w923p"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Nucleation and growth of spherulitic domain structure in semi-crystalline polymer thin films</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Huang, Tao, 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The grained patterns of semi-crystalline polymer thin films are of great scientific and industrial importance. They strongly affect polymer material properties specially the functionality in optical and electronic applications. The formation of grained pattern is the result of the nucleation-growth process. Nucleation and growth and their evolution have received much interest in the physics, materials and polymer science and engineering community. Typically domain growth associated with first order non-equilibrium phase transitions occurs via spinodal decomposition or nucleation and growth. However, the details of nucleation-growth are not well understood. The grain structure of semi-crystalline polymer systems has not been studied so far and was very poorly understood. In this work, systematic experiments have been carried out to elucidate the polymer spherulite growth mechanism, the spatio-temporal evolution of nucleation-growth and grain formation. We take spatial correlation into account and describe both geometrical and topological characteristics of the structural evolution in nucleation and growth. Physical models, computational and direct imaging methods have been developed and integrated for prediction and characterization of the microstructure formation in the semi-crystalline polymer thin films. Novel domain-spatial correlation functions and structure functions are proposed and evaluated with experimental data. Scaling relationships for nucleation-growth are explored with experimental data from both FFT imaging and the domain-spatial correlation function. Advanced grain structure analysis are proposed and evaluated in terms of the topological correlation and the grouping analysis of all the pertinent structural parameters taken together. Computational modeling based on the proposed envelop evolution equation associated with the light intensity equation and free energy equation predicts the nucleation-growth processes and grain patterns of polymer spherulitic structures. These results do not only enhance the understanding of dynamic mechanisms, but also provide reliable predictive techniques to optimize material functionality and process control.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rey, A.

The prevailing theme in earlier studies on contemporary Iran has been that of Islamic resurgence or the socio-political outcome of the 1979 Revolution to the neglect of other significant issues or intellectual challenges faced by religious modernists in both the pre- and post-revolutionary eras, such as that of the problematic of Islam and democracy. The present work therefore, considers the views of certain Iranian religious modernists of the last fifty years on the question of whether Islam is theoretically compatible or incompatible with democracy. To this end, we examine the main principles of democracy and critically evaluate their parallels among Islamic norms. Then, the democratic notions of seven major Iranian religio-political thinkers are analyzed and evaluated in depth. We also try to show the perception that these men had of democracy and of Islam, how they sought to bring the two into conformity, on what basis they structured their arguments, and how their attempt in this respect differed from that of their predecessors at the turn of the century. Among the contributions of the present work to the field is its attempt to present, for the first time, the post-revolutionary religious intellectual trend in Iran with particular reference to the problematic of Islam and democracy. This is largely accomplished through an analytical study of its leading figure, Abdulkarim Soroush. The result suggests that his attempt is an unprecedented one in terms of content, method and consequences. Indeed it is a watershed in Shi'ite religious modernism in general and in the debate over the compatibility of Islam with democracy, in particular.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Landolt, Hermann</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xw742.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77ft14t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Democracy -- Religious aspects -- Islam</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- Iran -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Democracy -- Iran</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam and state -- Iran</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30pv39f"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Lanthanum (III)-promoted clevage of RNA and cyclic nucleotides</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hurst, Phillip C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The RNA dimer ApA is rapidly cleaved in the presence of lanthanum(III) chloride yielding the products of transesterification and hydrolysis, 2 '-AMP, 3'-AMEP and adenosine. The intermediate 2,3'-cAMP does not accumulate. Under pseudo-first-order conditions (approximately 100-fold excess lanthanum(III) chloride) the half-life for ApA cleavage is only 13 seconds. The potentiometric titration, pH-rate profile and dependence upon lanthanum(IIII) chloride concentration support a penta-mu-hydroxo dilanthanum species as the active species. The kinetic isotope effect of 1.9 and a one-proton inventory indicate that the 2'-hydroxyl deprotonation is not concerted with the nucleophilic attack. It is proposed that a rapid equilibrium proton transfer occurs between the 2'-hydroxyl and a bridging hydroxo prior to the nucleophilic attack and rate-determining intramolecular general acid catalyzed breakdown of the phosphorane to products. It is proposed that the general acid is a bound water, formed from the protonation of the bridging hydroxo. Lanthanum(III) ion was found to be among the best of the trivalent lanthanides for promoting ApA cleavage, contrary to literature reports. The proposed lanthanide dimer mechanism, which is consistent with the behavior of the other lanthanides, easily explains this. The lanthanum(III) dimer was also found to be highly reactive towards the DNA model compound bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate and the cyclic nucleotides 3',5'-cAMP and 2',3'-cAMP, providing half-lives of 12s, 9min and 340ms respectively. The results were consistent with a bound mu-hydroxo as the nucleophile. The results for the ApA and cyclic nucleotides reactions are faster than any reported for synthetic catalysts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chin, Jik</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jd05h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv39f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht52f"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Airline labour law : a study of certain labour law rules in international air transport</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Huang, Chu Cheng, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines problems related to particular labor laws currently applied in international air transport. This analysis is framed within the context of scholarly theory and judicial practice arising from various regimes of labor law governing industrial injury, the individual contract of employment, labor-management relations, and fair treatment in the civil aviation industry. A critical survey of labor regulations operating in the international air transport industry is provided through commentary on the principles formulated by judicial decisions and the theories which underlie their reasoning, helping to clarify both substantive and procedural labor laws affecting international air transport. A critical analysis of different categories of statutory labor law governing international air transport is also provided to assess the validity of commonly-erected conflict of labor law rules, thereby revealing the inadequacy of the single rule principle in view of the unique and perplexing regulatory interests which are inherent in aviation activity. The divergence between domestic labor statutes and Treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation or bilateral air transport agreements also adds a more subtle aspect to the problems explored.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Micheal</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xg625.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht52f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Industrial and Labor Relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0c483k964"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Chromium atom routes to 2-vinylpyridine polymers and composites</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Deakin, Laura</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The reaction between atomic chromium and neat 2-vinylpyridine leads to the polymerization of the monomer, forming a polymer glass. The product of the rapid polymerization of neat monomer is atactic poly(2-vinylpyridine) in which the chromium has been incorporated as a complex. From cyclic voltammetry and electronic absorption studies, it was proposed that the chromium forms a neutral complex with a severely distorted octahedral geometry and consists of a formally Cr2+ metal center. The metal would then form an organometallic complex that is also bound via the nitrogen atom to pendant pyridine rings. The polymerization of 2-vinylpyridine in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran at -78ยฐC after reaction with chromium atoms leads to the formation of isotactic poly(2-vinylpyridine) with 50% mmm isotactic content from the 13C NMR spectrum. A coordination polymerization mechanism at a chromium metal center is proposed to occur during this reaction. Semicrystalline poly(2-vinylpyridine) was formed by annealing the isotactic polymer. The highest melting temperature reported for this polymer by differential scanning calorimetry was that observed with our sample at 217ยฐC. The atactic polymer from the rapid polymerization of neat monomer displayed a glass transition at 95ยฐC at a heating rate of 20ยฐC/minute, but did not melt. The morphology of the crystalline portions of the isotactic polymer after annealing consisted of spherulites displaying both "Maltese Cross" and banding under cross polarizers. Bis(eta6-1-methylnaphthalene)chromium was synthesized by the metal atom route. This complex was reacted with 2-vinylpyridine producing an atactic polymer glass from the resulting rapid polymerization of the monomer. This rapid polymerization was not inhibited by CO2 (g), but was quenched upon addition of hydroquinone. These results support a radical propagation mechanism that forms the polymer glass. A cryogenic vacuum station was designed and constructed for the low-temperature (15 K) electron paramagnetic resonance characterization of the reaction products from the cocondensation of atomic vanadium with 2-vinylpyridine. The cocondensation of benzene with vanadium atoms produced bis(eta6-benzene)vanadium that displayed the characteristic axial spectrum. No signal was observed for reactions between vanadium atoms and nitrogen heterocycles including 2,6-dimethylpyridine and 2-vinylpyridine. The incorporation of atomic iron and cobalt into 2-vinylpyridine following the addition of atomic chromium leads to a rapid polymerization reaction forming a polymer composite consisting of magnetic metal particles embedded in poly(2-vinylpyridine). The particle sizes were measured by transmission electron microscopy to be 1.5--22 nm in diameter. Magnetometry studies indicated the additional presence of smaller particles not identified by microscopy. The observation of a ferromagnetic resonance spectrum from the cobalt sample at X-band frequency is consistent with the cobalt particles having undergone an allotropic phase transition to the face-centered cubic phase. The addition of atomic Ni to the monomer did not yield metal particles, but instead, a nickel complex with the polymer matrix is formed. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of this polymeric material below 40 K are consistent with the Ni metal being present as an organometallic formally Ni1+ center in an octahedral complex bound to the polymer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Andrews, M.

It was found that alpha1AR-mediated inotropic effects and phosphatidylinositide (PI) turnover in neonatal and adult rat myocardium are mediated by different receptor subtypes. In neonatal rats, alpha 1AAR play a predominant role, although both alpha1AAR and alpha 1BAR are present in approximately equal amount as assayed by ligand binding; however, both alpha1AAR and alpha1BAR contribute to the positive inotropic response of adult rat myocardium. alpha1D AR are not functionally expressed in neonatal rat hearts but may play a minor role in adult myocardium. On the other hand, alpha1DAR are the predominant subtypes mediating the contractile response of the rat aorta to alpha1AR agonists. alpha1AR-mediated positive inotropic effect seems to be mediated by Ca2+-independent PKC isoforms (nPKC); the activation of Ca2+-dependent isoforms (cPKC) may inhibit the myocardial contraction. This inference is suggested by the following data: (1) phenylephrine-induced positive inotropic response was potentiated by DAG kinase inhibitor R59949, and inhibited by PKC inhibitor BIM but not by selective cPKC inhibitor G0 6976; (2) phenylephrine caused a translocation of nPKC (delta and epsilon) but not of cPKC(alpha); (3) simultaneous activation of both cPKC and nPKC by PDBu and selective activation of cPKC by thymeleatoxin resulted in negative inotropy, which was blocked by BIM as well as Go 6976. In neonatal hearts, inactivation of alpha1BAR by CEC potentiated alpha 1AAR-mediated effects on PKC activation, Ca2+ signaling and hypertrophy. Based on these data, I present a model describing a possible mechanism by which alpha1BAR antagonize alpha1AAR-mediated effects via negative coupling to Ca2+ channels. This antagonistic relationship between alpha1AAR and alpha1BAR may be required physiologically for normal alpha1AR-mediated myocardial responses.* *Please refer to dissertation for diagram.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Varma, Daya R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h356p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xt52w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zw20b"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Writing assessment : raters' definition of the rating task</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>DeRemer, Mary</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This descriptive case study examined how highly experienced raters do writing assessment, with a focus on how raters defined the task under two conditions: (1) as external raters and (2) as 'teacher as rater'. Three raters followed a think-aloud procedure as they evaluated student writing. The semantic structure of the think-aloud protocols was analyzed via the Task Independent Coding method. This analysis yielded a detailed representation of the objects and operations used by raters. The sequence which raters followed as they used these objects and operations was represented schematically by problem behavior graphs for each scoring decision made (N = 360). Analyses of the problem behavior graphs showed that raters defined the task in three very different ways: (1) by searching the rubric to make a match between their response to the text and the language of the scoring rubric (search task definition), (2) by assigning a score directly based on a quick general impression (simple recognition task definition), or (3) by analyzing the criteria prior to score assignment without considering alternative scores (complex recognition task definition). Raters differed in their use of task definitions when they evaluated the same texts. These results challenged current Writing assessment procedures which assume that raters Internalize a scoring rubric during training and make a direct match between the scoring rubric and text characteristics. In addition, these results indicated that task definition is related to individual characteristics of the rater rather than status as a rater (i.e., external rater or 'teacher as rater'). These findings are discussed in terms of the effect of different task definitions on the validity of writing assessment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bracewell, Robert J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fq650.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zw20b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Rhetoric -- Study and teaching</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
