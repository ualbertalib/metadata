These studies were carried out in vagotomized, chloralosed, artificially ventilated cats. Samples of the perfusates were collected at fixed intervals to analyze the cation concentrations. Perfusions with either CSF alone or low I-noradrenaline bitartrate (NA) concentrations produced no significant changes in either blood pressure, ECG or heart rate. Perfusions with higher concentrations of NA significantly increased blood pressure and K+ concentrations in the perfusates. Following pretreatment with various agents (reserpine, tranylcypromine, chlorpromazine and imipramine) similar NA perfusions induced no significant blood pressure changes and blocked the K+ effect seen with NA perfusions alone. Further pretreatment with chlorpromazine and imipramine significantly reduced blood pressure with a concomitant increase in Mg++ concentrations. It is concluded that centrally initiated noradrenaline blood pressure responses appear to involve K+ movements in the CNS and that the blood pressure responses following central pretreatment with chlorpromazine and imipramine involve Mg++ movements in the central nervous system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Melville, K.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v597w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784p79p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2227mt04j"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of oxygen at high pressure on the mechanical properties on pathogen free rat lungs</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hurley, Robert M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of OHP on pathogen-free rat lungs was studied. All experiments, except one at 5 ata., were done with OHP at 4 ata. Both lung-thorax and isolated lung preparations were used. No changes in the static pressure-volume curves were seen, indicating that the pulmonary alveolar surfactant had not changed at this point early in the evolution of pulmonary oxygen toxicity. Any surfactant effect must be small and terminal. A large decrease in resistance to air flow ten minutes after gasping in OHP at 4 ata, was seen, both in isolated and lungs in the intact chest. This decrease was not due to pressure alone, but is probably due to bronchodilatation, and is accompanied by a shift to the left of the static inflation pressure-volume curve of isolated lungs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rosenberg, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859j75x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mt04j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tq14x"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Demonstration of light cells in the rat thyroid gland by a histological technique</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hatcher, Norma H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Several histological techniques were evaluated to establish a simplified method for accurate light cell identification in rat thyroid glands. Glutaraldehyde fixation, celloidin-paraffin double embedding and PAS-haematoxylin staining revealed two distinct parenchymal cell populations. Chromophilic cells were follicular cells; the chromophobic population resembled light cells. To prove chromophobes were indeed light cells, comparisons were made between chromophobic cells in glutaraldehyde-fixed thyroid lobes and light cells in Bouin-fixed lobes (which were reliably identified by absence of colloid droplets after TSH stimulation). Chromophobes showed no colloid droplets after TSH stimulation, and the incidence of chromophobes in glutaraldehyde-fixed lobes was not significantly different from light cell incidence in Bouin-fixed lobes of the same glands.

Narrowed AVD with normal or elevated CI occurred in 11 of 20 patients studied. AVD correlated inversely with CI. In the dog given E. coli endotoxin, there was marked widening of the AVD and decrease in cardiac output. In patients with septic shock and dogs with endotoxic shock, arterial bleed lactate correlated inversely with V02 but did not correlate with pC02. In 5 patients with hypoxemia and septic shock, oxygen therapy did not improve V02. These findings in patients with septic shock imply cellular damage or arteriovenous shunting. In the dog with endotoxin shock, decreased V02 is due to inadequate blood flow.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacLean, L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f676k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000322n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sk48m"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of hypophysectomy on the induction of thyroid tumours in rats</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Goldberg, Michael R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hypophysectomized and sham-hypophysectomized rats were injected with 3 µc 131I or not and placed on a low iodine diet with or without an iodide supplement.

Experimental ascites was produced by partial constriction of supradiaphragmatic inferior vena cava. Thoracic duct to azygos vein shunt using an invagination anastomosis was performed on these ascitic animals. Ascitic animals showed a scanty excretion of urinary sodium and a poor response to acute salt loading. Establishing a patent thoracic duct to azygos vein shunt was associated with relief of ascites, increased urinary sodium excretion and a good natriuretic response to acute saline loading. Internal drainage of thoracic duct by decompressing the lymphatic system and lowering the interstitial hepatic pressure, relieves ascites and at the same time affects a possible hepatic mechanism responsible for salt regulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gutelius, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666786z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65vb78w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440w93k"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology and Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The political behavior of high school students in Trinidad</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Douglin, Junette J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigated the political behavior of High School students in Trinidad, and attempted to discover their political knowledge, beliefs and attitudes.

Although the study was formulated and analysed within the framework of "political socialization," it did not deal with how the students were socialized politically, but with what orientations they learned as a result of differential socialization. The results show that the students' political knowledge, level of participation and interest were, in general, relatively. low; they displayed no great national pride and only a mediocre "system affect." However, these findings were greatly modified when we controlled for the important factors of ethnicity and social class, as Negro and Indian students stood out in their political attitudes, and lower class students in their involvement.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Henry, F.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Laporte, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xh93c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440w93k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sociology and Anthropology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f4403"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The distribution and biosynthesis of the polypeptides of the hypothalamo-neuropypophyseal complex</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cheng, Kwong-Wah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Proteins of the posterior lobe, lower, middle and upper stalk and hypothalamus were compared after starch gel electrophoresis.

One hr. to 12 days thereafter, radioautographs were prepared of injected and control marrows, blood leucocyte concentrates, and lymphoid tissues. H3-thymidine was initially incorporated only by DNA synthesizing cells of the injected marrow, but by 5 hr. labelled lymphocytes appeared. These lymphocytes appeared in the blood at 25 hr., and rapidly migrated into lymphoid tissues, namely the spleen, mesenteric lymph node, and thymus. In these organs they were located first in the cortical areas (or red pulp in the spleen), but later were found in increasing numbers in the medullary areas (white pulp in the spleen). They disappeared from these organs after 5 - 6 days.

In total-IMS rats, metacorticoid hypertension could not be produced and renal hypertension was not sustained; the aortic sodium was not elevated. Methyldopa was effective in reducing the blood pressure in all groups (normotensive and hypertensive control and partial-IMS, and normotensive total-IMS rats) of animals. The hypotensive effect of methyldopa was not influenced by hexamethonium, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol or 3-hydroxybenzyloxyamine.

The concentration of inactive monomers varies in a predictable manner during the regeneration of rat liver. The pool of ribosomal monomers decreases to 40% that of normal rat liver within 19 hours of partial hepatectomy; by 42 hours, it has returned to within 70% of the resting level. Based on 2 and 4 hour labeling in vivo, there is a linear and inverse relationship between the rate of incorporation of label from orotic acid-6-14C into the RNA of the cytoplasmic ribosomes and the size of the inactive monomer pool. This relationship suggests that the two parameters are tightly coupled and that this coupling may represent an important regulatory mechanism for ribosome synthesis. This theory is further supported by the finding that inhibitors of protein biosynthesis which catalyze the conversion of polyribosomes to monomers, appear to reduce the incorporation of label from orotic acid-6- 14C into cytoplasmic ribosomes to a greater degree than those which maintain the integrity of the polyribosome.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webb, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408120b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tv69h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adz010t22g"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Normal human serum factors which block Prausnitz-Kustne sensitization with reagins</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Phills, James A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A study was made of factors in normal human sera which are able to block Prausnitz-Kustner (P-K) sensitization with ragweed reagins.

Fractions containing, YA globulin had minimal activity while YM fractions had little or no blocking activity. Heterogeneity of blocking factors in normal human sera was demonstrated by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation and Sephadex gel filtration.

Findings were related to laryngeal pathology and voice quality evaluations. From tape recordings of 14 English speaking subjects with a history of hoarseness, sample words judged as most hoarse or least hoarse were selected tor spectrographic analysis. Spectrograms were measured for aperiodicity, fundamental frequency and noise components. Results for most hoarse and least hoarse samples were compared. Aperiodicity increased significantly with severity of hoarseness, supporting the findings of Lieberman (1963) and Yanagihara (1962). Noise, its lower limit and hence disruptive effect upon vowel formants, was a significant factor, with a trend for greatest disruption of supporting harmonics, less for F2 and least for Fl. Other parameters examined were not significant. Findings were related to those of Yanagihara (1964) and modifications of his tour types suggested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Doehring, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x693m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g3242</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human Communications Disorder</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53wz98g"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of growth hormone and insulin on protein and nucleic acid synthesis in rat diaphragm</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Patey, Paul E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hemidiaphragms from normal and hypophysectomized rats were preincubated in a medium containing Actinomycin D and subsequently incubated in a medium containing Actinomycin D, 14C substrates, and with either Bovine Growth Hormone or insulin, or with no added hormone. Total proteins or total nucleic acids were subsequently isolated. Actinomycin D inhibited the incorporation of Adenine and Uridine into nucleic acids by more than 95 percent and inhibited Leucine incorporation into protein by about 45 percent. Insulin stimulated both protein synthesis and nucleic acid synthesis in the presence and absence of Actinomycin D. BGH stimulated protein synthesis but did not affect nucleic acid synthesis either in the presence or absence of Actinomycin D. It is concluded that the early in vitro Insulin and BGH stimulation of Leucine incorporation into protein is not dependent on a normal rate of nucleic acid synthesis, nor is the stimulation mediated by a marked increase of nucleic acid synthesis, but may be mediated by some action subsequent to RNA synthesis. Some additional investigations of the use of Actinomycin D in further elucidating the actions of Insulin and BGH are also reported.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rubinstein, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644v894.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53wz98g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Medicine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agt54kr21f"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Adrenal steroid biogenesis in various species of mice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ogunsua, Augustine O.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Incubation of adrenals from albino mice (Mus musculus albinus) with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or with deoxycorticosterone (DOC) resulted in an increased yield of corticosterone and of lipids with the mobility of 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OH-B) and aldosterone.

The only orientation that has been explicitly worked out prior to this thesis is that in which all the wave vectors are confined to the xy plane of uniaxial crystals. For this orientation, the two refractive indices involved are not direction dependent. In this thesis, the geometries for an interaction plane involving the optic axis in uniaxial crystals are calculated algebraically, first for an acoustic wave vector parallel and then perpendicular to the optic axis. In both cases one of the refractive indices is direction dependent. A computer program has also been written for numerically calculating the diffraction angles for all orientations and all directions of acoustic propagation in both uniaxial and biaxial crystals. A feature introduced in this program is that the crystal faces and their orientation with respect to other vectors is taken into account. Results obtained from the general, computer program agree with the results of all the three special cases and several geometries for biaxial crystals are presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Farnell, G.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pw98t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xm78m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3t945v11s"><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of sex hormones on gastric acid secretion of the guinea pig</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Katz, Sidney</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The possible role of male and female sex hormones in the regulation of gastric acid secretion , was studied in the guinea-pig.

Catecholamine determination was done by a fluorometric method. Catecholamine plasma levels are not related to portal hypertension. A liver clearance for nor-adrenaline was observed.
