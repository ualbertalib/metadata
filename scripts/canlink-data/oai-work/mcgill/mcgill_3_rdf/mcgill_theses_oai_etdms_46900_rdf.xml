The Calendars of McGill (1907-8 etc) make frequent mention of exercises "to counteract bad and harmful positions assumed during study hours." The second stageconsiders this subject as a prevention for these defects, while the third stage though not discarding the first two ideals, recognizes social, mental and moral values also arising through Physical Education. Nary Lyon, the founder of Mount Holyoke College recognized these values as early as 1837 when she said that "daily exercise held in those days a place not unlike athletics ... as it developed team work and the gift of leadership."

It was not until 1928, however, that the effect was observed experimentally by Prof. Sir C.V.Raman(2) in Calcutta. Monochromatic light was allowed to fall on a liquid, the scattered light being analysed by means of a spectograph and lines being found on the photographic plate which were due to frequencies not present in the primary or incident light. These lines are now known as "Raman lines" and the phenomenon itself as the "Raman Effect." [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

The oxidation of zinc ethyl is always accompanied by the deposition of a white precipitate,and this could not be observed.

Particular attention has been paid to the use of hydroxylatedsolvents in the presence of catalysts. The pioneer work was carried out by H. J. Rowley (1), who introduced the use of glycol and was able to extract about one half of the ligninby this means, though the recovery was appreciably less. It was shown (4) that the presence of glycol gives rise to false methoxyl values, and this solvent was therefore replaced by methyl alcohol (2, 3, 4).
