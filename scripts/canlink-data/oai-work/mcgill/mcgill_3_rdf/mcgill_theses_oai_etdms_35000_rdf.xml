With the collapse of communism and the dissolution of the former socialist block, Russian society entered a new stage of development, a stage of transformation towards a capitalist society with a democratic political system. In the course of this transformation, a new social group of Russian private capital owners has emerged. This research focuses on the political attitudes and political participation of Russian businessmen who own and manage their own capital. In particular, it examines the extent to which capital owners are willing to support the consolidation of the democratic regime in Russia. The analysis was based on interviews with 60 capital owners conducted in Moscow, the capital of Russia. I examine their attitudes towards democracy, democratic institutions and democratic procedures, along with their ways of political participation in correlation with the size and origin of the capital that the businessmen own, controlling for age, education and political past. The purpose of this analysis was to establish if structural conditions such as the size and origin of the capital might play a role in a capital owners' pro-liberal political orientation. Three main conclusions emerge from this research: (1) Russian capital owners are not uniformly pro-liberal in their political orientation, some businessmen being hostile to democratic political rule, and others having only limited pro-liberal political attitudes; (2) those capital owners who have pro-liberal political attitudes, limited or not, are the least likely to participate politically; (3) owners of small and medium sized independent type capital constitute the most pro-democratic group among Russian businessmen.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>van den Berg, Axel</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vs61g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010r842</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Russia (Federation) -- Economic conditions -- 1991-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Post-communism -- Russia (Federation)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Capitalism -- Russia (Federation)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A05741t496"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of the differential responses of male and female children to musical performance anxiety</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ryan, Charlene Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the responses of male and female children to musical performance anxiety. Twenty-six sixth-grade piano students (11 male, 15 female) performing in a piano recital served as subjects. Boys' and girls' heart rates, behaviour, performance quality, and anxiety levels were examined for possible differences between the genders. It was found that girls had substantially higher heart rates than boys immediately prior to performing, but that this difference was minimal while performing. Significantly more anxious behaviours were noted for both genders prior to performing than during performing, but boys had significantly more anxious behaviours than girls in both cases. Very little difference was noted in boys' anxiety scores (State-trait Anxiety Inventory for Children) between low, medium and high performance quality levels, however girls with moderate performance quality had much higher anxiety than did those with low and high quality performances. As well, girls were found to give significantly higher quality performances than boys. Correlation and regression analyses suggest that the genders respond differently to musical performance anxiety. These analyses were run on the data in three ways: All Children, Boys Only, and Girls Only. It was found that several relationships that emerged in the All Children analysis were driven by a strong relationship in a single gender, but were nearly absent, or in fact opposite, in the other.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Costa-Giomi, Eugenia</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430642f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741t496</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anxiety in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music -- Performance -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x310s"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Coalition structures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Diamantoudi, Effrosyni</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The first chapter introduces the topic of coalition structures and stresses its importance and impact on game theory. Additionally, it presents and motivates the significance of the three following chapters. The second chapter investigates how rational individuals partition themselves into different coalitions. We propose a notion that determines simultaneously the coalition structures that are likely to prevail in a game, as well as the feasible payoff configurations associated with them. Our solution concept is built in the spirit of von Neumann and Morgenstern stability, but it overcomes the overoptimism associated with it when employed in our context. Moreover, in doing so, we achieve consistency and resolve the problem of myopia embedded in previous notions. We prove existence for a general class of games, and investigate the efficiency of our solution. The third chapter ascertains which partitions of players will emerge and what actions will these players choose under each partition, when they can negotiate with each other and their actions have externalities. Naturally, the environment is depicted by a normal form game. The solution is a collection of pairs, each consisting of a coalition structure and a strategy profile. Although this chapter addresses the same question the Ray and Vohra (1997) paper did, it does so in a manner that overcomes the problems embedded in their approach. In particular, we assume that once a coalition deviates it fears the worst, given that the non-members do the best for themselves. In doing so, we improve upon previous solution concepts (e.g. strong and coalition-proof Nash equilibria) by NOT assuming that all other players will stay put. Yet, unlike the Ray and Vohra approach, we do not endow the deviating coalition with the power of imposing its will on all of the other players. A general solution concept is defined and its properties (efficiency, etc.) and applications are discussed. The fourth chapter analyzes cartel stability when firms are farsighted. It studies a price leadership model a la D'Aspremont et al. (1983), where the dominant cartel acts as a leader by determining the market price, while the fringe behaves competitively. According to D'Aspremont et al.'s notion of cartel stability, a firm will not remain in a cartel as long as it prefers the outcome where it is the only member leaving the cartel for the fringe. Such an approach implies that the firm is myopic since it ignores whether the outcome of its deviation is stable itself. Our notion captures foresight by employing a solution concept built in the spirit of von Neumann and Morgenstern stable set, yet adopting an indirect dominance a la Harsanyi. We show that there always exists a unique, non-empty set of stable cartels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Greenberg, Joseph</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547t17f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x310s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cartels</dc:subject><dc:subject>Game theory</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coalitions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579t935"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Information search and use in consumer decision making : an in-depth study of Chinese and North American consumers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Doran, Kathleen B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation explores individuals' approaches to information search and use in consumer decision making in two dissimilar cultures: China and North America. The research consists of two exploratory studies designed to develop a deep description of information search and use in each of the two cultures studied. Since the two cultures are so different, the research also examined cultural dimensionality and the specific dimensions that appear to impact information search and use in each culture. In addition, the studies probed the implications of these findings for other stages of consumer decision making in Chinese and North American culture. The dissertation utilizes primarily qualitative approaches to investigate the topic in an interpretive fashion. Throughout the research, an emphasis is placed on a multi-method approach in an attempt to develop descriptions and theories of information search and use for the two cultures being investigated. The Chinese study was directed from a base in Beijing, China, and the North American study was directed from two bases in Montreal, Canada, and Boston, Massachusetts. The two studies each utilize three product categories chosen to maximize understanding of information search and use characteristics of each culture. The methods employed include focus groups and interviews, observation, content analysis, and store layout and product availability analyses. The contributions of this research are both theoretical and practical. The dissertation provides a deeply descriptive study of information search and use for two disparate cultures. In addition, the insights gained from the two separate studies should lead to a better understanding of the role culture plays in information search and use more generally. Moreover, the research should help managers to adapt their promotional efforts to the differing cultural needs of two disparate cultures, and to understand how differences in information search and use between cultures can impact other phases of the decision making process, such as the evaluation of alternatives and post-purchase satisfaction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hartwick, Jon</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sf37t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579t935</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Consumer behavior -- North America</dc:subject><dc:subject>Consumer behavior -- China</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73px702"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Martin Heidegger's interpretation of ancient Greek aletheia and the philological response to it</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>De Sousa, Rui</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis tries to provide a critical review of Heidegger's interpretation of ancient Greek truth in the different stages of his career and it also examines the philological response that his work on this question elicited. The publication of Sein und Zeit made Heidegger's views on a ,l h&amp;d12;q3ia available to a wide public and thereby launched a heated debate on the meaning of this word. The introduction tries to give an account of the general intellectual background to Heidegger's interpretation of ancient Greek truth. It also looks at the kind of interpretative approach favored by the philologists responding to Heidegger's views on a ,l h&amp;d12;q3ia . The thesis first examines his arguments on ancient Greek truth and language in Sein und Zeit from the point of view of the larger philosophical project of Heidegger's seminal work. It then looks at some initial philological responses to Heidegger along with Heidegger's views on a ,l h&amp;d12;q3ia in a few works following the publication of Sein und Zeit . As a next step, the bulk of the philological work responding to Heidegger is carefully examined with a special focus on the interpretative approaches of the various authors. Heidegger's attempt to respond to some of these philologists is also reviewed. Finally, Heidegger's retraction of his earlier views on a ,l h&amp;d12;q3ia is examined in light of a growing critical consensus among philologists. The very latest philological responses to Heidegger are also considered. The conclusion looks at the contributions made by Heidegger and his philological respondents to our knowledge of ancient Greek truth. Some suggestions are also made for future research on this topic.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Silverthorne, Michael</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042v597.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73px702</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Heidegger, Martin, 1889-1976.

Within nivr&amp;dotbelow;tti dharma, discourses on sexuality are inalienable from discourses on the body, and on asceticism.

Although AF has been recognized and studied extensively since the early twentieth century, AF management is far from ideal. A better understanding of AF mechanisms is essential in order to improve treatment of AF. The objectives of this study were designed to determine the cellular, ionic, and molecular bases of tachycardia-related AF. To achieve our goals, we developed a dog model of tachycardia-related AF, and studied ionic and molecular determinants of atrial repolarization under normal physiological conditions, as well as the ionic and molecular determinants of tachycardia-induced electrical remodeling. We first optimized an arterial perfusion method to isolate dog atrial myocytes, which allowed us to characterize repolarizing currents. We found that Ito, ICl.Ca, IKr, and IKs are all present in dog atrium and play an important role in repolarization. On addition, we found the properties of canine atrial Ito, I Kr, and OKs to be quite similar to those of corresponding currents in human atrial myocytes. Although Ito and ICl.Ca were not affected by the cell isolation method, the delayed rectifier IK was very sensitive to cell isolation technique, explaining discrepancies in the literature and implying the importance of optimal cell isolation for studies of native ionic currents. In the process of characterizing repolarizing currents, we identified a novel ultra-rapid delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKur.d) in dog atrium. IKur.d exhibits signature features such as extreme sensitivity to TEA and 4 AP, inward rectification, and up-regulation by both alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic stimulation (mediated by PKC and PKA activation, respectively). On order to understand the molecular basis of IKur.d, we cloned a novel Shaw-subfamily K+ channel dKv3.1 from dog atrium. Heterologous expression of dKv3.1 in Xenopus oocytes produces currents which closely resemble IKur.d. Both mRNA and protein expression of dKv3.1 are strong in dog atrium. This study is the first to show the presence and the function of Shaw-related K + channel subunits in the heart. On the basis of an understanding of the ionic determinants of repolarization under normal physiological conditions, we investigated the cellular, ionic, and molecular bases of tachycardia-related AF. We found that APD shortening and attenuation of APD adaptation to rate underlie ERP alterations induced by AF. The ionic remodeling associated with APD changes includes decreases in L-type ICa and Ito, without any changes in I K, IK1, ICl.ca, or IKur.d. The changes in L-type ICa account for APD alterations, and thus play a predominant role in tachycardia-related AF remodeling. With the use of competitive RT-PCR, we found that down-regulation of mRNA is the molecular basis of tachycardia-related AF. Our findings reveal that atrial tachycardia during AF down-regulates Ca2+ channel alpha1C-subunit mRNA, which results in functional decreases in L-type ICa density, which in turn reduces APD. Shortening in APD results in decreases in ERP, which provides a substrate for AF to persist. This explains the self-perpetuating nature of AF, i.e. how "AF begets AF".</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nattel, Stanley</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fz390.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm689</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bn41h"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Wenckebach rhythms and {1:1--2:1} bistability in single rabbit ventricular cells and in a ventricular ionic model</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yehia, Ali</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Stimulating a rabbit ventricular cell with a train of current pulses at a long basic cycle length (BCL) and high pulse amplitude (PA) leads to a 1:1 rhythm, where each injected pulse generates an action potential. With a fixed BCL (BCL = 300 ms at 34--36°C and BCL = 1000 ms at 22--24°C), as PA is decreased, there is a transition from 1:1 rhythm to Wenckebach rhythms. These rhythms are characterized by a beat-to-beat increment in latency and action potential duration (APD) culminating in a skipped beat. Using voltage and action potential clamp, as well as a specific channel blocker, I show that the transient outward current (Ito) is implicated in the generation of these APD increments, and is responsible for the periodicity of these rhythms. When PA is raised, a direct transition from 1:1 to 2:1 rhythm can be observed by varying BCL. With the use of an ionic model, hysteresis between 1:1 and 2:1 rhythms is shown and compared to similar hysteresis observed previously in experiments with rabbit ventricular cells. When the BCL is within the hysteresis range, the addition of stimulus pulses flips 1:1 to 2:1 rhythm and vice versa, providing evidence for bistability. With the ionic model, the substraction of a single pulse also flipped 1:1 to 2:1 rhythm. Iteration of a finite-difference equation, derived using the steady-state APD restitution curve, predicts the direct {1:1 ↔ 2:1} transition, as well as bistability, in both the experimental and modeling work. Finally, I show in an ionic model that the transition from 1:1 to 2:1 rhythms: (1) is interrupted by Wenckebach rhythms at low PAs; (2) is direct without hysteresis at one specific higher PA value; (3) is direct with hystersis at still higher PAs. While iteration of the APD restitution curve predicted {1:1 ↔ 2:1} bistability at higher PA, iteration of the latency restitution curve predicted Wenckebach rhythms at lower PA, confirming the importance of latency for the existence of Wenckebach rhythms</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guevara, M.

Robustness of validity, robustness of efficiency and high breakdown point size and power are the fundamental goals in robust testing. The objective of this dissertation is to examine the finite-sample properties of robust estimators and tests, and to find some useful applications for them. This is accomplished by extensive Monte Carlo experiments and other inference techniques in various contamination situations. In the linear regression model with an outlying regressor and deviations from the normal error distribution, robust estimators demonstrate noticeable advantages over the standard LS and maximum likelihood (ML) estimators. Our findings reveal that the finite-sample behavior of the robust estimators is very different from their asymptotic properties. The robust properties of estimators carry over to test statistics based on these estimators. The robust tests we proposed can achieve to the large extent the fundamental goals in robust testing. Economic applications on modelling the household consumption behavior and testing for (G)ARCH effects show that one can capture big gains from the appropriate utilization of the robust methods even at very simple models.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zinde-Walsh, Victoria</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wp50g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225c739</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Robust statistics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Econometrics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Regression analysis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv935466h"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Asymptotic solutions of dendritic crystal growth in external flow</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yu, Dong-Sheng, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present thesis is concerned with the effect of external fluid flow on steady axisymmetric dendrtic growth from a undercooled pure melt with zero surface tension.

As a conceptual point of departure for public health programming, community violence focuses on acutely violent events, where homicide and/or hospitalization are the potential outcomes. The violence experienced by poor people living in marginal neighborhoods is chronic and does not resemble this conception of violence on which public health intervention programs are based. The violence that is most pressing to these intended service recipients is driven by their immersion in poverty. As a result of this lack of conceptual correspondence, intervention programs are unable to achieve the intended goal of violence reduction. Drawing on and adding to the literature from the anthropology of violence and the anthropology of public health, this thesis explores public health conceptions of community and domestic violence intervention as contrasted with the experience of structural violence for the individuals for whom intervention services are designed. The research that underwrites this project was conducted in an inner-city public hospital and focused on a clinically-driven, community-based youth violence intervention program. Clinical and community violence intervention programs bring three groups together: clinical practitioners, community workers and youth service recipients. This study explores the heterogeneity of the world views of members of these groups and exposes the power imbalances inherent to clinical and community collaborations. The power differentials exist between the clinical, community and youth factions, as well as within each faction. This work shows how this unequal distribution of power---between and among these sub-groups---mirrors themes in American society and comes to influence internal program adjustment and negotiation. The process observed highlights how power politics, as well as incongruent perspectives on violence, play out initially in the implementation process and secondarily in the lives of the youth who were program participants. This work, which has theoretical and practical implications for scholars working in the areas of poverty, violence, public health interventionism or adolescent programming, concludes with a summary of alternative strategies to approach violence prevention programming.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Corin, Ellen</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k84v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p878t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Violence -- New York (State) -- New York</dc:subject><dc:subject>Crisis intervention (Mental health services) -- New York (State) -- New York</dc:subject><dc:subject>African American children -- New York (State) -- New York -- Social conditions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gv32k"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Rockburst control using destress blasting</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tang, Baoyao, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the main problems facing mining engineers when dealing with deep, hard rock mines is to prevent and/or reduce rockburst hazard around mine openings. Rockburst is a phenomenon which is characterised by violent rock failure. The current research focuses on the assessment and control of rockbursts in deep, hard rock mines. Strainbursts, or strain-type rockbursts, occur in the vicinity of mine openings and are generally provoked by high stress conditions in a brittle rock mass. A new theory has been developed for the assessment of the potential of violent rock failure by strainburst, in underground hard rock mines. In this theory, the mining-induced energy parameters are used to calculate the so-called burst potential index (BPI). When the BPI reaches or exceeds 100%, the method predicts a burst prone situation. One of the most commonly used methods to control strainbursts in hard rock mines is destress blasting. Motivated by the lack of a dedicated analysis tool to help assess destress blasting, a new, geomechanical model was developed. The technique employs two newly introduced parameters, alpha, a rock fragmentation factor, and beta, a stress dissipation factor, inside the modelled, fractured zone. Implemented in a 3-dimensional finite element code developed by the author, the new model simulates the damage zone induced by destress blasting of a mining face to help evaluate the efficiency of destress blasting. Extensive model verification and parametric studies have been undertaken. The effects of the destress blasting pattern, premining stresses and their orientation, and the two destress blasting factors (rock fragmentation factor, and stress dissipation factor) are studied. The model has been applied successfully to Canadian mine case histories. A detailed case study of a cut-and-fill mine stope involving crown and sill pillar destressing has been carried out. It is shown that the new method can be useful in the assessment of destress blasting in deep drift face development and the crown/sill pillar problems in cut-and-fill mine stopes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitri, Hani S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4306440.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gv32k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qt69j"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The regulation of ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in injured peripheral nervous tissue</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Subang, Maria Cristina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Studies of Wallerian degeneration, the phenomenon wherein axons severed from the nerve cell body disintegrate, have revealed tightly regulated interactions between axons and Schwann cells. This present study focused on Schwann cell changes that occur following nerve injury. To tease out the different signals that influence the changes in Schwann cell phenotype, the regulation of three Schwann cell genes, namely ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), was investigated. Data showed that CNTF mRNA, regulated in a similar manner as myelin P 0, is induced by axonal contact even in the absence of transport from the nerve cell body. The mRNAs for LIF, which belongs to the same family as CNTF, and MCP-1 are induced in a biphasic manner in transected nerves---within 3--6 hours at the site of lesion and by 24 hours in the entire distal stump. Also, the induction of MCP-1 mRNA at the lesion site appears to be mediated by oxygen radicals. In vitro, Schwann cells produce MCP-1 mRNA in response to TNF-alpha stimulation through a pathway that can be inhibited by anti-oxidants and does not appear to require NF-kappaB activation. However, in vivo TNF-alpha is not crucial to the induction of MCP-1 mRNA in injured PNS. In contrast to the signal that decreases CNTF mRNA synthesis, the signals that induce MCP-1 and LIF mRNA are not strongly dependent on axonal degeneration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Richardson, Peter M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988m72n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qt69j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pc123"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The somatic state : the dialectics of law's morality</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sugrue, Seana Carole</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation offers a dialectical analysis of law creation insofar as legal rules and processes of social ordering are the products of interactions among agents inter se and between agents and legal institutions. This perspective demands that agents be regarded as contributing to the creation of law governing their own lives. The agents involved are not restricted to legal officials but include all persons with the capacity to exercise agency. This perspective of law creation is defended on the basis that the dialectical analysis permits a better comprehension of the relationship between law and morality. The normative defence of the dialectical approach is based on four inter-related arguments. First, law creation is an instantiation of moral practice for "full insiders", these being agents committed to norms and intrinsic goods. Secondly, the conflicts ensuing from the interactions of agents tend to imbue legal authority with some degree of legitimacy through normative compromises. Thirdly, as the agents involved in this process exercise political freedom, they have the capacity to exercise judgement in mediating between a commitment to institutional structures that facilitate moral practice and a commitment to moral reasoning that can counsel the instigation of change. Lastly, even in the case of "truncated insiders", agents who are not committed to moral reasoning, there are certain weak prudential checks that exist within the games they play inhibiting unfair processes and unjust outcomes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macdonald, Roderick A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sx59t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pc123</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jurisprudence</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67js885"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Simulation modeling of irrigation requirements for sugarcane production in Sindh Province, Pakistan</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Qureshi, Suhail Ahmad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Over-irrigation and poor internal drainage of soils in the Indus basin of Pakistan have resulted in waterlogging and salinity problems, severely affecting agriculture. These problems may be solved by subsurface drainage or more efficient irrigation water management. Since drainage system installation is relatively expensive Pakistan, efficient irrigation management practices e.g., irrigation scheduling and on-farm water management are cheaper alternatives. A soil water simulation model, SWAP93, was used to evaluate the effects of water stress on crop yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and crop water use in sugarcane [Saccharum officinarum L.]. This information was used to determine water management practices, which can reduce salinity and waterlogging Drainage fluxes and evapotranspiration simulated by the model were compared with those measured in drainage lysimeters (water tables controlled at 1.5 m and 2.25 m from the soil surface) for 1989 and 1990. Drainage fluxes were overestimated, and evapotranspiration underestimated. The model's original grass-based evapotranspiration (ET) was changed to an alfalfa-based one, resulting in a better estimation of drainage fluxes and ET. The effects of soil water balance, simulated by the SWAP93, on the crop yield, WUE and crop water use were assessed using twelve irrigation treatments consisting of four irrigation amounts (1800, 1650, 1200 and 900 mm) factorially combined with three irrigation intervals (7, 10 and 15 days) for seven years of climatic data. Crop yields increased linearly with irrigation of 1200 mm during the growing season, Crop yield, ET and WUE were not significantly different for irrigation amounts ranging from 1200 to 1800 mm. When the total applied water was above 1400 mm, the crop yield showed a plateau. This maximum yield was reached because irrigation water was remained in the soil profile or percolated into deeper layers at high levels of irrigation application. For a 7-day irrigation interval, the 1200 mm treatment showed water deficits during the middle of the growing season, whereas for 10- or 15-day irrigation intervals, water deficits were negligible. A 3rd degree polynomial relationship between cumulative irrigation amount and drainage fluxes was developed, allowing a daily estimation of irrigation amount for a given percolation or capillary rise. This relationship can be used to optimize irrigation amounts, and evaluate their impacts on percolation losses. From the results of this simulation study, it was predicted that the 1200 mm---15 irrigation application treatment (15 day interval) was best for irrigation scheduling to reduce salinity and waterlogging.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Madramootoo, C.

When a decision on where to put a protected area to conserve biodiversity must be made at a given time, the decision must be based on the best data available. But, adequate data are often lacking. This thesis examines the use of surrogate measures of biodiversity in conservation decision-making in Guyana, South America. The study looks at different surrogate measures and their influence on the selection of priority biodiversity sites for conservation. Surrogate measures at the ecosystem and species level are examined. The research shows that measures from different hierarchical levels produce different outcomes on the location of sites, however measures at the ecosystem-level appear to capture most of the known species distributions. The thesis examines cross-taxon congruency and shows that the spatial scale of analysis influences patterns of congruency for different taxonomic groups. The influence of spatial scale is also examined for various measures of biodiversity and it is shown that variability of species richness decreases with increased selection unit size. Finally, an index of vulnerability is used to prioritise conservation of sites in Guyana based on urgency, which is defined by two different threats: agriculture and forestry. This thesis adopts a conceptual framework based on data-driven, efficient, flexible and transparent methodologies and uses it to demonstrate how a network of protected areas might be established in Guyana that uses the most comprehensive data available on biodiversity. The thesis concludes by presenting a protocol for conservation decision-making that incorporates some of the theoretical principles identified by this work as important for measuring biodiversity and planning a protected area network.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Meredith, Thom</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967531h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xt43x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ecology -- Guyana</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biodiversity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human ecology -- Guyana</dc:subject><dc:subject>Conservation of natural resources -- Guyana</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vv902"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The spatial mechanisms mediating the perception of mirror symmetry in human vision</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rainville, Stéphane Jean Michel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present thesis reports psychophysical and modeling studies on the spatial properties of visual mechanisms mediating the perception of mirror symmetry in human vision. In a first set of experiments, patterns were filtered for power spectra that decayed with spatial frequency according to variable slopes. Results revealed that symmetry detection is optimal if contrast energy is roughly equated across log-frequency bands (i.e. 1/f2) and that, under such conditions, spatial scales contribute equally and independently to symmetry perception. In a second study, random-noise patterns were filtered for various orientation bands. Results showed that symmetry perception is possible at all orientations, is mediated by oriented mechanisms, and is computed independently in different orientation channels. Data also revealed that the dimensions of the spatial integration region (IR) for symmetry vary with orientation in a way that approximately matches the spatial distribution of information in the stimulus. Finally, symmetry detection was measured for bandpass textures of variable spatial density and variable contrast polarity. For such patterns, it was found that symmetry is computed at a spatial scale proportional to stimulus density and that mechanisms insensitive to contrast polarity (i.e. second-order) are involved in the scale-selection process. Overall, results from empirical and modeling work revealed an intimate link between symmetry perception and the properties of spatial filters. In particular, I argue that the size of the IR tends to vary such that a fixed amount of information is integrated irrespective of the spatial properties of the stimulus. Implications for the functional architecture of symmetry perception are discussed, and a paradigm for future research in symmetry perception is proposed in which spatial filtering is extended to higher orders of spatial complexity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kingdom, Frederick A.

Lambdas are measured via the charged decay channel: Λ → ppi- and identified from the ppi - invariant mass spectra with the aids of a set of pair cuts. A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation is made to extensively study the lambda reconstruction. The details of the data analysis for lambda identification are presented. The consistence of data analysis is examined by detailed comparison of the constructed proton and pion spectra with the previous results from the E877 1993 data set. The double differential multiplicities for lambda as a function of collision centrality are presented. Lambda rapidity distribution dN/dy is also studied. A pure thermal model is used to characterize the lambda spectra. The experimental results are compared to the predictions of the RQMD model (v2.3) in its cascade version and in the mode that takes into account the effect of mean-field. We also present the first measurement of the lambda directed flow at the AGS. In spite of limited statistics, a strong positive directed flow for lambda, which is comparable to the amplitude of the proton flow, is observed at forward rapidities (2.8 &lt; y &lt; 3.4) in the semi-central Au+Au collisions. The measured flow amplitude as a function of pt, v 1(pt), is in agreement with the predictions of the RQMD model.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barrette, Jean</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h121d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278v917</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Nuclear</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214q82n"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Study of the mixing with chemical reaction in a cross flow impinging jet aerosol reactor</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nadeau, Patrice</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A reactor has been designed for the study of the nucleation and growth of an ammonium chloride aerosol starting from ammonia and hydrogen chloride in the gas phase at ambient conditions. The reactor configuration was derived from other aerosol reactors used for the production of ultrafine ceramic particles: two opposed jets containing one reactant discharging into a cross stream containing the second reactant. The fluid flow was in a transition state from laminar to fully turbulent. The reactor had essentially a two-dimensional configuration. Three types of measurements were performed to characterize the reactor: velocity, tracer concentration and aerosol particle size distribution (PSD) measurements. A mathematical model was developed to simulate the experimental reactor. The measurements demonstrated that the flow could be divided into two important regions: the principal jet trajectory and the main recirculation downstream of the jet along the reactor wall. Most of the mixing between the two jets and the main flow occurred along the principal jet trajectory, the recirculation zone was well mixed in most cases. Higher jet velocities increased the extent of mixing in the reactor. The nucleation of aerosol particles occurred close to the reactor inlets. In the recirculation zone, larger particles were found and in a lower concentration compared to the aerosol along the principal jet trajectory. The numerical computations showed that neither a laminar nor a turbulent flow model were able to accurately reproduce the experimental fluid flow. A good agreement with measurements was nevertheless obtained for the modeling of the mixing of a tracer. For the nucleation and growth of the aerosol, a model based on the residence time distribution of the reactor gave a good agreement with experiments for certain values of the rate constant and surface free energy of formation. However, this model neglects key features of the reactor behavior because it assumes well mixed reactants at the entrance and that particles of different ages are not mixed together. Another model using spatial transport of the species failed to reproduce the experimental aerosol measurements. It nevertheless emphasized the role of the recirculation zone in the reduction of the nucleation by favoring condensation onto existing particles.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Munz, Richard J.</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Berk, Dimitrios</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p6381.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214q82n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d1572"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterisation of the transcriptional properties of the mSim gene products</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Moffett, Peter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The basic-Helix-Loop-Helix PAS (bHLH-PAS) protein family is a growing family of transcription factors. Included in this family is the Drosophila single-minded (DSim) gene, which is critical for the development of the CNS midline cells. We have isolated a murine homologue of the Drosophila Sim gene, mSim-2. The murine and Drosophila gene products share a high degree of homology in the bHLH and PAS regions but not within the carboxy terminus. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis of adult murine tissues revealed that the mSim-2 is expressed at the highest levels in the kidneys and at lower levels is present in skeletal muscle, lung, testis, brain, and heart. In situ hybridisation experiments demonstrate that mSim-2 is also expressed in early fetal development in the central nervous system and in cartilage primordia. We investigated the ability of mSIM-2 to associate with the Arnt gene product, a common dimerisation partner of a number of bHLH-PAS proteins. We found that the HLH and PAS motifs of both proteins are required for optimal association. We demonstrated the presence of two separable repression domains within the carboxy terminus of mSIM-2, in contrast to dSIM, which is a transactivator. We find that mSIM-2 is also capable of repressing activation by its binding partner, ARNT. We also demonstrate that mSIM-2 can functionally interfere with another bHLH-PAS transcription factor, HIF-1alpha, by competing for ARNT binding, providing a second mechanism by which mSIM-2 may inhibit transcription. We also investigated the effects of mSIM-2 and its close paralogue mSIM-1, as heterodimers with ARNT, on reporter constructs containing native DNA binding sites. We find that mSIM-1 can effect transcriptional activation through it's association with ARNT. In contrast, mSIM-2/ARNT does not activate, as the mSIM-2 repression domains quench ARNT transactivation. We also find that the mSIM-2 can interfere with mSIM-1 mediated transactivation by competing for dimerisation with ARNT and for DNA binding site occupation. Our results suggest that mSIM-1 and mSIM-2 have similar dimerisation and DNA binding properties but different transcriptional effects and may therefore antagonise each other which may in turn be a mechanism of gene regulation by these two proteins.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pelletier, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343t80v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d1572</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440v31c"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evolution of glycophosphatidyl inositol anchors in carcinoembryonic antigen family members : functional implications</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Naghibalhossaini, Fakhraddin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family members in humans can be divided into two subgroups according to the type of anchorage to the cell membrane: Glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-linked and transmembrane (TM) linked. The mode of membrane anchorage can profoundly affect the biological functions of CEA family molecules, including the ability to inhibit differentiation. All information so far, suggests that the GPI-anchored CEA family members evolved recently presumably from a more primordial TM-anchored family member such as CEACAM1. The results of this study indicate that very few mutations in the TM domain are required to effect this change. The introduction of a stop codon in the CEACAM1 TM domain at the position corresponding to that of all GPI-linked CEA family members plus two more amino acid changes in this domain resulted in highly efficiently GPI-processed protein. The GPI-anchored mutant CEACAM1 protein is still capable of mediating cell-cell adhesion but, unlike TM-linked CEACAM1, could block myogenic differentiation. Screening of genomic DNA from various mammalian groups by PCR showed convergent evolution of GPI anchorage in the CEA family, in that it evolved twice independently by different packages of mutations during the primate radiation. The same group of GPI-generating mutations as in human CEA family members evolved in the common ancestor of primitive primate groups of tarsiers and New World monkeys, and a novel group of GPI producing mutations evolved later in Cebidae family of New World monkeys. These independent groups of mutations that gave rise to the same structural feature imply adaptive evolution of GPI-anchor acquisition in CEA family, This supports the notion that GPI-anchoring of CEA family members is functionally important in vivo and therefore, has been positively selected during evolution.

One of the objectives of this study is to obtain a realistic simulation of the lifecycle and to determine the factors that regulated the convective onsets. Another objective is to document the impact of the mesoscale convective system and its embedded mesoscale precipitation features on the atmospheric heat and moisture budgets over the warm pool and the surface energy balance of the underlying ocean. The lifecycle of the mesoscale convective system was characterized by the initiation at 0530 UTC of two entities S1 and S2, which underwent development and eventually merged to form a large anvil cloud by 1830 UTC. To obtain a realistic simulation of the lifecycle, improvements to the initial moisture field, the convective and surface flux processes in the model were undertaken. The lifecycle of the mesoscale convective system was realistically simulated, The growing stage was composed of three convective onsets at 0600, 1100, and 1400 UTC. The onsets were governed by three factors: occurrence of convective available potential energy, large scale ascent and a favorable surface potential temperature dropoff. The calculated heat and moisture budgets of the mesoscale convective system were characterized by two heating and drying peaks (300 hPa and 925 hPa) with cooling and moistening occurring at midlevels (45--700 hPa). The surface energy balance was not affected by solar radiation because the system evolved nocturnally. Latent heat flux and the net longwave radiation were the two largest components in the surface energy budget. During the second and third convective onsets, the net longwave radiation remained essentially unchanged but the latent and sensible heat fluxes increased. The enhanced surface fluxes during the onsets increased the residual ocean fluxes, particularly over the region occupied by the third convective onset.

In the differential control systems case, the state space D of any given continuous base control system S is decomposed by a so-called finite analytic partition pi into a finite set of disjoint open connected blocks. For any such S and pi, a high level finite state control system Mp (called a partition machine of S ) is then obtained from the DC dynamics of the blocks of pi. It is shown that in the class of hybrid in-block controllable (HIBC) partitions the controllability of the base system S is equivalent to the controllability of the partition machine Mp . Within this context, the converse question naturally arises as to whether any given finite state machine has a representation as the partition machine of some continuous control system S . In Chapter 2, we show that this is indeed the case and we present a constructive solution to this problem for all finite state machines. The question of finding HIBC partitions leads us to the general study of controllability for nonlinear systems. In Chapter 3, a form of open local accessibility for nonlinear control systems is introduced called the continuous fountain condition. Subject to the condition that (i) the states of a system are continuous fountains, and (ii) one of various recurrence conditions holds; it is established that the system state space is (globally) controllable. It is shown that these controllability results imply the controllability of certain subsets of the state space of Hamiltonian control systems called energy slices. Several algebraic conditions for verification of the fountain property without analysing the actual geometry of accessible sets are established. Finally, these results are shown to have application to HHC theory in that they give conditions for a finite analytic partition to satisfy HIBC hypothesis, In practice, an application of HHC theory would encounter problems in which the dynamics of the system, the nature of the controllable flows, and the positions of the boundaries of a partition themselves could only be approximately specified, Consequently, it is of interest to establish conditions under which the dynamics of Mp and its associated set of control laws are robust (that is to say insensitive) with respect to sufficiently small perturbations of the partitions defining Mp and small perturbations of the controllable flow. Chapter 4 addresses this issue. Two notions of the deformation of a partition pi are specified as, respectively, maps of the boundaries and the blocks of pi. The robustness properties of the partition machine Mp with respect to deformations of pi, and with respect to deformations of the controllable flow are investigated. In Chapter 5, HHC theory is generalised to hybrid systems with disturbances. A disturbance rejection hierarchical hybrid control theory is introduced and then applied to a multi-tank example and to a highly simplified air traffic management example.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Caines, Peter E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj04m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gm57j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m104h"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>"Une fleur des païs étrangers" : Desfontaines traducteur au XVIIIe</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Léger, Benoit</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Analyses of Eighteenth-century French translations of English literature have often been reduced to criticizing so-called "belles infideles".

Translating Swiftian satire in Gulliver's Travels , Pope's "badinage" in The Rape of the Lock, Clifton's medical history in the context of Newton's ideas, or social satire in Joseph Andrews, regardless of the degree of "fidelity", is never an innocent process. These issues are coupled with formal ones, translational as well as esthetic, when poetry or the Eighteenth-century novel-style texts are translated. The importance of the Abbe Desfontaines (1685--1745) is undeniable. As a journalist, he comments, criticizes, and analyses not only the translations of English texts, but also the movement along which English ideas are translated within the French system. His numerous satirical texts also reveal him positioning himself before of the issues of the time. Allowing himself more freedom as a translator, he belongs to the first ones to proceed to the translation of English literature between 1727 and 1743. In his translations, he adapts, imitates, or censors some elements seen as unacceptable in French. He has therefore been considered to be an "unfaithful translator", a position that does not account for his translation project which it is described in the important paratextual apparatus of his translations. His title pages, and especially his dedications, forewords, and introductions, reveal him as being aware of the most polemical aspects of these texts. So as to avoid the impasse encountered in criticizing the "fidelity" of his translations, I have focused on his paratextual apparatus in order to define his translation project and poetics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bouchard, Chantal</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>St-Pierre, Paul</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s413h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m104h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Desfontaines, M. l'abbé (Pierre-François Guyot), 1685-1745</dc:subject><dc:subject>English literature -- Translations into French -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085m99b"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The use of rat glutathione S-transferase A3 for hematopoietic chemoprotection from nitrogen mustards in cancer therapy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Létourneau, Sylvain</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effectiveness of anti-cancer chemotherapy is limited by acute dose limiting toxicities, principally myelosuppression. The introduction of drug resistance genes into hematopoietic cells may increase the bone marrow (BM) tolerance to chemotherapy and may permit safer dose escalation, and thus increase clinical efficacy. Conferring chemoprotection to nitrogen mustards would be clinically relevant because of their broad spectrum of anti-tumor activity and their predominant, dose-limiting hematotoxicity. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) alpha isoenzymes, particularly the rat GSTA3, have been implicated in resistance to nitrogen mustards. To determine if retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of the rat GSTA3 (previously called GST-Yc) could be used to confer resistance to nitrogen mustards, we studied the expression of rat GSTA3 and the sensitivity to nitrogen mustards in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts following either transfection or transduction of GSTA3 with a Moloney-based retrovirus vector (N2Yc). Populations of GSTA3-transduced cells and single cell-derived clones demonstrated increased glutathione (GSH) peroxidase activity (associated with the A3 subunit) and moderate in vitro resistance to chlorambucil and mechlorethamine. To address the feasibility of using rat GSTA3 gene transfer to confer chemoprotection to the hematopoietic system, we then transduced human leukemia K-562 cells and primary murine hematopoietic progenitor cells with the N2Yc retrovirus vector, Similarly to N2Yc-expressing fibroblasts, K-562 cells and clonogenic primary murine hematopoietic cells transduced with the N2Yc retrovirus vector demonstrated increased GSH peroxidase activity and moderate in vitro resistance to melphalan, chlorambucil and mechlorethamine. We next explored the possibility of conferring chemoprotection against nitrogen mustards in vivo following transplantation of mice with GSTA3-transduced BM cells. Unfortunately, we did not observed chemoprotection from chlorambucil in</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cournoyer, Denis</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547t190.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085m99b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
