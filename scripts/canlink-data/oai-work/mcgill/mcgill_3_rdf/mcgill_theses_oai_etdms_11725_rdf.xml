They combine the property of great strength, which can be altered as required by proper heat treatment, with excellent corrosion resistance. The alloys can be subjected to heat treatments similar to those used for the heat treating of steel.

To help interpret all these factors, under such a wide range of conditions, in as short a period as possible, the rapid, semi-quantitative tissue tests and soil tests have been developed. This investigation is a comparison of the tests more widely used in the United States, applied to two soil types in Quebec, as an aid in determining the nutrient status of the soil.

The individual amounts of the three triols, together with those of the cis- and trans-cyclohexanediols simultaneously formed, were determined for various times of hydrogenation. Theories were advanced to account for the various yields. The geometrical configurations of the three pyrogallitols were definitely established for the first time by a study of their relative rates of reaction with lead tetraacetate and periodate. The cis- and trans-1,2-dinitrates of cyclohexanediol and the three trinitrates of the pyrogallitols were prepared and characterized. These five nitrates reacted inalkaline media in different ways and the rates of hydrolysis, of nitrite and color formation, were determined in each case. An attempt was made to explain these results. Several explosiveproperties, such as thermal stability, sensitivity to shock and compatibility with nitrocellulose, were determined for one or more of these five cyclohexane nitrates. Some correlation was found between these properties and the behavior of the nitrates in alkali.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dq412.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92gb42b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jf31b"><ual:graduationDate>1947</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The geology of the St. Dominique ridge, Bagot County, Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Usher, John Leslie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The ridge of Ordovician rocks at St. Dominique, Quebec, abounds in problems of stratigraphical, paleontological and structural importance, yet, in spite of its nearness to Montreal, it has so far received only cursory attention from geologists.

During the study of the stability of ascorbic acid in fortified apple juice as compared to unfortified tomato juice and other juices, the methods of determining vitamin C have been thoroughly investigated. The most serious criticism of the methods studied is that in Roe’s 2:4-dinitrophenylhydrazine method, 2:3-diketo-1-gulonic acid is included in the values for dehydroascorbic acid so that inaccurately high antiscorbutic potencies are indicated in extracts analyzed by this widely used method.

This method requires a petrographic microscope and also a knowledge of optical mineralogy. Since the microchemlcal method requires only a small sample, it is preferable to other methods in determinative mineralogy. The purpose of this paper is to present a description of the characteristic reactions and of the optical properties of the resultant crystalline precipitates of certain common elements. The optical constants are worked out in detail, in so far as the technique used permits. It will be noted that a number of these are not in complete agreement with those given in authoritative tables. An attempt has been made to interpret the interference reactions resulting from the test solution of some complex minerals with the reagents, in the hope that they may prove useful to the detection of cations and, therefore, to the determination of the composition of minerals.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jolliff, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b6595.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vx191</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar494vp131"><ual:graduationDate>1948</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hume’s moral philosophy in the Treatise of human nature</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yalden-Thomson, David C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Hume's philosophical -writings received little attention, except in Scottish circles, and it was not until the present century that Hume came to be generally regarded as one of the greatest British philosophers. At the time when I began this thesis, there was still relatively little published criticism of his ethical thought, for reasons which are discussed elsewhere. Interest has largely been confined to his epistemology, and his ethics have been neglected or treated as subsidiary to his theory of knowledge. It was never suggested, I think, until Professor Kemp Smith's Philosophy of David Hume appeared in 1941, that moral philosophy was Hume's original, and perhaps his main, concern. This suggestion, coming from such an authoritative source, might alone be thought to justify a re-examination of his ethical writings.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maclennan, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204231q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vp131</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hume, David, 1711-1776</dc:subject><dc:subject>ETHICS</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asf268846c"><ual:graduationDate>1948</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of various factors on glycolysis in human blood during storage</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Woodford, V.R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The investigation to be described in this thesis forms part of a larger study which has been carried on in the Department of Biochemistry at McGill University since January 1940.

Pr144 , has been made using a thin lens magnetic spectrometer. Analysis of the beta-spectrum Indicates the presence of five spectra with end-points at 3.06 ± 0.09, 1.05 ± 0.05, 0.517 ± O.O36, 0.303 ± 0.020, and 0.179 ± 0.015 Mev. The first three have been assigned to Pr1 , the remaining two to Ce1 . Conversion lines at 90.1 ± 0.9 and 125 ± 1.3 Kev. are attributed to internal conversion of a 132 Kev. gamma-ray following the 0.179 Mev. beta-disintegration of Ce144 . Measurement of gammaray energies by spectrometric methods proved Impractical with the activity available, but absorption methods reveal three other gamma-rays of energies about 2, 0.5 and 0.22 Mev. The results of coincidence experiments are, on the whole, inconclusive, but indicate in general the complexity of the spectra. Tentative disintegration schemes are presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sx00d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nf34x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h2766"><ual:graduationDate>1948</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Factors relating to the teacher-child contacts in preschool education</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Willis, Edith Blair</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study has been stimulated by the increasing interest and efforts in the preschool education movement in Montreal, in which the writer has been fortunate to have had an active part.

The purpose of this paper is to present the evidence that has been assembled indicating the controls that resulted in the formation of the known orebodies . The ore occurs as irregular bodies of skarn within the limestone members of an assemblage of volcanic rocks and limestone lenses . The writer concludes that the skarn bodies were produced by alteration of limestone , that the gold was introduced during this alteration , and that a set of vertical fractures in underlying rocks were probably the channels by which replacing solutions entered the limestone . A nearby dioritic stock may have been the source of the solutions . The report was planned as a preliminary study , to be revised and expanded following further work at the property.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>O'Neill, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w295k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053k466</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geological Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
