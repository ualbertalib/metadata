Advantages of the heater over the conventional hot water generators include higher efficiency, lower cost of equipment, lower pressure drop, and a simpler control system. The experimental work has been conducted on a prototype dual water heater located at the Natural Gas Technology Center at Boucherville, Quebec. The heater consists of an immersed firetube and two packed columns. It provides hot water at two temperatures. The effects of the controlling parameters, such as the flow rates of the water, air, and fuel gas, on the performance of the heater were analyzed. Equations governing the heat and mass transfer were formulated. Simplified forms of these equations were used to determine heat and mass transfer coefficients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooke, N.

When these human-computer interaction techniques are brought together, they offer the opportunity to learn interactively with the training environment, rather than providing a passive classroom-like visual or audio training experience. Features such as the automatic creation of a 3D model substation derived from single-line diagrams, and the use of a distributed network methodology have been developed to enhance the flexibility of ESOPE-VR. Alternate manipulation devices such as the 2D mouse, Logitech 6D flying mouse, and the Powerglove all have unique characteristics that can enhance the realism of the user interactions. This thesis investigates the effectiveness of these devices in providing an interaction interface to the ESOPE-VR virtual reality operator training system. These manipulation devices are analyzed and the development of accompanying manipulation strategies are described.

The goal of this research is to develop flow control techniques that regulates the admitted calls based on the prediction of the total transmitted power requirements over the next packet transmission interval. If the probability of exceeding the maximum power value is sufficiently low, the extra power required to accommodate the data transmission is unlikely to result in outage and, therefore, data flow is permitted. The autocovariance function of the transmitted power under maximally loaded traffic conditions allows such predictions. With packet-level flow control, one can potentially transmit useful volumes of packet data even when no fixed mean data transmission rate can be guaranteed. The traffic admitted to any cell is increased if the traffic in the neighboring cells happens to be low. Using constant bit rate (CBR) speech transmission with 100% activity, the system can accommodate about 67 mobiles. With available bit rate (ABR), we can accommodate up to 82 data mobiles receiving data at the same average rate of 8 Kb/sec.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mermelstein, Paul</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Morgera, Salvatore D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811km83x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zz727</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1v53k025g"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An analog VLSI implementation of an attention-based saccade generator</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Qumsieh, Ala</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A huge amount of data is present in the visual field of the primate visual system. Serial processing of the entire visual field requires long periods of time, while parallel processing involves very complex architectures. Biological systems are able to handle this problem using attention. Attention is a mechanism where interesting locations in a given scene, that are worthy of more processing, are identified. These locations are then serially attended to where the precious amount of resources are allocated for further parallel processing. Biological systems have been able to find a good compromise between the slow serial architecture and the complex parallel one. In this thesis, we present an analog VLSI implementation of a system that mimics the attentional mechanism of the primate visual system. We follow the premotor theory of attention in that attention and motor action (specifically saccadic eye movements) are tightly linked. These two processes have been considered separately in most previous computational and VLSI models of vision. Our model facilitates the selection of regions of interest by using a winner-take-all mechanism. This defines a set of inhibitory signals, one at each node, that determine the behaviour of the system. It is the pattern of these inhibitory signals that gives rise to saccadic eye movements. The model also contains an inhibition-of-return mechanism, a proximity preference behaviour, and a centroid detection circuit. One and two-dimensional versions of the model were fabricated and tested. The use of the analog VLSI paradigm to implement our model has provided a powerful mechanism to model the massively parallel architecture of biological systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clark, James J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042w12j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k025g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axw42nb00r"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of anions, acids and bases on the solubility of amino acids in aqueous solutions</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pradhan, Anjali A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of acids and bases on the solubility of amino acids at 298.2 K, within the pH range (2--10) and out of the pH range was determined. The amino acids-studied were glycine, DL-alanine, DL-valine and DL-serine. The acids used were HCl and HNO3 and the bases NaOH and KOH. It was observed that in the pH range (2--10) there is no significant difference in the solubility of DL-alanine in the presence of different ions such as, Na+ or K+, at high pH, and Cl - or NO3-, at low pH. However, in concentrated acids the solubility is higher in nitric acid than in hydrochloric acid. Also in concentrated bases the solubility is higher in KOH than in NaOH. The solubilities of these amino acids in electrolyte solutions containing either NaNO3 or KNO3 were also measured at 298.2 K. The effect of anions was determined by comparing these results, with those reported in the literature for the effect of NaCl and KCl. For each cation, the solubility is higher with nitrate than with chloride anion. This is the first systematic study reporting the effect of anions on the solubilities of amino acids in water.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vera, J.

As a result, an increase in the contact area of the femorotibial joint at high flexion angles is needed to decrease high contact stresses. At first, a morphometrical study was performed on 12 cadaveric distal femurs. A laser range finder device digitized their articular surfaces. A non-iterative algebraic algorithm was developed to reconstruct the medial and the lateral condyles in the sagittal plane by means of two circular arcs. The average geometry of all of the femoral condyles tested was then used to perform a parametric analysis which consists of studying the effect of the alterations of this geometry on the contact area extent of the joint. The results of this research indicate that a reduction of wear of the prosthesis cannot be achieved at high flexion angles without alterations of the current concepts of the design of knee prostheses.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ahmed, A.

The VR training system is being developed for use by the power station maintenance and electrical contractor personnel. In order for the trainee to perform correct and safe ground welding procedures under a variety of situations, visual cues representing those situations are necessary. Since there is a tradeoff between the realism and the interactivity in any real-time VR system, the challenge in implementing special effects in such a system is to develop a relatively realistic model that is also computationally efficient. The effects that are implemented include rain, snow, fog, sparking and explosion, snow accumulation, lightning, and the rotation of a background textured sky. The algorithms for the snow, rain, and sparks are derived from the theory of the particle systems. All special effects were then evaluated to ensure a suitable compromise between realism and interactivity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Malowang, A.

This residue is mainly comprised of n-alkanes and n-1-alkenes ranging in chain length of 15 to 45 carbon units and therefore resembles crude oil. The microorganisms investigated were: Y. lipolytica ATCC 8662, Y. lipolytica ATCC 20460, A. paraffineus ATCC 19558, P. aeruginosa PAO1, P. putida ATCC 12633, R. rhodochrous ATCC 21766 and Rhodococcus sp. ATCC 29671. It was found that all seven microorganisms tested were able to degrade the polyethylene thermolysis residue. Results suggest that R. rhodochrous produced a biosurfactant when growing on the polyethylene thermolysis residue. It was also found that the acclimation of the microorganism to the substrate was an important factor in the degradation of the residue. Using two different acclimation times, two different strains of R. rhodochrous were selected for in the acclimation step. The two different strains showed very different degradation patterns of the polyethylene thermolysis residue. Strain A showed almost no effect of chain length on the degradation rate of the hydrocarbons while the degradation rate of the hydrocarbons for strain B decreased with increasing chain length. This difference in the degradation pattern was attributed to the varying amounts of enzymes present in each strain. Another factor found to affect the degradation pattern was the liquidity of the polyethylene thermolysis residue.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooper, D.

Intermediate views are calculated using a linear filter with angle-dependent coefficients. Two existing disparity estimation algorithms are adapted to perform IVR, and results are used for parallax adjustment of still stereo images. In one case, the well-known block matching (BM) technique is used, and several novel algorithm enhancements are proposed. The final BM scheme employs three-component estimation, a spatial smoothness constraint, and a quadtree structure. A procedure for targeting problematic blocks that requires splitting based on robust estimation is proposed, and an efficient approach for the reestimation of sub-blocks is developed. A technique for eliminating component-mismatches in stereo pairs is also examined. The accuracy of estimations based on these "balanced" images is seen to increase. In the other case, the ill-posed problem of obtaining dense disparity maps is addressed, and the method of regularization is used to compute pixel-based vector fields for intermediate views. The conclusion is that although single image reconstruction results are comparable in both cases, the approach based on regularization is superior to the block-based scheme for a dynamic sequence of such reconstructions. Both approaches are applied to stereo parallax adjustment for still images, and numerous experimental results are included.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Konrad, Janusz</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mh66r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g719h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811km846"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Crystallization of gypsum in zinc sulphate solution</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lo, Nigel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this research is to use a mathematical model to study the removal of calcium in the form of gypsum from zinc sulphate solution by cooling from 80ºC to 30ºC in a batch crystallizer.

Using the simulation module developed, it is found that the removal of calcium can be improved by operating at a high temperature, which speeds up both the growth and nucleation kinetics, and produces a higher supersaturation by lowering the equilibrium molality of calcium ion in solution.

The simulation package was then used to study the dynamic behavior and to introduce a modified method for identification and control of cavity pressure in injection molding. The physically-based model of cavity pressure used in the simulation is based on the previous work of Rafizadeh [1996]. The open loop simulation results of the physically-based model are validated with previous experimental data to give a basis for simulating controlled behavior. This simulation package provides, therefore a convenient basis for other researchers to use Rafizadeh's theoretical results and extend the study into the areas of identification and control of the cavity pressure in injection molding. A new approach using off-line identification is introduced to obtain a time varying linear transfer function. Its theory, derivation and advantages over the previous approaches (Rafizadeh [1996] and Gao [1993]) are discussed. It is also applied to the simulation package to obtain the dynamic model used for the control. The control of the cavity pressure on simulation is studied by using generalized predictive control (GPC). The simulation shows superior results.

Accurate experimental CTE measurements were made using a high precision Thermomechanical Analyzer system. Silicon carbide reinforced composite average CTE values were bounded by two elastic CTE theoretical models consisting of Schapery and Kerner predictions over the 25--350ºC interval for reinforcement volume fractions between 10 and 40%.

The useful lifetime of the enzyme is limited by inactivation; however, the rate of enzyme inactivation is significantly lower in the presence of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG). Of the various molecular weight PEGs, PEG 35 000 provides the most protection to SBP from inactivation. The protective effect of PEG is related to molecular weight which is likely due to the unique manner in which PEG hydrates. Observations suggest that the protective mechanism relates to the interaction between PEG and the phenol polymers. The low biodegradability of PEG is a potential concern as half of the PEG added under optimum conditions will remain in solution in a batch treatment of phenol. The final particle size of the phenolic polymers is dependent upon PEG molecular weight as well as stir speed, yet PEG molecular weight affects inactivation of the enzyme while stir speed does not. Therefore, particle size is not directly related to inactivation of the enzyme. The kinetic model developed for HRP by Buchanan and Nicell (1997) was fit with batch reactor data using SBP both in the presence and absence of PEG. The model is able to predict the time-dependent phenol concentrations within the range commonly encountered in industrial effluents. For SBP, the model indicates that only one kinetic parameter is necessary to describe permanent inactivation of the enzyme.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Niceil, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f573j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tr50r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225d19q"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Packaging of surface active optoelectronic device arrays</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kabal, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Requirements of electronic systems are increasing, as the applications for these systems become more complex and require more bandwidth. Optical interconnection can help satisfy these system requirements. In order for an optical interconnect to be successful, system design must satisfy new demands on the packaging of the optically interconnected devices, different from those encountered in packaging electronic interconnects. This thesis addresses the issues faced in designing the packaging for a two-dimensional array of surface active optoelectronic devices, within the framework of a free-space optically interconnected backplane. Two demonstrator systems' packaging are presented, as well as a general discussion of the issues and constraints involved in the design, assembly and testing of this packaging. These issues include connectivity, bandwidth, thermal management, optomechanical interfacing and space constraints. The particular optoelectronic devices examined are Quantum Confined Stark Effect (QCSE) modulators and detectors. The impact of temperature sensitivity on these particular devices is examined, and a technique for optimizing their performance at a specific temperature is presented. As a thermal diagnostic aid, as well as a thermal management tool, the design and characterization of an array of temperature sensors integrated into an optoelectronic device array is presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Plant, David</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jn69p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225d19q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r056f"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Design and behaviour of eccentrically braced frames in moderate seismic zones</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Han, Xue Ming</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>EBF seismic design conforming to Clause 27 of CSA-S16.1-94 is described and a computer program to carry out the ductility design (EBFSD) was developed for this study. EBF design procedures for different seismic load levels are proposed. Twenty-two EBFs incorporating different link lengths, numbers of storey, and wind-to-earthquake load ratios are designed and analyzed for a moderate seismic zone. The loads controlling member selection in a frame are identified from various load combinations considered in the design phases. The extent of seismic overstrength design for an EBF in a moderate seismic zone is investigated. Enhanced strength of ductile links due to non-seismic loads may cause the ductility demands on the links to be reduced. The strengths. stiffness. and ductility of the frames with the resulting members from the proposed design procedures are investigated. A simple method of evaluating overall frame strength and ductility is outlined. Detailing of the links for moderate seismic loads is proposed based on the analytical results. The results indicate that EBF design with the proposed procedures is feasible and practical.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Redwood, Richard</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544br645.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r056f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject><dc:subject>Applied Mechanics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544br65f"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The osseous response to corundum blasted implant surfaces in a canine total hip arthroplasty model</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hacking, Steven Adam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the radiographic and histologic response. to corundum blasted implant surfaces of varying roughness in a canine total hip arthroplasty model. Three types of tapered femoral implants were made from titanium alloy and were identical in every respect except surface finish. The entire surface of the femoral implant possessed either a 2.9, 4.2 or 6.7 micrometer average surface roughness (Ra) from blasting with 60, 24, or 16 grit corundum particles, respectively. Staged bilateral total hip arthroplasties were performed such that each dog received a 60 grit on one side and a 24 grit or 16 grit implant on the contralateral side. Twenty-two stems in 11 dogs were evaluated at 6 months. The appearance of the bone implant interface was qualitatively characterized. Bone apposition and average bone-implant contact length were determined. Twenty-one of the stems demonstrated osseointegration while one stem developed a stable fibrous interface. All three types of corundum blasted implants demonstrated consistently high amounts of bone apposition, averaging 30.5%. Abundant new peri-implant bone consistently formed, particularly within the intramedullary canal where trabeculae spanned implant-cortical gaps up to 5 mm and established osseointegration ration. There was no statistical difference amongst bone apposition with the 60, 24, and 16 grit stems which averaged 31.7%, 32.0% and 27.9% respectively. However, the pattern of new bone formation was different in that the average length of each region of bone apposition for the 60 and 24 grit surfaces was 50% greater than that for the coarser 16 grit surface (p &lt; 0.02). Through detailed qualitative and quantitative radiographic and histologic elucidation of the osseous response to corundum blasted hip implant surfaces, this study provided new understanding of their potential for biologic fixation.

In addition to the efficient removal of these phenolic compounds, one should also be concerned with residual soluble by-products of the enzymatic reaction which may potentially exhibit higher toxicities than the parent phenols. In this investigation, a number of phenolic compounds were completely removed from solution using excess concentrations of soybean peroxidase and horseradish peroxidase. Partial treatment of phenol was also carried out using limited enzyme doses. Supernatants were characterized in terms of their acute toxicities using the 5-minute Microtox assay. The fully treated mixtures obtained from the enzymatic polymerization of 4-chlorophenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol were significantly more toxic than expected, while those obtained from the oxidation of 2-methylphenol, 2-chlorophenol, and phenol had residual toxicities which were higher than the initial toxicities of the corresponding untreated mixtures. GC and 14C radio-tracer analyses of the peroxidase-treated phenol solutions revealed that the total quantity of residual by-products was lowest when full treatment of the substrate was achieved. However, residual non-phenol toxicities were found to be lower in samples which had undergone only partial treatment. The residual effluent toxicities for the fully treated samples were observed to be independent of the initial phenol concentration.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s700g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741t941</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m897w"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>"Centrifuge modelling of LNAPL transport in partially saturated granular medium</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Esposito, Gennaro, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents the experimental modelling of Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids transport in partially saturated with water sand using centrifuge tests, which were carried out at the Geotechnical Centrifuge facility located at Delft Technical University (The Netherlands). The experimentation consisted of a two-dimensional three-phase flow (air, water, Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids) in an unsaturated sand for two values of porosity. The Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids used in this research was a multigrade motor oil. The modelling of a two-dimensional flow and the use of a transparent strongbox enabled the direct observations of the experiments. Scaling laws developed in connection with other studies available in the literature were used. Tests were conducted at two different gravity accelerations, 20g and 30g, in order to verify, by means of the "modelling of models " technique, the similitude between the different experiments. The thesis covers details of the experimental methodologies and the measurement techniques which where used to evaluate the final water and LNAPL content in the experiments.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Selvadurai, A.

Synchronous cultures of this organism were grown in a self-cycling fermentor (SCF). Application of a standard cycling scheme to the fermentor allowed for production of between 0.82 and 1.10 g/L of biosurfactant, depending on the rate of aeration to the system. Asynchronous cultures grown under the same operating conditions produced only 0.75 g/L of phospholipid. Extension of isolated fermentor cycles allowed for further increases in biosurfactant production by the synchronous culture. Extending a cycle for ninety minutes increased the phospholipid concentration to 1.44 g/L, without requiring additional hydrocarbon substrate. Placing broth harvested from standard SCF cycles in separate vessels and allowing the fermentation to continue allowed concentrations to rise to 1.89 g/L without additional hydrocarbon addition, and to 2.92 g/L with extra hexadecane substrate. Continual addition of hexadecane to the SCF caused biosurfactant production to cease, suggesting that the microorganism does not produce biosurfactant to increase the availabilty of insoluble hydrocarbon substrates.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooper, D.

In this work, magnetic carriers were prepared by coating an organic surfactant on magnetic particles. The coating was deposited by molecular self-assembly. Two coatings were tested, using two similar bolaamphiphiles* of different chain lengths, HS-(CH2)11-COOH and HS-(CH 2)15-COOH. The magnetic particles were nanosized maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3). The surfactants were synthesized and characterized. Magnetic carriers were prepared, characterized, and tested for metal ion loading. Molecular orientation, density, and stability of the surfactant coatings were characterized by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), wetting tests, and leaching tests. The coatings, resulting from the chemisorption of the surfactants on maghemite through carboxylate bonding, were found to be dense, well-packed, and resistant to acid and base attack. The potential use of coated particles for metal ion removal was assessed with Cu and Ag solutions. The metal ion uptake by the carriers was characterized by atomic adsorption and MRS. The influence of pH and metal concentration on adsorption was studied. Metal ion uptake was found to be dependent on pH, and was not significantly different for both types of coated carriers and for bare maghemite. The maximum loading capacity was low, at approximately 6 mg Cu/g particles for Cu. The similarity in loading for coated and bare particles needs further clarification. *Bolaamphiphiles are surfactants with a functional group at each end.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, Jim</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z312x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311r52c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p0969332"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Determination of zero-shear viscosity of molten polymers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Boudreault, Mélanie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Measuring the zero-shear viscosity of a molten polymer is not at all straightforward. Available rheometers are unable to operate at shear rates low enough to measure this important property, especially for polymers that have a very broad molecular weight distribution or a high degree of long chain branching. A new falling ball viscometer, the Magnetoviscometer (MVM), has recently been developed in Austria for the measurement of melt viscosity at very low shear rates. The primary objective of the research was to evaluate this instrument as a tool for the routine measurement of the zero-shear viscosity. Another objective was to develop a reliable and convenient method to prepare samples. Experiments performed near the maximum allowable stresses for various resins are in good agreement with dynamic data obtained using a rotational rheometer. The MVM allows for the measurement of viscosity in a range of shear rates not accessible to most rheometers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dealy, J.

LPC models the short-term spectral information for a block of speech using an all-pole response. Line spectral frequencies (LSF) have been found to be an effective parametric representation for the all-pole response. Vector quantization (VQ) is often used to code the coefficients of the response. VQ performs poorly whenever it is coding coefficient vectors which are not well matched to the distribution of its codebooks. A shift in the distribution can be caused by filtering (microphones, filters in communication equipment, etc.), speaker or environmental variability (male, female, background noise, etc.). In this thesis, we explore a method for matching the distribution of the vectors representing the incoming speech signal to the distribution of the codebooks. A novel mapping model based on the transformation of codebooks using the mean and the standard deviation of the distributions is used to increase the robustness of vector quantization. The mapping model is optimized in two ways---choosing the most suitable spectral parameter representation and seeking the best way to obtain the form of the mapping model. The effectiveness and limitations of this method are investigated through simulation of a split vector quantizer (SVQ) of the LPC coefficients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rabal, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nw724.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qb97r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
