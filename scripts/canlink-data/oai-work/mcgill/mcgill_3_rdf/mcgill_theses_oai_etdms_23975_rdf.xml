This was followed by the gradual implementation of a communist regime and its attendant atheist ideology in a region where over 80% of the population subscribed to protestantism. This thesis examines the policies of the SED towards the Protestant Church in Eastern Germany and attempts to define the various phases, motives, methods, and principles underlying that religious policy from 1945 to 1953. The SED's atheist ideology alone fails to explain all the measures taken with regard to the Church. The religious policy of the SED depended in large part on the overall political situation, on developments during the Cold War and Soviet projects aimed at Germany. While the SED ultimately sought to eliminate the Church, it was nonetheless prepared to solicit its support through compromise, when necessary for the stability of the regime.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hoffmann, Peter</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732d984h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q900</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands</dc:subject><dc:subject>Church and state -- Germany (East)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801ph04d"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Muslim women in Indonesia's politics : an historical examination of the political career of Aisyah Aminy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Rifai, Nurlena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the political participation of Muslim women since the colonial period into the New Order period. It is a study of the Indonesian women's movement in its different trends: the roles of women in gaining and defending Indonesian independence as well as in Indonesia's politics in the Liberal Democracy, Guided Democracy, and New Order periods. It investigates the reasons for the relatively limited participation of women in politics. This low level of political participation is indicated by the ratio of women membership in the House of People's Representatives (DPR, Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat), in the Consultative Assembly (MPR, Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat), and in the central boards of political organizations. This thesis also focuses on the political career and discourse of Aisyah Aminy, and examines her involvement as a case study. The prominence of Aisyah Aminy lies in her ability to transcend the barriers which usually obstruct Muslim women from getting involved in politics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turgay, A.

The data were gathered on Newfoundland's Grand Banks in 1992 using a dual-beam sonar system. In situ measures of target strength distribution are biased unless a correction is made for nonignorable missing data because high target strength fish can be detected more readily than low target strength ones. Two methods of correcting for the bias are described and implemented. Both methods use measured off-axis angle and rely on the accuracy of these angle measurements since they compare the distributions of measured and true off-axis angles. The first method involves varying the beam pattern threshold with the observed target strength of the fish. The second method uses a logistic model for the probability of detecting a fish given its target strength. The analysis in this thesis found several previously undocumented results. Firstly, it was demonstrated that off-axis angles measured with a dual-beam system do not correspond well with true ones, which makes the results of both methods dubious; secondly, measured off-axis angles are shown to be dependent on target strength, which suggests that the process of measuring off-axis angles could be improved by taking this into account, and finally, target strength measurements below about -34 dB are observed to be strongly dependent on characteristics of the dual-beam system.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f425p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569534j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Statistics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hj98x"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Some hydrologic and environmental benefits of water table management</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lalonde, Vincent</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A water table management field experiment was established and conducted on a sandy loam soil in 1991 and 1992. The effects of two water tables levels, as well as conventional drainage, on nitrate levels in drainage outflow were studied. The controlled water table levels were 25 and 50 cm above the drain. The experimental setup consisted of 9 monitored drains and 6 buffer drains. Plots were centred over the drains and were 115 m long by 18.69 m wide. Drain outflow, nitrate concentration in the drainage water, soil temperature, rainfall, and water table elevations were measured during the 1992 growing season. In July a solid set sprinkler irrigation system was installed and operated for a period of 2 weeks, to raise water table levels and induce nitrate leaching. It was impossible to maintain the 25 and 50 cm controlled water table levels for the entire 1992 growing season. Controlled drainage had a significant effect on subsurface dynamic outflow. The 25 and 50 cm controlled water tables were effective in reducing total drainage volume by 60% and 77%, respectively, compared to conventional drainage. Controlled drainage also had a significant effect on nitrate loss. The 25 and 50 cm controlled water tables reduced nitrate loss by 85% and 58%, respectively, during the July irrigation period, compared to conventional free outlet drainage. This was due to the reduced drainage volumes associated with controlled drainage.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483k123.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hj98x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Agricultural</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50ts383"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Oscillations, chaos, and crises in a model for cell replication</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Crabb, Rebecca</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, the dynamics of a mathematical model for cell replication in which there is simultaneous proliferation and maturation is studied. The cell population dynamics are described by a first order nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) in which there is retardation (delay) in both the temporal and maturation variables. The solution behaviour of the model is investigated for two different initial conditions $ varphi(x)$ = $x sp{n}$ for n $ gg$ 1 and n = 1, where x is the maturation variable. When n $ gg$ 1, the solutions are left moving fronts whose velocities are primarily dependent on the value of n and of the delay. Increasing the delay also causes oscillations to appear near the wave front. This type of solution behaviour can be associated with solitons. When n = 1 and other parameters are varied, the temporal solution goes through a period doubling route to chaos and exhibits crises and multistability while the spatial solution becomes increasingly structured.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mackey, M.

Solutions of MWL were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Changes in the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the lignin were assessed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). To elucidate the chemical changes induced in the lignin by irradiation, infrared (IR) and UV spectra of the irradiated solutions were also studied. Irradiation under nitrogen causes the formation of both high molecular weight (MW) condensation products and low MW fragments; whereas, irradiation under oxygen yields only low MW fragments, similar to those found under nitrogen. Since the formation of condensation products can be attributed to free radical coupling, it follows that oxygen is probably reacting with free radicals to form peroxyl free radicals thereby avoiding condensation to higher MW products. Finally, the chemical basis of the photoinduced changes in the MWD of the lignin are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Manley, R.

During the 1970's it achieved global popularity and is now produced in many locations around the world. In Montreal, reggae is produced by and for a cosmopolitan community; however, certain conceptions of the distinctiveness of this music as an effective intervention in social processes, derived from Rastafarian philosophy, are maintained by its performers. This thesis examines reggae song lyrics and elements of discourse about reggae music in relation to Rastafarian cultural practices, showing how the aesthetic conventions of the form involve a certain ritualization of musical activity that allows for the interpretation of aesthetic experience in terms of solidarity, resistance and historical progress.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rousseau, Jerome</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722h970x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g75r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music -- Social aspects -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rastafari movement -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reggae music -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f204t"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The acquisition of English functional categories by native speakers of Inuktitut</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Moss, Siobhan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Several current studies in language acquisition have focussed on the emergence of functional categories in first and second languages.

Results from specimens having different spandrel beam sizes and different amounts of torsional reinforcement in the spandrel beams provided a better understanding of their behaviour. The test specimens were heavily instrumented to enable detailed strain measurements in the slab bars, the joint region and the spandrel beam. These strains together with the crack pattern provide some insight into the flow of forces from the slab and spandrel beam into the joint region. The tests show that the effective width of the slab contributing to the negative bending of the main beam is affected by the torsional yielding of the spandrel beam. However, after this yielding, a different force mechanism, involving concrete compressive struts, and tension ties in the slab and spandrel beam bars, provides means of transferring additional forces from the slab bars to the joint region. It is important to consider the effect of these forces since they increase the negative moment capacity of the beams, and hence, they may affect the hierarchy of yielding between the columns and the beams. This effect may in turn alter the failure mode of the structure. Tentative design proposals, accounting for the flow of forces through the spandrel beam, are presented. The application of these proposals are illustrated for a number of different specimens having varying spandrel beam dimensions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, Denis</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h036t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w074d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246s88m"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Lack of detection of signal sequence receptor but not Calnexin in yeast</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fréchette, Claude</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The presence of homologues to the signal sequence receptor (SSR) and associated proteins, gp25L and calnexin was evaluated in yeast.

The thesis challenges three key assumptions underlying the programme, namely: (1) prostitutes in Kenya form a readily identifiable, homogenous social category; (2) medically, they are a source of HIV-infection, and a risk group due to their sexual activity; (3) once provided with knowledge about AIDS transmission and prevention, they have the incentive, and the means to modify their risk behaviour. The notions of "prostitution", "risk", and "responsibility", as assumed in the medical discourse of the programme, are contrasted with those found in the narratives of local health workers and the women involved in the programme. The incongruences in these sets of understandings have implications for the interpretation of epidemiological findings and the planning of AIDS prevention programmes in general. By lending an overall priority ranking to the risk factor of sexual behaviour, the epidemiological paradigm informing the programme masks social and economic co-factors placing women at risk, as well as the role of men in transmission of the HIV-virus. Further, the paradigm ignores important factors in the motivation of health behaviour, namely, the relative significance that women attribute to the risk of AIDS, as well as their envisaged control over health.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lock, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pb24p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cf11z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Working class women -- Kenya -- Thika -- Social conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical anthropology -- Kenya -- Thika</dc:subject><dc:subject>AIDS (Disease) -- Kenya -- Thika -- Prevention</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prostitutes -- Health risk assessment -- Kenya -- Thika</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f206c"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La thématique de l'éducation chez Stendhal et chez Sand</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Désilets, Nathalie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The 19th century French novel has a well-know model called Bildung Novel. The inspiration for this name comes from Wilhem Meister by Goethe published in 1795. In this type of writing we witness the education (Bildung) of a hero or a heroin who has to face and overcome a series of difficulties. In this memoire we will analyze the theme of education in the works of two authors Stendhal and George Sand. We have chosen two novels from each author, one dating back to the beginning of their career, and the other to the end. For Stendhal we have selected Le Rouge et le Noir (1830) and Lucien Leuwen (posthume publication 1894); Mauprat (1837) and La Ville Noire (1861) by Sand. In each novel we will analyze family education, intellectual and moral training, life experience and sentimental education successively in the same way the heros experience them. To do this we use thematic method which, as Jean Starobinski puts it, considers the theme as a unit of meaning of the novel. In the conclusion we will compare the results of our analyses in the works of Stendhal and George Sand.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, Gabrielle Pascal</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225b890.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f206c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stendhal, 1783-1842 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sand, George, 1804-1876 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bf84w"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Une vérification empirique de la théorie des caractéristiques des emplois appliquée aux directions d'école du Québec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Roy, Réal, 1944-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research wanted to test if the Job Characteristics Model was good to study school principals' motivation in the province of Quebec. To run the study, the Job Diagnostic Survey created by Hackman and Oldham was used to collect school principals data. To this questionnaire, a part was added to collect sociodemographic data. Using these data, one way analysis of variance was used to find out if there were significant differences between the means of school principals. The results obtained indicate that the Job Characteristics Model is not exactly the right means to study school principals' motivation. But the analysis of variance revealed some significant differences between the means of the school principals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barnabe, Clermont</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fm365.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bf84w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>School principals -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63sw69v"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Critical distance : politics between the Habermasian dualisms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Burkart, Patrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explores Jurgen Habermas's dualist, system and action methodology of the social sciences as a continuation of Frankfurt School critical theory. It also interprets it as a reworking of this tradition. First, it lays out the criteria and models Habermas uses for a theory of rational modern progress, and relates these ideals to his empirical political theory of practice in the public sphere (Chapter One). Then, it looks for positivisms and objectivisms in the project that threaten its critical function (Chapter Two). Finally, it illustrates these positivisms at work in Habermas's dualist theory of new social movements (Chapter Three). Habermas's dialogue with new social movement theory illuminates some hidden instrumentalisms in his critical theory of society.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Meadwell, Hudson</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pn74m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw69v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Habermas, Jürgen</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75dd21j"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Liberalism and nationalism in the world trade market</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lin, Zeng, 1953-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyzes the dialectical relations of economic liberalism and nationalism. Four arguments are made: (1) the international economic order is the product of the intercourse between liberalism and nationalism; (2) world trade expansion is conditioned by the rise of protectionism; (3) the formation of regional trading blocs sets up a bridge between regional liberalism and GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariff); (4) the success of development is determined by the results of the crystallization of the nation-state. The arguments of this paper develop from abstract to specific. In the first part, the philosophical foundations of liberalism and nationalism are given attention. Both forces are regarded as the foundations of modern international relations, the success of one side depending on the other. In this connection, Ruggie's (1982) "embedded liberalism" is extended to the whole range of modern history. The three theories are also reviewed with respect to their ideologic commitments. The rapprochement of nationalism and liberalism implies that their originally one-sided standpoints need modification. In the second part of this thesis, empirical analyses are introduced. The different state patterns, such as free capitalism and state socialism, are regarded as the results of crystallization (Mann, forthcoming). The rise of protectionism and regionalism reflect the erosion of the existing international relations. Successful nationalism could set up the foundation for the solid development of liberalism under the political framework of democracy, which could alter the existing international relations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Su, Tieting</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kh28r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dd21j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>International trade</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Economic aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liberalism -- Economic aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fc48c"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>African countries and the conventions on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Amlak, Mehari Gebre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In recent decades, hazardous waste generation has increased in industrialized countries, and disposal facilities, especially landfill spaces, have become scarce and therefore more expensive. As a result, exports of hazardous waste to developing countries, especially to Africa grew considerably due to low cost of "disposal". African countries lack the legal and industrial set-ups and technical capacity to dispose of the waste safely. In an attempt to control such exports, African countries adopted the Bamako Convention in January, 1991. The Convention was modelled on the Basel Convention, an instrument adopted earlier on the same subject, but at a global level. Except with respect to certain issues like clean production methods, non-polluting technology and inter-African trade in hazardous waste, the Bamako and Basel Conventions are identical and contain similar shortcomings. On account of Africa's reality, however, the Bamako Convention should have approached the problem of transboundary movements of hazardous waste within the context of a comprehensive legal, economic, political, ethical and environmental strategy. Reliance on people's participation, regional environmental assessment and co-operation with industrialized countries should have been emphasised. Furthermore, African countries should have sought solutions at global, regional and national levels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brunnee, Jutta</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182m02g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc48c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2f75r8722"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The design and implementation of a three dimensional computerized treatment planning system</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Comeau, Roch</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An efficient and productive radiation treatment planning (RTP) system must make use of both appropriate visualization techniques and good user interface design. The suitability of several visualization techniques have been examined in the context of 3-D radiation treatment planning. These techniques include wire frame, surface rendering, volume rendering and a subset of volume rendering: reformatting of data. A rudimentary computerized RTP system was written using the most appropriate visualization techniques examined earlier. These techniques were used to display the anatomical data acquired from computed tomography (CT) scanners, the beam position within the anatomy, and finally, the dose distributions resulting from the entered plan. The program was written in ANSI C and runs on a Silicon Graphics Personal Iris UNIX workstation. The system makes use of effective user interface tools and efficient code which results in an efficient and interactive system. The accuracy of the system is verified by comparing dose profiles obtained with film dosimetry and from the computer calculations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fallone, B.
