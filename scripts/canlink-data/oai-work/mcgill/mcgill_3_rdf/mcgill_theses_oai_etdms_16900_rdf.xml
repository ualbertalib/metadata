However, the exploitation of the forests for the manufacture of pulp and paper is relatively recent. For only in the 1860's were commercial methods for making pulp from wood developed. Prior to this, a pulp and paper industry had been growing in a small way, but based on cotton and rags. Information on this early development is very scanty.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brecher, I.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451n29s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945v50g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pr47b"><ual:graduationDate>1960</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agriculture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of Uromyces Phaseoli var. typical (Arthur) infection on photosynthate translocation in Phaseolus vulgaris L.</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hampson, Michael. C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The elucidation of the nature of host pathogen relations is a problem of great theoretical and practical importance. One of the most promising lines of research for this problem seems to be in the field of physiological studies, in which the affects of infection on the metabolism of a host plant are studied. In most cases, metabolic studies which have been carried out on the nature of disease had to be performed on detached organs, detachment of which prevents the movement of materials in and/or out or the organ from taking place, i.e. prevents translocation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pelletier, R.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fm81k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pr47b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plant Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920g1435"><ual:graduationDate>1960</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Radar attenuation estimates from raingauge statistics</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hamilton, Paul. M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The attenuation of radar weather signals by intervening precipitation is difficult to estimate by radar methods. Rainfall rates observed at a point in the path of a storm approximate those along a section through the storm; this is the basis in estimating attenuation frequencies at 3.2 cm wavelength for a summer’s storms at Montreal. It has been found that attenuation along a radar path increases with increasing target intensity: expected attenuation over a 30 mi path at 3 mm hr-1 is 3 db, at 80 mm hr- 1 is 14 db. Power can overcome the limitations imposed by attenuation upon the radar as an indicator of the presence or absence of precipitation. But quantitative observations are difficult; and so attenuation gravely limits the 3.2 cm wavelength radar in a role as a severe-storm indicator.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s850w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920g1435</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Meteorology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nm85m"><ual:graduationDate>1960</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Health Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hydralazine, L-norepinephrine, and hydrocortisone in the treatment of haemorrhagic shock</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hakstian, Robert.

This concept was reiterated by Moyer who made the point that death and morbidity in severe hypovolemic shock is undoubtedly due to a lack of perfusion of vital organs but that simple replacement of fluids is not enough to renew this flow.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gurd, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sn96d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nm85m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Experimental Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
