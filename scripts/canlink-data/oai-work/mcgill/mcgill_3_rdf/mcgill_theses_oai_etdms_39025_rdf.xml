Antonio (Giuseppe Antonio)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene during normal and pathological bone development was studied. The regulation of c-fos expression in bone cells by calcitriol and its contribution to the etiology of fibrous dysplasia was addressed. We have shown that treatment of osteoblasts with calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, transiently stimulated the expression of c-fos, fos-B, c-jun and jun-B in a specific and dose-dependent manner. The expression of the Fos protein correlated with the expression of the c-fos gene. Finally, calcitriol appeared to modulate c-fos transcription in osteoblasts, whereas it stimulated c-jun and jun-B expression by a post-transcriptional mechanism distinct from mRNA stabilization. The transcriptional stimulation of c-fos was explored further and we identified a novel vitamin D response element (VDRE) in the c-fos promoter. We report that a 36 bp sequence centered around position-161 upstream of the c-fos transcription start site is responsive to 1,25-(OH)$ rm sb2D sb3$ in osteoblastic cells. This sequence binds the VDR, and mutations that abrogate binding to this element also abolish transcriptional activation by 1,25-(OH)$ sb2D sb3,$ demonstrating that we have identified a functional VDRE. Structure-function analysis revealed that the c-fos VDRE has an unusual structure that does not correspond to the classical direct repeat (DR)-type elements. Supporting this observation, our results show that the VDR requires a novel dimerizing partner to bind the c-fos VDRE. Finally, we report increased expression of c-fos in bone lesions from patients with fibrous dysplasia. The elevated c-fos mRNA levels were detected only in fibrous dysplasia lesions and not in samples from patients with other bone diseases where high bone turnover and fibrous marrow tissue are present. Our results support the implication of c-fos in the etiology of fibrous dysplasia.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Arnaud, Rene St</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jt14k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jn40q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akw52j987n"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Striving to care : a qualitative study of stress in nursing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Carnevale, Franco A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study advances current explanations of stress in nursing. Research reports have documented a broad range of stressors experienced by nurses. This study was motivated by the scarce agreement across studies regarding how these stressors affect nurses and how they are managed by nurses. Virtually all studies of stress in nursing have been based exclusively on self-report data. As well, no studies have been documented regarding the enrichments of nursing that may serve to offset the effects of stress among nurses. A phenomenological method was used in this study in order to obtain rich descriptions of nurses' experience of stress and enrichment within their workplace. Twelve nurses were recruited, six from an intensive care unit and six from a medical unit, in a university-teaching general hospital. These nurses were observed while working on their units and then subsequently interviewed. The principal sources of stress reported were "conflict with the physicians," "complex patient care situations," and "shortstaffing." The coping strategies employed to manage these were "drawing on support" and "stressor-specific strategies." The principal sources of enrichment observed were "the patient" and "the team." A central developmental phenomenon was uncovered that described the nurses' overall attempts to manage their work stress, which has been named "striving to care." The informants' early career was characterized by reports of self-sacrifice, followed later by reports of disenchantment, which sometimes led to a discovery of "relational mutuality." This process resembles the psychological development of women described by Carol Gilligan. Implications for counselling research and practice are outlined in relation to the experience of nurses. These are also related to the broader counselling literature that addresses issues in the work of women and female-dominated occupations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xw938.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j987n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nurses -- Job stress</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nursing -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801pj27x"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The effect of encapsulated hepatocytes on hyperbilirubinemia in Gunn rats characterized by a deficiency of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bruni, Silvia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Free and microencapsulated hepatocytes in an alginate-polylysine-alginate artificial membrane (APA), were implanted intraperitoneally into the Gunn rat, the animal model for Crigler-Najjar syndrome, to reduce serum bilirubin level. Hepatocytes from guinea pigs, Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats whether free or microencapsulated were equally effective in lowering serum bilirubin levels in the Gunn rat. Buffalo rat hepatocytes however, were immunorejected unless microencapsulated. Decrease in serum bilirubin was concomitant with the appearance of conjugated bilirubin in the bile of Gunn rats as demonstrated by HPLC analysis. Microcapsules containing guinea pig hepatocytes showed less fibrosis than microcapsules containing hepatocytes from different strains of rats and empty microcapsules. In the Gunn rat there is significant accumulation of bilirubin in various tissues which affects the net removal of bilirubin upon implantation of the encapsulated hepatocytes. This deposition increases with time and it is organ-dependent. The kinetic data of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) indicated that it is a multisubunit enzyme in which there is cooperative binding of the substrate to the subunits. The binding of bilirubin showed positive cooperativity while the binding of UDPGA exhibited kinetics with mixed cooperativity. Encapsulated hepatocytes when incubated with bilirubin and UDP-glucuronic acid can form bilirubin conjugates. This was shown by HPLC analysis.The comparison of UDPGT activity between liver homogenate, intact hepatocytes and encapsulated hepatocytes showed that there is mass transfer resistance of the APA membrane.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pf90k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pj27x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666651n"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Safeguarding Mother Tamil in multicultural Quebec : Sri Lankan legends, Canadian myths, and the politics of culture</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brunger, Fern M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I examine the concept of "culture" being promoted in the Canadian policy of multiculturalism and by Tamil refugees safeguarding their culture in Quebec.

This research addresses popular "multiculturalism" movements which use anthropological notions of culture but fail to problematize the notion of culture itself. I illustrate how and why the concept of culture is itself culturally embedded and historically shaped, and thus dense with political implications. It also addresses anthropological approaches which avoid realist ethnography because of its political implications. I argue that a focus on culture in its relation to power is necessary in order to examine anthropology's own continuing involvement in imperialism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lock, Margaret</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rg412.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666651n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tamil (Indic people) -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Montr√©al -- Ethnic identity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multiculturalism -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Politics and culture -- Qu√©bec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wf74q"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Column flotation froths</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yianatos, Juan B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A fundamental study on the behaviour of flotation column froths is presented. Three main aspects were considered: hydrodynamic, cleaning (rejection of hydraulically entrained particles) and selectivity (separation between particles of different hydrophobicity). Column froth hydrodynamics were studied in a two phase (gas-liquid) system. A model to estimate gas holdup from electrical conductivity was developed. Bubble coalescence was evaluated by means of local measurement of gas holdup and bubble size distribution, consequently bubble surface loss along the froth was determined. Mathematical models are developed to describe liquid entrainment and drainage throughout the froth. The cleaning action was evaluated by monitoring feed water penetration at different levels in the froth, which corresponds to the boundary (worst) condition of fine particles entrainment. Laboratory and plant-scale tracer tests showed that the main cleaning action occurs close to the froth/collection zone interface. Local grade and solids percentage along column froths, together with a mathematical model describing mass transport, was used to analyse mineral selectivity in column froths. Quantification of mineral loss from the froth, due to detachment and cleaning, is presented. A generalized model to describe particle settling against a bubble swarm was developed. Entrainment and segregation of particles in the wake of bubbles gives insight into the characteristics of the pulp entering the froth in a flotation column.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qt96f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wf74q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Flotation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579v193"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hustling to survive : social and economic change in a south Louisiana Black Creole community</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Maguire, Robert E.

It begins with slavery and emphasizes the last 40 years. The study area is viewed as a creole society set in the United States. Change and adaptation is analysed from the perspective of those lacking access to, and control over, resources ensuring socio-economic advancement. Factors of race and ethnicity are crucial to the analysis. Changes in the agricultural economy have cast blacks off the land. In local settlements, they form a surplus labor pool. In today's industrial, neoplantation economy, Civil Rights legislation and alliances beyond the study area have ensured black participation, particularly at a textile mill, resulting in fragile prosperity. Their dual Afro-Creole identity, viewed through language, music, and food, faces a questionable future as alliances external to the creole society are strengthened.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vw06r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579v193</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social mobility -- Louisiana -- Saint Martin Parish</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saint Martin Parish (La.) -- Population</dc:subject><dc:subject>Creoles -- Louisiana -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>African Americans -- Louisiana -- Economic conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>French language -- Louisiana</dc:subject><dc:subject>African Americans -- Louisiana -- Social conditions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514nn318"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The dissolution of niobium and zirconium in liquid steel</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sismanis, Panagiotis G., 1959-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The dissolution rates of niobium and zirconium cylinders in liquid steel have been measured in a 'dynamic way', with the help of a data acquisition and process control facility. Two distinct periods were identified; the steel shell period and the free dissolution period. Lower bath superheats allowed a reaction to take place at the steel shell/niobium interface while higher superheats didn't; the intermetallic compounds Fe$ sb 2$Nb and Fe$ sb 2$Nb$ sb 3$ were identified as the reaction products. Niobium dissolved relatively slowly in liquid steel and its dissolution speed was increased under dynamic conditions (i.e., inductively stirred baths). In the case of zirconium, an exothermic reaction occurred at the steel shell/zirconium interface and the intermetallics Fe$ sb 2$Zr and FeZr$ sb 2$ were identified as the reaction products. This reaction was triggered at 1220 K by the formation of a liquid Fe-Zr (76 at% Zr) eutectic. For the experimental conditions under which this study was performed, the hydrodynamic conditions of the steel baths did not seem to influence the dissolution rates of zirconium. A simplified mathematical model was used in order to simulate the coupled heat and mass transfer phenomena which take place during the two periods.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848s467.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nn318</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zirconium alloys</dc:subject><dc:subject>Niobium alloys</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel alloys</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62fb27n"><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Microbial products in enhanced oil recovery</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Ramsay, Juliana Akit</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956h84x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62fb27n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Secondary recovery of oil -- Microbiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dh70v"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Loss unlimited : sadness and originality in Wordsworth, Pater, and Ashbery</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Khalip, Jacques</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sadness in literature has often been thematically interpreted as an indication of literary originality. Notions of solitude, silence, and alienation contribute to the idea that melancholy benefits the introspective work of the artist. But it is also possible to explore sadness as a more complex literary phenomenon, one that expands the dimensions of affect and influences possibilities of aesthetic and ethical renovation that gesture beyond the usual themes of melancholy and solitude. Sadness thus does not come to be conceived as merely an aspect of mourning, but as a structure of loss that is intrinsic to our concept of the world's composition and insufficiencies. The energies that surround the experience of sadness measure the degree to winch many writers have been able to develop their sense of unhappiness into a way of charting the difficulties and transformative power of their own labours. As well, sadness in literature can be seen as illuminating a loss that writers generate in order to achieve through their art the possibility of aesthetic and even social reparation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McSweeney, Kerry</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773x653.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dh70v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sadness in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pater, Walter, 1839-1894 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wordsworth, William, 1770-1850 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ashbery, John -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rq667"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Digital recursive filters : a tutorial for filter designers with examples implemented in Csound and supercollider</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Katsianos, Themis G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Filters constitute an essential tool for manipulating the spectral content of a signal.

Eleven highly trained male endurance athletes (average VO2max = 72.5 +/- 4.3 ml/kg/min) performed three intense interval running workouts of 10 x 400m at an average running velocity of 357.9 +/- 9.0 m/min, with a minimum of 4 days between runs. Recovery duration between trials was randomly assigned at 60s, 120s, and 180s. The following biomechanical variables were used to assess running kinematics during the last 3 minutes prior to and following each workout at speeds of 200 and 268m/min: maximum knee flexion in support (KFLEX), minimum knee velocity during stance (KVEL), maximum plantar flexion angle at toe-off (PFLEX), shank angle at heel strike (SANG), mean trunk angle during stride cycle (TANG), mean vertical oscillation of center of mass (VOSC), and stride cycle length (SL). Results of this study affirmed our hypothesis that speed significantly impacts on some kinematic variables (KVEL, SANG, SL), and to a degree has shown that pre and post test and recovery conditions creating a fatigued state altered 2 of the kinematic variables (KVEL and VOSC). However, none of the other kinematic variables measured were altered by speed or fatigue in any substantial way, nor were there any clear correlations between changes in running economy and mechanics. Whether the significant kinematic changes that occurred reflect adaptations to fatigue, rather than a failure to compensate for it, is not clear. The interrelationship between metabolic and biomechanical markers of training and performance appears to be complex and somewhat individualistic.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pearsall, D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784n64v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462737p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human mechanics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Running -- Training</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2j62s675b"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La participation dans un projet local de gestion des d√©chets : √©tude de cas √† Curitiba, la capitale √©cologique du Br√©sil</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Doucet Donida, Andrea</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study attempts to clarify questions concerning the validity of participatory strategies by comparing the practical results with the theoretical objectives.

It examines first the historical factors that played a significant role in the development of Kasravi's socio-religious consciousness and his keen interest in religion. Secondly, it explores the intellectual contexts of his religious thought---its origins, the controversial nature of it, the original aspects of it, the reaction of the clergy and intellectuals of the time to it, and its significance and impact on the coming generations. Finally, the key concepts of Kasravi's socio-religious ideology and some major current misunderstandings of them are examined.

In particular, it explores the issues of what training themes and activities can best prepare community organizers to participate in the development process. The research constitutes an actual 6-week training program for young rural Guatemalan women studying to become community leaders. As the field practice of the training, the students undertook a week-long community survey with women in four rural communities of Huehuetenango province. This thesis recounts the training and community survey experience and analyses it in order to consider implications for further research and application in community development training.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jackson, Nancy</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237ht74g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10ws299</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Community education -- Guatemala</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Education -- Guatemala</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053j05r"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Ibn Sƒ´nÃÑƒÅ and mysticism : a reconsideration</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Anwar, Etin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ibn Sina has been the object of many contemporary studies, all of which have attempted to examine various angles of the possible connection between Ibn Sina and mysticism. These studies, however, have not fully explored Ibn Sina's understanding of mysticism; he is generally seen as the most rational philosopher who ever lived and, therefore, unlikely to have been a mystic in any sense. In response to this claim, the present study aims to reconsider Ibn Sina's connection with mysticism and to examine his own perception of this tradition. This thesis first looks at the various factors which may possibly have contributed to Ibn Sina's mystical thought. Two of these were his spiritual consciousness and the Shi'ite milieu of his times. The intellectual tradition in which Ibn Sina lived, and his exposure to different aspects of Islamic intellectual tradition, were another factor that shaped his mystical thought. This thesis also attempts to reread Ibn Sina's mystical works in order to reveal his methodological perspective on mysticism. Ibn Sina incorporates mystical experience in a symbolic narrative into his work. He also theorized about mystical experience, using SÃ£ufi terms like mystical knowledge ('irfan) and love ('ihsq), and tried to explain these experiences in a systematic fashion. Ibn Sina's main contribution to the field of mysticism is his attempt to reconcile and to connect the different traditions of Neoplatonism, gnosticism, and SÃ£ufism. It is remarkable how these ideas fit into a common framework---that of mysticism. These ideas may possibly stem from his close understanding of and sympathy with SÃ£ufi discourse. Ibn Sina also contributed to a new literary genre in SÃ£ufi literature, most notably in his visionary recitals, which express a sort of mystical experience.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Landolt, Hermann</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k705x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053j05r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mysticism -- Islam</dc:subject><dc:subject>Avicenna, 980-1037 -- Views on mysticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33rz53s"><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>"A profound edge" : the margin as a place of possibility and power, or, Revisioning the post-colonial margin in Caribbean-Canadian literature</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Batson, Sandra</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explores the literary representations of the post-colonial margin, and develops this site as a place of possibility to transform self identity and acquire power. This exploration of Caribbean-Canadian literature, from writers born in the Caribbean who emigrated to Canada indicates the potential for power in the margins without idealizing this space. Close readings of fiction by Neil Bissoondath, Dionne Brand and Marlene Nourbese Philip illustrate various struggles within the margin based on race, gender, economics, and education. Despite vast ideological differences regarding identity, all three authors concur in their characterizations of the margin. In each work, the margin is not a monolithic entity, but rather a diverse space which allows for the constitution of various identities. This textual analysis in conjunction with critical analysis also addresses issues of language appropriation and cultural ghettoization, by critiquing the right of one group to speak for another in a racially mixed society such as Canada, as well as by critiquing the homogeneity of identity within one racial group. Ultimately, by illuminating these textual and critical trends, this study looks toward possible future directions for Caribbean-Canadian literature.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rimstead, Roxanne</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784n654.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33rz53s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canadian literature -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Caribbean literature (English) -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494b333"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A tale of two videos : media event, moral panic and the Canadian Airborne Regiment</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Armstrong, Martha, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines how and why two amateur videos, broadcast across Canada in 1995, contributed to the disbandment of the Canadian Airborne Regiment. A brief history of the Airborne highlights discipline problems that were known to exist before the videos were broadcast. Common assumptions about images, particularly amateur video images, are explored. The concept of the "media event" is used to show how mediation magnified the videos' impact. A detailed examination of the videos and their constructions as news stories demonstrates how narrative frames and the newsmaking process in general shaped what the public saw. A general content analysis of the media coverage surrounding the videos shows how a moral panic developed when Canadian values were threatened. It is argued that the videos and reaction to them shed more light on attitudes Canadians wanted to keep hidden than they did on any secrets the military harboured.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Straw, Will</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj29g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494b333</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada.

It posits that the political mobilization of sub-national groups cannot be understood without an examination of the cultural processes of identity formation. The analysis engages cultural discourse and its organization as an explanatory factor in the examination of the variation in ethnic political outcomes. Hence, important questions about ethnonational conflict can be answered by engaging the levels at which identity is constructed and reshaped through cultural discourse. It shifts the arena of analysis from the state to the ethnic groups themselves. The two empirical cases analyzed are that of Sikh nationalism in Punjab and 'ethnic' Assamese nationalism in Assam.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Subramanian, Narendra</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dp35q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w9371</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Punjab (India) -- Politics and government</dc:subject><dc:subject>Assam (India) -- Politics and government</dc:subject><dc:subject>Assam (India) -- Ethnic relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>India -- History -- Autonomy and independence movements</dc:subject><dc:subject>Punjab (India) -- Ethnic relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sikhs -- India -- Punjab -- Ethnic identity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ethnicity -- Political aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xk53j"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La chanson d'Eve : counterpoint in the late of Faur√©</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Flint, Catrena M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the field of musicology, most commentators agree that the late style of Gabriel Faure is highly contrapuntal. At the same time, no systematic or generally accepted methodology exists for the discussion of the way in which Faure combines individual lines, except for Robert Orledge's brief enumeration of Faure's preferred procedures with respect to such things as time and interval of entry. In this thesis, I develop a method for examining counterpoint in selected songs from the late-style song cycle, La Chanson d'Eve. This is based on historical information concerning Faure's education, his pedagogical habits, and his comments concerning the composition of Penelope which was written during the same time period as the songs. This methodology is then applied to an examination of the interaction between the voice and piano, something Orledge has referred to as the "Themeless Contrapuntal Duet." Since Faure himself claimed that he combined motives according to the poetic context, I have also tried to show instances in which their content may be influenced by the text. Finally, I show how these cells of simultaneously sounding motives may be used to create a larger sense of form.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b0829.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xk53j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Faur√©, Gabriel, 1845-1924.

They can be distinguished by their unusual style which presents a multitude of literary devices that closely resemble mistakes and are seldom found in Gary's other writings. The present study attempts to explain this particular style by the author's desire to create a truly "total novel" as discussed in Pour Sganarelle, an essay that presents Romain Gary's approach to the art of writing. The greater part of this analysis is dedicated to the examination of Ajar's style and will expose the lexical, logical and syntactic characteristics of the four works, in an effort to establish how these literary devices not only contribute to the creation of a particular literary style, but bring forth what can be defined as an entirely new form of literary language.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rivard, Yvon</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gv58q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rg42b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gary, Romain -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g466j"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Animated writing</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Fisher, Matt, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Using an animation program on a Macintosh computer, I have animated poems, song lyrics and expressions in an experimental way to investigate alternatives to the restrictive poetics of the static medium of paper.

To commence, a I shall recount a brief history of "evangelicals," tracing the movement from its origins in early sixteenth century Europe at the time of the Protestant Reformation to the present. A four point theological characterization of the contemporary evangelical movement will be outlined. Drawing upon a spectrum of evangelical commentators, leaders and events, I consider the impulses that most typically comprise the evangelical ethos in Canada. Martin Luther's theology of the cross will then be presented and shown to be an appropriate lens through which to consider evangelicalism, given a common heritage in the Reformation.

The cunner trypsin fraction exhibited exceptional capacity to hydrolyze native proteins versus the bovine trypsin. Incubation of native PME with cunner or bovine trypsin resulted in a loss of 75% or 35% in PME activity respectively. Similarly, a 75% or 55% loss in PPO activity was observed after treatment with cunner and bovine trypsin respectively. Bovine trypsin, however, hydrolyzed the heat-denatured PME and PPO better than the cunner trypsin. Also, there was no reactivation of both PME and PPO activity after treatment with either the cunner or bovine enzyme during storage at 4$ sp circ$C for 3 weeks. However, PPO retained up to 20% or 50% of the initial activity after treatment with cunner or bovine trypsin, respectively. A 3 x 3 factorial design involving the factors of temperature, enzyme concentration and incubation time carried out gave an r$ sp2$ of 0.92 and 0.95 for cunner and bovine trypsin treated PME respectively. On the other hand, an r$ sp2$ of 0.91 and 0.94 was obtained for the combined effects using cunner and bovine trypsin for PPO inactivation. Validation of the model of PME inactivation measured as the % cloud remaining revealed that the cunner trypsin fraction upheld the cloud stability of cloud juice better than bovine trypsin, with cunner trypsin retaining more than 90% of the cloud whereas the juice treated with bovine trypsin only resulted in a 70% retention of the juice cloud.
