elementary children of Caribbean background in Montreal. Several studies show that these children tend to do poorly in Canadian schools. Research indicates that a significant variable in the home environment which influences school performance is the aspirations of parents for their children. The aspirations can be manifested through parental encouragement and are influenced by factors such as culture, class and/or ethnicity. A sample of 20, English speaking West Indian parents agreed to participate in this research. An interview protocol was used to collect the data by telephone. The semi-structured interview was based on questionnaires used in similar studies and from issues emerging from the literature review. The findings show that despite West Indian parents' high aspirations, their socioeconomic and/or ethnic status influence the outcome. They feel disadvantaged in a society where the realization of their perceptions of success are dependent on their ethnic status vis-a-vis the dominant group. Despite human rights legislation and multicultural policy, these parents anticipated racial and socioeconomic disadvantages for their children. The language factor in Quebec is seen as compounding the problem for English speaking Canadians of Caribbean origin.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53ww92d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g127g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>West Indian Canadians -- Education, Elementary -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930bz354"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A model of moral education : the Euthanasia trial</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marx, Mauryne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A model of moral education generally includes a conception of morality, a theory about how moral development can be encouraged, and pedagogical strategies designed to facilitate moral development in educational settings. The Euthanasia Trial is a model of moral education which is based on the concept of morality as a combination of caring, judging and acting. Morality begins with a compassionate concern for life; this feeling triggers the psychological ability to consider the interests of others. Caring and empathy alone, however, are not enough. In order to resolve moral conflicts there must also be an ability to reason, to evaluate conflicting interests in the light of certain criteria or principles. Guided by these reasoned judgments, moved by a sense of caring, morality culminates in decisive action. The Euthanasia Trial attempts to integrate these three components of morality in a multi-faceted project designed for senior high school students. Philosophical dialogues develop the pupils' reasoning abilities; dramatic roles engage their emotional responses; and emphasis on cooperative learning throughout the project provides students with concrete opportunities to practice moral behavior.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z893b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bz354</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Trials (Euthanasia)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Euthanasia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053h09n"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Temporal assimilations during bi-manual movements in non-impaired and Parkinsonian individuals</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Manal, Kurt T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>When bi-lateral movements of differing difficulty are performed as rapidly as possible the "easier" of the two limbs slows down and is attracted to the temporal structure of the more difficult movement. Simultaneous movements are expected to be severely compromised in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Parkinsonians elicit temporal assimilations in the belief that an assimilatory response may facilitate simultaneous bi-lateral control in PD. Temporal attractions were elicited by the non-impaired subjects during the bi-lateral task. The increased movement duration of the "easy" limb was the consequence of a contralateral motor command interference. The Parkinsonians failed to generate sufficient contralateral shoulder torque to interfere with the metrical structure of the "easier" task comprising the bi-lateral movements. These observations suggest that temporal assimilations elicited by this class of movements are the result of a motor command interference and not the effect of a restructuring of the movements metrics.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g128r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053h09n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Parkinson's disease</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motor ability</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580n71x"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A reading of 'Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau"</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Martin, Neill</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Browning's long dramatic monologue Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau was published in 1871. No second edition was required. General critical opinion judges the poem a failure both in conception and execution. It has not been anthologised since the beginning of the century and survives only as academic property. After a summary of existing criticism, the historical and biographical background is examined and a possible motivation for the poem's appearance is suggested. This is followed by what is certainly the first in-depth study of the manuscript. Close examination contributes to our understanding of the mechanics of Browning's poetry. The bulk of the thesis is devoted to a close reading of the poem, a disentangling of the syntax which, apart from the poem's length, seems to be the main reason for its unpopularity. A short conclusion argues for the poem's restoration to the canon.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429b38v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580n71x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Browning, Robert, 1812-1889.

There they are used as substitutes to traditional materials for walls and roofs, scarce or unaffordable in urban areas. However, they are also used as a means to repair or protect dilapidated materials and building components. Recycled consumer items are neither accepted nor regarded as standard building materials. Nevertheless, builders continue to use them, recognizing the existence of a market where they are regarded as alternative materials in housing. The use of these materials is defined by the users' needs and priorities. However, the decision-making process also depends on availability in the market, opportunity cost of the products, the performance of each material and its perceived aesthetic and social value within the community. In the process their use has created complex supply networks that deliver building materials according to local supply and demand. Based on a field study, this thesis presents the recycled consumer items used for the provision of housing in a squatter settlement. All the recycled non-conventional materials found are recorded according to their uses in the dwelling units, classified according to building types. Later on these materials are classified and analyzed according to their properties, their provision and acquisition.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv679.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wh12k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Building materials -- Dominican Republic -- Santo Domingo</dc:subject><dc:subject>Waste products as building materials -- Dominican Republic -- Santo Domingo</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m771j"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Muscle preservation in denervation injury using continuous implantable electrical stimulation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thomas, Daniel Stewart</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Using a dog model, two experimental groups were defined. In group 1, the common peroneal nerve of the right hind limb was cut and repaired microsurgically 12 cm from the tibialis anterior muscle (fast muscle). Electrodes (applied to the muscle) and an Itrel pulse generator were implanted, and electrical stimulation (ES) was delivered at 85 Hz,.45 msec pulse duration, 10.5 V, 1.5 sec every 24 sec (n = 4). Group 2 was similar except there was no ES (n = 5). Comparing the experimental side to the normal contralateral muscle, ES versus no ES resulted in a preservation of muscle weight--73% vs 39% (p $&lt;$.01); twitch tension--21% vs 7% (p $&lt;$.001); nerve stimulated tetanic tension--23% vs 7% (p $&lt;$.05); direct muscle stimulated tetanic tension--43% vs 11% (p $&lt;$.01); Type I fiber area--69% vs 46% (p $&lt;$.05); and Type II fiber area of 63% vs 34% (p $&lt;$.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the fiber type proportions. The results of this project support the hypothesis that continuous, implantable ES delivered over an extended period of time has a positive functional and morphological impact on denervated muscle.

Pain intensity was measured using a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire was used to measure quality. The most common pain types reported were movement-associated and constant incisional pain (100% of subjects), gas pain (88.1%), and uterine contraction pain (83.3%). Each pain type differed in its intensity, duration and quality. Movement-associated incisional pain was the most intense and long-lasting pain type reported. On postoperative days 2 to 4, mothers who received complete epidural anesthesia during surgery reported less intense movement-associated incisional pain than those who received general or incomplete epidural anesthesia. However, statistical significance was not often obtained. These findings demonstrate the uniqueness of each pain type composing the postcesarean pain experience. The clinical data also support the hypothesis that epidural anesthesia diminishes the sustained hyperexcitability of the central nervous system caused by surgery.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d531g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rj07k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hk25m"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Word order within infinitival complements in Swiss-German</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Knoll, Sonja</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis studies word order variations in Swiss-German sentences that contain infinitival complements.

In particular, it is claimed that Swiss-German verbs that take infinitival complements do not all select the same type of complements. Some verbs (like modals, perception verbs and causatives) select VPs, others (like raising verbs) select IPs and others (like control verbs) select IPs or CPs. Mechanisms such as extraposition, verb raising and proliticization then apply to different structures in order for the sentence to satisfy T-linking. Extraposition applies to IPs and CPs, verb raising to IPs and VPs and procliticization to verbs that are sister to VPs.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967481h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hk25m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>German language -- Dialects -- Switzerland</dc:subject><dc:subject>German language -- Switzerland -- Word order</dc:subject><dc:subject>German language -- Switzerland -- Verb phrase</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am900nv71n"><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The design and analysis of nodes in a fiber optic based star network (STARNET)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Tanir, Oryal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>STARNET is a fiber optic based network which facilitates the interconnection of distributed Local Area Networks. Configured as a sixteen pointed star topology with a multiprocessor based controller at the center of the star (named the Central Switch). STARNET is capable of scheduling calls from users connected to User Access Nodes located at the points of the star. Messages are passed from one node to another through the Central Switch via duplex fiber optic lines connecting each node to the center. This paper presents a multiprocessor based design of the User Access Node. The hardware and software structure is examined in depth, providing solid guidelines for the physical construction of the unit. The performances of statistical STARNET models using parameters obtained from the design (and three different Central Switch models) are plotted and compared for five different examples of external traffic. The model analysis gives an indication of the expected message delays, supporting the feasibility of the design.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xz41n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv71n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fiber optics</dc:subject><dc:subject>STARNET (Local area network system)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Local area networks (Computer networks)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Interactive computer systems</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fq10d"><ual:graduationDate>1986</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The five paintings of the Adoration of the Magi by Sandro Botticelli</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lake, G. Thomas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thematic unit formed by the five versions of The Adoration of the Magi painted by Sandro Botticelli provide a special opportunity for studying his artistic development. An investigation of these five paintings shows that Botticelli aimed toward a goal of perfecting compositional techniques. He systematically made alterations to these works in order to create special point of view effects. This thesis outlines the general trends in art with respect to the Adoration theme and then concentrates on a demonstration of Botticelli's attempts at correlating compositional devices and the unique features developed with respect to spectator involvement. This selected study allows for a careful examination which spans the artistic career of Sandro Botticelli. As a result, it can be shown that it was perhaps Botticelli, rather than Leonardo da Vinci, who was primarily responsible for the development of a compositional format which became a foundation stone of High Renaissance compositions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612p764.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq10d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Art -- Themes, motives</dc:subject><dc:subject>Botticelli, Sandro, 1444 or 5-1510.
