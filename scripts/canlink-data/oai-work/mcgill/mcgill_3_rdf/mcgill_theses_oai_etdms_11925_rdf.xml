Most of those who have worked on this subject  have a tendency to consider that the alpha cell of the islet of Langerhans is, in the morphological field, the seat of this function. With the introduction of alloxan, which is a simple method of inducing selective necrosis of the beta cell of the islet, and with the development of histological technique in the last few years for the differential study of the islet cell, it would appear that a thorough study of this problem should be considered.

The extent of the exchange is measured by making the common atom in one of the compounds detectable as a radioactive or stable isotope, the former being preferred because it is more readily traced. At the end of the reaction time the two compounds are separated and the distribution of the isotope measured. If complete exchange has taken place each compound has the same proportion of isotope, but if no exchange has occurred all the isotope is found in the original compound. The exchange reaction has been recognized as a valuable tool in chemistry, particularly in organic chemistry, because it gives direct information regarding bond reactivities and reaction mechanisms. The reaction offers an excellent method of studying some of the most fundamental properties of chemical compounds because it provides a remarkably simple system. Since the reactants and products are chemically identical there is no heat of reaction, only an energy of activation; concentrations remain constant and there are no interfering products or by-products. It is, therefore, somewhat surprising to note that the mechanism of the exchange reaction in solution has not been completely studied.

The widespread occurrence of this worm in an important commercial fish presents a grave problem not only to the fresh-fish industry but also to the canned-fish industry in the Atlantic Maritime provinces of Canada. Fish producers are frequently compelled to employ personnel whose sole function is the removal of worms from fillets and this procedure is obviously expensive. It has been conservatively estimated that this infection is the cause of an annual loss to the fishing industry of approximately two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The situation was so serious that in 1945 it was decided to study the life history of the parasite in an effort to disclose some method of control[...]Although the primary purpose of this investigation at the time of its conception was the discovery of some method of control of the parasite, the body of the investigation as presented in this paper soon developed into a study of the life history of the worm[...]It will be later seen that the course of the investigation has led the author not only to a consideration of the developmental history of the worm but also to a consideration of its ecological behaviour.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stanley, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33s0713.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913t048</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nematodes</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405sd73s"><ual:graduationDate>1949</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Column strength of an aluminum alloy section</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Harris, Philip John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is written to show that within the elastic limit of the material, the behavior of columns can be predicted with reasonable accuracy by means of the well-known Secant Formula or a combination of the Secant Formula and the Initial Curvature Formula. Nine aluminum alloy columns (Alcan 26S-T) in lengths ranging from 7’-0” to l’-6” have been tested with both central and eccentric loads, and measurements of stresses and deflections taken at intervals during the tests. These results are compared with the theoretical values to show the accuracy of the formulas. The application of these results to the establishment of design formulas is also discussed, and future lines of investigation are suggested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DeStein, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fp99v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sd73s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Civil Engineering &amp; Applied Mechanics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579w512"><ual:graduationDate>1949</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An investigation of the ether and ligroin extracts of white spruce bark</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Harwood, Victor Douglas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present research, the second in a series on the constitution of white spruce bark, is concerned with the extraneous components, or those that are extracted by chemically inert solvents. Research on such materials was initiated in the hope of finding valuable constituents in sufficient quantity to warrant the recovery of the extractives on a commercial scale, because at present bark is a major waste product of the Pulp and Paper Industry. Since previous workers in this field were limited in the extent of their investigations by the inadequate quantity of bark which they studied, the present research was commenced on a pilot plant scale. In order that comparative studies could be made with past or future work, the bark was peeled from the trees in the woods rather than collected from river-run pulp logs. The methanol extract from about 600 pounds of bark was precipitated with water and this precipitate was extracted with ligroin and diethyl ether. [...] Consequently, the research resolved itself into three major tasks, the identification of the neutral esters, the separation and study of the neutral unsaponifiable matter and the investigation of the nature of the fatty acids present. Throughout the project, attempts were made to obtain strictly quantitative yields of the various components. In this connection the decision to conduct the work on a large scale has been repeatedly vindicated because certain constituents are present only in minute quantity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311s64c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579w512</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vf62c"><ual:graduationDate>1949</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bacteriology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A method for the rapid isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hawirko, Roma Z.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The demonstration of the tubercle bacillus by Robert Koch in 1882, as the etiological agent of tuberculosis led to developments in technique for the isolation of the bacilli from suspected material. Because of the scarcity of organisms in some specimens, concentration methods were devised to give a more delicate demonstration of the bacilli than was possible by direct smear or culture. The increasing importance of bacteriological methods for diagnosis in many cases of suspected tuberculosis has given a stimulus to the study of such procedures. In spite of the voluminous literature that has been published there is still a need for a more satisfactory method for the demonstration of the presence of the tubercle bacilli in pathological specimens. The development of nutritive media has made great progress since the time of Koch, but there still remains much to be desired from the point of view of time required for the appearance of colonies and the initiation of growth from minimal inocula. A concentration method based on the flotation principle of Lange and Nitsche (1909) utilizing oil as the agent, and the medium described by Dubos (1945), using Tween and albumin were investigated for this problem, with the view of achieving a more satisfactory method for the demonstration of the tubercle bacillus.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Murray, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623g77v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vf62c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bacteriology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rx829"><ual:graduationDate>1949</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le réel et l’imaginaire dans les contes et romans d’Alexandre Arnoux, 1918-1947</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hawkins, Stuart Christopher McLean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Le President de l’Academie Goncourt en 1948 était Alexandre Arnoux.1 II a produit une oeuvre considérable, et en qualité et en quantité, et semble jouir actuellement du plein épanouissement de son génie: Algorithme. qu’il a publie en 1948, sera bientÔt suivi d’un ouvrage sur Paris, maintenant sous presse, dont le titre n’est pas encore définitif.

Alexandre Arnoux n’a fondé aucune école, mais c’est un observateur perspicace de la période qui entre dans l’histoire sous le nom de “l’entre-deux-guerres”, et ses observations forment le point de départ ou le fonds de la série de contes, de nouvelles, de romans, et d’essais anecdotiques qu’il convient de nommer simplement “contes et romans”.
