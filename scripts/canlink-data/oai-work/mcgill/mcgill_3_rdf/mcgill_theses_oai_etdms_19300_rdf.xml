When sufficient gas had been traversed, the ratio of negative ions to protons reached an equilibrium value which was a maximum of 22.2 percent at about 8.5 kilovolts. The energy interval investigated was from 4 to 70 kilovolts. In this interval, the electron loss cross-section for the negative hydrogen ion was determined. It varied from 6.3 x 10-16 cm.2 at 4.2 kilovolts, to 2.5 x 10-16 cm.2 at 70.3 kilovolts. A calculation of the electron capture cross-section for the neutral hydrogen atom in the same energy interval was made. A determination of the electron capture cross-section for protons between the above mentioned energies was also made, and found to agree with values obtained by other workers, both theoretical and experimental. A seven stage voltage-multiplier circuit operated at radio-frequency, an ion accelerator and analyser were designed for this work and are described.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nq362.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278z41n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject/></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jg29h"><ual:graduationDate>1952</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>the Oxidation of Hydrazobenzene by Ammonium Persulphate in Homogeneous Solution</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Whalley, Basil John Palmer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Persulphurie acid* and its common salts have been the subject of great interest since the discovery of the acid by Berthelot in 1878 (1) and much work has been done to investigate their reactions, many of which are remarkable in that they proceed at a measurable rate, despite a normal electrode potential of the persulphate ion of about 2 volts (2).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p26770645.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jg29h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject/></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agb19fb06g"><ual:graduationDate>1952</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>On the Separation of Nutritionally Deleterious and Innocuous Fractions from the Esters of Thermally Polymerized Linseed Oil</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wells, Arthur Frederick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The shortage of edible fats and oils during the Second World War prompted research in this laboratory on the utilization of linseed oil for edible purposes.

A program is proposed for a revised theory of distribution. In partial fulfillment of this program the following analysis is attempted: a detailed examination of the basis of individual utility functions; a formalization of the market and the mechanics of marketing, with some attention to the problem of indivisibility; and a study of the transition from individual to collective utility functions. In connection with the last a new proof is offered for K.J. Arrow's "General Possibility Theorem", and Arrow's work is otherwise extended and applied.

It was found that the arc stability is associated with the electron emission mode transition of the cathode operation. Estimation of current densities, SEM pictures, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of total voltage, and measurement of cathode surface temperature supported this. Stable arcs are in the thermionic emission regime while unstable arcs in the thermofield emission regime. Higher argon gas flow rate is believed to cause the shift of the mode from the thermofield emission to the thermionic emission by increasing the arc root temperature through steepening the thermal gradient at the arc root and increasing ionization phenomena inside the arc. Sharp cathode tip geometry usually leads to the thermionic emission while a rounded tip geometry encourages the thermofield emission. For the unstable arcs, the high voltage fluctuation resulted from the jumping of the arc root between different cathode spots and changes in the arc length. In the stable arcs, however, the voltage was almost constant because of the absence of arc jumping. The standard deviation of the voltage was used as the arc stability indicator and was less than 3 V for the stable arc in this transferred arc system. The erosion rate of the cathode in this work ranged from 0.41 to 2.61 mug/C. At 150 A runs the arc stability strongly influenced the erosion rate; as the arc stability increased, the erosion rate decreased. Higher currents runs (300 and 400 A), however, showed the opposite trend because of the carbon vapor redeposition. The total erosion rates of 150 A runs were separated into the stable (Es) and the unstable (Eu) erosion rate. The Eu was more than 3 times higher in this work. It is believed that the thermofield emission of the unstable arcs produced more erosion because of the higher local heat flux to the cathode spots.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Munz, R.

D'une part, il s'est opéré un mouvement d'unification au sein de l'univers, car les distances ont été vaincues et de grandes centralisations éconmoiques ont multiplié les communications entre les pays, en meme temps qu'elles amplifiaient leur inter-dépendance réciproque.  D'autre part, presque rien ne subsiste, qui dans les siècles passés avait pu fournir un llien puissant entre les hommes, que ce soit religion, philosophie ou théorie politique.

Bioassays, using Drosophila adults or mosquito larvae, showed that rate of decomposition was most rapid with parathion, followed in turn by hexachlorocyclohexane, wettable DDT, toxaphene, p-p' DDT. Rate of decomposition varied with the soil, generally being quicker at low than at high dosages, and more rapid at the top of the soil column than at the bottom with toxaphene and hexachlorocyolohexane while the reverse was true with DDT. Bioassays showed small quantities of insecticide in the leachates. Aging reduced phytotoxicity of hexachlorocyclohexane, but increased that of DDT.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morrison, Frank O.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204306k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rz60g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject/><dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cp86n"><ual:graduationDate>1952</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>the District of Brome a Regional Study of Physical and Human Geography</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pochopien, Kazimierz Marian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is no known scientific account of the physical and human geography of the District of Brome. Some information is scattered in various reports and essays of investigators in other fields of research, such as history or geology, but as yet no effort has been made to collect this material into one work. The purpose of this thesis is to summarise the scanty work done in the area previously, and to supplement the lacking or not coordinated knowledge with the up-to-date information collected during special field work in the area.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hare, Kenneth</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kf751.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cp86n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject/><dc:subject>Geography</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
