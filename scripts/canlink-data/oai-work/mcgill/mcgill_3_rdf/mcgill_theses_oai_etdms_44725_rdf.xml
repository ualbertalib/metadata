A  robust mythology extolling Lomonosov's role in Russian science and culture formed in  the years immediately following his death, and would increase in vigor while  adapting to changing historical circumstances until well into the twentieth century.  This dissertation explores the evolution of Lomonosov's imposing stature in Russian  thought from the middle of the eighteenth century to the first decades of the Soviet  period. It reveals much about the intersection in Russian culture of changing  attitudes towards the meaning and significance of science, as well as about the rise  of a Russian national identity of which Lomonosov became an outstanding  symbol. The processes by which myths can be used to create and shape  historical memory are highlighted throughout this inquiry. At first, Lomonosov was  depicted very generally as the pioneering Russian natural philosopher; later his  contributions, still broadly framed, were conflated with select institutional  agendas; finally historians of various disciplines appropriated his life in order to  reinforce their own professional strategies. Even as the myth of Lomonosov grew more  elaborate, however, it was the inspiring idea of Lomonosov's heroic determination to  propagate science, culture, and education within Russia and his successful struggles  against myriad obstacles to achieve this end that remained the primary and enduring  biographical element. It is this image with which my study is principally  concerned.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boss, Valentin</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs44j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf25z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lomonosov, Mikhail Vasilʹevich, 1711-1765</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Russia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289j467"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of host genetic risk factors for leprosy susceptibility</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mira, Marcelo Távora</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium  leprae, is the leading cause of non-traumatic neuropathies in the world. Although a  genetic component for leprosy susceptibility has been demonstrated by several  studies, the exact nature and extent of this component is still unknown. Here, we  applied linkage and association analysis in a combined candidate region and  genome-wide approach to further investigate the nature of host genetic factors  controlling leprosy susceptibility. First, we used 20 Vietnamese multiplex leprosy  families to perform linkage analysis on selected genomic candidate regions  harbouring genes previously known to be either linked or associated with leprosy  phenotypes. We found significant evidence for linkage between markers of the TNFA  gene located on chromosomal region 6p21 and clinical subtype of the disease (P =  0.00021). Next, we performed a genome-wide scan in a sample of 86 Vietnamese  multiplex leprosy families. We identified a new leprosy "per se"  susceptibility locus on chromosome 6q25--q27 (LOD = 4.31, P = 5 x 10-6). Linkage  results were reproduced by family-based association analysis in an independent  sample of 208 Vietnamese simplex leprosy pedigrees (P = 5.9 x 10 -5). A linkage  homogeneity test confirmed chromosomal region 10p13 as modifier for paucibacillary  leprosy in the Vietnamese population. Finally, we applied SNP-based association  analysis to construct a high density linkage disequilibrium (LD) map of chromosome  6q25--q27. We identified genetic polymorphisms clustered in a 80 Kb LD block  overlapping the 5-prime regulatory region shared by two genes, Parkinson's disease  susceptibility gene PARK2 and PACRG, as risk factors for leprosy "per se"  in the Vietnamese population (OR = 3.15--5.72).

One of the tRNALys isoacceptors, tRNA Lys3 serves as a primer  for the reverse transcriptase-catalyzed synthesis of minus strand, strong stop cDNA.  Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) a tRNA Lys-binding protein is also selectively package  into HIV-1, making it a candidate for being the signal which targets tRNALys for  incorporation into viruses. We have tested whether the cytoplasmic tRNA Lys/LysRS  interaction is required for selective packaging of tRNA Lys into HIV-1 by  constructing anticodon mutations within the anticodon domain of tRNALys3. The  anticodon is the major binding domain for tRNALys/LysRS interaction. We found that  the ability of tRNALys3 to bind to LysRS, and be aminoacylated was directly  correlated with its ability to be incorporated into HIV-1. However it was not clear from these results if in addition to  the tRNALys/LysRS interaction, tRNA aminoacylation was required for selective  packaging of tRNA Lys3. To investigate this, we constructed and expressed two mutant  LysRS species. One has lost its aminoacylation activity because of a deletion within  the catalytic core. The other mutant LysRS has a reduced ability to bind to tRNALys,  because it contains a deletion within tRNA Lys binding site. This mutant LysRS does  not have the ability to facilitate tRNALys packaging into the virus, while the  mutant LysRS which binds to tRNALys, but fails to aminoacylate it, does facilitate  tRNALys packaging, indicating that tRNALys aminoacylation is not required for its  packaging into viruses. LysRS is carried into the viruses by its interaction with Gag.  We have mapped the sites of interaction between HIV-1 Gag and LysRS using in vivo  and in vitro techniques. We find that Gag sequences within the C-terminal domain of  CA which contains the CA dimerization site, interact with LysRS sequences which  include motif 1, which contains the LysRS dimerization site.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k3106.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jp185</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j3332723"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A consenus chromosome origin of replication in alpha-proteobacteria</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shaheen, S.

It divides to yield two distincts cell types: a flagellated,  non-replicating swarmer cell and a non-motile but replicative stalked cell. In order  to initiate chromosome replication, the swarmer cell must differentiate into the  stalked cell by ejecting the polar flagellum and acquiring a tubular stalk  appendage. Therefore, chromosome replication is restricted to the stalked cell where  chromosome replication initiates exactly once per cell cycle. A key feature of C.  crescentus is the global response regulator CtrA that controls key events within the  cell cycle including chromosomal replication. CtrA represses replication in the  swarmer cell by binding to five specific sites on the C. crescentus chromosome  origin of replication (Cori). To initiate replication, CtrA protein is removed from  the stalked cell by proteolytic degradation. (C. crescentus represents the first  example where a response regulator protein controls DNA synthesis.) We tested  whether other replication origins from related bacteria also bind CtrA, and whether  they also share other DNA elements implicated in replication control such as binding  sites for the DnaA protein (DnaA boxes) and DNA methylation sites. We isolated  potential replication origins from closely related freshwater and marine Caulobacter  species by PCR amplification with degenerated primers that hybridize to conserved  flanking genes. We amplified the origins of replication of 3 freshwater and 2 marine  Caulobacter species, and we sequenced all of them. Further, we wanted to know  whether we amplified the true origin of replication for the related bacteria or not.  Therefore, we tested these clones by autonomous replication assays in C. crescentus.  4 out of 5 proposed replication origins supported autonomous plasmid replication in  C. crescentus.

The objective of this dissertation is to study the analogy between urban designs and  their representation in theatre from the Ancient Greece until the Golden Age Spanish  Theatre. As we acknowledge the influence of the urban configuration on the mentality  of that particular period, we also seek to explain how the surrounding reality  becomes like an ideological postulate with the passing of time. By analysing and  defining the cities from the Ancient Greece to the period known as the Baroque, we  aim at defining the new form taken by their inherent spatial notions when they merge  with those of the ancient historic capital of the Mexica empire, that is,  Mexico-Tenochtitlan. As the two worlds were coming into contact, the changes as well  as the exchange of cultural legacies and urban experiences endowed the author's town  of birth with a new way of communicating, which was at the same time both Spanish  and non-Spanish. This allowed the author to write plots where the urban setting  would not determine all the characters' actions and reactions, as was the case with  the Golden Age dramatists in Spain.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Magallon, Jesus</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c802s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zt85r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ruiz de Alarcón, Juan, 1580?-1639 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cities and towns in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gt20k"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Man the machine : a history of a metaphor from Leonardo da Vinci to H.

In so doing, they drew on ancient Greek  notions of instrumentality and proportion. During the early Scientific Revolution,  the metaphor of Man the machine played a key role in the development of mechanistic  philosophy. During the Enlightenment, it served views on materialism and atheism. By  the nineteenth century, when the Industrial Revolution was in full swing, a  fundamental change in the relationship of man to machine had come about. Whereas,  for Protagoras, man had been the measure of all things, now suddenly the machine was  the standard by which the capacities and limits of man were judged. Man the machine  was a key feature in the development of the totalitarian ideology of Communism.  Moreover, for over a century now, the technocratic viewpoint has guided many  technological innovations. Tracing a history of this metaphor, through Leonardo,  Vesalius, Harvey, Descartes, Hobbes, Leibniz, La Mettrie, d'Holbach, Marx and Wells,  places man's relationship with technology and his gradual loss of identity since the  Renaissance in a new context.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boss, V.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p769n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gt20k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Machinery in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Machinery -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human-machine systems</dc:subject><dc:subject>Machinery in art</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afn106z65h"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of a cryptic plasmid from Lactobacillus plantarum</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shareck, Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), a group of generally recognized as  safe (GRAS) organisms that metabolize sugars into primarily lactic acid, have  traditionally been used for the fermentation and preservation of various foods and  beverages.

However, because these bacteria have food-related applications, their  genetic modification requires the use of food-grade genetic engineering tools. LAB  plasmids, self-replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecules, can be used to derive  food-grade cloning vectors. The rationale of this research was to develop a  food-grade cloning vector using a lactobacilli cryptic plasmid and to investigate  its cloning and expression properties.

In the  first part, I discuss the widely used technique of molecular dynamics to  characterise the dynamics and statistical observables of a system undergoing a phase  transition. I then outline the advantages and the main drawbacks of this technique:  slow implementation and poor performance for long time scales. It is shown that  order parameter or phenomenological theories of freezing paliate those problems.  These theories describe the dynamics of one parameter that starts in a highly  symmetric state and which symmetry is broken during the phase transition. The  dynamics of the order parameter, which in our case is the time averaged density, is  governed by the topology of a free energy functional. We derive such a free energy  functional for two theories and explain why one of these can be applied to give  freezing into arbitrary symmetry groups.

The power fluctuations cause the  frequency of electric utility to deviate from the 60Hz standard. This thesis is  concerned with estimating the maximum fluctuating wind power before the 1% deviation  from the 60 Hz standard (required by some utilities) is exceeded. To keep the thesis  manageable, the scope is narrowed to thermal power plants with governor speed  control but no Automatic Governor Control (AGC). This thesis shows that each  governor speed control system provides energy storage buffer to attenuate the wind  power fluctuations and arrives at the estimate that the fluctuating wind power  penetration is conservatively around 5% of the generation capacity of the utility  grid. The methodologies used to reach this estimate are: (i) Transfer Function  analysis of power plants; (ii) digital simulations using HYPERSIM. Through the  research, an innovative method of predicting the frequency deviation in an electric  grid with multiple power plants has been developed and validated by  simulation. The thesis also shows that fluctuating wind power penetration  can be higher when there are filtering also in the wind farms. Wind turbines, with  small inertias, driving constant speed squirrel cage induction generators are found  to provide poor filtering. On the other hand, the fluctuating wind power penetration  limit is increased to 18% in the case of wind turbines, with large inertias, driving  variable-speed doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) with decoupled P-Q control to  implement optimal wind power acquisition.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n203z65r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv116</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bp77t"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An ultra low-power 5Gbps vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser-based optical transmitter for optical interconnect applications and access networks</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Thibodeau, Jean-Philippe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The bandwidth bottleneck present in the access level of optical  networks stimulated research, leading to novel topologies, including passive optical  networks.

This thesis outlines the design, implementation, and testing of  a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)-based optical transmitter in  0.18mum CMOS usable for both applications. Optical transmitter architectures are  reviewed and a suitable topology is proposed. The implementation includes an  original dual power-rail layout for reduced power consumption. A detailed  bias-dependent VCSEL model is developed from experimental data. Experimental results presented in this thesis are in good  agreement with simulations. An errorless data rate of 3.125Gbps is achieved for a  total power consumption of 18.35mW, at an average optical output power of 2mW. An  error-corrected channel using the proposed optical transmitter can operate at  5Gbps.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zt879.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bp77t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av692t687q"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of plant sterols and glucomannan on parameters of cholesterol kinetics in hyperlipidemic individuals with and without type 2 diabetes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Barake, Roula</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of plant  sterols and/or glucomannan on lipid profiles and cholesterol kinetics in  hyperlipidemic individuals with or without type 2 diabetes. It was hypothesized that  plant sterols and glucomannan reduce circulating cholesterol levels and may have an  additive or synergistic effect when combined by reducing cholesterol absorption.  Thirteen type 2 diabetics and sixteen non-diabetics all mildly hypercholesterolemic  free living subjects participated in a randomized crossover trial consisting of 4  phases, 21 days each. Subjects consumed plant sterols and glucomannan during the  trial. Overall reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol levels were greater  (P&lt;0.05) after consumption of the combination supplement. Effects of  supplements were not different between diabetics and non-diabetics. No significant  changes were observed in cholesterol absorption or synthesis in both diabetics and  non-diabetics. The intake of plant sterols and glucomannan together may be an  alternative approach in reducing blood cholesterol levels.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j149d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t687q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Phytosterols</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hypercholesteremia -- Treatment</dc:subject><dc:subject>Non-insulin-dependent diabetes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amorphophallus -- Physiological effect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anticholesteremic agents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sterols -- Physiological effect</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abk128b46z"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Manufacturing process modelling of thermoplastic composite resistance welding</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Talbot, Edith</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One-, two- and three-dimensional transient heat transfer finite  element models are developed to simulate the resistance welding process of  pre-consolidated unidirectional AS4 carbon fibre reinforced Poly-ether-ether-ketone  (APC-2/AS4) laminates with a metal mesh heating element, in a lap-shear  configuration. The finite element models are used to investigate the effect of  process and material parameters on the thermal behaviour of the coupon size welds,  yielding to a better understanding of the process. The 1-D model determines: (a) the  importance of including the latent heat of PEEK, and (b) the through-thickness  temperature gradient away from the edges, for different tooling plate materials. The  2-D model simulates the cross-section of the process, considering the convective and  irradiative heat losses from the areas of the heating element exposed to air. The  3-D model includes the heat conduction along the length of the laminates, to fully  depict the thermal behaviour of the welds. Finally, the models are compared with  experimental data.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kq92x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128b46z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electric welding</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thermoplastic composites</dc:subject><dc:subject>Finite element method</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mathematical optimization</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thermoplastics -- Welding</dc:subject><dc:subject>Manufacturing processes -- Computer simulation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3197xm38c"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of chemotherapeutic agents for testicular cancer on male rat reproductive organs and spermatozoal numbers, motility, and morphology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bieber, Adrienne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common cancer affecting men  of reproductive age; however treatment with bleomycin, etoposide, and cis-platin  (BEP) results in extremely high cure rates. The post-treatment quality of life of TC  patients is therefore a major concern. The goal of this study was to determine the  effects of BEP on sperm count, motility, and morphology in an animal model. Male  Sprague Dawley rats were treated with BEP for 9 weeks. Rats were killed, and the  numbers, motility, and morphology of the spermatozoa from the epididymides were  analyzed. After BEP treatment, sperm counts decreased by almost 10-fold when  compared to control (11.9x107 versus 1.65x107 sperm per epididymis). The percent of  spermatozoa that were motile was &gt; 30% lower in the treated group compared to  control group. Morphological defects increased significantly in both the midpiece  and principal piece of the flagella. These results indicate that BEP treatment has  significant effects on spermatogenesis in the rat model.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f4625980.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xm38c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aws859g18w"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification and characterization of the murine Meis1 promoter</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bodner, Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>MEIS1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1) is a member  of the TALE class of homeodomain-containing proteins. MEIS1, along with related  family members PBX and PREP1, bind DNA cooperatively with HOX proteins to regulate  transcription. Meis1 is implicated in many developmental processes. Moreover,  deregulation of Meis1 is involved in leukemogenesis. To better understand the  mechanisms of Meis1 transcriptional regulation, we set out to map and characterize  the Meis1 promoter. Results from RNase protection and 5' RACE suggest that Meis1 has  multiple transcription start sites (TSSs) located between -608 and -751 base pairs  upstream of the translational start site. Sequence analysis of the promoter region  did not reveal a TATA box-like element. However, Meis1 lies within a CpG island,  consistent with a clustering of TSSs. Meis1 is induced upon RA treatment of P19 cell  aggregates, consistent with H3 and H4 acetylation and RNA pol II recruitment at the  Meis1 promoter. Furthermore, MEIS1 is recruited to a conserved MEIS/PBX binding site  within the promoter region suggesting that MEIS1 may autoregulate its own  transcription.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh30x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g18w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb397878s"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study into the efficiency of traffic : flows induced by selfish agents</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Boucher, Christina Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We examine the following traffic model. There is a network of  users who wish to route traffic to their destinations as quickly as possible. Each  edge in the network has a load-dependent function specifying the delay experienced  by traffic using that network link. In an optimal routing scheme the total latency  incurred by all the network users is minimized. However, when users are free to  route traffic according to their own interests the network traffic converges to a  selfishly defined traffic assignment which can be more costly than the optimal  solution. The following question then arises; how much deterioration in network  performance can be caused by this lack of coordination? First, we explore this  question by quantifying the efficiency losses inherent in the selfishly defined  solution. Second, we focus on designing selfish routing instances that produce  optimal network flows. We present, an assortment of results on these topics and  suggest some promising new areas of research.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qj21t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397878s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296wz59h"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Responsive measures to short-term prehabilitation in surgical patients</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kim, Do Jun, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to identify the most responsive  measure of aerobic fitness over a four week pre-surgical aerobic training program  (prehabilitation) in patients undergoing major bowel resection.

Two designs adapted to  the HV technology are proposed for the current-to-high-voltage conversion as  traditional output resistor or op-amp solutions are not optimum for the HV process:  one uses a high-compliance current mirror, while the other uses a simple current  mirror. The DACs show a DNL of 0.16LSB and 1LSB, respectively, while the INL profile  is 0.16LSB and 13LSBs for the first and second designs.

L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this critical inquiry, I look at how individuals who  experience social, cultural and economic exclusion in postcolonial societies  construct cultural identities and relationships with what they perceive as the  dominant cultures of their countries through the process of schooling. Here, the  term 'postcolonial' refers to events, places, and conditions that are situated after  periods of colonization, and implicate individuals whose histories are linked to  colonizers and colonized peoples. This thesis discusses theoretical, political, philosophical and  methodological issues around the design, implementation, interpretation and report  of an ethnographic inquiry carried out in Brazil (Sao Paulo area) and southern  France in 2004-2005. In this project, I organized focus groups of adolescents from  marginalized communities in those two locations with the intention to generate  critical dialogues about their experience of schooling and the dynamics between what  they perceived as their cultural identity, their school's culture, and the culture  of their countries. More than a mere survey of the accommodation and representation  of 'minority' histories and peoples in France and Brazil, this study strives to  explore and compare how the societal apparatuses of those two countries, with a  particular emphasis on schooling, produce categories of cultural difference and  inscribe them onto societal subjects. Thus, I carried out my inquiry with the belief  that schooling is not simply a site of cultural transmission and reproduction, but  also of cultural and identity production: a matrix that recreates, renegotiates, and  institutionalizes hierarchical boundaries of difference that become actualized in  students' subjectivities (Hall, 1999).</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128b477.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d145</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Minorities -- Education -- France</dc:subject><dc:subject>Postcolonialism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Minorities -- Education -- Brazil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612p144"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Le conflit germano-soviétique, 1941-1945 : analyse des principaux enjeux militaires, politiques et stratégiques</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bélanger, Nicolas, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In spite of the crucial importance of the Russian front in the  outcome of the Second World War, this aspect of the conflict has been studied  relatively little in the West since 1945. This omission can be attributed to several  factors including linguistic complexity, the difficulty of access to Soviet  archives, and the political constraints caused by the ideological climate of the  Cold War. Since the time of glasnost' and the collapse of the Soviet block, however,  a new era has begun for historians thanks to the release of many documents which had  been secret and to the improved ideological climate. The present work aims to summarise the current situation of the  debate in this rapidly expanding field of historiography. Some of the most  controversial military, political, and strategic questions are examined, most  frequently from a Soviet perspective. These include the Soviet preparations for war  and their shortcomings; the German campaign of 1941 and the reasons for its failure;  the turning of the tide in 1942-1943, especially the battles of Kursk and  Stalingrad; the Yalta conference and the "division of the world"; the role  of Stalin and his regime in the "Great Patriotic War"; the human and  material losses of the Soviet Union during the conflict; and finally the importance  of the Soviet contribution to the victory of the Allies.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214p61p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p144</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- Campaigns -- Eastern Front</dc:subject><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- Soviet Union</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj67314488"><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Peasant adaptation to environmental change in the Peruvian Amazon : livelihood responses in an Amerindian and a non-Amerindian community</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Manzi, Maya</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the primary challenges facing researchers and  practitioners in their efforts to address issues of poverty and environment is the  need to deepen our understanding of the logic that guides local people's decisions  over resource use, particularly among the rural poor whose livelihoods depend on  fragile and dynamic environments.

A great deal of research has focused  on coaches of elite able-bodied athletes, while coaches of athletes with a  disability have generally been overlooked. In a recent analysis of disability sport,  only 5% of empirical publications pertained to coaching. Thus, the current study  addressed the gap in the literature by examining the knowledge of disability sport  coaches. Six elite level Canadian coaches of swimmers with a physical disability  were interviewed using an unstructured, open-ended interview format. Four categories  emerged from the analysis: coach background and characteristics, training,  competition, and contextual factors. Results revealed who the coaches were, what  they did, and similarities with elite able-bodied coaches, as well as differences  that were specific to coaching swimmers with a physical disability. Specifically, it  was essential for coaches to become knowledgeable of their athletes' disabilities,  deal with issues of equality between able-bodied and swimmers with a physical  disability, and accommodate a large array of individual needs. These findings  augment knowledge in coaching psychology by including elite level coaches of  athletes with physical disabilities.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w5277.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537177m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Coaching (Athletics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Swimmers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Athletes with disabilities</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
