Because of the increasing use of compounds of this nature in agriculture it is imperative that such effects should be studied to avert possible damage to large sections of arable land.

Dr Kranck had previously examined the rocks of the coastal region in 1937, as a member of the Finland-Labrador Expedition, and in 1939 as a leader of a second expedition from Finland.
