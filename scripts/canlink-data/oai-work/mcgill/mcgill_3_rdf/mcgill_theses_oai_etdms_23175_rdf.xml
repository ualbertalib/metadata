While the image incorporates several autobiographical references, this is not the revelation. With textual recurrence forming a thematic, topical thread, the image is seen in its poetic, symbolic and mythical dimensions. Woman offers a surrealist poet a rhetorical gift. In these works the image of woman acquires symbolic value. It is identified with Nature in its cosmic, telluric reality, rooted in the unconscious in its oneiric reality. It is epiphanic in that it gives access to the Other's vision. To the poet it represents, to use Carl Jung's hermeneutic, the archetypal figure of the Anima. In its mythical dimensions, finally, the image calls forth the great visions of femininity: Muse, Sprite, Fairy, Elf, Virgin...</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t754c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h0704</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Breton, André, 1896-1966 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rj13q"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A case study in adult participation in learning</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Koop, Sandra</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This case study examines adult participation in learning. Ethnographic methods were employed to document classroom processes and participant perceptions in an adult basic education class. Classroom observations showed that learner participation was for the most part initiated by the teacher rather than by the students. Analysis of the data indicated a close link between the defined teacher and learner roles and the participants' shared perceptions of the teacher as the expert. Analysis also showed that teacher-student interaction was influenced by the teacher's past teaching experience and by her perceptions of the students and their needs. The results of this study demonstrate a need for teacher preparation designed both to increase awareness of appropriate adult education methods, and to provide experience in active learner participation. The study also highlights the importance of dialogue between teachers and learners as a means of involving learners in the learning process.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv761.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rj13q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Learning, Psychology of</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adult education -- Case studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687j67t"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La symbolique maternelle dans quatre romans de Françoise Mallet-Joris</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wilson, Sonia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>So far, Francoise Mallet-Joris has been categorized either as a Catholic novelist or as a moderate feminist. Accused of conservatism by some, perceived by others as immoral, she has been considerably underrated by a critical audience anxious to maintain traditional literary categories. This thesis attempts to demonstrate that faith and feminism, far from conflicting with each other, are linked in Mallet-Joris' work with the process of writing, thus forming a triple entity where the common denominator is the theme of maternity. This theme will be analysed in four of Mallet-Joris' novels, Les Mensonges, Les Signes et les Prodiges, Allegra, and La Tristesse du Cerf-volant, using a symbolic approach whose usefulness lies in the twofold definition of a symbol as, on the one hand, a materialisation of the inexpressible and on the other, a split unity. For the temporal modality and the concept of identity inherent in the maternal experience place it outside the narrative system, thus putting any author who wishes to tackle this area in the position of either inventing a new narrative form or attempting a compromise between already existing forms and the specific content of the maternal experience. It is this latter alternative that Francoise Mallet-Joris adopts. Although as far as form is concerned, Mallet-Joris can hardly be termed innovative, she demonstrates on an ideological plane an originality which is largely the product of using the symbol of the Virgin Mary as an intermediary between the maternal experience and the symbolic order.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dn58t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687j67t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mallet-Joris, Françoise, 1930- -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n229w"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Autonomie dans les activités de base des personnes avec une démence de type Alzheimer et des personnes avec une dépression majeure</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Laberge, Hélène</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Demented persons of the Alzheimer type, and to a lesser degree, persons suffering from major depression, experience a loss of autonomy in their activities of daily living (ADL). This loss of autonomy is often associated with a decrease in the initiation, organization and continuation of the activity. The Psychogeriatric Basic ADL Scale developed for this study, was especially created for the aged experiencing a loss of autonomy as a consequence of problems other than motor and/or sensorial. It assesses the following activities: taking of a bath (or shower), dressing, grooming, continence and feeding, in relation to some higher cognitive functions. In this study, the test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the scale were evaluated using a sample of normal, depressed and demented subjects. The test-retest reliability was high (Spearman's rho = 0.98), and the concurrent validity of this scale with the Rapid Disability Rating Scale-2 was also high (Spearman's rho = 0.93). These groups of subjects (15 normal, 15 with major depression, 15 demented subjects) were administered this scale and the results indicate that there is a significant difference in the global execution of basic activities in normal, persons with major depression and demented subjects.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv9354194.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n229w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qj86n"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An in-vitro study of the relative displacements in the human knee joint during walking gait</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Williams, C.

Six knee joint specimens were subjected to level walking using a newly developed dynamic gait simulator. After testing with the joints intact, the anterior and then the posterior cruciate ligaments in three of the specimens were transected and the simulation was repeated after each cut. The angular and linear displacements of the tibia and patella were measured using two six degrees-of-freedom goniometers. The method of Euler angles was used to determine the rotations. The total joint reaction was also measured, using a two-axis force plate. An evaluation of the performance of the simulator showed that the required input functions were satisfactorily reproduced.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752h84m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qj86n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25x967b"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Inherent and noise induced asymptotic periodicity</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Provatas, Nicholas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The evolution of phase space densities under the action of nonlinear dynamical systems is studied. The identification of macroscopic properties of these systems is made through their corresponding time dependent phase space density state, in close analogy to statistical mechanics. We focus attention on a property that may arise in either deterministic or stochastically perturbed one dimensional maps, known as asymptotic periodicity (AP). Asymptotically periodic systems exhibit an eventual periodicity in the evolution of their phase space densities. The periodic density cycle that emerges is highly sensitive to the initial density of preparation of the system. Three one dimensional systems possessing AP are studied; the hat map, the quadratic map, and noise perturbed Keener maps. Certain physical properties of these maps are derived highlighting their underlying AP. The idea of using a type of entropy, the conditional entropy, as a measure of localization of a cycle of density states of AP systems is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tq48h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x967b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, General</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vv414"><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular characterization of statin, a protein marker for non-proliferating cells</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Mao, Pei-Lin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One cDNA clone (S1) was isolated from a rat brain expression library by statin-specific monoclonal antibodies. S1 contains a statin-like cDNA insert which on amino acid sequence analysis shows a high homology to human elongation factor-1$ alpha$ (EF-1$ alpha$). S1 gene product, pS1, a statin-like protein fused with $ beta$-galactosidase, was cleaved by an endogenous protease from E. coli; therefore, we reconstructed S1 into a pPL-$ lambda$ vector with a thermo-inducible promoter. To verify that this S1 gene product is distinct from the endogenous E. coli EF-Tu, we used the polyclonal antibody HT7, which specifically recognizes the extreme C-terminal of EF-1$ alpha$ also present in S1, but not in the endogenous EF-Tu. The 3$ sp prime$ and 5$ sp prime$ untranslated regions of S1 were found to be completely different from that of EF-1$ alpha$. The level of EF-1$ alpha$ increased during cell proliferation but dramatically decreased in senescent cells. In contrast, S1 mRNA could only be detected in senescent cells. The presence of three different S1-like mRNAs in the rat brain and four in the liver was demonstrated. While both the statin-like S1 gene and EF-1$ alpha$ may belong to the same multigene family, their expression exhibits inverse patterns in proliferating or non-proliferating cells.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cv16f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vv414</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax346d540f"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Characterization of planar glass waveguides by K+-Na+ ion-exchange</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Noutsios, Peter C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Planar optical waveguides made by purely thermal and electric field-assisted $K sp{+} - Na sp+$ ion-exchange in soda-lime glass substrates are investigated. Buried waveguides fabricated by a purely thermal backdiffusion process have been demonstrated, for the first time, on soda-lime glass. The diffusion properties, such as the potassium-ion concentration, are determined experimentally using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). These properties are then compared to the numerical modeling of the non-linear ion-exchange process and correlated to the waveguide propagation characteristics, such as the refractive index profile. The single-mode dispersion curves are computed by a simple Runga-Kutta procedure and compared to the measured effective mode indices. An experimental characterization of surface waveguides made by an electric field-assisted process with respect to a wide range of fabrication conditions are studied, including measurements of polarization-dependent propagation characteristics. Parallel to this, the diffusion properties are numerically simulated and correlated to the SEM data, providing an accurate description of the refractive index profile.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t3208.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d540f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vv42d"><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Jewish Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of the rise of modern Jewish consciousness in Ludwig August Frankl's "Jews in the east"</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Morris, Nancy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the history of Austrian Jewry, the year 1848 marked a crucial turning point. Although there had been a rapid succession of changes in the lives of Jews in Central Europe, 1848 was a definitive beginning on the road to "modernity" from which there could be no turning back. Ludwig August Frankl was a distinguished representative of this generation of Jews living in the Habsburg realm. He believed in the revolutionary ideals of 1848, and yet was paradoxically not a radical. He was, rather, a representative of that now often forgotten group of Jews who believed in an evolutionary path to modernity that seemed to offer the logical and triumphant culmination of a hundred years of cultural assimilation. Modernity became their identification and their aspiration, and also led to a new perception of their own Judaism. Ludwig August Frankl brought the elements of this new identity to his mission to found the first secular Jewish school in Jerusalem in 1856, the Laemel School.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f956w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vv42d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Frankl, Ludwig August, 1810-1894.

Let S be a subset of the boundary of P, such that a point x of K is visible from s if the line segment joining s to x does not intersect S. The set S is called an obscuring set for s and K with respect to P. What is the smallest number of edges of P that must be included in S, in order to hide K from s? Moreover, what is the minimal subset of the boundary of P that must be included in S in order to hide K from s? We refer to these minimal subsets as minimal obscuring sets. The two questions in the previous paragraph generate several inter-connected problems. The study of these problems is the main focus of this thesis. Several algorithms for constructing minimal obscuring sets are presented, along with some related open

Reinach's ontological and epistemological assumptions are clarified through an analysis of his theories of states-of-affairs, intentionality, and judgments, first developed by Reinach in reference to judgments and subsequently utilized in his analysis of ethical and legal questions. A critical exposition and evaluation of his legal philosophy focuses attention on the analysis of "social acts", "determinations", and the distinctions between the moral and legal spheres. It is found that Reinach's philosophical position can be adequately understood and evaluated only as a whole. Confusions in the literature dealing with Reinach's legal philosophy indeed appear to have arisen precisely through lack of attention to its theoretical structure. Arguments are presented for various qualifications and extensions of Reinach's position.
