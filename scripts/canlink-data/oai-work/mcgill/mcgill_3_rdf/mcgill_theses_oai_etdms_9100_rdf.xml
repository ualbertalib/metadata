The second problem can be termed a problem of design, and simply stated refers to a suggested design for a low cost and low maintenance refractory furnace, for an oil fired steam boiler. The third problem is a mechanical engineering problem and refers to the selection of proper firing equipment to suit the particular service, (type of steam demand) for which this equipment will be used. It is felt that a clear view on these three matters should contribute materially to reductions in the cost of operating oil fired boilers, while at the same time increasing their useful life.

Butthe slightest exposure of the plant to a few degrees of frost in the warm season, providing it is sufficient to cause freezing, is fatal.Death in this case is the direct result of the formation of ice as evidenced by the fact that a plant can be supercooled far below the freezingpoint of its tissues without injury; prevention of supercooling by stimulus to crystallization will result in the immediate death of the plant andthis at a temperature which if it is not at the freezing point of its tissues is well above that reached by supercooling without injury.

The resulting inefficiency of classification prevented reliable conclusions as tothe effects of circulating loads on the grinding efficiency of the mill.Results, however, seem to indicate ore efficient grinding takes place in making a coarser finished product. A comparison between laboratory andcommercial mills shows the latter to be more efficient. This is open to criticism, however, because of classifying infficiency and mill operatingconditions.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bell, J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hz55h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795b756</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mining</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axs55mf838"><ual:graduationDate>1937</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Physiilogical studies of venturia inaequalis (cke). wint</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Cox, Harold Arthur</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A study of the physiology of a pathogen le organism in pure culture is a great aid in an investigation or to an understanding of the much morecomplex and difficult problem of the physiology of its parasitism.

The deposits were formed by injection of an aqueous differentiate from the Morin magma, into fractured sillimanaite-garnetnear the contact with cuartzite. Following the crystallization of magnesite from the injected bodies, aqueous residues attacked the country rocksand formed the zone of hydrothermal alteration now referred to as the ore zone. The solutions acting during the period of hydrothermalalteration were richer in lime than the original differentiate. Consequently, dolomite formed from them as veins and replacements. In places, thelater solutions attacked the earlier formed magnesite and altered it to dolomite.The literature on magnesite deposits of the world is reviewed and the various types of magnesite deposits are described. A comparison shows thatthe Grenville deposits are more closely related to the sagvandite group of igneous rocks with primary magnesite, than to other deposits suchas those of the Veitsch type which are replacements of limestone.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Osborne, F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w66346717.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55zb79x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988n912"><ual:graduationDate>1937</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Horticulture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Some investigations with regard to the effect of nitrogen on the storage qualities of celery</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bourque, Leopold</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>[...]The yield of celery growing on muck soils was not increased by increasing the nitrogen content of the fertilizer from 0 to 14 per cent, thephosphorus and potash content remaining constant, 8 and 10 per cent respectively. Furthermore, there, was no change in size of plant as measured by weight, diameter and height ofplants.With regard to wilting in cold storage no significant difference was noted between lots of celery from different nitrogen plots. Dry matterdeterminations likewise showed no significant difference between plots.Celery from the different nitrogen plots showed similar physical storage qualities, pithiness, breakdown of leaves and petioles,etc.Varying the nitrogen content of the fertilizer mixture did not change the total nitrogen content of the plant as no significant difference existingin quantities of total nitrogen in plants from different plots is determined by the Kjeldahl method. Only slight decreases were noted in the plantsthroughout the storage period. This decrease was uniform in celery from all plots throughout the storage period.Hexose sugars increased gradually until the end of the storage period, while sucrose sugars showed a slight decrease.It was concluded that the period of economical storage was 90 to 100 days under the conditions of this experiment.A carefully planned fertilizer experiment has been presented for consideration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Murray, H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445ch31v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988n912</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Horticulture-Botany</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214s199"><ual:graduationDate>1937</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Humoral and local hormonal mechanisms regulating the activity of the digestive glands</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacIntosh, Frank Campbell</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The digestive glands are activated by nervous and humoral stimuli: the latter include both specific digestive hormones and active substances derivedfrom the food and absorbed into the blood; the former are now believed to act through the liberation of 'local hormones'. The significance of thesevarious stimuli is discussed in the introduction. I have investigated the mechanisms underlying certain phenomena of salivary secretion, viz.the 'augmented secretion' and the response of the 'paralytic' gland to sympathetic stimulation.These have been shown to depend not on a motor actionof the sympathetic, but on an increased irritability of the secretory cells; and the theory is advanced that this increased irritability is due toa passage of acetylcholine from the alveolar to the neighbouring demilune cells. The choline-esterase content of the cat's submaxillary gland isunaffected by degenerative section of the chorda tympani.
