By prescribing pole locations in the discrete-time domains or usable sampling periods in a continuous-time context, sensitivity specifications in time constant of a real pole, natural frequency, damping ratio and uncertain relative region of a complex pole can be achieved. It is shown in this thesis that the alternative discrete-time operators, $ varepsilon, z sp prime, w sp prime$ and z, provide superior performance in the propagation of errors coming from coefficient quantization of first order control laws than the z operator at fast sampling rates, and possess sensitivity properties converging to those of an equivalent continuous-time system as the sampling interval approaches zero. A two-stage least squares identification process of a high order plant is studied with emphasis placed on sensitivity effects as well as on the effect of the accuracy of the digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters. The Euler form identification process is shown to yield the most accurate continuous-time pole estimates among the operator forms examined in this work and the accuracy of the converters is shown to bring an upper limit on the sampling rate, at which the data are captured for identification, so that relatively accurate pole estimates are obtained.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hori, N.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr172031p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r521s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289m03v"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Static and fatigue behaviour of unidirectional composites in compression</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Milette, Jean-Fran√ßois</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this research, the test methods and specimen configurations are studied for both static and fatigue characterization of composite materials in compression, using carbon/epoxy as an example. A new test method was developed to allow for both static and compression fatigue testing. Finite element analyses were performed to analyze the effect of Teflon inserts between the tabs and specimen on the stress distribution in the specimen. The test uses a conventional material testing machine equipped with hydraulic grips. No fixture was needed to test the specimen, which is an important advantage especially in fatigue testing, where the fixture itself can be damaged. The plasma projected wedges of the hydraulic grips provide good friction between the wedges and the specimen. No anti-buckling device was needed because of the short gage length used. The use of Teflon inserts effectively reduces the stress concentration at the end of the tabs in both static and fatigue loading. Experimental results of the new test method for static loading of unidirectional AS4/3501-6 are discussed. The new approach results in comparable static compression strength, and failure predominantly in the middle of the gage length. Then, fatigue testing results are presented for unidirectional AS4/3501-6. To completely characterize this material under compression fatigue loading, life curves with different stress ratios (R = $ rm sigma sb{min}/ sigma sb{max}$) are produced in the form of constant life diagrams. The residual strength and stiffness were measured by static compression of the specimen after compressive cyclic loading and removal before final failure. These results are presented in the form of strength and modulus degradation curves. The compression-compression fatigue test results are part of a complete fatigue progressive damage theory developed at McGill University.

The superiority of the expansion tube over the non-reflected and reflected shock tubes will be shown. Further, a method of increasing testing times of combustible flows in the expansion tube through use of a chemical inhibitor is proposed and validated theoretically. The compound selected to illustrate the concept is CF$ sb3$Br. In order to carry out the theoretical analysis of the expansion tube with reactive gas in the presence of trace amounts of inhibitor, the following empirical relation relating the induction period, $ tau,$ to the concentration of the reactants and the local gas temperature is used: tau=0.235 lbrack CH sb4 rbrack sp{0.33} lbrack O sb2 rbrack sp{-1.03} lbrack Ar rbrack sp0 lbrack CF sb3Br rbrack sp{1.35}e{ sp{25.82 over Re T}} It will be shown that at free stream Mach numbers of approximately 6 with velocities on the order of 3000 m/s in the test region, an uninhibited mixture of argon diluted methane-oxygen cannot sustain the elevated temperatures of the post normal primary shock region without experiencing premature combustion. With trace amounts of CF$ sb3$Br (1% or 2% of total mixture), however, sufficient lengthening of the induction delay period occurs so as to afford testing time in the test region of the expansion tube. Comparisons of three different uninhibited combustible mixtures--CH$ sb4$-O$ sb2$-Ar, C$ rm sb3H sb8$-O$ sb2$-Ar and C$ rm sb2H sb4$-O$ sb2$-Ar will also be made at lower operating conditions to demonstrate the marching action of the explosion line on the t-x wave diagram for the operation of the expansion tube with reactive gas.

Quantitative ultrasound techniques that relate lung tissue acoustic properties, i.e. acoustic velocity, attenuation, and scattering, to its physical properties, such as, elastic and structural properties, have been reviewed. B-mode techniques were equipment dependent and produced conflicting results. A-mode techniques are less dependent on the measuring equipment and could provide more accurate information about lung development. A-node techniques were applied to the study of regional differences within the fetal lung. The accuracy of these techniques could be instrumental to the eventual determination of lung maturation. To pursue this possibility, the alveolar regions across the upper, middle, and lower lobes of physiologically mature normal preterm lamb lungs were scanned to determine their acoustic properties within the frequency range of 1-15 MHz. Average speed of sound, attenuation and size of backscatterers were found to be independent of lung regions. Comparison between the lung mean size of backscatterers and mean alveolar sac diameter, histologically measured from the whole lung, showed that these data were not statistically different. This suggested that the collagen rich alveolar sac septal walls were the principal sources of scattering. Histological measurements on the size of alveolar sacs across different regions of the lung were also independent of the lung regions. The results of this study on the fetal lamb lungs suggested that A-mode ultrasound is sensitive to lung developmental changes. The ability of A-mode ultrasound to determine lung maturity appears promising. Further experiments on regional lung development and lung maturation at the pre and post-surfactant synthesis stages of the gestational life may establish the basis for an accurate and risk-free ultrasound assessment of lung maturation that is reliable in a clinical setting</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Watkin, Kenneth L.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cc939.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pj39q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Human Development</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687k29m"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A study of the impact of flexible AC transmission system devices on the economic-secure operation of power systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Griffin, Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines how Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices can improve the secure-economic operation of a power system. More specifically, the benefits of FACTS devices in a network are evaluated in terms of four areas of power system study: system security, economic dispatch operation, maximum network loadability and electric industry deregulation. Simulations of a simple network are made to evaluate how a FACTS device can be used to increase the security region of a network. Based on this analysis, simulations are performed using the 24-bus IEEE reliability test network to assess the possible savings in generation costs, the increase in maximum network loadability and the improvements in flexibility of exchanges resulting from the use of a FACTS device in this network. The results demonstrate that FACTS devices can be used effectively to increase the security region of a network thereby allowing for a better optimum operating point in any optimization problem performed over such a region.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galiana, F.

Most of the solute is solubilized in micelles, which are aggregates of surfactant molecules, formed in the feed solution. Separation is achieved through retention of the micelles by an ultrafiltration membrane. Since much of the solute is within the micelles, a membrane with a molecular weight cut off (MWCO) much larger than the molecular weight of the solute is used. Although some unsolubilized solute and surfactant monomers pass through the membrane, the use of a surfactant with a low critical micelle concentration (CMC) ensures little contamination of the permeate by surfactant monomers. Solubilization tests and MEUF experiments were performed with an aqueous feed solution of benzoic acid (molecular weight 122) and Rhodameen T12/90 (molecular weight 798), a twin-head, cationic tertiary amine surfactant. This surfactant has an 18 carbon hydrophobic tail and two hydrophilic polyoxyethylene heads. The equilibrium solubilization of benzoic acid by surfactant solutions was measured by semiquilibrium dialysis. The maximum solubilization was nearly one mole of benzoic acid per mole of Rhodameen. MEUF was carried out in hollow fiber polysulfone membrane units with MWCO of 5,000 and 30,000. The permeate flux and overall rejection of benzoic acid and surfactant were measured for different initial feed compositions and initial surfactant concentrations under varying transmembrane pressures (TMP). The flux increased with TMP and decreased with Rhodameen concentration, but was not affected by the benzoic acid concentration. The highest rejections of benzoic acid (90%) and Rhodameen (95%) were obtained when the molar ratio of surfactant to solute in the feed was 1.2.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Weber, M.

The most promising technologies were found to be enhanced biological phosphorus removal, treatment plant process optimization and on-line process control. The use of alum sludges from potable water treatment plants appeared promising although it has not yet been widely practised or studied. The MEF therefore decided to retain the process as one requiring further study. Through batch sorption tests with synthetic solutions, it was found that aluminum hydroxide has a significant sorptive capacity for orthophosphate, condensed phosphate and organic phosphate. The removal of these phosphates was independent of pH between pH 3 and pH 6. The solubility of the aluminum hydroxide was highly pH-dependent. In all the tests, except that with organic phosphate at pH 3.6, the measured soluble aluminum was consistent with solutions saturated with solid-phase Al(OH)$ sb3$. With organic phosphate at pH 3.6, an aluminum-organic phosphate appears to have formed. A theoretical analysis of Al(OH)$ sb3$ and Al(PO$ sb4)$ precipitation showed that phosphate removal is not achieved through Al(PO$ sb4)$ precipitation when dosing with conventional alum, but rather that a mixed aluminum hydroxide phosphate precipitate is formed. Jar tests performed with full-scale alum sludge and wastewater showed that phosphate is removed by the particulate fraction of the sludge. The removal of reactive phosphate (orthophosphate) decreased with an increase in the storage time of the alum sludge. This decrease was not seen with the non-reactive phosphate. It was therefore suggested that reactive phosphate removal is carried out by adsorption and that non-reactive phosphate removal is performed by a sweep-floc mechanism.

The two underlying principles of our approach to stereo vision are local computation of binocular disparities and the use of the resulting disparity map for image segmentation. The cepstrum is used to provide an estimation of binocular disparity between corresponding regions of the stereo image pair. We study the cepstrum and its properties, and suggest improvements to the initial disparity estimation stage. Next a modified median filtering scheme is employed for the refinement of the initial disparities using neighbourhood information. The overall disparity map is used for image segmentation based on distance. Local estimation of initial disparities provides two fundamental advantages for real-time systems: the possibility of increased computational efficiency through parallel implementation and a fixed running time that is independent of image properties. Furthermore, using stereopsis for figure-ground segmentation rather than surface reconstruction eliminates the need for camera calibration which is essential for methods based on exact depth calculation. Therefore, the approach is well-suited to active vision systems in which the cameras are in constant motion. We provide evidence for the plausibility of the disparity estimation algorithm and the properties of the overall disparity map in the context of biological stereopsis. The algorithm is implemented on a network of TMS320C40 processors to obtain a processing time of one second for a 128-pixel $ times$ 128-pixel image frame.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levine, M.

A linear force-to-force model is used to study the dynamics of the transmission, to predict how certain system parameters affect the response, and how these parameters can be modified for improvements. To this end, sensitivity analysis was applied to show how the system is affected for each of its components considered in the linear model. This sensitivity analysis leads to criteria that can be used to choose the best values for the parameters to achieve a wide bandwidth and a good disturbance rejection. Nominal values of some parameters were identified with the help of a testbed representing one channel of the haptic interface. Significant nonlinearities were observed in force-to-force, force-to-velocity, and force-to-position phase plots. The open loop and closed loop responses (using a proportional, a second and a fourth order lead controllers) were then compared. The final design of the controller was done using the loopshaping technique. This controller was designed from the information about linear behavior of the plant and to reduce the nonlinearities shown in the force-to-force phase plot. The idea is to lump the memory effects of the transmission as a linear model, while the nonlinear response is assumed to be memoryless. This can actually be experimentally verified. A robust controller was designed given the range of uncertainty given by the open loop response to signals with different amplitudes. It is capable of reducing the nonlinearities seen in the open loop response to insignificant values. The controller also exhibits very good disturbance rejection and robustness. The performance of each controller is presented in terms of the closed loop Bode plot and phase plot. Experimental results are presented showing the characteristics of the controller.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayward, Vincent</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50tt745.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nw61m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494b40h"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Squeeze casting of A356 aluminumdiscontinuous Saffil alumina fibre composites</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Brzezinski, Tracey</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The ability to tailor specific properties, such as stiffness, hardness and thermal expansion has led to the use of metal matrix composites (MMCs) in a wide variety of engineering applications.

This work deals with the fabrication and evaluation of an aluminum casting alloy (A356) reinforced with short Al$ sb2$O$ sb3$ fibre (mean fibre length $ sim$265 $ mu$m) using the squeeze casting technique. Discontinuous Al$ sb2$O$ sb3$ fibre preforms of different volume fractions (5-15%), were infiltrated with metal using various melt temperatures (775-825$ sp circ$C) and pressures (20-60 MPa). The microstructure and the mechanical properties of MMCs and unreinforced A356 were investigated. In addition, the MMC response to heat treatment operations was assessed. The microstructure consisted of primary Al, eutectic Si particles at the fibre surface, and homogeneously dispersed, randomly oriented short fibres. Excellent fibre/matrix contact was achieved and little or no porosity was detected. There was no evidence of any bulk chemical reactions between fibre and matrix alloy at the interface. The material exhibited a range of properties depending on the Al$ rm sb2O sb3$ content and the casting pressure. In general, the density, elastic modulus, tensile strength, and bulk hardness increased with fibre content and the elongation to failure decreased significantly.

A number of techniques were applied to give insight into the mechanism, including adsorption studies, microflotation tests, and solution and surface analyses. It was revealed that dextrin only adsorbed on mineral surfaces that contained some metal ionic sites. The degree of adsorption depended on the nature of the metal species, with lead being more reactive than iron. Dextrin was able to depress pyrite, regardless of whether dextrin adsorbed or not; however, adsorbed dextrin was more effective. It appeared as if dextrin inhibited the formation of dixanthogen on the surface, which could lead to reduced floatability of pyrite. Finally, it was observed that over time, adsorbed dextrin underwent a conformational change on the surface of the mineral. This change permitted a greater amount of xanthate to adsorb on the mineral.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, J.

(Vincent Joseph)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Researchers have linked resin and fatty acids (RFAs) to acute toxicity, especially in thermomechanical and chemithermomechanical pulp and paper mill effluents. Thus, the measurement of total RFAs may be a rapid, inexpensive alternative to standard methods of toxicity monitoring, such as 96-hour rainbow trout testing. Current procedures for the analysis of RFAs typically involve solvent extraction and concentration, derivatization, and analysis by GC, HPLC, or TLC. These procedures are far too expensive, complicated, and time-consuming for implementation at mill sites. This thesis reports the development of a rapid, colourimetric assay based on the dye methylene blue (MB) for the quantification of resin and fatty acids in pulp and paper mill effluents. This MB assay uses the complexation of the cationic organic dye molecule to the carboxylic acid groups of RFAs to form a measurable chromophore. The electrically neutral, blue-coloured complexes are then extracted into a poorly polar organic solvent, dichloromethane. The measured absorbance at 655 nm is directly related to the total RFA concentration in the effluent sample. The methylene blue assay is inexpensive and simple to use. It has a method detection limit of 0.589 mg/L total RFA. There are good correlations between the results obtained using the methylene blue assay and a well-established GC assay, and between RFA concentrations measured by the MB assay and acute toxicity measured by Microtox. The assay is sufficiently simple and rapid to be practical for routine in-mill monitoring.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Neufeld, Ronald J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fz80q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k473p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Environmental</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agriculture, Wood Technology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Analytical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av118rg53v"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Hamka's method of interpreting the legal verses of the Qur'ƒÅn : a study of his Tafsir al-Azhar</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yusuf, Milhan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Having been influenced by the Muslim reformist ideas championed by Muhammad 'Abduh and his colleagues, Hamka attempted to disseminate and ameliorate the reform ideas in his country, Indonesia, through the means available to him; that is by preaching and writing. He was among the most prolific contemporary authors, having written 113 books including his monumental Tafsir al-Azhar. In this commentary, Hamka has probably included the sum of his ideas particularly those pertaining to religious aspects. With regards to the religious aspects, he mostly discusses the problems of theology, sufism and law. Hamka's conception of the law portrays his challenge and struggle towards the abolishment of taqlid (uncritical acceptance of the decisions made by the predecessors) and the implementation of ijtihad (personal opinion). In addition, his legal comments and interpretations are quite different from many of the comments made by sectarian commentators, who saw in tafsir a forum for defending their schools of thought. However, Hamka steered away from any school of thought and tried to be as objective as possible in his work, an attempt reflected in his method of interpreting the problematic legal verses. Moreover, he did not limit himself to a single method of interpretation. On the contrary, he availed himself of both the tafsir bi al-ma'thur method (interpretation derived from the Prophet, the Companions and the Successors) and the tafsir bi al-ra'y method (interpretation based on reason).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boullata, Issa J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th53n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rg53v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islamic law -- Interpretation and construction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hamka, 1908- Tafsir al-Azhar</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn301341d"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Heavy with the unspoken : the interplay of absence and presence in Margaret Atwood's Cat's eye</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Weinstein, Sheri M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explores the philosophical, linguistic and textual interplay of absence and presence in Margaret Atwood's novel Cat's Eye. The premise of the thesis is that the novel posits language as a problematic communicative medium; as such, language conveys that meanings of words are flexible, mutable and transient. It is through frameworks which both establish states of absence and presence as well as destroy binary oppositions between the two that Cat's Eye conveys its positions about language. Thus, textual and extra-textual discourses about the natures of language and linguistic meaning are situated within recurrent thematic and formal attention to relationships between absence and presence. By exploring the roles of absence and presence in various phenomenological and linguistic contexts, this study concludes that absence/presence is a paradigm in Cat's Eye for the way in which words are (alternately as well as simultaneously) spoken and silent, understood and misunderstood, opposed and united.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooke, Nathalie</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj40g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301341d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Atwood, Margaret, 1939- Cat's eye</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930c032p"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Mapping forest decline risk factors in the Quebec Appalachians</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wallace, Ian, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The causes of recent episodes of forest decline in Canada have not yet been fully determined.

Geographic Information Systems are used to map a series of forest decline risk factors relating to soil characteristics and topography. The individual risk factors, as well as models comprising weighted combinations of risk factors, are compared with actual defoliation patterns. Forest defoliation is determined using areal survey data and satellite imagery. Although statistically significant associations were obtained between defoliation patterns and several risk factors, the amount of association was not strong enough to conclude that these factors are dominant causes of forest decline.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Meredith, Thom</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462749g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c032p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Forest declines -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Estrie</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sugar maple -- Effect of acid deposition on -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Estrie</dc:subject><dc:subject>Forest mapping -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Estrie</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956h96q"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The voice of truth : life and works of Sayyid N≈´r Mu·∏•ammad ShƒÅh, a 15th16th century IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´ mystic</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Virani, Shafique</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Isma'ilism, one of the most colourful and dynamic sects of Islam, boasts a rich and fascinating history. This thesis studies the life and works of Nur Muhammad Shah, a gifted exponent of the Isma'ili Sat Panth movement in Indo-Pakistan during the 15th/16th centuries. Sat Panth, the Path of Truth, is the highly mystical form of Isma'ilism which resulted from conversion efforts in the Subcontinent during the eleventh and subsequent centuries. The legacy of the order which was fostered is to be found in its corpus of sacred religious literature known as Ginans, an appellation that suggests supreme, gnostic knowledge. The Sat Panthi Isma'ilis consider the Ginans to be the embodiment, par excellence, of the Qur'an's esoteric dimension. Nur Muhammad Shah is the last of the Sat Panth authors for whom a large body of Ginanas has been preserved. This work gives a historical background of the Isma'ili movement in Indo-Pakistan, examines the career of Nur Muhammad Shah from the earliest available primary sources and disproves suggestions by previous scholars that he forsook his allegiance to the Isma'ili Imam and became the founder of his own rival sect. In addition, it provides for the first time a scholarly translation of a significant portion of the Nur Muhammad Shah's Sat Veni Moti or Tale of Truth (Larger), an important Sat Panthi mystical text.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Landalt, Hermann</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708z95c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956h96q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>N≈´r Mu·∏•ammad ShƒÅh, 1463?-1534</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ismailites -- India</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar494vn04v"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Architecture under the knife : Viollet-le-Duc's illustrations for the Dictionnaire Raisonn√© and the anatomical representation of architectural knowledge</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Vinegar, Aron</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The numerous illustrations--or better yet demonstrations--in Viollet-le-Duc's Dictionnaire Raisonne of Gothic architecture were the most powerful means of implementing biological metaphors in order to transfer or situate the discourse of architecture within the realm of nineteenth century positivistic science. Viollet-le-Duc borrowed dissective strategies of representation from the field of anatomy to implement his alternate 'vision' for appropriating architectural knowledge. By inscribing anatomical metaphors within his architectural drawings, Viollet-le-Duc could filter the viewer's conception of architecture through his own appropriation of anatomy's critical and selective methods of representation. This scientific approach to architectural drawing was in perfect harmony with Viollet-le-Duc's textual and conceptual mission in the Dictionnaire to not only demystify architectural knowledge as practiced at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, but also to critically reconfigure the reader's relationship to it according to his own system. Through this process, it was his intent to change the public's way of thinking and seeing architecture.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boker, Hans</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nt107.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vn04v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architectural drawing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Viollet-le-Duc, Eug√®ne-Emmanuel, 1814-1879.

An interview-protocol was also used to collect in-depth data from six first-year and six second-year students, and six teachers, and three administrators. Analysis of data suggested that 70% of students and also 80% of the majority of the participants in this study were satisfied with Vanier College's pre-university program. Students' satisfaction was due to the following factors: academic rigor, good teaching, a highly motivated student body, appropriate administrative support, encouragement from peers and the home, and a positive school climate. The study concluded that students were quite well prepared for universities, such as McGill University, in basic academic skills. The study focused on positive qualities that the Honours program possessed.

The banning of a short story, a novel, a theatrical play, a film, a poem or any other kind of artistic enterprise is an attestation of such a crucial reference. Exploring the relation of Islam and literature, with Indonesian Islam as a background, this thesis will examine the short story Langit Makin Mendung written by Kipankjikusmin. Langit Makin Mendung, which was published in August 1968 in the magazine Sastra, was condemned by the majority of Indonesian Muslims, for it was considered to be blasphemous, insulting God, the Prophet, the archangels, the 'ulama' and the kiyai (traditional scholars), and it was judged to be in contravention of the Constitution of '45. In terms of the public reaction to Langit Makin Mendung, the critiques concern three aspects: legal, literary and religious views. Apart from such views, the thesis also examines Islamic teachings on intellectual freedom and on freedom of speech. It will be shown that the political turbulence that occurred during the Old Order regime, especially in the era of the so-called Guided Democracy, and that the Communist movement of the 1960s are foremost among the influences on the milieu in which this short story was written. In addition to the socio-political context, this thesis assesses the theological aspect which focuses on the significant connection of the Islamic Weltanschauung and literature as an indicator of the status on freedom of literary expression in a Muslim society.

This issue has been dealt with from various perspectives. Some scholars claim that Roman law was the predominant influence in formulating Islamic law, both in its legal concepts and its application. Certain scholars, however, maintain that the provincial law influenced Islamic law more, arguing that Roman law was not really practiced in former Greek provinces where Islamic law was formulated. Still others argue that Jewish influences are also believed to have shaped the development of early Islamic law, considering that Babylonian schools were situated close to the Hanafi school. The problem of foreign influences on early Islamic law, however, is a matter of degree only as far as the pre-Islamic Arab traditions are concerned. It is believed that certain institutions derived from pre-Islamic Arabic society, the Qur' an and the traditions of the Prophet provided the early Muslims with a considerable wealth of values, norms and broad principles as well as specific rules which were to guide the Muslims in their legal speculation in order to develop positive law.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hallaq, Wael B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z303z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mx54s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islamic law -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930c033z"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>D√©partement de langue et litt√©rature fran√ßaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>La g√©n√©ration X dans le roman qu√©b√©cois actuel</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Soulard, Louis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The following Master's thesis is proposing the analysis of five novels, written between 1988 and 1993, by five young Quebec writers. The object of this research is to study the representation of "generation X" in these five texts. The introduction of the thesis establishes the parameters of the "generation X", which comprises people born between 1959 and 1974. This definition constitutes the basis of our comparison between the concept of "generation X" and the main characters of the novels, who are "fictive" members of this generation. The rest of the thesis includes three chapters, devoted to the following themes: the politic perception of young characters, their economic situation and their attitude toward society. Necessarily, our analysis also considers the difference of perception between "baby-boomers" (people born between 1944 and 1959) and "generation X". This comparison is essential because "generation X" defines itself in opposition with adults values and institutions: reject of political power and authority, reject of work, instruction and money, refusal to integrate society. The main purpose of this analysis is to see how the present Quebec novel integrates, assimilates and thinks the socio-historic context where it takes place, and how it could possibly renew the forms and the style of Quebec novel in general.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boucher, Jean-Pierre</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cw13t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c033z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reproduction -- Qu√©bec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>French-Canadian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f4627507"><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Uncapping the volcano : Malcolm Lowry, literary creativity, and writer's block</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sinclair, Struan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Literary creativity and its shadow, the phenomenon popularly referred to as writer's block, have historically been accorded little attention by literary studies. In my thesis I seek to redress this oversight, illustrating my argument with reference to the creative life and works of Malcolm Lowry. I begin by arguing for a model of literary creativity that takes seriously the roles played by plans and intentions in motivating, sustaining and appropriately terminating literary creative action. I employ this model in order to provide a basis from which to clarify Lowry's own creative method. I go on to rehearse and evaluate definitions and theories of writer's block from a variety of research paradigms. From these accounts I distill some important general features of writer's block. I argue that writer's block typically occurs as an intervention between stages of the literary creative process. Finally, I return to detailed consideration of Lowry's creative method. I investigate three critical periods of writer's block in Lowry's later life and examine these interventions with reference to circumstantial, methodological and goal-based considerations. I conclude by drawing attention to the importance for literary studies of an accurate and comprehensive understanding of both literary creativity and writer's block.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bristol, Michael D.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hm263.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f4627507</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Writer's block</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lowry, Malcolm, 1909-1957 -- Psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
