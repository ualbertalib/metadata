Up to now in Quebec, no nitrogen fertilizer recommendation has been based on nitrogen availability in the soil, even those soil nitrogen testing is available. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the relation between soil nitrate-N content, nitrogen fertilization and potato yield; and (2) to determine the time and the sampling depth of soil most appropriate to predict potato yields and response to nitrogen fertilizer under Quebec conditions. Soil samples were taken at two depths at planting and at hilling time in 28 sites fertilized at four levels of nitrogen. Laboratory measures of nitrate-N were carried out on those samples. A combination of nitrate-N and nitrogen fertilisation gave the best explanation of the variation potato yields. A maximum of 46% of yield variation was attributed to the combination of those two factors in general. Best coefficients of determination were obtained when the sampling of nitrate-N was done at planting time compared to time. Regression models predicted nitrogen fertilizer needs of 89 to 200 kg ha$ sp{-1}.$ The same conclusions were found in the case of the variety Superior alone. The variation of yield explained was up to 62%. Regression models predicted nitrogen fertilizer needs of 77 to 224 kg ha$ sp{-1}$ for Superior. It was concluded that the analysis of soil nitrate-N can improve the prediction of nitrogen fertilizer needs for an optimum potato production.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mackenzie, A.

Conventional radiosurgery employs a stereotactic frame in order to obtain sufficient spatial accuracy in dose delivery. Frame based verification methods attempt to ensure accurate target positioning with respect to the frame but they do not account for possible movement of the frame with respect to the anatomy and isocenter. We account for this possibility by superimposing digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) over orthogonal edge detected digital portal image pairs. By developing a process for interactively manipulating the CT-data in three dimensions (rotations and translations) new DRRs are generated and overlaid with orthogonal portal images. This method is able to account for ambiguities in matching due to rotations and translations outside the imaging plane because of the availability of DRRs at any possible orientation. This matching procedure is performed using only the anatomy and is used in tandem with a fiducial marker array attached to the stereotactic frame. The method is evaluated using portal images simulated from patient CT-data and then tested using a radiographic head phantom. Results show that repositioning precision of the system is at the level required by stereotactic radiosurgery.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fallone, B.

(Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) on the radial growth of tree species that differ in their acceptability as hosts for gypsy moth larvae. Annual growth rings were measured from 1950 to 1992 on increment cores taken from three species: red oak (Quercus rubra L.), a preferred species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), an acceptable species, and white ash (Fraxinus americana L.), an avoided species. The number of gypsy moth larvae on these same individual trees had already been recorded from 1979 to 1992. To remove the potentially-confounding effects of climate on radial growth, I developed regression models of growth on climate in a pre-gypsy moth period (1950 to 1975), and then used these models to predict growth in a post-gypsy moth period (1978 to 1992). The residuals from these growth models were then examined with respect to gypsy moth numbers.

Although antiviral drugs have been important in the treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals, toxicity and resistance have mandated new efforts and strategies. We have tried to develop a trans-dominant gene therapy approach, by showing that mutated Gag-Pol polyproteins can be incorporated into viral particles. In our studies, Gag-Pol proteins that were mutated in protease (PR) and combinations of mutations in PR and reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibited the production of fully processed and infectious viral particles when coexpressed with the infectious HIV-1 molecular clone, pBH10. Viral particles produced after cotransfection of COS-7 cells with both pBH10 and Gag-Pol, mutated in PR alone or in both RT and PR, showed abnormal processing and lower infectivity, suggesting that a trans-dominant negative effect had occurred. These effects were not seen when Gag-Pol with a deleted integrase ($ Delta$IN) and the same RT and PR mutations were co-expressed with pBH10. Complementation experiments in which pBH10 mutated in PR was co-expressed with wild-type Gag-Pol showed that the latter could be incorporated into viral particles. Finally, COS-7 cells stably transfected with Gag-Pol mutated in PR or in both PR and RT, and subsequently transfected with pBH10, showed diminished production of viral particles.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wainber, Mark A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720f89p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k004q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75df52r"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification of low molecular weight compounds produced or utilized by pychrotrophic meat spoilage organisms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Moosavi-Nasab, Marzieh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Meat Juice Medium (MJM), an aqueous extract of meat, was inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and incubated for 7 d at 4$ sp circ$C under shaking conditions (100 rev.min$ sp{-1}$).

These compounds with retention times (RT) of 21.48 and 32.04 min were tentatively identified as acetic and butyric acids, respectively. These compounds were also produced when MJM was replaced with Brain Heart Infusion Broth medium. In later experiments, the effect of glucose supplementation on the rate of MJM spoilage was examined.

HPLC of samples after 1d of incubation indicated the presence of 8 predominant compounds including acetic and butyric acids.

Using HPLC, TLC, Pyrolysis/GC/MS, FTIR and GC-MS methodologies, the compounds with RT of 8.91, 9.67, 11.96, 13.33, 17.74, 21.48, 26.07 and 32.04 min were tentatively identified as cadaverine, 2-keto gluconic acid, fructose, lactic acid, acetic acid, methanol and butyric acid. In contrast to the results of previous researchers, cadaverine was produced in large amounts while no putrescine was produced by P. aeruginosa. During the spoilage period, the levels of glucose, fructose and total carbohydrate were monitored. Addition of glucose to MJM delayed slime production by 4 days and increase to maximum pH of 8.3 by 7 days.

At current prices, lupins were not a profitable base case scenario. The gross margin of the dairy farm was $147,918. This resulted in a total soil loss of 3,504 tonnes (t), 50 percent higher than soil tolerance, T (acceptable level of soil loss) of 14 t ha$ sp-1,$ and produced 541 kg of Nitrogen (N). Sale of corn grain (CG) was 442.3 t, constituting about 39 percent of the gross margin but had a negative effect on the soil. The farm purchased 59 t of straw for animal bedding. When the environmental constraint of soil erosion, 14 t ha$ sp{-1},$ was imposed, the gross margin was estimated to be $131,148 while total N and soil loss were 2,454 kg and 1,708 t, respectively. Lupins were produced on 18.3 ha with this soil loss level constraint. The tradeoff between soil loss and gross margin and lupins was observed. The N fixation constraint reduced the gross margin while it increased soil loss. CG sales were reduced from 442 to 244.5 t but milk production increased by 163 hectolitres (HL). Sensitivity analysis on labour supply and farm size indicated that lupins became an alternative to soybeans when farm size and labour supply were larger and fewer respectively. Lupins would substitute for soybeans if yield is increased by 5 percent; cost of production is reduced by 10 percent and home grown clean lupin seed is used for 2 or 3 more years or government provides a subsidy of $328 ha$ sp-1.$ This is approximately equal to the CG subsidy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thomassin, Paul J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k06989494.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945s77g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Soybean -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lupines -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Feeding and feeds -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21th45z"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Using Bombus impatiens Cr. as a pollinator of greenhouse sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Meisels, Susan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The pollination of greenhouse sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L. var. grossum cv.

B. impatiens pollination resulted in a significantly greater number of seeds per fruit and a greater percent marketable fruit, due to a positive quadratic relationship between seed number and fruit weight, than both vibration wand and NGV. Both B. impatiens and NGV resulted in a significantly greater fruit set than vibration wand. Per fruit, an extra profit of $0.06 for green and $0.13 for red sweet peppers could be made by B. impatiens pollination over NGV, due to greater marketable fruit and greater mean fruit weight. B. impatiens pollination was more effective than both vibration wand and NGV even though both the daily activity of the insect at the hive (hive traffic) and their foraging on plants (greenhouse foraging) decreased throughout the pollination period and attained a maximum of only 3 B. impatiens foraging in the greenhouse during the second period.

(Gavin)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The southwestern region of the Manicouagan reservoir occupies the structurally uppermost position in the Parautochthonous belt, in the Grenville province, in eastern Quebec. The region consists principally of well banded grey gneisses composed essentially of plagioclase, quartz and biotite. An assemblage of rocks consisting of dolomitic marbles, quartzites, iron formations and pelites, occurs throughout the region. This assemblage can be correlated to rocks in the tectonic foreland to the north of the Grenville Front, that were deposited on the continental margin of Laurentia during the Paleo-Proterozoic. The east-striking, and moderately south-dipping, Utishku fault zone runs through the middle of the region, and juxtaposes eclogite-facies rocks to the north with amphibolite-facies rocks to the south. Kinematics on the Utishku fault zone are unclear. The relationship, however, of high-pressure rocks in the footwall, and lower-pressure rocks in the hangingwall, indicates a predominant normal fault motion. Mineral lineations on the Utishku fault zone plunge due south. Normal faulting was, therefore, oblique to the regional northwest-directed compression of the Grenville in eastern Quebec. Mafic rocks from the Utishku fault zone preserve a prograde P-T path. In contrast, pelitic rocks from the Utishku fault zone preserve a retrograde P-T path. The mafic rocks were probably incorporated into the fault at a relatively late stage. It seems likely that the mafics were initially buried by a thrust fault, structurally below the Utishku fault zone, that was active synchronous to normal motion on the Utishku fault zone. The eclogite-facies rocks, to the north of the Utishku fault zone, may, therefore, be bounded by a thrust fault below and a normal fault above, that were coeval. It is suggested that normal faulting and rapid exhumation of eclogite-facies rocks occurred synchronous to regional compression and relatively early in the history of the Grenville orogen.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hynes, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v747j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687k19c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7h149r621"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Chlorisondamine : possible mechanism and sites of action in the rat brain</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Marenco, Ted</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Chlorisondamine (CHL) is a nicotinic antagonist that blocks for several weeks most of the centrally-mediated behavioural effects of nicotine. However, the mechanism for the long-lasting action of CHL in vivo and the brain regions it targets are largely unknown. We hypothesized that the persistent blockade produced by CHL may result from uptake by neuronal terminals, followed by retrograde transport and accumulation of CHL (or metabolite) in the perikarya. The hypothesis was tested in rats, using locomotor tests to measure nicotinic antagonism within mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons. Results did not entirely support the hypothesis. Our hypothesis also predicted that CHL would block the stimulatory effect of nicotine on cerebral glucose utilization only in regions where CHL accumulates in appreciable amounts. To determine which brain regions are targeted by CHL, we used the 2-deoxy-D- (1-$ sp{14}$C) glucose method (Sokoloff et al., 1977).

A questionnaire was distributed to 4,080 children in grades 1 and 4 in a stratified, random sample of 43 schools in Montreal. Results. The mean number of streets crossed was similar by sex and increased with age. Children who attended schools in neighbourhoods ranked as disadvantaged crossed, on average, 50% more streets than those attending non-disadvantaged schools. Similar trends emerged in other SES variables. When analyzed by police district, injury rates and exposure were positively correlated (r$ sp2$ = 0.53). Conclusion. Differences in injury rates by sex or age are poorly explained by exposure to traffic, whereas exposure appears related to socio-economic status. The number of streets crossed is related to injury rates. These results suggest that although a reduction in children's exposure to traffic would possibly diminish the number of pedestrian injuries, a more promising strategy involves reducing the risk of traffic through environmental changes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pless, I.

The possibility that BM reticular cells and FDCs may share common surface properties has been examined in mouse bone marrow by in vivo administration of $ sp{125}$I-labelled purified monoclonal antibodies (mAb) raised against mouse FDC, detecting mAb-binding by light microscope (LM) and electron microscope (EM) radioautography. Young mice were injected intravenously with $ sp{125}$I-mAb FDC-M1, FDC-M2, FDC-M3 and then perfused to remove unbound antibody. Quantitative analyses of radioautographic LM sections of femoral bone marrow revealed discrete FDC-labelling throughout bone marrow sections, especially in outer areas near the surrounding bone and intermediate areas, forming both linear arrangements and irregular patches. Electron microscopy revealed labelling aligned over delicate processes of certain reticular cells intimately associated with lympho hemopoietic cells, as well as localized regions of sinusoidal endothelium, particularly in central areas and at sites of contact with hemopoietic cells. The results demonstrate that a subset of stromal reticular cells in mouse BM express FDC-associated surface determinants, suggesting possible common lineage or functional properties.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Osmond, D.

Both P-gp and MRP are ABC transporters which when overexpressed in tumour cells are capable of enhancing drug efflux, resulting in a drug accumulation deficit. Paradoxically, acquisition of the MDR phenotype frequently results in newfound hypersensitivity to a different group of drugs. This thesis investigates the collateral sensitivity of the P-gp-bearing CHO cell line CH$ sp{ rm R}$ C5 to the calcium channel blocker, verapamil (VRP). In addition, the hypersensitivity of the MRP-bearing SCLC line H69AR to BSO, a depleter of glutathione (GSH), is herein examined. Although VRP clearly induced heightened levels of p53-independent apoptosis in CH$ sp{ rm R}$ C5 cells, blockage of calcium channels was not involved in the cytotoxicity of the drug. BSO clearly killed through depletion of GSH, apparently resulting in heightened levels of necrosis in H69AR cells. In both cases, decreased expression of the Bcl-2 gene appeared to result in hypersensitivity of MDR cells to the toxic effects of BSO and VRP.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Georges, Elias</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fb317.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qb78j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drug resistance</dc:subject><dc:subject>Glycoproteins</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p910c"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Topical glucocorticoids modulate the lesion interface after cerebral cortical stab wounds in adult rats</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Li, Maria S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A lesion interface consisting of a glia limitans lined by a laminin-rich basal lamina forms within 3 weeks after leptomeningeal cells infiltrate into penetrating wounds in the adult mammalian CNS.

Topical glucocorticoids were applied on the surface of cortex encompassing stab wounds. Three weeks later, cryostat sections through the lesioned area were labeled with anti-laminin, anti-GFAP, anti-ED-1 and Nuclear Yellow. Steroid treatment attenuated all components of the lesion, including leptomeningeal cell infiltration. In vitro, steroid treatment did not alter laminin secretion but reduced cell proliferation in leptomeningeal cultures. These results suggest that steroids modulate lesion interface formation in the CNS in part by decreasing leptomeningeal cell proliferation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>David, Samuel</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375z38k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p910c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kc643"><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Classification trees for acoustic models : variations on a theme</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lazaridès, Ariane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the most important problems to be faced when building a speech recognizer is the lack of sufficient training data to estimate all of the parameters of the system.

In this thesis, several variations on this theme will be presented, the first few ones dealing with trees classifying whole HMMs (tree units), the others with trees classifying states of HMMs (tree states).

The optimal thickness and material of the metal plate and a-Se thicknesses are investigated by modelling dose deposition in the a-Se layer for a 6 MV exit beam. Simulations of Detective Quantum Efficiency DQE(f) show that although DQE(0) increases with metal thickness up to $d sb{max},$ there is a cross-over near 1 cycle/mm which indicates that smaller metal thicknesses are more useful to visualize edges and small objects. A similar cross-over, though not as prominent, is also observed with constant metal thickness while varying a-Se thickness. Tungsten front plates are shown be optimal in terms of DQE for the plates under investigation. The effect of the scattered beam, described by the Scatter Fraction SF and Scatter-to-Primary Ratio SPR, is also modelled to ensure that the front-plate, which also acts as a scatter-rejection tool, satisfactorily filters out the scatter component. The SF is measured experimentally with a prototype imager for four metal plate/a-Se combinations and agrees with the Monte Carlo results within experimental uncertainties.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fallone, B.

It was already known that Zapalote Chico possesses some resistance to corn earworm (Heliothis zeae) and variation in Fusarium graminearum ear rot symptom severity had been observed within the population. During two years of experiments, 47 S4- and S5-generation lines were inoculated and ear rot severity was assessed. In addition, eight pigmentation traits and eight morphological traits were recorded. Lines showed significant differences for all recorded traits. Associations were not strong among morphological traits, but were fairly strong among pigmentation traits. Ear rot symptom severity did not seem to be associated with any other trait. The source population and inbred lines exhibited broad ranges of variation and similar bimodal distributions of ear rot symptom severity ratings. Despite significant differences among lines within experiments none of the lines showed distinct and consistent resistance over two years of experiments. It seems that Zapalote Chico lines do not have environmental stability and sufficient potential to be considered worthwhile source of resistance for ear rot.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mather, D.

Cadmium content, holding a mean 0.77 $ mu$g/L, was generally low for most areas with only a few elevated readings in Tripoli (1.89 $ mu$g/L), Checca (1.83 $ mu$g/L), Kaslik (0.79 $ mu$g/L), Beirut (1.19 $ mu$g/L) and Ramlet Al-Bayda (1.77 $ mu$g/L). Mercury content, holding a mean value of 0.06 mg/Kg (wet weight), was below the accepted tolerance limit of 0.5 mg/Kg for all sampling sites. Some 128 samples were then analyzed for fecal coliforms (Escherichia coli and Streptococcus feacalis). Approximately, 50% of the sampling stations showed satisfactory results (less than 100 colonies/100 ml). High counts of fecal coliforms, over 500 colonies/100 ml, collected at Dora, Ramlet Al-Bayda and Antelias, reveal poor sea water quality and a public health hazards to swimmers and fishermen. Some 36 samples were collected and analyzed for dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, salinity and temperature. For all sites sampled, DO averaged 4.03 mg/L, pH averaged 7.97, salinity averaged 38.77 ppt and temperature averaged 27.9$ sp circ$C.

Changes in climate, radial growth and mineral nutrition of trees, as well as the contamination in Mn and Zn of tamarack and black spruce forests of the region during the last forty years were investigated. A growth model based on climatic variables was produced for each species. The regional climate didn't show any steady trend of increase in temperature and precipitation with time. However, the 1953-1964 decade was the warmest one and the 1964-1973 decade received the most precipitation. Radial growth of both species have probably increased during the investigated period. Growth of larch was primarily associated with May and June precipitation (R$ sp2$ = 0.134) when spruce growth was associated with spring temperature and July and August evapotranspiration (R$ sp2$ = 0.352). Wood chemistry (concentration, burden, and elemental ratio) suggests a stable soil fertility in base cations during the last forty years as well as a stable or increased availability of Zn during the last decade.

Field experiments were conducted on a Ste.

The cover crops were red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), forage radish (Raphanus sativus L.), canola (Brassica rapa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), annual rye grass (Lolium multiflorum L.). Three replicates were used in a split plot arrangement of a randomized complete block experiment. Sweet corn and wheat were grown at three fertilizer N rates, 0-75-150 kg N ha$ sp{-1}$ for sweet corn and 0-45-90 kg N ha$ sp{-1}$ for wheat. Cover crop of forage radish, canola and barley were more effective at absorption or soil N than rye grass and clover species at all sample times. Levels of soluble N in the soil were reduced with cover crop in the off-season. Cover crop plots had higher NO$ sp- sb3$-N levels than control plots in the spring, indicating net mineralization and nitrification. Gravitational water NO$ sp- sb3$-N contents were higher in the control plots relative to cover crop plots at both sites. Therefore growing cover crops after harvest of sweet corn and wheat can reduce residual NO$ sb3$-N level in the soil and thus restrict ground water contamination with fertilizer N.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacKenzie, A.

Studies were performed to test the hypotheses (1) that malondialdehyde (MDA), a by-product of lipid peroxidation, affects $ beta$-cell function and integrity in vitro and (2) that such effects might be prevented in the BB rat (a model of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes) in vivo by administration of $ alpha$-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN), a free radical spin trap. First, islets of Wistar-Furth rats were studied at 12, 24 and 40 hr of culture in either 5.5, 11 or 16.5 mM glucose, and MDA at a range of concentrations ($6 times10 sp{-12}$-10$ sp{-3}$M). High concentrations of MDA inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release without corresponding decreases in islet insulin content, suggesting that in situations with high predicted islet free radical content (e.g., autoimmune insulitis) beta cell function may be affected even before the cells are destroyed. Second, 28 diabetes-prone (BBdp) and 13 non diabetes-prone (BBn) rats were given PBN (20 mg/kg) s.c. 2x/day and 27 BBdp and 12 BBn rats received an equal volume of saline. PBN was able to decrease MDA in the absence of the autoimmune process and is remarkably non-toxic. However, it did not prevent diabetes for reasons which may include its concentration at the site of the inflammatory process or specificity to types of radicals trapped. Because it did decrease MDA, either a higher dose or a combination of PBN with other agents may hold promise for disease prevention.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kubow, Stan</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rw45z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032493p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Free radicals (Chemistry)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islands of Langerhans</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lipids -- Peroxidation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diabetes -- Pathophysiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
