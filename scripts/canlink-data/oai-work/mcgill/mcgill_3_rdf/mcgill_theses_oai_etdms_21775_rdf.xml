(Indje Ognianov)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The subject of this work is gallium extraction from sulphate solutions--an additional source of this metal from hydrometallurgical zinc production--with organophosphorus acid reagents: di-2-ethyl hexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and OPAP, a mixed extractant consisting of mono- and di-octyl phenyl phosphoric acids. Extraction proceeds via cation-exchange and Ga$ sp{3+}$ is the reacting species. Gallium is extracted with D2EHPA mostly as GaR$ sb3$ - HR. The results for OPAP suggest existence of four reactions, which form GaM$ sb3,$ GaM$ sb2$D, GaMD$ sb2,$ and GaD$ sb3;$ this explains and allows prediction of behaviour over a wide range of OPAP compositions. Sulphate complexation causes decrease in concentration of the reacting species, and thus lower $D sb{ rm Ga}$ values and extraction rates. Prior knowledge on gallium aqueous complexes is used, and an algorithm developed, to allow quantitative prediction of complexation effects on extraction. The model of mass-transfer with chemical reaction, verified with several known criteria for reaction site determination, describes well the kinetic data for the Ga-D2EHPA system. The model is further developed to account for the stronger acidity and the monomer/dimer equilibria typical for the kind of extractants used. A detailed reaction mechanism is proposed and the first organic ligand addition is found as rate-limiting. The model parameters, estimated from extraction kinetic data, are reasonable, when compared with those obtained for other metals elsewhere. The model's predictions agree with the results from stripping kinetics; the equilibrium conditions (zero rate) can also be satisfactorily predicted, as found by comparisons with the equilibrium data. Ga-D2EHPA and Ga-OPAP systems are compared with an emphasis given to the potential for metal separation; the importance of the ligand exchange rate constant is illustrated with the example of Ga and Al extraction/stripping and their separation based on different rates with</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nx84t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc405</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5d86p118r"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of small-scale turbulence and upwelling on the ecology of larval fishes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>MacKenzie, Brian R. (Brian Royce)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Environmental control of interactions between larval fish and their prey, and the potential influence of this relationship on fish feeding and recruitment, were assessed using empirical models developed using data drawn from the literature and developed in field studies. Ingestion rates of larval fish in laboratory and natural environments were found to differ in relation to food density. In laboratory studies, larvae show a strong functional response to prey density. Larvae situated in situ consume food at much higher races than would be predicted from laboratory studies and these rates are independent of prey density at known in situ densities. This discrepancy between laboratory and field feeding rate-food density relationships can be partly explained by the in situ contribution of small-scale turbulence to predator-prey encounter rates. Field studies of the influence of wind on nearshore hydrography showed that wind-induced upwelling generated favorable combinations of nutrients, light, and small-scale turbulence for production by phyto- and zooplankton. The distribution of microplankton $(&lt;$80 $ mu$m) that resulted from these upwelling episodes was quantitatively described by the cumulative longshore wind velocity during the summer months. Microplankton abundance was greatest within 4 km of a major spawning site for capelin, Mallotus villosus, an economically and ecologically important forage species in the north Atlantic Ocean. Interannual variability in the intensity and frequency of upwelling-favorable winds was positively and significantly correlated with recruitment levels in the NAFO 2J3K capelin population. A new recruitment forecasting model, using an upwelling-related wind index as an input, explained more of the variance in capelin recruitment than did a previously published model. These results suggest that larval capelin are more likely to be food-limited in years when wind conditions are unfavorable for upwelling, and that recruitment in this fi</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx35w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p118r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Capelin -- Larvae</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fisheries -- Climatic factors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fishes -- Larvae</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag732d981p"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Kraft black liquor recovery usiung steam plasma technology</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Stuart, Paul R.

An Atomized Suspension Technique Reactor was designed in which a fine spray of concentrated black liquor was fed co-currently with a jet of high-temperature steam, generated using plasma technology. The pilot scale reactor processed up to 23 kg/h black liquor solids on a dry basis during the experimental programme. The most successful experiment simulated the case where the product gas from the plasma reactor would be recycled and used as the plasma gas. A high quality green liquor was produced: over 99% of the black liquor carbon was gasified, over 99% of the total sulphur was reduced to Na$ sb2$S, and near-complete sulphur recovery was achieved. It is postulated that white liquor similar to that obtained in the conventional kraft recovery process would form in a plasma reactor following certain reactor modification including the elimination of alumina-containing refractory walls and the recycle of reactor effluent gases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gauvin, W.

Based on the proposed model, the combined effect of residual plastic stretch, asperity mismatch, and corrosion debris on the closure behavior of a fatigue crack can be simulated by a hypothetical rigid insert located in an ideal crack wake. Accordingly, the crack closing period can be modeled by a gradual contact between the ideal crack faces and the rigid insert. The formulation of the model results in a set of equations which can predict the closure load as well as the load-CMOD characteristics using the residual CMOD at zero load as a unique experimental input. Based on the initial model, the final form of the derived equations are either logarithmic or quadratic. While the latter can be solved directly for the closure load, the former requires a numerical solution. The model qualitatively predicts the effect of gradual crack wake removal on the crack closure load level and the load-CMOD behavior. It also accounts for the response of a cracked component to an anomalous crack wake formed by single or block overloads. The model is verified, both qualitatively and quantitatively, using specifically designed experimental techniques, a variety of specimen sizes, and two different alloys.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515p155.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579t05j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amw22v623r"><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Structure-morphology-property relations in random styrene ionomers</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hird, Bryn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is generally accepted that in random styrene ionomers the ion-pairs tend to associate to form small aggregates termed multiplets which are embedded in the polymer and act as crosslinks. At sufficiently high ion-contents, ion-rich regions termed clusters are believed to phase-separate from the polymer matrix. In this study, the dynamic mechanical properties of random styrene ionomers containing various concentrations of alkali-metal methacrylate groups were measured over a range of temperatures at several different frequencies. Two peaks are evident in the loss tangent (tan $ delta)$ vs. temperature curves, indicating that the materials are phase-separated, with each tan $ delta$ peak resulting from the glass transition (T$ sb{ rm g})$ of a separate phase. This hypothesis is supported by the magnitudes of the apparent activation energies determined in this study for each transition. The relative heights and areas of the tan $ delta$ peaks indicate that the cluster phase becomes dominant at ion contents above ca. 6 mol %, and that complete phase inversion occurs at relatively low ion-contents. This finding, together with the results of small-angle X-ray studies performed elsewhere, led to the development of a new model for the morphology of random styrene ionomers. The model is based on aggregation of ion-pairs to form multiplets. Each ion-pair in a multiplet effectively anchors the polymer chain to which it is attached, thereby forming a layer of polymer with restricted mobility surrounding the multiplet. Isolated multiplets act as large crosslinks, thus increasing the glass transition temperature of the material. As the ion content is increased, the regions of restricted mobility surrounding each multiplet overlap to form larger contiguous regions of restricted mobility. When these regions become sufficiently large, they exhibit phase-separated behaviour and are termed clusters. The model is in good agreement with a very wide range of experimentally observed p</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w66344502.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v623r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab8515p16f"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The ecological knowledge of Belcher Island inuit : a traditional basis for contemporary wildlife co-management</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nakashima, D.

It provides a detailed assessment of Inuit use and knowledge of a single species, the Hudson Bay Eider (Somateria mollissima sedentaria). Data collected on Inuit classifications of animals reveal the highly-ordered systems whereby Inuit structure their extensive knowledge of the biological diversity of their environment. A lexicon of Inuktitut terms illustrates the refinement of their anatomical knowledge, while detailed data on one anatomical element, the eider skin, serve to indicate the considerable volume of information lying behind these labeled categories. Furthermore, Inuit knowledge of eider ecology provides exacting biogeographical information and identifies important ecological patterns and processes for the species. These findings run counter to preconceptions about traditional knowledge which linger in the wildlife professionals' milieu. Neither anecdotal, narrowly pragmatic, unverified nor non-ecological, traditional knowledge provides a sound argument for greater Native autonomy in wildlife management.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qd00s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515p16f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wildlife management -- Nunavut</dc:subject><dc:subject>Eider -- Nunavut</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inuit -- Nunavut -- Belcher Islands</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az316q232d"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Bacterial adhesion to model meat surfaces</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Piette, J.-P.

In general, adhesion was not influenced by the physiological age of the cells and was not correlated with the cell surface characteristics (electrical charge, hydrophobicity) of the organisms. Also, adhesion data did not corroborate the predictions based on changes in the free energy of adhesion, calculated from contact angles and surface tension measurements. A more detailed study of the adhesion of Pseudomonas fluorescens to tendon was subsequently undertaken. Neither physiological activity nor the presence of flagella was found to be essential for adhesion. Selective chemical alterations of the cell surface pointed to no direct implication of carboxyl or amino groups in an adhesive bond with tendon. These groups may participate in adhesion, however, through electrostatic interactions as suggested from the variations of adhesion with ionic strength.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m498v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q232d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pseudomonas fluorescens</dc:subject><dc:subject>Meat -- Microbiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bacteria -- Adhesion</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903078k"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Urinary metabolites of anabolic steroids : identification and synthesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Bi, Honggang</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The metabolism of several anabolic 17$ alpha$-methyl steroids, namely formebolone, mestanolone, methandienone, methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone and stanozolol, were investigated. The identification of metabolites was based on GC/MS analysis of different derivatives, and chemical synthesis of corresponding reference steroids. Common metabolic reactions have been studied and structure-metabolism relationships were discussed. New biotransformation routes, such as oxidative pathways of 2-formyl and 2-hydroxymethylene steroids, have been unveiled. The mechanism of 17-epimerization of these 17$ beta$-hydroxy-17$ alpha$-methyl steroids in vivo has also been clarified. A simple and convenient method for the preparation of 17$ beta$-tertiary sulfate derivatives of these steroids has been developed. A stereoselective approach was used for the partial synthesis of reference steroids in order to confirm the stereochemical features of an acidic metabolite of oxymetholone.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d729j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903078k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qd012"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Control coordination of SVCs for voltage regulation in power systems</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hellal, Abdelhafid</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the principal functions of static var compensators (SVCs) in a transmission system is the voltage control at the point of connection. As power and transmission systems have grown considerably in the last decades, many systems have been interconnected for economic reasons. The use of SVCs became more important as the systems were required to operate at higher power levels, which led to a reduction in the stability margin. Increasing the number of SVCs in a network is one of the solutions, but it leads to undesirable interactions among them, which affect the stability limits. Control coordination of these SVCs is considered a good alternative to allow power systems to operate at higher power levels with the required stability margin, as well as to increase the damping of critical modes of oscillation. This study presents the possibility of improving the effectiveness of SVCs in a system through the concept of SVC control coordination for voltage regulation, in linearized power systems. A concept of coordination of several SVC units, operating on the same system bus of a network, based on averaging the SVC current outputs according to their dynamic reactive capabilities as defined by their slope reactances, has been elaborated. Then, a control coordination concept relevant to many SVC units connected to different buses of the system has been presented and described. The methodologies used to describe these concepts have been explained, and simulation results were presented.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bj031.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qd012</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Energy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831ck79m"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of observer's experience and skill level on learning and performance in motor skill modeling</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Downey, Margaret J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Expertise effects on response acquisition (learning) and performance reproduction (performance) (Bandura, 1986) in dance observational learning were investigated. Over an acquisition period, forty university students with varied movement backgrounds observed dance demonstrations, arranged still photos to represent the dances, and performed each dance. Learning was assessed via a pictorial-resequencing task. Dance performance accuracy and quality were evaluated via detailed analyses of videotaped performances. Results indicated that dance experts learn more and perform better than novices (p $&lt;$.05) in a modeling situation, and learning and performance scores are positively correlated at a moderate level. Entry-level dance skill is the best present indicator of success in dance observational learning. Elementary instruction can improve beginner dancers' observational learning ability. The findings support Bandura's social cognitive theory of modeling (1986), extend the knowledge base related to the effects of expertise in motor skill acquisition, and have implications for dance and other motor skill educators.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25x9416.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831ck79m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Motor learning</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motor ability</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117p72z"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Synchrony with host leaf emergence as a component of population dynamics in lepidopteran folivores</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Hunter, Alison F. (Alison Fiona)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The connection between variable synchrony of insect eclosion with host budburst and variability in insect densities was investigated. Experiments with gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) larvae determined the duration of acceptable foliage after budbreak of nine hardwood species. Four competing conceptual models of environmental influences on the timing of budburst were compared and evaluated. The best budburst model was combined with an eclosion model to estimate the frequency of asynchrony and its correlation with density. Synchrony with budburst has a smaller effect than weather after hatch, on the population size of the gypsy moth, but neither is the driving force behind density changes. However, comparison of traits of 300 species of Macrolepidoptera showed that 50% of outbreak species, but only 24% of nonoutbreak species begin feeding at the time of budburst; this suggests a stronger relation between synchrony and population dynamics than was found with the gypsy moth.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w5633.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117p72z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gypsy moth -- Host plants</dc:subject><dc:subject>Insect-plant relationships</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gypsy moth -- Food</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hardwoods -- Diseases and pests</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6d56zx365"><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Vitrification of simulated medium and high level Canadian nuclear waste in a continuous transferred arc plasma melter</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chen, GangQiang</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A 40 kW transferred arc plasma melter was designed and built for the vitrification of nuclear waste. Borosilicate glass, high silica glass and sphene glass-ceramic were successfully melted with the waste using an argon plasma in both batch and continuous transferred arc plasma melters. The use of both direct heating and indirect heating were examined in the continuous plasma melter. The loss of total glass weight and the elemental losses of Na, Cs, U and Nd were examined as a function of operating conditions. The losses of Cs during melting were from 25 to 73 wt% and depended on operating conditions. The loss of Cs during melting could be minimized by decreasing the plasma power, increasing the feed rate, using indirect heating rather than direct heating and choosing suitable waste form. A heat transfer model and a mass transfer model were developed to analyze cesium losses during melting.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Munz, R.
