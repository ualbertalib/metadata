(Maria Dimitra)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Last year (1992) marked the 50th anniversary of wartime housing in Montreal. Built as temporary shelter for workers engaged in the war industry, these homes were to be demounted after the war. Public demand for inexpensive housing however, forced authorities to allow workers and veterans to purchase a unit. No bigger than a 1000 ft$ sp2$ (100 m$ sp2$), the wartime home can be investigated as a prototype for today's small affordable housing. Downsized homes, tailored to suit modern lifestyles and provide opportunity for ownership, have been criticized by theorists like Ruth Madigan, Moira Munro and Constance Perin for their inflexible designs in fulfilling people's social and spatial demands. This thesis explores how people manage to meet these needs by employing wartime housing as a research model. Interviews were conducted with owners of 22 wartime homes that were not enlarged, drawn from the Ville St-Laurent, Montreal-East, and Snowdon districts. The case studies revealed that spaces like the kitchen, the bedrooms, and storage areas play a major role in accommodating users' changing needs. Moreover, solutions rendered in space management by residents can serve as guidelines for architects in designing small living spaces. Relative to small-lot housing, adaptability in the wartime house was facilitated by its sizable lot and coal shed in the rear.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Friedman, Avi</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh55s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q234z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture, Domestic -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Designs and plans</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture, Domestic -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avt150k07r"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Multi-scale object representation and localization using range data</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Alami, Wassim T. (Wassim Tarek)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines an approach to the representation of 3-D objects based on multi-scale surface patches. These patches are computed using multiple alternative decompositions of the surface based on the signs of the mean and Gaussian curvatures. The approach is applicable both to polyhedral objects as well as smoothly curved objects. A hierarchical ranking of these patches is then used to describe individual objects based on geometric information. These geometric descriptors are ranked according to several criteria expressing their estimated stability and utility. Pose estimation is cast as an optimal matching problem. The geometric pose transformation between two views of a simple curved object is found by matching multi-scale descriptions corresponding to the two views. Different combinations of possible three patch correspondences are found and ranked between the two views and the position transformation (rotation and translation) is computed. The starting patches are constrained to be those with the most stable description. The cost of matching the two sets of representative patches based on the position transformation is computed. The final pose estimate is obtained from the correspondence that produces the best global consistency. The algorithm's applicability to pose estimation is demonstrated by examples using real range data and its behaviour in the presence of noise is validated. Its use in object recognition is then discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dudek, Gregory</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613mz32q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150k07r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9w0323862"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Factors influencing the diffusion of innovative products in North American home building firms</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sternthal, Benjamin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This report examines the diffusion of innovation to North American home building firms. Innovation is defined as new technologies in the form of new products and techniques. The organizational structure of the home building firm and the unique mindset of builders/developers running these firms are examined in order to understand the firm and its leader. Technology diffusion theories are then explored to comprehend how innovation reaches the marketplace. Through research, evaluation criteria are established which builders/developers use when adopting innovation. These criteria are tested by interviewing twelve selected builders/developers in the Montreal-Ottawa region and by recording their responses to thirty innovative products. The study demonstrates that all factors comprising the evaluation criteria are important to different builders/developers at different times. Furthermore, builders/developers cannot be treated as a homogeneous group since their backgrounds are not similar. Accordingly, no model depicting a builder's/developer's decision-making process can guarantee the successful diffusion of an innovation. The author therefore suggests certain guidelines to help innovators diffuse innovation to home building firms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Friedman, Avi</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d7334.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w0323862</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj139271b"><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Receiver structures and performance analysis for fading multipath channels</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Abboud, Nagi N.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this research, we introduce a model for a fading multipath channel. The channel impulse response consists of an infinite series of $ delta$-functions whose amplitude has a Ricean probability density function and whose phases are randomly distributed. The arrival times of the various pulses follow a non-homogeneous Poisson process. This model is well structured and quite flexible for characterization of mobile and indoor radio environment. A Bayesian decision approach is employed for the derivation of the optimal receiver for this channel model with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Simplified forms of the receiver are presented under assumption of high and low SNR. The performance of the system is investigated for the high SNR case when the intensity of the Poisson process is constant. In this case, the performance of this system is compared to what has been found for differential phase shift keying (DPSK) when using diversity reception. A performance analysis is also done for a more realistic situation when the rate of the Poisson process is a decaying oscillatory function. This non-homogeneous Poisson process generates the observed phenomenon of ray clustering.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leib, Harry</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472x248.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139271b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75dd187"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Conflict of labour laws in international air transport : an analysis of the American practice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Huang, Chu Cheng, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the problems of conflict of labour laws in international air transport, in the context of U.S. judicial practice in relation to the constitutional law-based labour statutes, employment accident statutes and labour management relation laws. The first chapter provides an overview of the methodology adopted in conflict of labour laws under the U.S. jurisprudence, mainly focusing on the balancing-of-interests technique crystallised through precedents. The compatibility problem involved in dealing with conflicts within international airline industry is also briefly discussed. A detailed review of different categories of labour statutes in later chapters reveals specific conflict of laws problems that could not be solved through any single rule, especially when in international air transport setting. The divergence between domestic labour statutes and Treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation or Air Transport Agreements also create subtle circumstance. All these point to the conflict of labour laws in international air transport as a relatively unexplored sphere, and the desirability of international unification of certain principles. The implications for the rather unique case of Taiwan are explored in chapter 5.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, M.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d0584.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dd187</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p547s"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The prevention and suppression of drug abuse and illicit traffic in international civil aviation</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Albán, Pedro</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Drug control has important connotations in the field of civil aviation. In the first place, substance consumption by aviation personnel may have disastrous effects given the level of alertness required in the performance of their duties. Furthermore, a significant portion of the illicit traffic in drugs is performed by air. Hence, the International Civil Aviation Organization has been called upon to participate actively in the international campaign against traffic in drugs. This paper explores ICAO's response to the international call for action. The first chapter presents ICAO within the context of the international system of drug control and provides background information on the drug control activity performed by the international community during the present century. The second chapter reviews in detail ICAO's role and activity, which have touched three main subject areas: air transport aspects, technical aspects and legal aspects of the prevention and suppression of drug abuse and illicit traffic in international civil aviation. The conclusions contain the author's personal assessment of the issues reviewed and make reference to the future challenges of the international community in the subject.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Janda, Richard</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tg22f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p547s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj236288r"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Aircraft accident investigation : the need for a stronger international regime</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Durand, Claudie Jennifer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this paper is to examine the international regime governing aircraft accident investigation while focusing on its various shortcomings and weaknesses. Weakened by the international legal nature of the Chicago Convention and by limitations voluntarily inflicted by its authors, Article 26 of the Convention and Annex 13 are unable to offer aircraft accident investigation a sufficient basis for a reliable and unified legal regime. Consequently, the questions pertaining to accident investigation are regulated by the various domestic laws, which leads to unavoidable conflicts of interests and tends to ruin the effort of co-operation. Although envisaged under a bilateral or regional form, a global approach to safety of civil aviation should be favoured to solve these conflicts and strengthen the current legal regime. Such international co-operation seems to stand better chances of achievement within the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r9674522.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236288r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s1617038"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>International regulation of Caribbean textile and apparel trade</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chaves Olarte, Georgina Ines</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the last five years, textiles and apparel have represented the largest source of growth of U.S. imports from countries covered by the Caribbean Basin Initiative.

This analysis takes into account not only the legal mechanisms developed to control trade in this sector, but also the underlining powers that have allowed the shaping of the current textile and apparel order.

The registration task consists of finding the translation and rotation parameters which properly align overlapping views of the surface so as to reconstruct from these partial surfaces, the complete surface representation of the object. The approach taken is to express the registration task as an optimization problem. We define a function which measures the quality of the alignment between the partial surfaces contained in two range images. The function computes a sum of Euclidean distances between a set of control points on one of the surfaces to corresponding points on the other surface. The strength of the approach resides in the method used to determine point correspondences across range images. Dual-view registration experiments conducted with the algorithm displayed extremely good results obtained in a very reasonable time. A multi-view registration experiment was also completed with success, except for the fact that a large processing time was required. A complete surface model of a typical 3D object was then constructed from the integration of its multiple partial views.

Morphological techniques have been intensively applied in all stages of the segmentation part of this algorithm, from edge detection to feature extraction. An important issue, edge enhancement, is discussed particularly in detail. The performance of the morphological edge detection technique on portal images is compared with that of local gradient operators and optimal edge detectors, while the advantage of the morphological edge detection and segmentation techniques is justified. The treatment field mask is proposed as the landmark for portal-simulator image correlation achieved by matching inertia moments of landmarks. The effect of two different landmarks, the treatment field mask and the treatment field contour, is examined with this correlation method, and the superiority of using the treatment field mask is shown.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fallone, B.

Changes in the matrilineal dominance hierarchy were investigated over a 12-year period (1979-1991). Matrilineal ranks remained unchanged for the first 7 years (stable period), reversed on several occasions over the next 3.5 years (unstable period), and have re-stabilised for a further 3.5 years to present date. The frequency distribution of non-matrilineal supports in different social contexts, the lower support frequency in unstable than stable periods, and in particular the high reciprocity evident in non-matrilineal support exchanges, suggest that non-matrilineal support is better explained by reciprocal altruism than by mutualism in vervet monkeys.

A view represents a well defined issue of concern related to the software process (SP) which has some intrinsic value, such as providing software engineering support. In turn, views offer insight into the process. Software process models (SPM) are important for communicating, analyzing, understanding and improving the software process. SP are difficult to model because they are complex. Using views in VDPM reduces the complexity of process modelling by separating issues of concern. Background on the SP and SPM is provided to bring the VDPM approach into context, followed by an explanation of the architecture and implementation of a system called Elicit that applies this approach. The Elicit system is evaluated and compared to other systems. The preliminary results indicate that VDPM is feasible and should be examined further.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Madhavji, Nazim H.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b695s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kt63j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gp08q"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>A box model study of the Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea, and Arctic Ocean</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Robitaille, Daniel Y.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A simple box model of a a high-latitude two-layer ocean, first developed by Martinson et al., 1981, is applied to four Arctic regions connected together: the Greenland Sea, the Norwegian Sea, the Arctic Ocean, and the Greenland Gyre. The latter, in fact, is a small convective region embedded in the northwest corner of the Norwegian Sea region. The model for each region consists of a thermodynamic ice layer that covers two layers of salty water which can, under specific conditions, become statically unstable and hence create a state of active overturning. The system is forced by monthly mean atmospheric temperatures in the four regions, as well as by continental runoffs and by inflows from adjacent oceans. The model predicts the ice thickness, and the temperature and salinity of the water in the upper layer for the four regions. Also determined are the water temperature and salinity for the lower layer in the Arctic Ocean box. The convective state of any given region, i.e., whether it is in an active overturning mode or not, is also obtained continuously. The different output variables of the model, which are the response to climatological forcing conditions, compare favourably with observed data. In this control run, the Arctic Ocean region is characterized by continuous ice cover only during winter, and the Norwegian Sea region never forms an ice cover. Another feature of the model is the winter time occurrence of convective overturning in the upper 200 m in the Greenland Gyre region.

The analysis assumes a homogeneous and stationary random field being advected past a fixed coordinate system with a constant velocity. Within the moving reference frame, the random field is assumed to possess quadrant symmetry. The concept of space-time isotropy is defined relative to a velocity. This is called the intrinsic velocity and represents a kinematic characteristic of the storm system apart from the advection velocity. A radial space-time correlation function is defined over a range of scales where the intrinsic velocity remains constant. The effect of the intrinsic velocity on Taylor's hypothesis is examined and an alternative is proposed. The effect of spatial resolution is evaluated theoretically on a model space-time correlation. The results from the theoretical calculation are compared with those obtained from two rain events. The radial space-time correlation functions of the rain events vary as expected with spatial resolution, but the intrinsic and advection velocities are inconclusive. The uncertainty for the intrinsic and advection velocities does not allow for a clear relationship with spatial resolution. Nor does it allow a clear determination of the effect of spatial resolution on the validity of Taylor's hypothesis. The intrinsic velocity may be approximated as constant over a certain range of time scales (15 to 70 min). Of the cases considered, the effect of the internal storm development on Taylor's hypothesis is slight. Therefore, a 'frozen turbulence' model for Taylor's hypothesis is still a good approximation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Belloh, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193984s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634455f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agm80hw17p"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effect of gamete of origin and gene dose in X-linked hypophosphatemic mice</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Qiu, Zheng-qing</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The expectation for a gene dose effect in an X-linked phenotype is that the corresponding metrical trait in heterozygous females will lie between values for affected hemizygous males and unaffected males and females. I made sequential measurements (at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days) of serum phosphate concentration and tail length in mice with X-linked hypophosphatemia (mutant genotypes: Hyp/+, Hyp/Y and Hyp/Hyp) and in their normal littermates (genotypes: +/+ +/Y). I also measured renal mitochondrial 24-OHase activity in mice fed control and low phosphate diets and representing all five genotypes. I further studied serum AP activity and vertebral bone histomorphometry in the five genotypes. The mutant animals all had uniformly and significantly different values than unaffected littermates. There was no evidence of a gene dose effect because values were not significantly different among the three mutant genotypes. I also studied the influence of gamete of origin on serum phosphate, tail length, renal mitochondrial 24-OHase activity, serum AP activity and vertebral bone histomorphometry in the Hyp/+ offspring of affected males (Hyp/Y) or affected females (Hyp/+ or Hyp/Hyp). I found no effect on the distribution of trait values. I conclude that parental origin of the mutant allele does not explain the absence of a gene dose effect in Hyp mice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scriven, C.

This technique allowed for determination of areal extent, contaminant levels and time period of initial contaminant contact. Only Zn, Sn, and Cu were found in elevated quantities in the xylem wood and Pb in the leaf litter. Elemental concentrations of Pb, Sn and Cd in xylem wood and leaves of ash were positively correlated. Tin was the only element to demonstrate a clear initial contact period and elemental accumulation with age. Significant levels of Cu accumulated in the heartwood while Zn revealed significant but inconsistent accumulated patterns. Expected attenuation zones associated with municipal solid waste landfill leachate dispersion were not found; thus the pathway for contaminant dispersion was likely through groundwater flow. An elemental index was developed to facilitate the use of dendro-chemical analysis in periods of suppressed tree growth resulting from environmental pollution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cote, B.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wg75n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d480</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Soil pollution -- Measurement</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Trace element content</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Heavy metal content</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dendrochronology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trees -- Effect of pollution on</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7h149q66x"><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The Strange Lake peralkaline complex, Québec-Labrador : the hypersolvus-subsolvus granite transitiion and feldspar mineralogy</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Nassif, Gary J. (Gary John)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The four main units of the epizonal Strange Lake peralkaline complex (Quebec-Labrador) document a transition from early hypersolvus granite, to transsolvus granite, to geochemically more evolved subsolvus granite and, finally, to highly K-enriched pegmatites. The felsic and mafic minerals constrain the temperatures of crystallization of the different units. The hypersolvus granite has a solidus above 650$ sp circ$C, and the pegmatite has a solidus below ${ sim}590 sp circ$C at 0.7 kbar. The textural transition and reduced solidi of the units are explained by an increase in (Na+K)/Al and fluorine in the evolved granitic melt, which allows crystallization to lower temperatures, and thus the nucleation of two separate primary feldspars. The composition and structural state of the feldspars of the pluton indicate temperatures of equilibration of ${ sim300} sp circ$ to 100$ sp circ$C. The increasing K/Na value of the bulk feldspar is explained by: (1) the shift of the haplogranite minimum toward the Qtz-Or sideline due to the addition of excess alkalis, and (2) the loss of Na by degassing. The high degree of order in the K-feldspar is attributed to the presence of an alkaline fluid phase. The geochemical evolution of the alkali feldspars is consistent with the fractionation of a single batch of evolved granitic magma. Degassing of the magma led to an important increase in $ int( rm O sb2),$ and to the escape of the peralkaline fluid into the wallrocks. Mineralization in the complex is attributed to the late re-distribution of ore constituents via a contaminated peralkaline fluid, which gained Ca, Sr and Mg by interaction with the country rock.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Martin, Robert F.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h035j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149q66x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
