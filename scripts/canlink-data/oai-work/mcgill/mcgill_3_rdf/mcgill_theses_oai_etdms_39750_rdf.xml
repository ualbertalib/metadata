The disease, caused by Venturia inaequalis, is controlled by numerous fungicide applications, regardless of the presence of inoculum in the orchard. Better timing of fungicide applications could be achieved if the airborne ascospore concentration (AAC) was considered in decision making. AAC can be measured in real time using spore traps. In this project, the relationship between AAC and lesions development was studied under controlled and natural conditions for five cultivars: Empire, McIntosh, Jonagold, Royal Gala, and Spartan. Potted trees were exposed to different airborne ascospore inoculum and the corresponding AAC were measured using spore traps. The spatial distribution of ascospores was studied in a commercial apple orchard plot. The potential ascospore dose (PAD) and the AAC were measured in 40 quadrats in the spring of 1999.

(1) To measure the responsiveness of SLAM-R and SLEDAI to meaningful changes in SLE activity; (2) to determine how strongly activity in specific organ systems affects SLAM-R and SLEDAI responsiveness. Methods. A secondary analysis was performed on blinded data of SLE patients. Sensitivity of SLAM-R and SLEDAI to change were assessed with traditional measures. Also, perceived change in disease activity was modelled as a function of change in overall instrument scores, and of change in organ system subscores. Results. Both SLAM-R and SLEDAI were responsive to changes perceived by physicians. However, only SLAM-R was sensitive to changes reported by patients. The relevance of type of organ involvement depended on whether the assessor was the patient or the physician. Conclusion. The differences between the type of change relevant to physicians and patients may account for SLAM-R's better ability to reflect patients' judgments.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Abrahamowicz, Michal</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g4594.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vw003</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88cj44t"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Identification of target DNA binding sites for a yeast zinc cluster transcriptional regulator</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Chow, Christine, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Zinc cluster proteins represent a subclass of zinc finger proteins and function as transcriptional regulators.

Sequencing of isolated clones showed correlation with published target sequences and binding was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Screening over 100 000 clones of the library with the YLR228c gene product allowed the isolation of 10 clones.

This thesis describes an IMM-JVC algorithm, its implementation, and demonstrates its performance on some simulated scenarios. The Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) estimator is integrated with the Jonker-Volgenant-Castanon (JVC) contact-to-track association optimization procedure in the IMM-JVC formulation described. The tracking accuracy provided by the IMM has been recognized as superior to that obtained from other single-scan positional estimators. The IMM provides a probabilistically weighted combination of the results of multiple Kalman filters. The JVC method also uses probability weighting in a global nearest neighbor approach to contact-to-track association. Some emphasis is put on tackling the problem of asynchronous sensors, which may be encountered in the case of multiple sensors. A number of different approaches, along with the IMM-JVC, are simulated to illustrate their characteristic properties and provide a basis for comparison.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Michalska, Hannah</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085n19m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708z676</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5d86p2197"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Criteria and tests for cold headability</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sarruf, Yasmine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is quite difficult to quantitatively define the ability of a material to be cold forged. The limit of the forming process is governed by a complicated interplay of such factors as material microstructure, rate of deformation, tool and workpiece geometry and the friction at the interface of the workpiece and tool. The success of a cold forming process is primarily determined by the formability of the stock material. Consistent product quality and increase in productivity requires parts to be plastically deformed without failure. Expensive downtime, tooling damage and material waste are often the consequences of material failure during loading. A means of assessing formability is, therefore, clearly required. A revised upset test is examined, seeking to represent the actual cold heading process and to minimize the effect of test specific factors, such as changing friction at the die-workpiece interface. It is designed to be easily used by industry, requiring minimal sample preparation and the use of a simple and reliable testing device. Preliminary tests are performed and the limitations of this test are investigated. Possibilities for future improvements are considered.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jonas, J.

W. Gams is a destructive mycoparasite of the soilborne plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. It colonizes effectively all types of cells of R. solani, and is considered as an effective biological control agent (BCA). Monitoring the presence of this mycoparasite in the field trials requires the development of a reliable and sensitive diagnostic assay that is able to detect and differentiate the BCA from their target host. To achieve this, designed SCAR (sequenced characterized amplified regions) primers designated as SE-13F and SE-13R were generated from informative RAPD markers. They were tested in conventional PCR assays alone or in conjunction with the recently developed SCAR primers (SBU-177/336) designed for Rhizoctonia solani (Kuhn) on several types of DNA. These included DNA extracted from pure cultures, co-cultures of the BCA and the pathogen, plant tissue and several types of soils inoculated with both the BCA and the pathogen. Irrespective of the type of the biological samples from which the DNA was extracted, the primers SE-13F/SE-13R successfully amplified only S. elegans. No cross-reaction was observed when the primers were used to amplify DNA of other fungi, bacteria and plant tissues. Likewise, the primer pair SBU-177/336 detected only its target organism, i.e., R. solani. The detection limit using these primers on amplified DNA was as little as 1 pg DNA extracted from pure cultures of S. elegans, 100 pg DNA extracted from greenhouse soil and 33 pg DNA extracted from natural soil. This work is the first report on the development of SCAR markers for the BCA, S. elegans. These molecular markers offer not only an alternative diagnostic assay to conventional detection methods, but also the possibility of being used in ecological studies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>J.-Hare, Suha</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p2200.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935482w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Genetic markers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stachybotrys elegans</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rhizoctonia solani -- Biological control</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rw34f"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Evaluation of common polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT)</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Weisberg, Ilan S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyses the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a carbon donor for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. A common mutation in MTHFR, 677C → T, which converts an alanine (A) to a valine (V) residue, is associated with increased plasma homocysteine and, consequently, is a risk factor for several vasculopathies. Recently, a second common mutation in MTHFR was reported (1298A → C) which converts a glutamate (E) to an alanine (A) residue in the C-terminal regulatory region. Thus study was designed to assess the in vitro and in vivo impact of this polymorphism. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human MTHFR cDNA was performed to create all four combinations of the two common MTHFR polymorphisms. Enzyme activity was assessed in a bacterial expression system. Since the 1298A → C polymorphism is due to a mutation in the regulatory domain, a parallel study was performed involving the complete deletion of this region. For in vivo assessment of the 1298A → C variant, we examined this mutation in three clinical populations. Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) is a second remethylation enzyme that converts betaine and homocysteine to dimethylglycine and methionine, respectively. This work represents the first report of sequence variants in the newly-cloned BHMT gene. Using SSCP analysis, three common base changes were identified in a panel of healthy controls.

IETF SIP is a standard for Internet telephony, but SIP service architecture has some shortcomings, for instance, it does not support service mobility. This thesis proposes a novel mobile agent based service architecture for Internet Telephony. The architecture relies on the use of two mobile agents for each subscriber: one agent contains originating services and the other contains terminating services. These two mobile agents act as capsules and carry the services to which the user has subscribed. The architecture brings the advantage associated with mobile agents. This includes network traffic reduction and flexibility in service provisioning. We start the thesis by introducing value-added services. The MA based architecture for IP telephony is then introduced. Conceptual model, implementation model, and service scenarios are all described in this architecture. Special attention is paid to service mobility. SIP is used as concrete example throughout the thesis and "Grasshopper" as basis for the implementation architecture.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glitho, Roch</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Dini, Petre</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Friedman, Nathan</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m862s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903182c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zq38k"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Apoptosis following ischemia-reperfusion injury in a rabbit lung ex-vivo model</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shaw, Matthew J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. Apoptosis is postulated as a mechanism involved in lung ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, however, the relative contributions of ischemia and reperfusion are unclear. Methods. Heart-lung blocks were harvested from New Zealand white rabbits (3.0--4.0 kg) and exposed to 0, 6, or 18 hours of cold ischemia (4°C), followed by 3 hours of reperfusion in an ex vivo model. Terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), the technique used most often for detection of apoptosis, was performed on the tissue sections. Results. TUNEL demonstrated minimal apoptosis in lungs exposed to 0, 6, or 18 hours of ischemia with insignificant differences (p = 0.6 for 0 h vs. 18 h). After one hour of reperfusion, the level of TUNEL in the 18 hour ischemic tissue was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05 for 0 h vs. 18 h). During the period of reperfusion, the extent of apoptosis increased in direct proportion to the duration of ischemia; the level of TUNEL staining after 2 hours of reperfusion was significantly greater in the 18 hour ischemic tissue compared to the 6 hour ischemic tissue (p &lt; 0.05), as was the 6 hour compared to the 0 hour (p &lt; 0.01). The hallmark of apoptosis, nucleosomal ladders of 180--200 base pair DNA fragments, corresponded in intensity on gel electrophoresis to the quantitation of TUNEL. The characteristics of apoptotic cells including cell membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and fragmentation were confirmed by electron microscopy. Conclusions. These results provide evidence that apoptosis may be a specific feature of IR injury in pulmonary tissue.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shennib, Hani</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz8061735.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq38k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fn638"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Event correlations in active networks by using active filters</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Shangguan, Yihong, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>With the development of modern computer and network technologies, computer systems and applications become more and more complex and dynamic. One of the problems of complex and dynamic systems is the difficulty of management of changes. Network management comprises of network monitoring and control, its aims include the detection and handling of faults, performance inefficiencies and security compromises. Centralized network management seriously limits the scalability of network management. The shortcomings of the centralized approach show up during the periods of heavy congestion when management intervention is particularly important. Therefore, in order to cope with problems (such as passive, static, rigid, etc.) arising from centralization, the network management functionality must be decentralized and should become more active and flexible. In this thesis, we use mobile agent and active network technologies to implement a network management tool, active filter, which could be very useful in various network management activities, such as, real-time resource management; load-sensitive flow rerouting; application-specific filtering in wireline/wireless network; and real-time multicast.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Newborn, Monty</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Dini, Petre</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10ws15z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fn638</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah128ng54c"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Functional interactions between the p75 neurotrophin receptor and TrkA</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Simoneau, Steve</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The p75NTR neurotrophin receptor has previously been shown to increase the responsiveness of TrkA to NGF, the preferred ligand of TrkA. We performed structure/function studies to determine the domains of p75 NTR involved in this functional interaction. Co-expression of p75NTR in 293T cells enhances NGF-mediated TrkA autophosphorylation while the intracellular domain of p75NTR is not required for this function. Indirect evidence has previously suggested that p75 NTR may also play a role in reducing non-preferred ligand activation of TrkA. We tested this directly and found that p75NTR reduces both basal and NT-3/NT-4-mediated TrkA autophosphorylation. In addition, we show that the intracellular domain of p75NTR can by itself reduce basal TrkA activity, suggesting the involvement of intracellular signaling. These data imply that the p75NTR receptor can functionally interact with the TrkA receptor through two distinct domains. We hypothesize that these interactions function in combination to help the TrkA receptor discriminate between preferred and non-preferred ligands, therefore increasing the specificity of activation of the TrkA receptor.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barker, Philip A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xk41r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128ng54c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55z969g"><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Functional analysis of Mpt5p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Sherk, Jennifer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Mpt5 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, aging, cell wall maintenance and regulation of gene transcription by glucose.

Finally, Green Fluorescent Protein-tagged Mpt5p has allowed for investigation of Mpt5p cellular localization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Whiteway, Malcolm</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451k48k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z969g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9k41zg38p"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>The influence of season on preovulatory events associated with estrus synchronization in dwarf goats raised in Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pierson, Janice</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In temperate zones most breeds of goats are anestrous and anovulatory during spring and summer, but start cycling as day length decreases during the fall. In tropical zones, indigenous goats, such as the Pygmy and the Nigerian Dwarf, tend to cycle throughout the year. Some studies have indicated that dwarf breeds become more seasonal when they are raised in temperate zones, while others maintain that they are capable of breeding throughout the year. In this study, Pygmy and Nigerian Dwarf goats became more seasonal in Quebec. The majority of the animals were cycling during December and February, but a significant proportion exhibited anestrus during October, May, and June. Several hormones, including prostaglandins (PG), progestagens, and gonadotropins (eCG, FSH, GnRH, hCG), have been used for the control and synchronization of estrus and ovulation in goats, but limited research has been conducted with dwarf breeds. In this study, dwarf goats were synchronized in November, March, and July with a 10-day MAP sponge coupled with 125 mug cloprostenol i.m. 48 h before sponge removal and 300 IU eCG i.m. at sponge removal. A seasonal shift was detected in the intervals to the onset of estrus, the LH surge, and ovulation following sponge removal. These intervals were shorter in November and July than in March (P &lt; 0.05). The intervals between the onset of estrus and the LH surge and between the LH surge and ovulation were found constant throughout the different seasons. The administration of 50 mug GnRH at 24 h after sponge removal improved the timing and synchrony of the LH surge and ovulation in dwarf goats (P &lt; 0.05). The knowledge acquired from this research may serve to improve reproductive efficiency in dwarf goats by facilitating the determination of an optimal time for breeding, artificial insemination, and oocyte and embryo recovery.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Downey, Bruce</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sc12v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zg38p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pygmy goat -- Québec (Province) -- Reproduction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nigerian dwarf goat -- Québec (Province) -- Reproduction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8p58pf835"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Angiogenesis and growth factor expression in a model of transmyocardial revascularization</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pelletier, Marc P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Introduction. The mechanism by which transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) exerts a beneficial effect remains unknown. This thesis hypothesizes that myocardial punctures for TMR cause a myocardial injury, leading to an angiogenic response mediated by a number of growth factors. Methods. Fifty-three rats underwent ligation of the left coronary artery. Group I (n = 25) served as controls, while Group II (n = 28) underwent concomitant TMR by creating six transmural channels with a 25-gauge needle in the ischemic zone. Surviving animals in both groups were sacrificed at intervals of 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks (n = 5 in each subgroup). Immunohistochemistry in the infarct areas was performed for factor VIII to assess vascular density. Immunohisto-chemistry using specific antibodies was also performed for transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta), basic-fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), and vasoendothelial growth factor (VEGF). Growth factor expression was quantitated by comparing areas of staining (in mm2) using computerized morphometric analysis. Results. Mortality was similar in both groups (5/25 vs. 8/28, p = NS). Group II had significantly greater vascular density than Group I (5.65 vs. 4.06 vessels/HPF, p &lt; 0.001), with a peak at 1 week post-operatively (9.12 vs. 5.56 vessels/HPF, p &lt; 0.0001) in both groups. Overall, both TGFbeta and bFGF were significantly higher in the TMR group compared to the control group (0.207 mm2/mm2 vs. 0.141 mm2/mm 2, p &lt; 0.05 and 0.125 mm2/mm2 vs. 0.099 mm2/mm2, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions. This model of TMR is associated with a significant angiogenic response, which appears to be mediated by the release of certain angiogenic growth factors such as TGFbeta and bFGF. With the long term patency of laser-created myocardial channels in clinical TMR increasingly in doubt, its mechanism of myocardial revascularization may be similar to that observed in our model.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chiu, Ray C.-J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214r036.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pf835</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vw01c"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of forest fires and clear-cutting on mercury loading to boreal lakes</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pinheiro, Fabiola M. R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the soil, mercury species are predominantly associated with particulate organic carbon (POC) and can be exported with surface runoff by erosion or in solution, associated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Water column samples collected in September 1997 and May 1998 from three treatment groups of lakes (9 whose watershed was clear-cut, 9 whose watershed was burnt, and 20 control lakes, whose watershed forests have not been touched by forest fires or clear-cutting for at least 70 years) were analyzed. Results of these analyses reveal a significant increase in the DOC and dissolved methylmercury concentrations in lake water after watershed clear-cutting. Following forest fires, there is an enrichment of methylmercury in the suspended particulate matter (SPM), as well as significant losses of nitrogen species. Thus, watershed perturbations increase the export of mercury species from the catchment to drainage lakes, and this effect is greater in logged- than in burnt-watershed lakes. This mercury export is dependent on the delivery of POC and DOC to the lakes, which increases as a result of surface runoff intensification.

We find that the NAO-positive (NAO-negative) phase induces: (i) anomalously high (low) winter mean sea-level pressure (SLP) in the Azores High region and anomalously low (high) SLP in the Icelandic Low region; (ii) anomalously high (low) winter mean temperatures over northern Eurasia and anomalously low (high) temperatures over northwestern Africa, Greenland, and segments of northeastern North America (i.e., primarily northern Quebec, Labrador, and Baffin Island); and (iii) anomalously high (low) winter mean preapitation centred over the Norwegian Sea/Barents Sea region and anomalously low (high) precipitation over southern Europe, western Greenland, and the above-mentioned region in northeastern North America.

The animals were 'hooked-up' to an external power supply, emitting a symmetrical sinusoidal wave form with an amplitude of 2.0 volt p-p and a frequency of 60 kHz. The current values tested were 20muA, 30muA and 60muA. In surgery I, a head cap was affixed to the animal's skull with stainless-steel screws and an acrylic resin. The head cap was connected to the external power supply by an electrical stimulation wire, encased in a stainless-steel spring. Two electrical leads were subcutaneously tunneled from the head cap to the future tibial implant site, and sutured to the soft tissues. After a one week acclimatization period, a second surgical procedure, surgery II, involved the placement of titanium implants proximal to the tibial tuberosity in each tibiae. Electrodes were then sutured one on either side of the implant, thus 'cuffing' the implant, and the current was then applied to one implant site with the other acting as a control. After seven days of continuous capacitive electrical stimulation, a biomechanical pull-out test was carried out to measure the force in Newtons (N) of implant extraction.

The complex fluid under consideration is a ternary mixture of two immiscible fluids (oil and water) plus a concentration of surfactants. The model used is based on a Ginzburg-Landau functional due to Laradji et al. which is written in terms of an order parameter representing the difference between the local densities of oil and water and a scalar field representing the local concentration of surfactants. A mean field phase diagram for the homogeneous phases was first obtained in terms of the surfactant chemical potential, mu using exact mean field equations. A tricritical point followed by a triple line between an oil/water coexistence region and a disordered phase was established from these equations. Following Laradji et al., the Langevin equations were derived in the presence of a new term in the free energy functional which stabilizes the system at long wavelengths. Once the phase diagram was established, we examined the equilibrium wetting of a water/oil interface by the complex fluid and we calculated the related contact angle, theta, along the triple line as a function of increasing mu.

It has been proposed that the high rate of early embryo loss (20--30%) in DBA/2-mated CBA/J female mice may be the consequence of a maternal non-speck immune rejection response to the allogeneic conceptus. Early embryo resorption in mice has been associated with the activation of natural killer like cells, macrophages, and production of TH1 inflammatory cytokines. To investigate and detect the earliest events in the activation of decidual NK cells and macrophages in initiating early embryo loss, gene expression analysis of two NK cell molecular markers, IFNgamma and perforin mRNA, and two macrophage specific cytokines, TNFalpha and NOS mRNA, was performed. Since IFNgamma is also produced by CD4+ T cells, cell labeling with an anti-NK antibody (DX5), cell sorting, and RT-PCR gene expression analysis were performed to confirm the source of IFNgamma mRNA in the decidua and spleen of DBA/2-mated CBA/J female. The role of the innate response during implantation, normal pregnancy, and early pregnancy loss will be discussed.

The seedlings of 8 North American spruce species were grown in a growth chamber, with half of them being given an episodic 'increased temperature and drought' stress treatment. Trait values among species, particularly growth analysis components, were compared and related to climatic variables associated with the geographical range of the species. Relative growth rate (RGR) and specific leaf area (SLA) were positively correlated with latitude, and the leaf weight ratio (LWR) variation negatively with the dryness of species' natural ranges. All these relationships hold with both messed and unstressed seedlings, even thou seedling response to the stress was significant. The SLA-latitude and LWR-dryness relationships are likely to have ecological significance, and this indicates that foliage stricture (SLA) and allocation (LWR) play important roles determining a species range along temperature and dryness gradients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lechowicz, Martin J.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322g21d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440v51v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Spruce -- Effect of global warming on -- North America</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spruce -- Ecophysiology -- North America</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn3013251"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Intracellular signals underlying the inductive effects of agrin during neuromuscular junction formation : study on the roles of ras and Shc</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Lemaire, Mathieu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Agrin triggers the subsynaptic aggregation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) via activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK (muscle-specific kinase). At present, the intracellular mechanisms utilized by MuSK to initiate such a complex process remain unknown. In the present study, I first tested if H-ras was involved in the process of synaptogenesis induced by agrin. The data presented suggest that ras could have a role in this process because a dominant inhibitory ras mutant (ras-N17) partially blocked the inductive effects of agrin while two activated ras mutants (ras-V12 and ras-V12-D38) induced agrin-independent AChR clusters. These effects were not due to major alterations in the levels of AChR, though more experiments are required to confirm these preliminary findings. Second, I investigated whether the adaptor protein Shc was a downstream effector of activated MuSK. MuSK and Shc could be co-immunoprecipitated, but this association was not consistently observed nor was it modulated by agrin at all times. Generally, no alteration in Shc phosphotyrosine content was observed in response to agrin, and when an increase was detected, it was modest. Finally, agrin did not modulate the interaction between Shc and Grb2. Based on these results, I conclude that Shc interaction with MuSK is not regulated by agrin.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Carbonetto, Salvatore</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408007k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3013251</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Myoneural junction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protein-tyrosine kinase</dc:subject><dc:subject>Acetylcholine -- Receptors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nerve tissue proteins</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mk79p"><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Giardia CWP2 : determining its immunogenic[i]ty and its potential as a candidate for vaccine against giardiasis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Larocque, Renée, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this study, we determined the immunogenicity of CWP2 and its potential as a vaccine candidate against giardiasis.

When BALB/c mice were immunized with CWP2, a specific IgA was detected in the feces. When mice were immunized with CWP2 + cholera toxin, as an adjuvant, IgA in the feces, and IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a in the serum, all specific to CWP2, were detected. Also, CD-1 mice were infected with G. muris and presence of specific IgA antibodies to CWP2 were detected in the feces. This result indicated that CWP2 was recognized by the immune system in a natural infection. IL-4 and IL-5 were released from Peyer's patches (PP) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) cells when stimulated with concanavalin A. In spleen cells, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-5 were released when stimulated with concanavalin A.
