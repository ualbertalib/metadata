Glutaraldehyde fixed tissues of the rat were stained with periodic acid-chromic acid-silver methenamine and examined in the electron microscope. Some saccules of the Golgi apparatus were stained in all cells examined. This part of the Golgi apparatus was referred to as the mature face in contrast to the forming face, where the saccules were unstained. In secretory cells, precursors of the secretory material were observed within the Golgi region. In these and in non-secretory cells, small vesicles and dense bodies (lysosomes) which may be of Golgi origin were also stained.

The specific activities of estrogen metabolites (estrone, estriol, 16-epiestriol, 16α-hydroxyestrone and 16-ketoestradiol- 17β) were measured following β-glucuronidase hydrolysis. The specific activity of urinary estriol was one-sixth and one-tenth that of estrone in two normal pregnancies and the specific activity of estrone was slightly greater or almost equal to those of 16-epiestriol, 16α-hydroxyestrone and 16-ketoestradiol-17β. The latter three were equal to each other, in normal pregnancy. In two diabetic pregnancies, the specific activity of estriol was 30% and 50% that of estrone and the specific activity of estrone was not as high as in normal pregnancy. The endogenous levels of seven estrogen metabolites (2-methoxyestrone, estrone, 16α-hydroxyestrone, 16-ketoestradiol-17β, estradiol, 16-epiestriol and estriol) were also investigated, particularly with respect to their modes of conjugation. In both normal and diabetic pregnancy the main form of conjugation with respect to total urinary estrogen was as glucuronide. However, very substantial amounts of 16-ketoestradiol-17β, 16α-hydroxyestrone and, on occasion, estrone were liberated by solvolysis, suggesting sulfate conjugation.

It has found its greatest usefulness in studies of antibody synthesis in which the concentrations of antibody usually have been very low. In the present study, the phage neutralization method was exploited for the detection of rabbit antibodies directed against 2,4-dinitrophenyl residues (DNP). The sodium salt of dinitrobenzene sulfonate was reacted with bacteriophage T2. Over 90% of the phage particles were inactivated in the coupling procedure. However, the surviving hapten bacteriophage conjugates (HBCs) were found to be sensitive to inactivation by anti-hapten antiserum. Thus, anti-hapten antiserum diluted by a factor of 10^5 to 10^6 caused measurable inactivation of the HBCs. This antibody assay procedure was shown to be more sensitive by a factor of 10^3 than the EDB passive haemagglutination technique. The specificity of the reaction was demonstrated by the inhibition with haptens of related structure (e.g. Ɛ-DNP-L-lysine, DNP-OH and 3,4-dinitrobenzoic acid) of the neutralization of HBCs by anti-hapten antibody. The sensitivity of this method was further increased three times by the addition of sheep anti-rabbit globulins to HBCs which had been previously incubated with rabbit anti-hapten antibody. Amounts of antibody as low as 2 x 10-3 µg were detected by this technique. In a series of experiments on in vitro antibody formation, tissue culture fluids obtained from culturing BGG-DNP immunized rabbit spleen fragments could be diluted by a factor of 10^3, and still gave 36% phage inhibition by this method.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sehon, A.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fs01v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65vb795</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akp78gk648"><ual:graduationDate>1967</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Physiological studies and delimitation of the human thalamus during stereotaxic surgery</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wong, Andrew W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Many rhythmic unit discharges in the ventrobasal complex rostral to the somatic tactile zone in patients with Parkinsonian tremor were found to be deep somatic neurons subserving pressure and joint afferents from the trembling contralateral segment.

Necrobiosis of the entire epithelial surface of the small bowel appears to be the common denominator between these two preparations. Two major conditions were identified, therefore both of which must prevail before organic lesions will result. The all important one was an ischaemic injury to the small bowel such as was produced by a period of severe hypotension or temporary occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. The second condition was related to the nature of the intestinal content. The intestinal chyme should consist of the derivatives of normal food. If both these conditions were met we demonstrated that re-establishment of the circulation after retransfusion or removal of the occlusion, did not prevent the gradual deterioration towards intestinal necrobiosis.

Similarly, a high correlation exists between the side of sciatica, myelographic defect and the oblique posterior intervertebral joint in patients with known symptoms of back pain and sciatica. Using dissected cadaver disc-vertebra units from a random group of patients at autopsy, a lower though still significant positive correlation is obtained between the side of posterior intervertebral joint obliquity and side of annular tear in the disc. Using a calibrated strain gauge apparatus, torsional stress can rupture an intervertebral disc without causing bony fracture and moreover, compression appears to protect the disc in the presence of intact posterior intervertebral joints.

When a trace amount of (7α-3H)-pregnenolone sulfate and (4-14C)-pregnenolone was given intravenously to a subject in the third trimester of pregnancy, three metabolites, namely, pregnanolone, pregnanediol and 5α-pregnane-3α,16α,20α-triol were isolated from the glucosiduronidate fraction of urine, and 5α-pregnane-3β,20α-diol was isolated from the sulfate fraction of urine. Both pregnenolone and pregnenolone sulfate were shown to be important precursors of urinary pregnanolone and pregnanediol. The results obtained also demonstrated a lack of peripheral 16α-hydroxylation of the administered progesterone, and the conversion of pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate and progesterone to neutral 16α-hydroxypregnanes in pregnancy urine.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Solomon, S.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mq68q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505363s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sg76q"><ual:graduationDate>1967</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>An antiviral substance from &lt;&lt;Penicillium cyaneo-fulvum&gt;&gt;: physical and chemical studies</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Russ, Laurence J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous studies showed that &lt;&lt;Penicillium cyaneo-fulvum&gt;&gt; elaborates an antiviral substance in stationary cultures.

Antiviral culture filtrates were purified by precipitation of. impurities with acetone, followed by dialysis and concentration. The product was subjected to gel filtration, which resulted in a significant increase in activity, on a weight basis, when compared with non gel-filtered samples. Lyophilization resulted in a partial loss of activity of the antiviral preparation, but no change in the ultraviolet spectrum of the material. Studies on gel-filtered preparations indicated that, in contrast to previous speculation, no amino acids in any form were associated with the active substance. A small amount of ribonucleic acid was found, as well as phosphate not associated with ribonucleic acid. A significant amount of carbohydrate of a heterogeneous nature was present in antiviral preparations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooke, P.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qn027.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sg76q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Microbiology and Immunology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4q77fv850"><ual:graduationDate>1967</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of intramuscular injection of carnitylcholine on enzyme movements in rat tissues</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Pang, David C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although muscular dystrophy was first described over 100 years ago, little progress has been made towards the understanding of the basic defects responsible for this affliction. Recent clinical, biochemical, histochemical, and histological studies have added knowledge and increased our understanding of this disease, but its fundamental nature is still unknown. Recent discovery of acetylcarnitylcholine in rat tissues has led us into investigating a hydrolytic product of it, namely, carnitylcholine. Injection of carnitylcholine into rat muscle caused enzyme movements from muscle to serum. This drug increased the activity of the pentose phosphate shunt in muscle and also caused an excess excretion of creatine and inorganic phosphate in the urine of experimental rats. These biochemical properties of carnitylcholine, its pharmacological actions, and its possible natural-occurrence, have led us to postulate that carnitylcholine, or some closely related substance, might be a causative factor in the etiology of Progressive Muscular Dystrophy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hosein, E.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jp86j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fv850</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r6296"><ual:graduationDate>1967</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>α-methyltryptophan and hepatic glycogenesis</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Oravec, Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Studies of the effect of α-methyltryptophan on carbohydrate metabolism have shown that this amine acid analogue stimulates hepatic glycogenesis in the rat, in contrast to tryptophan which inhibits this process. Other differences in the actions of the two amino acids have been found: whereas tryptophan interferes with the conversion of the exogenous pyruvate into glycogen, α-methyltryptophan does not. Tryptophan promotes an increase in the assayable level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in liver, but α-methyltryptophan causes a decrease. α-Methyltryptophan acts only in the presence of glucocorticoids. Furthermore, α-methyltryptophan accelerates in vivo the oxidation of tryptophan, an essential amino acid, thus probably creating an amine acid imbalance. Decreased utilization of amino acids for protein synthesis, together with the availability of endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids could account for the glycogenetic property of α-methyltryptophan. Some metabolites of tryptophan were also examined. Only 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid mimicked the effect of tryptophan with respect to inhibition of glycogenesis and enhancement of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sourkes, T.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892f11h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r6296</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr172133f"><ual:graduationDate>1946</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Zoology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Regeneration in hydroids</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Davidson, Margaret E.

To attain such a goal, the nature of the behaviour in question must be adequately and reliably known. Therefore, the initial step is one of observation and description, and, when the results of these activities are substantial, one may attempt to predict the behaviour of the individual. As applied to the educational field, Psychology has made extensive efforts to estimate, in advance, the lively scholastic success of the college student. In particular, the present study seeks to predict the success of a sample of McGill students in the field of engineering training. A survey of the heavy academic mortality rate in engineering colleges of many different universities will make it apparent that the purpose set for this study is decidedly a practical one. For example, at McGill University, of the class entering the first year of Engineering in 1935, only about 43% received degrees in 1939, taking account of both the Spring and Fall Convocation.

Efficient plant operation then depends upon recovery of the unchanged styrene and butadiene[...] In both the recovered butadiene and styrene, polymerization may occur to produce a polymer, which is practically insoluble in any of the usual rubber solvents. This polymer usually occurs as a deposit in the condensers, in the styrene recovery unit, while the counterpart in the butadiene recovery occurs mainly in the rerun tower. Since the insoluble polymer formed from styrene containing small amounts of butadiene is usually white and has a cauliflower-like appearance, it is known as “popcorn” polymer. Insoluble butadiene polymer is usually glassy and brittle and varies in color from white to green or brown. Both types of popcorn show such proliferative activity that at intervals, production may have to be stopped to clean the condensers mechanically. In the recovery units of the Polymer Corporation plant at Sarnia, Canada, it has been necessary on occasion, to cut the styrene condensers apart to remove the popcorn. The economic waste of such an operation is apparent. It was with a view to elucidating the mechanism of formation and growth of popcorn, with the ultimate aim of completely preventing the reaction, that the present investigation was made.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m2602.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483n41z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av692t954s"><ual:graduationDate>1946</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Some characteristics of slots in ultra-high frequency wave guides</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Dodds, John William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The idea of extracting U.H.F. energy from a wave guide by means of slots, is shown to be of importance in the design of two-dimensional arrays.

Graphs are drawn for the variation of the admittance of a shunt slot with the slot length, width and position on the guide. Considerable work was done on the frequency characteristics of slots, and the results are given in graphical form. An interesting and important use of slots, that of the coupling of guides, is discussed. Since this type of coupling is useful in the feeding of two dimensional arrays, its frequency characteristics were investigated.
