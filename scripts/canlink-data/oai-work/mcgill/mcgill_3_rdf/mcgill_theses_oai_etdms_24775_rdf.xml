And I relate how each one defends the internal logic of her claims  against the critique of moral relativism. I examine Iris Murdoch's conception of  reality and consciousness in the distinctive way that she fuses them to a  transcendent morality. In chapter two, I turn to Murdoch's description of the journey  from illusion to reality and the role of love or eros in this journey. I examine the  many points of intersection between her description of the escape from selfishness  and Wendy Farley's (1996) theory of how we acknowledge the other through a type of  attention that she calls eros for the other . In Chapter three, I discuss the problem that evil poses for  Murdoch's moral philosophy, and how Murdoch and Farley interpret the experience of  the void as yearning for relation. In the conclusion of this thesis, I present  Murdoch's views on form as the consolation of human yearning.

One question which arises from this analysis, and is considered in this  thesis, is of the relation between sexual perversion and history, and in particular  between experiences of violence, (dis)pleasure and desire, and historically specific  forms of discourse and power, such as legislation on rape; myths and practices  concerning marriage alliance; the depiction of such myths and practices in art;  religion; and family structures. A second question which this thesis explores is the  manners in which sadistic and masochistic artistic production function politically,  to bolster pre-existing gender ideologies or to subvert them. Finally, this thesis  considers the relation between sadism and masochism and visuality, both by bringing  literary models of perversion to an interpretation of paintings, and by exploring  the amenability of different genres of visual art to sadism and masochism  respectively.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wilson, Bronwen</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bh83r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q701m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sex in art</dc:subject><dc:subject>Titian, ca. 1488-1576 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sadism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rape in art</dc:subject><dc:subject>Painting, Renaissance -- Italy -- Themes, motives</dc:subject><dc:subject>Botticelli, Sandro, 1444 or 5-1510.

The discussion is based on a detailed study of informal and  incidental learning that takes place in Baltistan. Research presented in this thesis  seeks to show that with women acting as men's equals rather than as mere  auxiliaries, greater victories in the fight against poverty and deprivation may be  won. Rather than being unwilling to participate in the development process, women  are prevented from playing a full role in the political lives of their communities.  The women of Baltistan do have an embryonic understanding of power, powerlessness,  and how the two interact to prevent action upon injustices. In order to understand  and realize the value of such learning in struggle I have made an attempt to expose  such learning through various case studies.

The object of this thesis is to discover  how the author adapts the genre to make a certain socio-cultural contextualization  that will be elaborated upon in the analysis here of the intimate discourse  exchanged by the two protagonists of the novel. At all times the important role will  be stressed of the "real" reader of this fictional amorous correspondence  which gives every impression of authenticity. The first chapter gives some historical background, highlighting  the growing critical interest of contemporary authors in the epistolary genre. Also  a bio-bibliography of Silvia Molina is given in order to emphasize the direction of  her literary work as well as her professional development as a multifaceted  author. This is followed in the second chapter by an examination of  epistolary writing as a specific narrative technique in El amor que me juraste in  order to facilitate the refocusing, executed by the female protagonist, of how a  woman might combat patriarchal ideology in contemporary Mexican  society. Finally, the third chapter centers upon the legal and  conventional functioning of epistolary writing in the genre. Thereby the  protagonist's search carried out here to find her cultural roots is shown to  complement her elaboration of her personal identity as a modern woman in the  recasting of masculine and feminine roles, and certain moral repercussions thereof,  portrayed both in the text as in society. A full bibliography is also  given.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sibbald, K.

The methodology used for the purpose of the  analysis gives a certain originality to this dissertation. It is quite unusual among  the literary scholars to associate rhetoric to a text that is typically romantic by  its form and content, rhetoric being traditionally used for discourse analysis only,  not for a novel. What our research has shown us is that nobody has ever approached,  with a rhetorical eye, that novel which, moreover, has almost never been studied nor  commented. The main idea for this paper was that the literary genre of the  confession, because of its religious and judicial origins, necessarily implies a  desire of persuasion. To obtain total redemption of his crimes or sins, one must  convince the other that he regrets what he has done, that he acted against his own  will, that he suffers from what he did, that he acted without knowing his actions or  words would hurt someone; one can even say that he is the victim of false  accusations, etc. Rhetoric is then called to play an important part in this  justification and persuasion enterprise. That is why we came with this hypothesis  that there was in Musset's novel a persuasion mechanism working to gain the support  of the reader toward the narrator's thesis. This dissertation tries to emphasize the  persuasion mechanism by doing a rhetorical analysis of the text.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duquette, Jean-Pierre</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zr33v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rv062</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Musset, Alfred de, 1810-1857. -- Confession d'un enfant du siècle</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axw42n862b"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Les (in)tolérances de l'abbé Grégoire</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Kheir, Mayyada</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Henri Gregoire poses a problem to all scholars who see the  French Revolution as an anti-religious event. Most of his fellow 'red priests',  those not-so-few who in 1789 asked for some kind of democracy and more rights for  the 'damned of the earth', gradually abandoned either their faith or their  patriotism. Gregoire, until his death in 1831, always proclaimed the compatibility  of Christianity and republic. Not only is his position representative of that of  many Catholics at the beginning of the Revolution, it also asks anew the important  question of the link between religion and revolution, and gives it an unusual  answer. As many philosophes did, Gregoire was speaking in terms of reason, of the  Enlightenments, and of natural rights---but nevertheless believed Catholicism was  the only good religion. If a good Christian is the best citizen possible, how can  one fight for the recognition of the 'natural rights' of the Jews and the freedom of  worship for all without being inconsistant?</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kirby, W.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the evaluative  reactions of an American-born audience toward accented English speech. Fifty-three  American college students listened to an audio recording of eight accented English  speakers, four representing regional U.S. accent groups and four representing ethnic  or foreign accent groups. The students' evaluative reactions indicated favoritism  toward the American English speakers with a consistent downgrading of the ethnic  speakers. Analysis of the personality ratings suggests that participants based their  judgments to some extent on their perceptions of the accented speakers in terms of  three dimensions: appeal, accommodation and aspiration. The conceptual affinity of  these three dimensions and the subsequent revelation of three-dimensional model of  "absolute accommodation" are discussed.

The extensive literature that has been produced and continues to be  published testifies to this fact. From the outset of the war in Spain, numerous  European countries actively participated in the Spanish conflict. However, Soviet  military "aid" to the Republican government "has provoked more  questions, mystification and bitter controversy than any other subject in the  history of the Spanish Civil War."1 Although the Spanish Civil War took place  almost 70 years ago, and the intervention or non-intervention of many countries in  Spain is well documented, Soviet involvement remains an "enigma". Little  is known of Stalin's motives in Spain and even less information has emerged on the  Spanish gold reserves that were sent to the USSR. This dissertation attempts to come  to terms with both of these questions and, with the help of new documentation,  challenge previously-held assumptions regarding Soviet foreign policy in  Spain. 1Gerald Howson.

While it has become commonplace to assert that Wilde's plays and essays  subvert the status quo, few scholars have studied Wilde's work on the decorative  arts to substantiate his status as a writer arguing for social and political change.  Through an analysis of Wilde's North American lecture tour and his editorship of The  Woman's World, as well as his approach to painting, clothing, and home decor in his  more well-known work, I argue that Wilde conceives of the decorative arts as a means  of expressing and inciting dissatisfaction with the social and political realities  of Victorian England. As I show, Wilde subtly presents avant-garde art, sartorial  details, and home decor items as functional ornaments. The formal elements of a  painting foster receptivity and, by extension, sensitivity and compassion.  Unconventional attire functions as a visual symbol of discontent with social and  physical conformity. In light of Wilde's published support of women's emancipation,  his writings on home decor imply that the well-decorated house, rather than the  Victorian wife, should be responsible for creating domestic harmony. Wilde's penchant for the decorative arts has long remained the  domain of anecdote; the following study instead positions Wilde's interest in the  decorative arts as a defining, and insightful, aspect of his oeuvre  .</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hickman, Miranda</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xx90c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc227</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dwellings in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Painting in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wilde, Oscar, 1854-1900 -- Settings</dc:subject><dc:subject>Clothing and dress in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qq181"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Living in an unidyllic Idyll : the worlds of Anne and Heidi : a comparison between Johanna Spyri's Heidi and L.M.

The theoretical notions used are mainly provided by literary and  philosophical works from Bakhtine and Ricoeur; they also come from the rich literary  tradition of humour and supernatural (le "merveilleux"). An intimate  reading of the funniness (la "drolerie") in the stories allows one to  characterize each novel in particular, but it also provides essential grounds to  some reflections on Marcel Ayme's art of the novel. Among aspects treated, great  emphasis is put on supernatural beings (devil, fabulous animal), the splitting of  narrative voice, on connivance and transgression, on exacerbation of materiality and  resolution of antagonisms, on ambivalence of meaning and on humor as a refusal of  seriousness.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ricard, Francois</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074v80c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m476t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Humor in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aymé, Marcel, 1902-1967 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182k77b"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Priority mechanism for QoS control in CDMA system through dynamic power control</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Yao, Bo, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Future wireless systems will have to support multimedia services  such as voice, data and video. Issues in providing multimedia services on wireless  systems include multiple access, bandwidth rationing, scheduling and power control.  In this thesis, we address the last issue. CDMA is assumed to be the access method.  Each of these services has different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, maximum  power and packet time-out constraints; in order to achieve the required QoS, they  can alter their transmission. In this work, we present a novel Power Control With  Priority Scheduling (PCWPS) algorithm for a wireless CDMA system, which achieves  reliability and efficiently control packet loss due to timeout violation for  simultaneously transmitted multimedia traffic, as well as minimizing system total  interference. Our power control algorithm requires information about each traffic  class instant state, as well as the wireless channel condition at the beginning  power update iteration. Based on this information, the optimum allocated power can  be calculated through linear or nonlinear programming methods. The simulation  results show that our algorithm achieves good performance in term of packet loss due  to timeout.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kaplan, Michael A.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bh859.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182k77b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw66344324"><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Cerebral blood flow measurement using fMRI and pet : a validation study</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Wieckowska, Marguerite</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique allowing the study of hemodynamic changes in the brain. Having a number of advantages over positron emission tomography (PET), the current gold standard, fMRI appears like an attractive alternative to study brain function. However, the measurements obtained with fMRI have not been rigorously validated. This thesis describes a study comparing cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes measured using a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) fMRI perfusion method, to the ones obtained using PET. We scanned 10 healthy normal volunteers under identical experimental conditions during presentation of 4 levels of visual stimulation and one level of hypercapnia. The CBF changes were compared in 4 regions-of-interest. Good correspondence was found in the locations of the CBF changes. FAIR CBF changes had a higher signal-to-noise ratio and presented a monotonic increase with stimulation intensity, absent in PET measurements. FAIR measurements were correlated to PET but slightly lower. Statistical analysis of the data did not show that FAIR measurements were significantly different from PET ones.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pike, G.

In such network,  all mobile elements are highly dynamic ad hoc devices. Plenty of applications  require wireless data broadcast to enhance the services due to its natural  advantage. This thesis focuses on developing data broadcast service models in a  multi-hop ad hoc network environment. In particular, it presents and analyzes three  proxy behavior models for the data dissemination in the network. QoS performance  measures are derived mathematically according to the behavior models, and applied to  the optimization of broadcast schedules at each proxy. Numerical results have shown  that the proposed "Intelligent" service proxy behavior model out-performs  all other proxy models. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the  sensitivity of the network performance with respect to the model assumptions. In  addition, an intensive performance analysis and evaluation is conducted as well as  its interpretations by information theory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Charalambous, C.

Photon detector converts photon  energy directly into electrical signal. Thermal detector, on the other hand, has a  temperature-sensitive electrical property and its temperature can be easily altered  by incident IR radiation. To reduce noise, both photon detector and previous  generation bolometer require cooling. A new generation of uncooled bolometer emerged  recently and will be the focus of this study. Micromachining processes were used to fabricate bolometers and  bolometric material test vehicles. Both surface micromachining and bulk  micromachining were attempted. The surface micromachined bolometers were created by  the MUMPs process. The material of the bolometer structures was polysilicon. From  the measurements carried out, it was shown that the present polysilicon bolometers  have a TCR of 0.123%/K and a thermal conductivity of 2 * 10-6 W/K. For the bulk micromachined bolometers, Bismuth bolometers were  deposited on silicon dioxide membranes on top of a silicon wafer. The silicon  dioxide membranes were made by overetching the bulk. A TCR of -0.21%/K, thermal  conductance of 4.58 * 10-5 W/K and a responsivity of 0.4 V/W were  measured. A 4 by 4 readout circuit was fabricated by TSMC 0.35 mum CMOS  process. It consists of pixel biasing, pixel selection, and output amplifying stage.  Two do voltage offset correction methods were proposed and examined. The proposed do  voltage offset correction methods could minimize the offset voltage to 113  muV.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shih, Ishang</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x19b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655h24x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak06988110"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Molecular weight distribution of long chain branched polyethylene</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Liu, Nannan, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To fully understand the properties of Long Chain Branched  Metallocene Polyethylene (LCB mPE), we need to understand its molecular structure  and Molecular Weight Distribution (MWD). Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) is the  most important and widely applied technique to measure the MWD. In this analytical  technique, polymer molecules are fractionated by their hydrodynamic volume (i.e. the  sizes of polymer molecules in dilute solution). This work is focused on the  simulation of GPC for the MWD of LCB mPE. The polymerization reaction mechanism of LCB mPE provides a  method to simulate the generation of LCB mPE molecules thus allowing the development  of a statistical model of the structure and molecular weight distribution of LCB mPE  by previous researchers. This statistical model gives a theoretical MWD. In this  work after simulating the generation of one million LCB mPE molecules, we calculate  the sizes (i.e. radii of gyration) of molecules at both theta and good solvent  conditions to obtain the molecular size distributions. Then we simulate the  fractionation in GPC and the different GPC detector responses to obtain simulated  GPC MWDs. The simulated MWDs are compared to real GPC results provided by the Dow  Chemical Company. We analyze the performance of GPC for long chain branched  polyethylene and relate the results to the theoretical MWD.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wood-Adams, P.

As a high-level technique for boundary identification, active contours are used extensively for segmentation purposes. Two different active contour approaches, i.e., parametric active contours and discrete dynamic contours, were used and compared for the segmentation of middle-ear images. We used histological and Magnetic Resonance Microscopy (MRM) image datasets for our experiments. Parametric and discrete dynamic contours show similar boundary identification results for the histological and MRM datasets. Gradient, Gradient Vector Flow (GVF), and the gradient plus pressure were used as the external force. The gradient has the disadvantage of having a restricted capture range. Two solutions for improving the capture range, gradient vector flow and pressure force, were compared. Although GVF provides a good capture range, it sometimes wrongly identifies the low-contrast boundaries. It was also found that GVF may wrongly identify the boundaries of close neighbouring structures. As an alternative, pressure forces have shown promising results for histological and MRM middle-ear images. For the same initial contours, a larger number of iterations is required for the parametric contours to converge to the boundary than with the discrete dynamic contours, when the gradient is used as the external force. However, when using GVF and gradient plus pressure, parametric active contours require a smaller number of iterations for active contour convergence, compared with the discrete dynamic approach. The use of open contours was demonstrated for shared boundaries and thin structures, in addition to the usual closed contours.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Funnell, W.

The first and most  critical phase in thermoforming is sheet heating. For a thick-gage plastic sheet,  the combination of conduction and radiation energy, which conducts and transmits  into the sheet interior, controls the heating cycle time. In order to predict the  formability of a thick-gage sheet and improve production efficiency, we need to know  the internal temperature of the plastic sheet during the heating phase in  thermoforming. Unfortunately, the internal temperature of the sheet is impossible to  measure directly. To overcome this problem, it is possible to use a soft-sensor  technique, which uses the surface temperature of a plastic sheet that can be  measured by infrared sensors to estimate the internal temperature of the  sheet. A soft sensor system was defined by using a finite difference  equation. Experiments and simulations were performed to determine how well the soft  sensor was able to predict the temperature distribution inside a plastic sheet. The  sensitivities of some key parameters, e.g., material absorptivity, thermal  diffusivity, view factor and oven air temperature, are analyzed and  discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thomson, Vince</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z841k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp55j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plastics Technology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3n203z750"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Effects of sediment transport on intergravel flow and egg survival in silt-rich spawning beds</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zimmermann, André E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous studies have shown fine sediment was removed from  spawning beds when salmon dug nests and subsequent sediment deposition can re-clog  the nests, which reduces intergravel flow and threatens egg survival. In the  intensively logged Cascapedia watershed it is not known if there is enough sediment  deposition to re-clog salmon nests. Furthermore, Cascapedia spawning beds are  relatively silt-rich, whereas, the effect of fine sediment has been studied in  rivers with sand-rich substrate. I evaluated if sediment-epositing events reduced  intergravel flow and if these events inhibited egg survival. During the summer and fall 2001, sediment deposition into clean  gravel occurred at rates proportional to the length and dose of suspended sediment  transporting events. Based on the results of an experimental sensor, sediment  deposition reduced intergravel water velocities. Habitat conditions within  artificial salmon nests, however, remained above critical levels for egg survival.  Eggs survived (81%) until mid-April, at which time they were at the pre-hatched  life-stage. The data suggests that in Cascapedia rivers, egg survival is likely only  inhibited if the spring-freshet erodes or clogs the salmon nests.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lapointe, Michel</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117p52g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n203z750</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Atlantic salmon -- Effect of logging on -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atlantic salmon -- Effect of sediments on -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed</dc:subject><dc:subject>Logging -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sediment transport -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43nx57x"><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><dcterms:title>Estimation of survival functions with time-dependent exposures</dcterms:title><ual:dissertant>Zi, Xiaolin, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The graphical presentation of survival functions by the  Kaplan-Meier method is very useful for reporting results from clinical trials or  cohort studies. However, this method is based on the "intent to treat"  approach that assumes that the exposure under study is fixed over time, as are the  covariates that are in addition assumed to be balanced between groups. These  situations are not often the case in observational studies, where the exposure may  varies over time, and covariates may be both time-fixed and time-dependent. In this  thesis, we compare two methods for estimation of the survival function with  time-varying exposure to the time-fixed approach. We apply these techniques to a  cohort study of the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The two methods are an extension of the Kaplan-Meier estimator  and the Nelson-Aalen estimator based on the Cox proportional hazards model. Both  methods are based on the assumption that the effect of exposure is acute.

The overall architecture of the framework consists of the core  EVolve platform that communicates with data sources via a well defined data protocol  and which communicates with visualization methods via a visualization  protocol. Given a data source, an end user can use EVolve as a stand-alone  tool by interactively creating, configuring and modifying one or more  visualizations. A variety of visualizations are provided in the standard EVolve  visualization library. EVolve can also be used to build custom visualizers  by-implementing new data sources and/or new kinds of visualizations.
